_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Baylor  61  
Texas A&M - 58

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Baylor coach Kim Mulkey, student-athletes
Odyssey Sims, Brittney Griner and Melissa Jones.  
Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Melissa, can you talk about overcoming that 12-0 lead and why you all got
down so far and just how you came back?  
MELISSA JONES: Well, I just think we had a really slow start. We just didn't
come out on top like we normally do. And one thing kind of led to another. And
it just seemed like finally we were like, all right, it's time to kick it into
gear, and at that moment we started to turn things around.  
  
Q. How comforting is it, Melissa, to know that you could be 12 down but you
got the players sitting there at your right going to get you back into it, and
talk about that 20-minute period she had, the middle of the first half to the
middle of the second half?  
MELISSA JONES: You gotta give Brittney credit for just an outstanding game she
played today. It was just great to be a part of it and have the experience
with her.  
We've been down before this year on several different occasions and we've been
able to fight back. We knew even though we were down we could still find a way
to win.  
  
Q. Melissa and Brittney, I know there's a politeness involved with not
wanting to be too much talking about how we wanted something more than the
other side did. But looking at rebounding numbers, how much of that truly is
just a matter of effort and going after it a little bit harder?  
MELISSA JONES: Rebounding is just one thing our coaching staff really does a
good job of stressing on us to do. And both not just on the defensive end but
on the offensive end, just that extra effort. And so that's something we work
on every day in practice and something we try and pride ourselves on.  
BRITTNEY GRINER: Just like M.J. said, we practice that a lot in practice and
our coaches stress that to us a lot, boxing out and rebounding and keeping
them off the boards because that one rebound could cost you the game. Our
mindset is to try to get everything that comes off the rim.  
COACH MULKEY: Let me interrupt there if I can. I don't know who votes on it,
and it's why I hate awards. You mentioned rebounding. How can you explain
Destiny Williams is not on the All-Tournament team? She plays three games and
she goes 21 points and eight rebounds, 18 points and seven rebounds, and she
has 11 big rebounds today and you're the champion and you only get the same
number that A&M did, the same number of All-Tournament people? That's the kid
you need to write about. Give her a little pub right there. Okay. I'm done.  
  
Q. Brittney, as M.J. said, you guys have been down in some games, but only a
handful of games where you've been down by that much at double-digit margin.
Can a game like this in the long run be good for you, just because you know
you can come back and dig back?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: Definitely this game is going to help us when we get into the
tournament. There will be times when you get down and you just gotta be able
to fight back. So this game definitely helped us out and is going to give us
some momentum going into the tournament.  
  
Q. Brittney, starting off, it seemed like they were really diving in on you,
double-teaming you. You lost the ball a couple times on turnovers. Did you
realize you scored 20 straight for you guys there between the end of the
middle of the first half through the middle of the second half? Did you
realize you were doing that much?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: Not really. I mean, I knew I was scoring, but I was just
trying to help my team out and they did a great job and just trusting me and
getting me the ball.  
  
Q. I was going to ask about that. I think it was like 23 of 25 or something
like that of your team's points during that stretch. Was it just the situation
where you said, hey, get me the ball, I'm going to get us back on top of these
guys?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: I was just posting up stronger. I lost the ball and turned it
over a couple of times trying to drive. So I just went to posting up and
trying to get the ball deeper and going towards the rim.  
  
Q. I don't mind telling you your Destiny was on my ballot.  
COACH MULKEY: The ones that voted for her don't mind speaking up; I wonder how
many of you here voted for Danielle Robinson who only played two games here.
Speak up. Let me see you. Shame on you. Shame on you. She's not leaving here
with a championship, is she?  
  
Q. Brittney, I also voted for you. Question for you and M.J., who I also
voted for.  
COACH MULKEY: You voted for Robinson and you're the one that asked the
rebounding question, man.  
  
Q. Question for Brittney and then M.J., if you could comment on that. You
had a basket, I don't even know if I can quite describe it, it was in the
first half. You got the ball way underneath and you sort of reached back. Can
you kind of talk about how you've developed your footwork and your post moves,
because you saw an example of all of this today. M.J., if you could talk about
how that's developed for her this year even over last year?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: Well, on that shot, I don't know, I don't know what to say on
that. I just saw the backboard and I knew where to go, so I was just trying to
get it in there and roll it in. So I was just happy on that. But Coach has me
thinking about it more, facing in, and not posting up too early. That way I
really don't have to do too big of a post move, because if I post deep, I'm
right there at the rim.  
MELISSA JONES: I think B.G.'s just done a great job from last year to this
year, just the fact she's been able to be smarter where like she plays herself
in the paint, and I think last year she was more throw the ball up there, I'm
going to get it and throw it up in the hoop. Now she's being more strategic
this year of where she wants to get the ball and deeper and getting the higher
percentage shot.  
  
Q. Melissa, on Wednesday you told us that you had woken up and were able to
see some light out of your bad eye for the first time. Has there been any
progress since?  
MELISSA JONES: It's about the same. I can tell that there's like lights and
it's still dark like when I'm not looking at any light or anything, but I can
see those bright lights out on the court like crazy. So when there's like
bright lights, I can see them. Or if a light is up close to my eye, I can see
it.  
  
Q. Odyssey, you and M.J. both got into some foul trouble. When that happens,
do you have to change your mindset defensively to be more careful when you're
on defense?  
ODYSSEY SIMS: Yeah, because we can't be as aggressive as we want to, so we
have to watch the handshake and driving to the basket knowing they're coming
for us.  
Just gotta try our best to just keep them in front and just not pick up our
third or fourth foul.  
  
Q. Melissa, could you take us through that last block of Sydney Carter and
how you did not bite on the fake?  
MELISSA JONES: Well, I kind of did a little bit, I think. I just knew that
they wanted a big shot, that they were so close that a 3 or just a big shot
would get them momentum and get them right back in it, if not tie the game or
get it real close.  
So I just knew that she wanted to shoot it. So it was just to try and stay as
close as I possibly could on her.  
  
Q. Melissa, can you talk about your last NCAA Tournament, how excited you
are to get started?  
MELISSA JONES: We're just thrilled. I think we couldn't have had a better game
to play A&M like we did today, going into the NCAA Tournament. It just -- it's
a good way to prepare us and to take us going into the tournament.  
  
Q. Brittney, second time in about ten days you guys have been able to cut
the nets down, put the hats on, all that, dance around. Isn't it an addictive
feeling?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: Definitely. It's a feeling that you want to keep having. So
it's definitely something to look forward to and work hard to try to get that
feeling again.  
  
Q. Brittney, in the four games that you've -- I guess five games that you
played against Danielle Adams, she's never scored more than 15 points --  
COACH MULKEY: Credit Destiny Williams who didn't make All-Tournament.  
  
Q. I voted for her.  
COACH MULKEY: Once again, another stat that's -- I know, that's why y'all in
the media and we coach. I know, I know.  
  
Q. I just wanted to ask you about that going up against her. She's the
league's leading scorer.  
BRITTNEY GRINER: She guarded me a lot. Like Coach said, that's Destiny doing a
good job on her and just guarding her. I was on her a couple times. I was
trying to make sure she didn't get a 3 off. But credit to Destiny, though.  
  
Q. Melissa, one of the other big factors, especially in the first half, was
your bench coming in and really giving you a big spark, Hayden, Brooklyn Pope,
both of them, and Coach Mulkey has talked all season about how important that
is going to be especially in the NCAA Tournament. Can you address that, that
when you guys got off with that slow start you were able to go to the bench
and get a lot of help from those people?  
MELISSA JONES: That's just something special that we have on this team, is
that we've got a tremendous amount of depth, and you could put any one of our
bench players -- I know Coach keeps calling them bench players, but she could
start any one of them. But just put any one with any five on the court at one
time, and they're going to produce.  
They just do an outstanding job in practice. Put anybody out on the court and
we'll make something happen.  
THE MODERATOR: Congratulations. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Two-part thing, first of all, to have 22 turnovers and have Odyssey have
a tough shooting game, all that, the fact that you guys were able to win.
Again, M.J., I had her down the stretch. She stopped Carter on the drive, she
kept the offensive rebound alive, which Destiny converted on. She blocked a
shot. She got a rebound on a free throw to give you another 20 seconds. I
don't know if you remember those stretches of plays for her, if you could talk
about that, and then just overcoming those other issues you had.  
COACH MULKEY: Let me talk about what you opened up with. We've won a lot of
games late in the season, when if you statistically look at it, you're not
supposed to. The OU game there. You know, you come back and you see what you
did there, and you're like how did we win that game? Looking at the stats
here, we have 22 turnovers, guys, to 11 assists. How many of those games are
you ever going to win? How many of the games are you going to win when you go
down 12-0?  
I thought that we battled after about the first five minutes of the game. I
don't think that we came out ready to play. And if that falls on my shoulders,
I'll accept responsibility for it.  
But you just keep coaching, fighting, and I think the kids really did that. It
wasn't a game that I say is one of our better games, but I'm not sure A&M, it
was one of their better games either.  
I think the game boiled down to players making plays. It wasn't going to be me
outcoaching Gary or Gary outcoaching me or us even executing anything great or
them executing anything great. It was no new schemes out there. It was just
kids playing basketball and making plays.  
Late in the game, and I'm not sure which plays you're talking about, but I
thought two key things late when the game was still on the line was when
Odyssey Sims missed the front end of the one-and-one, who got the rebound?  
  
Q. Melissa.  
COACH MULKEY: When Odyssey missed the baseline jumper, who got the rebound?
Destiny Williams. Those two offensive boards gave us more time on a new shot
clock which allowed us to milk the clock even more. We were up five when
Odyssey missed the front end, then they go down and score. We were up three.
So those were big just -- in football you call it smashmouth football; in
basketball, you just call it tough, grit it out, get in there and make a play.  
And I thought those two plays were big late in the game.  
  
Q. I asked Brittney this, but what do you think may be the long-term
benefits of a game like this where you had to come back?  
COACH MULKEY: We've had a lot of those. First of all, I think the regular
season championship is the most important, the 16 games. That's your body of
work. That's what you want first. Anybody can get on a roll in three days and
win a tourney championship. So for us to do both, not many teams probably
really do that. I knew that if we played A&M in the championship, that it
would be this kind of game.  
I also knew that you know what, it's going to be the best championship game of
any conference in the country. And Stanford will probably play UCLA in the
Pac-10. That's the only one left. It is the best championship game, I said it
all along, I said it at halftime, in the entire country. No SEC game has the
No. 2 and No. 5 team playing each other. Not the Big Ten, not the ACC. The
game itself, you got to see the two top 5 teams in the country.  
You got to see some serious defense on both ends of the floor. What a great
preparation for the NCAA Tournament. It has to help both of us as we head into
the NCAA Tournament. I do not think that either one of us will be tired and
fatigued. You have a week to get ready. And win or lose, if we had lost the
game, we were going to be a No. 1 seed. Had Gary won the game, he was still
going to be a No. 2 seed. And I think that makes the game -- just go enjoy it.
Go play it hard for the fans, for the TV, and for you guys.  
  
Q. Can you talk about you usually keep players off the floor when they get
two fouls. You put Odyssey back in there. Kind of rotated her. The confidence
you had with her late in the game when she obviously struggled shooting the
ball but you still let her handle it and control it?  
COACH MULKEY: I didn't want to put her in. You know I don't like to do that.
It goes against all coaching principles that I have. But Nae-Nae is the back-
up point guard and she was gassed. We had a fastbreak one time, three on one,
and M.J. had it and kind of made a bad shot. She couldn't go. So my other
alternative was to put Condrey. But I want to say I might have subbed Condrey
at that point because Jordan Madden had two fouls. I can't remember exactly.  
So I just looked at her and I said, Whatever you do on the offensive end,
don't drive to run over somebody, don't push off, just go and get us into an
offense and I'll get you off the floor on the defensive end every time, and I
was able to just buy a little time there when Nae was gassed.  
  
Q. You made it really tough for Danielle Adams all three games. Was it
mostly Brittney or good team defense?  
COACH MULKEY: You all answer it for him. Destiny Williams. Write an article
about Destiny Williams and her ability to stop the leading scorer in the
league every game. But she couldn't make All-Tournament.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the way that Brittney took over those 20 minutes,
number one?  
COACH MULKEY: You want me to answer it now. We worked with B.G. We have always
worked with B.G. But I thought Brittney has such a soft touch and can shoot it
facing the basket and can do all those things. She can elevate above you and
just shoot it.  
It's now time for Brittney, when she's not doubled and triple-teamed and
you're in a one-on-one situation, you need to establish the power game for us
right now. And we've really, really pushed her and worked with her to not
allow people to push you off the block.  
And she's such a coachable kid. She's trying to bang in there and she's trying
to push and back up when they're pushing her off the block. So does that
answer your question with Brittney?  
  
Q. Now I want to look forward to this week and beyond, two questions here.
One, just talk about your readiness for the NCAA Tournament. You'll be at home
and then probably Dallas, you could get to the Final Four without leaving
Texas?  
COACH MULKEY: I hope so. I would hope that if we're a No. 1 seed that
obviously you'll be in Waco for the first and second rounds in Dallas, and
it's my understanding, correct me if I'm wrong, I know a month ago we knocked
the NCAA socks off with how many tickets have been sold both at the first and
second rounds in Waco and in Dallas.  
And you've got to love that. That shows the NCAA that we appreciate women's
basketball in Texas.  
  
Q. That leads me to my final question. Gary brought this up as he does every
year about playing here and you guys are treated well, you're just
overshadowed by the men, and he obviously would like to play elsewhere. So in
'14 the talk is that the women's tournament is going to go a week later, which
would not have to tie this to the men's tournament in Kansas City. Can you
just talk about the future as far as playing the women's tournament a week
later and how that might move this tournament?  
COACH MULKEY: No, because I may be dead -- that's Gary having too much time on
his hands. Here's what I will say. Kansas City is awesome. Lots to do here.
It's been a joy. But if this tournament and this game was played in Dallas,
Texas, today, you people that cover us, how many people do you think would
have attended?  
  
Q. 10,000, 12,000?  
COACH MULKEY: That's probably mostly what he's referring to. And that's not to
take away anything from the people who bid on this tournament or the people
who work their rear ends off to make it a good tournament.  
Just parts of the country, you can look at teams in parts of the country that
are ranked in the top 10. And they don't draw. You can look at conferences
outside the Big 12, they don't draw, and they have good teams in it. I think a
lot of that is attributed to the personality of the coaches, how good the
league is, and we work really hard at selling our sport to our fans. And I
would love for this to be somewhere in Texas before Griner graduates. Who
wouldn't?  
  
Q. To follow up on that, Coach Blair mentioned the fact that there are also
really strong teams that we're talking about, teams that have won a lot, and
that's why the attendance is here. Do you think that there may be something to
that as far as what's going on with the sport here in this area, because I've
been covering it in Columbia for a long time and they're still really
struggling to get people in the seats there. If KU, K-State or Mizzou was
really able to get a team together that's winning games, that that's maybe
part of what's going on here with the attendance?  
COACH MULKEY: I don't know. I can remember when Iowa State was winning it,
they'd bring everybody from Ames here. Kansas State back in the day when they
had (indiscernible), those fans came too. It could be. You could be exactly
right. I don't know.  
  
Q. You are kind of like the lioness who is very protective of her Cubs and
you are very complementary of your athletes, and you don't shy away from
telling us what you think about what we've written. And I love that about you.
And I am just wondering where that comes from and is it from being a former
athlete yourself or why do you feel the need to be protective like that?  
COACH MULKEY: Protective as in?  
  
Q. For example, you come up here and you go to town on us about Destiny
Williams.  
COACH MULKEY: You're protective of your athletes when they do right. I will
never protect an athlete that gets in trouble and they're wrong. Look, honey,
I've dismissed starters for missing class.  
Okay. So be careful when you say I protect them. I don't protect them. I make
them do right. They're held accountable. I think it's a personality that
you're born with, but it's also who you played for. Have you ever met Leon
Barmore? Have you ever met Pat Summitt? I got to cherish the moments I had
with them when they were my age. I got them in their prime. And I am a
pussycat compared to either one of them.  
But the thing I always loved about them is that I may not have wanted to hear
what they had to say, if it was particularly critical, but it motivated me
because I never wanted to disappoint them. I never wanted to disappoint them.
And I knew that if I gave them everything I had they would be that protective
person for me and they would fight for me.  
And it's so funny, I think some of you have written this in your things, and
my children even laugh about it, my kids, Mackenzie and Kramer, you say,
Mulkey, and then you all put in parentheses, who is brutally honest or honest
to a fault.  
Since when is honesty a fault? Since when is honesty a fault? I have never
ever turned anybody down for an interview. I have never lied to anybody in
this room. What you see with me is what you get. And I guess it's my
personality. I guess it's who I played for. It's like why am I intense and
some coaches aren't. That doesn't make me a better coach than those that
aren't. It's just who you are. There's a realness to me.  
Bernice Mosby, I don't know if you followed her career, she said it best. She
said, Coach, you've got everybody fooled that doesn't know you. And I told
her, Shut up and keep it that way. She said, You are nothing like what people
think. And I said, I don't want those people that aren't in that locker room
or those people that don't know me to know any different. It gives me my
competitive edge.  
Those kids play hard for me. Those kids laugh with me. They cry with me.
Melissa Jones, I can get emotional still talking about that kid. It's just
real. And it happened long ago, and I have two of my own children, I have
Mackenzie and Kramer, be real with these kids. Get in their face when they
need to be gotten on. Hug them when they need to be hugged.  
I hope I've given you the best answer I can give.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Baylor  61  
Texas A&M - 58

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by the Texas A&M Aggies and coach Gary Blair and
the three student-athletes, Danielle Adams, Sydney Colson and Sydney Carter.
Coach, your thoughts about this afternoon's game.  
COACH BLAIR: Great college basketball game. You can see why the Big 12 is like
it is now. It's going to get harder when we go to 10.  
The pace of the game was in our favor. We did a pretty good job on Odyssey. We
were up 10-0 to start the game and running transition, forcing turnovers, and
even then we missed a number of opportunities just on transition baskets, but
we've missed them all year. So that doesn't bother us.  
We're going to force turnovers, we didn't take advantage of Odyssey when she
went to the bench, and they were able to hold with us until the halftime. We
get 19 more shots than them. We get three more free throws. We get
outrebounded by 14 because we don't make the commitment to rebound defensively
with five people.  
That's been a problem all year. We have to defensive rebound with five, like
Colson did yesterday to get eight boards.  
They're very good at the 3, 4 and 5 on offensive boards. But, folks, this is
what Baylor and A&M have done for the last two years, every game has been just
like this. Isn't it something? People won't tune into women's basketball
because they think it's like watching paint dry, and that's what you've got, a
lot of male egos across the country and you've got 18,000 fans over in the
other building that will not come over to see. If they would dare to come over
and see our even-play pickup against Baylor or us, they will see what women's
basketball at the highest level is all about, because that was as good of a
game as you could see.  
I appreciate the media, because you're here, not because they assign you,
because you want to be here, and that's where the game has changed, because
the media has been so good to women's basketball in the last few years. And
we're going to continue to grow. Continue to grow.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Danielle, two questions for you: One, the last shot. Just talk about the
look you had. You guys needed three, and there you were.  
DANIELLE ADAMS: I thought it was going in, when it went out of my hands. I
guess it hit the front of the rim and then the back and then just came out.
But I thought it looked good when I put it up.  
  
Q. Looked like the start of the second half you guys were kind of trying to
get back into your hands. And, boy, you had four or five just off the glass,
off the rim. How frustrating was that? Was that a little bit of Griner? Just
talk about the first four, five minutes of the second half.  
DANIELLE ADAMS: It wasn't Griner. It wasn't frustration. It was just I was
missing easy shots. And I made the hard ones. So that's how I put it. I missed
the easy ones and made the hard shots.  
  
Q. Sydney Colson and Sydney Carter, could you talk about the 3-point shots
today, your problems, and do you think you settled too much maybe for
3-pointers?  
SYDNEY COLSON: I think there were just some of them, like when I was coming
off high screens some were rushed and we probably could have got better looks.
Other ones they were run off our sets in half court offense. There were looks
we knocked down yesterday in the first game when we played Texas, and some of
the shots just weren't falling.  
So then we started trying to do some other things. But as far as 3-point shots
go, I think some of them could have been taken back. We wish we had those
back. But the other ones are shots we take within the offense, and we just
happened to miss them.  
SYDNEY CARTER: Just going off what she said, I think that at the end of the
game I think I did kind of rush a couple of the shots and it was a bad shot
selection.  
And that's just something I've got to learn from and just get over and make
sure that it doesn't happen the next time in another big game.  
But overall I just don't think that our shots were falling. Most of them were
good shots. We just weren't hitting them.  
  
Q. Sydney Colson, I know you guys would never make this excuse, I'm not
asking you to, but you're almost never going to have a turnaround quite like
this and you won't have it the NCAA Tournament no matter what happens of
playing the late game yesterday and having an 11:00 game in the morning. Did
you feel maybe just when you see a shooting percentage like this, maybe a
little bit of tired legs at all?  
SYDNEY COLSON: I don't even think so. Like Danielle was saying, like for her,
she was missing some of the easy ones and not making hard ones. For layups and
stuff I don't think you can blame it on legs. Maybe some of our far shots. But
I think when we get ready for a big game, you know, we get our adrenalin going
and stuff and like our conditioning doesn't really come into play. We do such
a good job throughout the year of being in shape and being able to run on
people that our conditioning, you know, last year when we played the
tournament we played three games in three days and we were just fine.  
So I don't think it's our conditioning. But maybe on a few of the shots it was
a combination of some legs maybe, and then just forced shots, too. But you're
right, we wouldn't use that excuse.  
  
Q. Danielle, you've lost three close games to them. How tough has that been
for you all, and what do you think? Is there a common denominator there as far
as why?  
DANIELLE ADAMS: I mean, it's real tough for us to lose three to Baylor. That's
just like us having three wins against Texas. I mean, it's no difference.  
I mean, we played Baylor in other close games where other teams are getting
blown out by them. Once Baylor plays us, we play so aggressive. They always
acknowledge our aggressive defense.  
I mean, it's just two great teams playing each other, and today was a great
game. We put our hearts out on the floor tonight and gave all our effort.  
  
Q. Sydneys and Danielle, yesterday you talked about having that -- I think
you said 11 -- I think it was a nine-point lead over Baylor the last time you
played them. When you got off to that 12-0 lead, were you thinking about that
at all, that, hey, we've done this before against these guys but they came
back?  
SYDNEY COLSON: We weren't thinking about the previous game. We were thinking
we needed to keep doing what got us the lead, and that was getting steals,
helping each other out on defense, and giving help stealing from one another
when people are penetrated.  
And we stopped doing what was working for us. We started settling for 3s we
weren't knocking down and some jump shots we weren't hitting. And I think most
of the turnovers we forced, I think they had 11 in the first half or something
or nine, and then that was in like the first few minutes, then we didn't get
any for the rest of the half.  
When Odyssey went out we didn't press their guards like we should have and
made them create more. But we really should have taken advantage when she was
out of the game and when we had a chance to go inside in the tech more and
take the guards off, but we didn't do that.  
  
Q. Danielle, can you talk about Griner, took over from the middle of the
first half to the middle of the second half. Could you talk about having to go
up against her again?  
DANIELLE ADAMS: She's just a great player. Her length is just so amazing to
me. I think this is the only 6'8" player that I've seen that can actually
play. She's physical down low. She's physical down low. She's a great player.
That's all I can say about her.  
  
Q. Danielle, the fact that you guys have played Baylor, a team that
everybody thinks will be a No. 1 seed and a national championship contender,
you've played them right down to the end three times now. How much confidence
does this give you guys going into the NCAA Tournament?  
SYDNEY CARTER: Well, just like you said, we've played them down to the wire
every single time. So we know that if they can get there, we definitely can,
because we're on the same level as them.  
And it's nice to just mention us, you know, with a team like Baylor and all
the other teams that are seen as national championship contenders. So we've
just got to make sure that we play our game every game and that we come out
here with the same intensity that we came in this tournament with.  
And if we do that, we'll definitely get there.  
DANIELLE ADAMS: I mean, it gives us a lot of confidence, just we're playing a
No. 1 seed that's going to be in the tournament. Just gives us a lot of
confidence and making to it the Final Four and national championship game.  
Like Syd said, we're just playing them down to the wire, and just us being
mentioned as a national championship contender has given us all the confidence
in the world and we just need to keep our focus and keep playing aggressive
like we always do.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Gary, I obviously didn't get a chance to see the other games that you
played against Baylor. Did you try to do anything different today against
Griner one way or the other than you did the other two times?  
COACH BLAIR: We ran a couple of spreads, shots to get Elonu the shot over in
the corner. She hit the first one and then missed about six others that were
wide open.  
But other than that, that's just a tough shot. I wouldn't trade any of those
shots Elonu had. I told her if she gets any offensive rebounds, take it out,
because she's not going to get the call and Griner's going to block it.  
  
Q. Anything different on the other end, on defense as to how to play her?  
COACH BLAIR: No, we just get after it. What works for us is pressure. We
played -- Karla gave us some good quality minutes in there. Danielle was
guarding her pretty well. But if you have better ball pressure, then the lob
is harder to get to Griner. And a couple times that happened with Danielle.
Their 4 player was able to make the pass very easy because we did not have
enough pressure on the 4.  
And they were able to get the ball in that way. I thought we did an
outstanding job defensively on the guards, particularly Odyssey. But no
changes. If it's been working and it gets us down to the last possession or
two, you keep thinking things are going to change and finally go our way.  
But when they go our way, we're going to have to make shots down the stretch,
because we're not going to get the 50/50 calls, as you noticed.  
So we're going to have to make shots, and you shoot 29 percent, that was the
difference in the ballgame.  
  
Q. What about that last play, didn't take a time-out, just figured you had a
better chance for 3 in transition and that you wanted Danielle to take it?  
COACH BLAIR: Exactly, we wanted any of our three guards over there to take it
or Tyra to take it. We had no set play. I couldn't believe she missed the free
throw and I couldn't believe that Melissa Jones didn't get the rebound.  
But we got it. We felt like sometimes you can over-coach kids, and transition,
let them go. I could have called some real cute play and looked real dumb if
it didn't work and looked real smart if it did. But there was no play. We made
the right pass. And that's -- a 23-footer to Danielle is just like a 19 to
anybody else.  
She had the look. We'll take it all day long.  
  
Q. Danielle talked about staying focused and aggressive and Colson -- not
Colson, Carter came out aggressive with her defensive prowess, especially the
first five minutes. Talk about her defense and how that spurred you guys. She
had fire in her eyes.  
COACH BLAIR: Carter is just a winner. The bottom line, she wasn't on the All-
Tournament team. I don't know if you guys were voting or what, but my gosh.
She's pretty damn good. And if she's the heart and soul of my team and
guarding everybody else, where was your all's vote. I'd like to ask y'all.  
But Carter is a hell of a player for what she does away from the ball with
everything that she does on the court. Throw stats out the windows. Okay? Look
at how do you play the game.  
Melissa Jones knows how to play the game. A lot of other people have talent
and they score. They rebound. They run fast. They make fancy passes. There
isn't a coach in America that wouldn't trade for Melissa Jones or Sydney
Carter, because those are the kids that know how to play the game. And that's
what coaches -- we look for and we try to teach.  
  
Q. Gary, just looking ahead, can you just talk about selections tomorrow
night? You feel so good about a 2 seed and --  
COACH BLAIR: We'll be a 2 seed. I've said it for four years. And this will be
the fourth year we'll be a 2 again. And we're proud to be a 2. Maybe the first
time in NCAA. I don't know the stats. I know it's the first time Big 12, four
straight No. 2 seeds. How did Stanford and UCLA come out today? Haven't
started.  
I think we're a 2. Where we go, it doesn't matter. We haven't gotten any
favors the last couple of years, because the two subregionals we played at
Notre Dame two years ago at their home court, they got upset. We played
Minnesota, won easy. And last year we had to go to Seattle, play basically in
Gonzaga's home court. That wasn't easy. Wichita, Albuquerque and Shreveport, I
hope one of the three.  
I hope one of the teams in there are the easiest ones I could possibly find.
It doesn't matter because they're all going to be good. I really think there's
only a few teams that could win the national championship. But I think there's
almost 20 teams that could get to the Final Four. You gotta have breaks. You
gotta have upsets.  
The year in '98, when we came to the Final Four here, the 1 seed got beat by
the 16 and we ran the gamut and got here. Didn't stay long. But faced
Tennessee. That's why I think that there's maybe 16 teams that could get to
the Final Four. But those four No. 1 seeds, they all deserve it.  
  
Q. Gary, if you're a 2 seed, I'm guessing they would probably keep you away,
but would you want to go to Dallas?  
COACH BLAIR: If we would have won this ballgame today we still would be a No.
2 seed because Baylor had earned it and I would have wanted to go to Dallas
because we would have had the confidence we had beaten Baylor. I don't want to
just beat them in the trivia game, I want to beat them on the court. I was
pretty good in that trivia game, by the way.  
But what I'm saying, would the committee have done that? No, they wouldn't
have. But we're so familiar with each other, I would have taken my chance one
more time. I mean, I might be a fool, but the game preparation wouldn't
change. Kim's wouldn't change for us. Our fans could have gone. I would have
liked to have moved this game to Dallas and played it. We would have a sell-
out. But Tennessee's playing awfully well right now. But point-wise, they
don't have near the RPI, I think, that even Duke has. Duke will probably, with
their ten wins against top 25, will probably be the No. 1 2 seed, and we
should be the No. 2 2 seed, and Xavier, Notre Dame or UCLA will be the others.
So you pick your four. I gave you five.  
  
Q. I was going to ask you to comment on that a little bit. Both in today's
game where obviously there was, let's be blunt, a pretty disappointing crowd
out there, and just the weekend as a whole, what you thought how you thought
things went here in KC?  
COACH BLAIR: I really believe men's basketball, this is a great venue for
men's basketball for the tournament, mainly for KU, Missouri and K-State. And
you always have one of those three in the finals. But for the women, I'm not
sure it is. But we're treated great. Everything is first class. I love coming
here, and it's a neutral site. Why is it a neutral site? So unless you're
playing Iowa State, which would bring the whole state down, it's a neutral
site.  
And I think Baylor had a few more fans than we had, but we had our largest
contingent that we've ever had here, but it's still not enough, because Texas
didn't bring people, look at the crowd last night in the men's game. How many
Longhorns were there? Not very many. We had more Aggies than Longhorns, that's
the first time ever.  
And Baylor for their men's teams, Texas Tech for theirs, I don't know the
answer. It's better for the men than it is for the women. If we go to Oklahoma
City, it's better for OU.  
But the crowds would be better because the state of Oklahoma will support high
school basketball perhaps better than what they're doing here. Where are all
the high school teams? I know there's a state tournament going on, but junior
highs and all of that, okay. That's what we've got to get if we're going to be
a girl's basketball power here.  
  
Q. Flash forward now, it will be here the next two years, but then in '14
there's talk that it might move up a week later because the NCAA women are
going to go a week after the men's. So that --  
COACH BLAIR: That should help.  
  
Q. You could be anywhere. You don't have to be tied to the men's
tournament.  
COACH BLAIR: I think we should go a week later. They're all worried about the
Masters. But we play basketball at night, the majority of the time. The
Masters is played during the day. And I think it's a great chance for us to
try something.  
Don't be afraid. Don't piggyback on the men. Go get your own crowd, get your
own following, and who knows, because when the men's Final Four is over, as
fans, as coaches, we live for it. And the women's Final Four is great, too,
that's the only time that we'll pack a 18,000-seat arena, but if it went that
next week we might be packing the regional arenas because the men's Final Four
I think is usually on a Monday night. Is that right? And we could do the
Saturday/Sunday and we could have that whole weekend.  
So let's try something, because we have to grow our game. And what's happening
across the nation, the top 30 teams are drawing. The 280 teams behind them are
not drawing. That has not changed since I've been in the game. Somehow we got
to increase those others. The top 30 are having great attendance, and we had
our largest attendance ever this year, our fans really came out. We averaged
almost 8,000 in conference play, and I think 6,100 for the year. And that's
huge. Normally they're waiting around for spring football to start. But they
were there.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Baylor  86  
Kansas State - 53

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Baylor coach Kim Mulkey and student-athletes
Odyssey Sims and Destiny Williams. Opening statement, Coach.  
COACH MULKEY: Hit these kids. You all know I've never opened with a remark.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Odyssey, defense is always a focus for you guys. First minute or so of
the game you got a couple of turnovers, created a couple turnovers. You got a
shot clock violation early on. What was working well for you defensively
today?  
ODYSSEY SIMS: Just our intensity. We came out, was ready to play. And we knew
we had to defend them.  
And just as far as the shot clock goes, we knew it was going to come down to
the wire and we had to defend all 30 seconds, so that's what we went out and
did.  
  
Q. Destiny, kind of talk about the game plan going inside, you and Brittney
obviously seemed to really have an advantage down low. Is that something you
knew from the first game and what was the approach tonight?  
DESTINY WILLIAMS: I thought Kansas State had a pretty good post plays as well.
I thought we had to come out strong and open the doors for perimeter and just
get an early start like we did when we played our last game. And we did just
that.  
  
Q. Destiny, you were the recipient of a lot of nice passes where you were
just shooting layups. Is the layup drill very key for you, because you get so
many easy looks?  
DESTINY WILLIAMS: Well, I thought the perimeter players did a great job of
looking into the post players and finding us and giving us wide-open layups. I
thought there were a couple of possessions that my man lost sight of me, and
Odyssey saw that and they saw that and gave me easy looks. When they double-
teamed or triple-teamed B.G., she always looked in, looked out, sometimes I
was open and she passed it in; sometimes I wasn't and she kicked it out.  
  
Q. Destiny, can you talk about how maybe that relationship with you and B.G.
has worked, you've all done better post-to-post passing, and how much that's
developed since January?  
DESTINY WILLIAMS: I thought that developed a lot since January. Me and B.G.
feel more comfortable on the floor with each other. I thought that B.G. could
take it to the hole, jump shots, wide open. I think B.G. can pass as well and
give it to me and vice versa. Me and B.G. just having a good feel for one
another right now in the tournament.  
  
Q. Odyssey, they got it to nine there in the first half and then you hit 3s
on consecutive possessions. Were you feeling any kind of, okay, they're
getting back in the game and we need to do something at that point?  
ODYSSEY SIMS: I felt like we kind of didn't play as good of defense as we
should have. They obviously had great range outside. And we didn't defend. We
didn't have our hands up. When they cut it to nine, we knew that we had to
defend and put our hands up and defend all of the floor because they're really
great shooters.  
  
Q. Odyssey, and then Destiny, if you could comment on this. Odyssey, you had
a lot on your shoulders since you came into Baylor. In what ways do you think
you've grown and improved the most? And, Destiny, could you comment on the way
she's been able to perform as a freshman this season?  
ODYSSEY SIMS: First coming in I had a lot of turnovers. My assist-to-turnover
ratio wasn't good. It's still getting better still. It isn't the best, but I'm
still working on it. I'm distributing the ball better than I did at the
beginning of the year. My shot has gotten better just being able to run the
floor from my teammates, find B.G. when she posts up in the middle of the
lane, just stuff like that.  
DESTINY WILLIAMS: I thought Odyssey has more intensity versus the first half
of her season. She's pushing the ball more, finding open teammates, giving up
the ball at the right time and then making easy shots, knocking down good
shots, attacking the rim and knowing how to pass it, just making us all
better.  
And defensively she's given us -- she's holding down their best players, their
best perimeter guards on defense. She locks down on defense and she pushes the
ball to offense. I thought Odyssey comes in she doesn't play like a freshman
to me. I think right now Odyssey is playing more like an upperclassman, and we
need that from her.  
  
Q. Destiny you went through a rough stretch there shooting the ball. What's
the difference now? Because particularly these last few games you've really
kind of come on strong.  
DESTINY WILLIAMS: I just feel comfortable out there. Shooters can't ever stop
shooting. So it will have to fall eventually. That's what I kept doing. I just
kept shooting. Teammates kept giving me the ball to shoot, telling me to
shoot, and I kept shooting and find my rhythm, and that's what I did.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Kim, how much did you appreciate the defensive effort today?  
COACH MULKEY: That team's hard to guard. Kansas State is hard to guard. You
know what they do. They don't -- they shoot it all over the floor. Just when
you think you're in the range where they won't shoot it, they will shoot it.
They challenge you to keep moving. They challenge you to stay in a defensive
stance for the entire shot clock and you know that they're going to go all the
way to the time that they have to throw up a shot, and they did make some of
those with hands in their face.  
To answer your question, you know what we do in Waco. You know what we spend
time -- you know what every time-out is talked about. It's not talking about
the offensive end of the floor. It's the defensive end of the floor. And for
the Odysseys and the Destinies and the B.G.s, those kids come to your program
as some of the best players in the country. But those kids have never had to
guard anybody. And that's the biggest adjustment and also the most improvement
is every day making them as efficient on the defensive end as they are on the
offensive end.  
And a lot of great players don't want to do that.  
  
Q. Speaking sort of to that, Kim, the way you guys have been able to rebound
and the way that it's spread throughout your team. They didn't have Childs
today, but still you almost -- well, you more than doubled them up.  
COACH MULKEY: We beat a good time without Childs. So don't let that be your
article that he we beat them without Childs. The article needs to be we beat a
very good basketball team with or without Childs.  
But if you look at our 3 spot, which is Melissa Jones, and if you look at
Destiny Williams and even Brooklyn Pope, you look at their rebounding, and
don't look at Griner, that's some solid numbers right there. And those are the
numbers you have to have to contend for not just a Big 12 tourney
championship, but a national championship.  
And I just think that the challenge to them every day in practice is get more
offensive boards, get every defensive rebound you can get, and make sure you
guard people. And when that game's over, you're going to win a lot of
basketball games.  
  
Q. The defense was pretty solid and only five team fouls. Do you think
you've ever had a team that played an entire game against a team like Kansas
State and not fouled?  
COACH MULKEY: I don't know. That is very low. And you'd have to ask our media
relations person, Julie Bennett, and those guys. But you have to look at the
styles of play. We're very quick.  
I would think that it would be safe, without offending anybody, that we're
probably quicker on the perimeter than Kansas State, and we move and get
through screens probably quicker before they can be set.  
And defensively if you're in the right position and you're not fouling and
you're not reaching and they make shots in your face, then don't foul them.
Back in the day when I played, it was never foul a jump shooter. Never foul a
jump shooter. Never foul a 3-point shooter. If they make it with a hand in
their face, you pat them on the rear and say nice shot.  
We just played good basketball. Part of that, too, is Griner allows you to get
beat sometimes off the drive and she's there to clean it up for you. But I
thought our quickness and our athleticism, we didn't get sucked in or baited
to watching the ball, and they reversed the ball real quick and get 3s. We
really did a nice job of not allowing Chambers to just go off on you.  
  
Q. It seems like players were a lot less willing to just throw it up there
with Griner in the paint this year, a lot fewer blocks. How has Griner had to
kind of adjust her defense considering they're not just throwing it up there
and getting ten blocks a night?  
COACH MULKEY: Well, Kansas State's style is not that anyway. You know when you
play Kansas State, Iowa State, their styles of play, they're not coming into
the paint a whole lot. There's not opportunities for her to get blocks.  
But I can't say it enough, Brittney Griner, I don't care what style you have,
I don't care what great post players you have, she makes you change your game
plan because she's just so big in there and she alters shots.  
We need to start keeping a stat on the number of shots and the number of
people that don't want to go in there and they have a layup. I would love
somebody to just follow her the next two years and say your job is to keep up
with nothing but, gosh, if [Brittney] wasn't there, would they have gone in
for a layup right there, if Brittney wasn't there would they have kicked it
back out. She's a phenom. She's above the rim. Help me here. If there's an
adjective I haven't used, introduce me to a new one.  
And she's only going to get better. You haven't even seen the best from her
yet.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the complement that Destiny gives you at the other
side and how important that is with so much attention on Brittney,
particularly how she's played at this tournament?  
COACH MULKEY: Well, you know, Destiny wasn't eligible until after the
Tennessee game. So we played Tennessee without Destiny. And we had Brooklyn
Pope in there. And Brooklyn Pope was a McDonald's All-American. And Destiny is
a McDonald's All-American, two totally different style of four players that
are complementary to Griner. Brooklyn is probably the better passer in feeding
her from high low. Brooklyn leaps out of the gym. Brooklyn does all those
athletic things. Destiny is the better finesse shooter, better shooter and her
rebounds will be done quietly. Brooklyn's will be done with a ah, she leaps
out of the gym.  
But when the game is over, one has seven rebounds, one has seven rebounds.
That's when you just go keep them healthy, keep teaching them. They're
sophomores. Keep getting better. They just complement each other well.  
I have thought about, and may do this in the future, running a triple post
offense. Boy, that would be scary to guard, have them all three in there at
the same time. Because truthfully Destiny can go to the 3 and we lose Melissa
Jones. So all summer, whenever that is, I may sit around and think: Might be
something to that.  
  
Q. Same thing I asked Odyssey, when they got it to nine, your thoughts --
and I know you were probably nervous the entire game, but was that the one
time when you were a little bit worried that they had any kind of chance?  
COACH MULKEY: No, I still felt they were in control. I thought we had subbed a
lot of kids at that moment. I think the three that were in the game off the
bench, I shouldn't have put them in that position, do them one at a time, get
them in, get them out, and let them have some continuity with the starting
group that had been on the floor for a while.  
I thought our defense got us the lead. I thought our defense allowed them to
cut it to nine, and then I thought our defense allowed us to extend it like we
did.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Baylor  86  
Kansas State - 53

  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by Coach Deb Patterson from Kansas State and
student-athletes Kelsey Hill and Taelor Karr. Coach, opening comments.  
COACH PATTERSON: Well, first thing that comes to mind is congratulations to
Baylor. They just played a very dominating 40-minute game, I thought.  
For us, I felt it was a game of two halves. The first half we might not have
been our best, but I think we were keeping the game competitive.  
The second 20 minutes we just failed in our ability to do that and that to me
was beyond obvious. But there were phases of the game, the rebounding numbers
reflect we didn't get the job done there to be competitive. Again,
particularly in the second half. I thought the first 20 lining up against a
team of that caliber, we had put ourselves in position to compete in the game
well.  
The lack of involvement offensively and defensively in terms of establishing
some post hits and post game I think put a lot of pressure on our perimeters
in this particular game.  
And I think we've established during the season we're better at that than we
played today, but we never really got that on track, any kind of real even
post touches that would lead to good passes that would put some pressure on
the defense. So I think that was a factor for us as well.  
But great game by Baylor, and a second half for us that just was not
competitive at the level you have to play against a great team like Baylor.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Taelor, and then for Kelsey, obviously Brittney Griner is not the only
reason that Baylor scores 86 points today. Defensively, what do you feel like
you should have done to limit the rebounds, especially offense rebounds, and
their shots?  
TAELOR KARR: Yeah, the main thing was the rebounding. They killed us on the
boards. And that's on the shoulders of all of us that played, not just the
posts. We all have to get in and get a body on everybody and box out and be
more physical. So that was the main thing.  
And then we played the zone a lot of the time, and we didn't scramble very
well. We didn't communicate, and Baylor's a great team and they'll pick you
apart, expose you on the little mistakes we made. They played a great game
today, and they exposed us big time.  
KELSEY HILL: It's just the work phases, it's the little things. You've got to
box out. You've got to hustle and scramble, like Taelor said. We didn't bring
it. Baylor definitely exposed us on that, where it's not characteristic of our
team to not do the little things. And we didn't do that today.  
  
Q. Kelsey and Taelor, you guys had a pretty tough game yesterday. Did you
feel like you were just kind of running out of energy in the second half?  
KELSEY HILL: You know, I wouldn't say that so much. I think that we just
didn't focus in mentally. Mentally brings physicality and effort. And I think
we had lack of effort, doing the little toughness things, which, again, like I
said aren't characteristic of us, we didn't really handle those.  
TAELOR KARR: Yeah, we can't use that as an excuse of being tired or anything
like that. We've been playing all season, and we should be in great shape by
now. That's definitely not an excuse. We're not going to say that at all. It's
just Baylor's a great team and they flat out beat us today.  
  
Q. Kelsey and Taelor, having Jalana suit up and start with you girls, was
that a motivating boost to start the game for you guys?  
KELSEY HILL: You know, absolutely. Jalana is a great player, and she's
phenomenal for us. And we have won games with her and with A&M -- or without
her, excuse me, we've won games without her at A&M and won games with her. And
I think we're just looking forward to the upcoming games in the tournament
that we have to play.  
  
Q. Taelor, is it surprising to look at the stat sheet and see you can shoot
70 percent from the 3 and lose by that margin?  
TAELOR KARR: Yeah, it's tough. They played a great game all the way around.
Odyssey Sims was four for five from the 3-point line. They had people step up.
It wasn't just Brittney Griner that really killed us.  
We just didn't play good defense. It's the same things. The work phases, like
Kelsey said, the boxing out and scrambling on defense, just giving effort. And
not being there for your teammates, we didn't do that at all today.  
KELSEY HILL: Absolutely. Just what Taelor said. We gave up too many easy looks
and didn't hustle with our intensity level.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. After a loss like this, you're now going into the NCAA Tournament. As a
coach, how do you get your athletes back in the mental game to where they get
that confidence back and they get that positive attitude back after kind of a
disappointing loss or a big loss?  
COACH PATTERSON: Honestly, I don't think it will be difficult with this team.
I think it's like any of us, when you come to work and you're going to do a
job and you go back home you're like, man, I really didn't do well with that,
whatever it is. That's the disposition I think our players walk away from this
game with.  
We have to be a team that brings great attention to the little things and the
work phases of the game. We can't wow you with our athleticism and we can't
wow you with our physical dominance. So we can stay competitive by doing
things consistently and bringing accountability to those things.  
And today it was -- and, again, I say it mostly in the second half, because
the first half is a little bit of feeling out your opponent. You know they're
good. You're still making adjustments. The second half I think it's not hard
for us to walk into that locker room and know we were absolutely just
dominated in that second 20 minutes emotionally, physically, with all the
detail things.  
So we're going to come back very hungry and motivated by the picture of what
we look like when we don't do that, particularly against a phenomenal, great,
confident, well-oiled machine like Baylor. And they are a little bit extreme
relative to the challenge, but I think we're better, are capable of being
better.  
So I don't think I'm going to have to pick their chins up off the floor or
they're walking out of there with a "poor me" mentality and how do we get our
confidence back at all. I think it's just today we failed at the things we
need to do to keep ourselves competitive, and so you get up tomorrow and say,
well, let's get back to work and this is what happens when we don't. I think
we're pretty matter of fact in that regard.  
  
Q. I want to look forward to -- can you just talk about -- I know it's an
inexact science, but do you think your seeding can be affected by Jalana's
situation and how do you see your team if you don't have her at full
strength?  
COACH PATTERSON: Well, honestly I think she should be okay. I think she should
be okay. So my expectation is that she will be. It's been a lot of days. We're
going to have several days before our first NCAA Tournament game.  
This is a hip flexor strain. It's not even the kind of injury that should
continue to present itself at a real high level. So I feel that she's going to
be okay. Today she didn't feel she could go, so we didn't utilize her. But I
expect to have her in the NCAA Tournament. I personally don't have any
question about her.  
  
Q. Big picture, where do you see your team fitting in the field?  
COACH PATTERSON: You might not believe this, but I can't even tell you where
all of the regionals are, because I'm so focused on our team and I like not
looking out there. I might be the only coach on the planet that way. So we'll
see.  
  
Q. Also looking ahead, I mean, I know you just said that you're intensely
focused on what K-State's doing, but what have you seen as a coach and just
following basketball in general this year that maybe gives you some evidence
that anything can happen, it could be anybody's tournament to win, as opposed
to being the usual suspects of UConn, Tennessee, et cetera, et cetera?  
COACH PATTERSON: I think in our league I would definitely say two of the usual
suspects are A&M and Baylor. And anyone that doesn't regard them that way
would be making a huge mistake.  
I think if Oklahoma gets hot, you know. They've got a chance at a run. And
then I tend to really believe in the usual suspects going into the NCAA
Tournament this year.  
I think Notre Dame's playing great basketball right now. It will be fun to see
what happens with them. But our league in and of itself, in those early rounds
of the NCAA Tournament, I think is a classic example of how wide open the
early phases of this tournament are going to be in the middle rounds and in
the first, you know -- those first games where you're looking at the 16 seed
up to about the second or third seed, I think. Our league is a classic example
of what can happen.  
But I do believe there's a little bit of real serious heavyweights that are
really some giants that people would have to slay when you line up against
those 1 and 2 seeds this year.  
  
Q. Baylor's defense, you had that stretch where you managed to cut it to
nine. But it almost seems like on the perimeter they're playing with six
players at times. Is that because of their quickness and then they've got
Griner back there as the goalie kind of? Defensively talk about how difficult
they are to get open shots against.  
COACH PATTERSON: Again, if you don't establish, I think, some pressure on the
rim and some post touches against Baylor, your life is just going to be so
difficult every offensive possession because they're athletic, they're strong,
they're physical, big bodies, great athletes. And once and if you do tend to
loosen yourself for even a moment on the perimeter, with maybe a dribble drive
option, you've got Brittney that's going to be that factor on your dribble
drive.  
And so if you aren't hot on the perimeter, if you don't create outside
opportunities by virtue of going outside and taking it at her and taking it at
Brooklyn or Destiny, whoever is in at that point, it's going to be a really
long day for you. And that's what we found today.  
But you're right, they're just big and physical. And they're able to, I think,
be better every catch because they know they've got Brittney behind them.  
  
Q. On a normal day, how important is it that your team make 3s and how much
do you rely on that aspect of the game?  
COACH PATTERSON: Well, we've won a lot of games this year not being great from
the 3-point line. But if you're not going to be great there, you better be
scoring some in the paint. And that's the whole deal. For us it's a 50/50
proposition. We're going to take any and every 3 we can get our hands on. I
like shooting them quick. I like shooting them when they're open. I never want
them passed up.  
But when those aren't dropping down, flat out you gotta find somebody that
will score in the paint. And today we didn't. And it can be a devastating
result for us.  
Today I thought, especially early in the second half, we had got some decent
looks. And I thought there were a couple of possessions where we saw Kelsey
Hill get hot. Taelor was hot the first half. I thought we had some open looks.
Alina had some. Kelsey had them in the second half. If they go in, the game
remains significantly more competitive.  
So it can keep us in games, that shot-making, but only for so long if we don't
have a little bit of balance on the inside, and we had no balance on the
inside today. None.  
The other day we could win a game with Brandy scoring three baskets in the
post, and that's enough. If Jalana's getting us 15 or 16.  
But we have to have at least 18, 20 points in there or we can't compete with
the people at this level.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Texas A&M  81  
Oklahoma - 68

  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by coach Sherri Coale from Oklahoma and her
two student-athletes, Danielle Adams and Whitney Hand coach.  
COACH COALE: I'm proud of our kids. I thought we fought really, really hard.
We didn't necessarily make a lot of great decisions. We did some dumb things
and missed some open shots and failed to take advantage of some opportunities
where I thought we could have just -- we were right on the edge and just
couldn't quite get to the other side.  
But I cannot fault their effort. I cannot fault their fight. I'm proud of
them. Texas A&M has a very good basketball team. They have tons of weapons.
And we at least made them go down the depth chart a little bit and try to find
them.  
Sydney Carter killed us in the second half. Obviously she went on a little
terror there for ten minutes and couldn't get an answer for her.  
But, again, they're a very, very good basketball team who had to play
extremely well to get through us and earn the right to the championship.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Whitney, can you talk about what Griffin has meant to you guys, how she
played today and how when she's able to play like that how it changes your
team?  
WHITNEY HAND: Yeah, Nicole, I think she stepped up tremendously. I was talking
to her last night, and she said the A&M game at their place when we got just
smashed is when she started to play, and she was really excited to get that
opportunity again.  
You saw what she did. Did she get a 3? I don't think she did. Oh, yeah, she
hit one. No, she didn't. She hit one. Sorry.  
I just felt like she really disrupted her rhythm a little bit. Obviously she
got pushed under a lot on rebounds. But I just felt like her presence, she's
just a confident girl. She wants the ball. She wants to go score. You can draw
up a play for her and she's going to be in the right spot and do the right
thing. I think that's a huge thing, especially around really experienced
guards.  
  
Q. Danielle, can you talk about what your -- your thoughts on where this
team is? The last two years, I don't think you guys have won this tournament
but you've gone to the Final Four. What are your thoughts now in terms of what
you can do the rest of the way?  
DANIELLE ROBINSON: I think we're in a great spot. We have enough support and
enough confidence and enough leadership to get us where we want to go. And
even though we came up short here in Kansas City, I think we're about to start
with a clean slate, and it's one game at a time in the NCAA Tournament. And
with the experience that we had the past two years, we have all the confidence
in the world.  
  
Q. Whitney, similar question, you guys have shown sparks these last five,
six weeks trying to get some momentum. What do you think it's going to take to
win two, three in a row and get going in the NCAA?  
WHITNEY HAND: I mean, we talked about it a little bit earlier in the locker
room that you take this week and you try to -- you improve. And I think the
teams that improve at this point and take advantage of this time that they
have together do great in the tournament.  
I think that we've traditionally done well in the tournament because we do
that. We find out how to believe again. You find out how to just do the little
things, I guess. Especially I feel like it's so much about bracket. And you
find out those teams you have -- I don't know when you prepare for those teams
earlier.  
I just feel like it's going to take a week of work and a week of really
enjoying playing together. And I think that's what the tournament's all about.
It's a fun time. If you play well together, it's hard to beat.  
  
Q. Danielle, can you talk about Carter? Coach alluded to that. Were you guys
(indiscernible)? Can you talk about her and her game and what you guys were
doing against her?  
DANIELLE ROBINSON: I think we lost her a couple times. She got hot. And
Colson's a really great point guard and she found her when she was open. And
she just made plays. She got steals and came out of transition and hit open
shots. And that's what great players do.  
  
Q. Danielle, another question about Griffin. The thing that impressed me
today is the way you throw it into her and then she's catching it easy, not
fumbling the ball around. Has she improved on that or has she always been able
to catch the ball and immediately do things with it? How has that
progressed?  
DANIELLE ROBINSON: She's definitely improved. She's become more confident the
more minutes she played, and the more we challenge our teammates to get
better, she stepped up to every challenge.  
And I think you've seen that all tournament and all year that she's been
playing, just her ability to gain momentum and take confidence into the next
game.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Kind of following up on what Barry was talking about here, Coach Blair
mentioned the idea that with Brittney now in Waco teams kind of have to have
that big presence in the middle. Y'all for some time now have been developing
these very good big players. Talk a little bit about how Nicole's fitting in
with that and do you think a team has to have that big player now to compete
in the conference?  
COACH COALE: Well, I'm really, really proud of Nicole. I think she's really
grown over the course of the year. You can just watch her play tonight; her
presence impacted the game.  
She's figuring out how to get angles and how to finish. She's figuring out how
to catch cleanly. She's not yet mastered the art of what to do when you're
displaced. She's not figured that out, how to either -- you have to hold your
ground or you have to fall. You can't just allow yourself to be pushed
completely out of the play.  
And she's got -- she's got to learn that and she's a freshman. And she'll
develop even further. It's been fun to watch her grow over the course of the
year, just fun to watch things sink in, light bulbs go off, and see her
incremental improvement over the course of the season.  
And she's going to get better even in the next week. That's just the kind of
kid she is. She's very conscientious. She comes to work every day and takes
games in and -- or takes the game in bite-sized bites, I guess you would say.
She doesn't try to improve on everything all at once. She just takes one
little thing at a time and tries to get better at it.  
I thought she was fantastic today. She almost had a double-double against
great, great experience and a post player who is an absolute conundrum to try
to defend.  
I thought she did a fantastic job. That's a very, very experienced A&M team
against some pretty green players. So I just think that Nicole, she did a
great job, and I'm proud of her, and I think she's going to continue to get
better, because it's important to her. When it's important to them, they do.  
  
Q. You said her improvement's been incremental. But her playing time really
wasn't. She's playing barely, barely three, four minutes, then all of a sudden
you played her 28 minutes and she's been playing a bunch ever since. What
happened at that point in the mid-season when you said, hey, we're just going
to play her?  
COACH COALE: We weren't getting any production from any other post players. We
had to get somebody who could produce, get rebounds, score baskets, at least
get fouled and go to the free-throw line. And when she got her opportunity to
play some extended minutes, she did that. And she never stopped doing it.  
  
Q. If someone tells you at halftime that you're going to hold Adams without
a field goal in the second, are you feeling pretty good about things, or are
you still worried about the players around her?  
COACH COALE: A&M is a basketball team. They're a top five team in the country
for a reason. They have more than one player. And we knew that.  
And we game planned for the whole crew of them. Just you don't imagine that
Sydney Carter is going to come out in the second half and have 19. That was
unexpected. Did we think she could score? Absolutely. She's hurt us before.
And we even talked about it in pregame, the deadly spots on the floor if she
catches it, it's points. You can just count on it.  
But, again, at halftime I felt like we were in a really good spot. And we came
out in the second half and we did some really good things, and I think it was
43-41, and we had the ball and we got a 3 and we missed it.  
You watch games on TV. I do it just like you guys do. If this goes in, and if
it goes in, then this game goes this direction, and if it doesn't it might go
the other.  
We had several of those I felt like. I felt that way a lot this year. If we
can just get that break, that one shot to go in for us, or maybe not go in for
them, maybe it goes a different way.  
  
Q. You guys have proven you don't have to win a Big Eight tournament to get
to the Final Four. Could you just kind of look towards next week and how is
your team primed for a run at the NCAA, where you think you'll be in it, et
cetera?  
COACH COALE: We're young. Again, we're fortunate we have great leadership and
three seniors who have been to two Final Fours, and we have a couple of
sophomores who, all they've ever done is gone to the Final Four since they
came to college, which is pretty bizarre.  
So they understand what we're getting ready to do. Vegas, Morgan Hook, Nicole
Griffin, they've got no idea what we're about to do. They have no idea. And I
look back at the game tonight and, boy, there were those little plays that we
were just talking about that can send it one way or another. A couple times it
ended up being freshmen who have been in a position they've never been in
before against seniors, juniors and seniors, at all spots.  
So they're learning and progressing, and it will be important that those older
guys on my squad who have been there and done that try to prepare them as best
they can. That being said, sometimes you just gotta go do it. You gotta go
through it to know what it's like. They've never played in a game where if you
don't win it you don't get to play anymore at the collegiate level. So that
will be new. We'll see how we handle it.  
  
Q. Talk about it has been win one, lose one for quite a while now, and this
is the time of year you have to win two or three in a row to get somewhere,
scheduling and those issues. Talk about what you've been through and why you
maybe have confidence that next week that train can end.  
COACH COALE: Let's talk about that. Let's blame the Big 12 computer system.
I'm all for that. We had no opportunity to gain any traction in the second
half of the Big 12 schedule. That's the way it felt.  
And at some point you gotta be good enough to beat somebody maybe you're not
supposed to beat so you can get some traction, and we couldn't quite get over
that hump.  
That being said, the best thing about our basketball team has been our
resilience. We tend to bounce back and figure out a way to regroup and get
better. I do think we're getting better.  
I think we're better now than we were a week ago, but we have to understand
the sense of urgency that we'll be in the middle of next weekend. The great
thing is, I think it's great, in the first and hopefully the second game we
shouldn't have to play anybody in the Big 12 South, and that will be fabulous.  
  
Q. I think Danielle reached that milestone today. She got the one steal that
she needed for 300 for her career so she becomes the third player in history.
I know you answered a lot of questions about her in glowing terms. But that's
rare air right there with the two that she joins in that category.  
COACH COALE: It's unbelievable. Nancy Lieberman and Dawn Staley and Danielle
Robinson, whatever she does for the rest of her life, she's a part of the
club. None of the rest of us can even get an invite to a pre-party to that
club.  
To me, I look at it, I got to coach this kid. I got to coach this kid who is
mentioned alongside Nancy Lieberman and Dawn Staley. Are you kidding me?  
Special. Special stuff. And yet if you talk to her right now, she just wishes
she had won that game. And that's what makes her unique.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Texas A&M  81  
Oklahoma - 68

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Texas A&M coach Gary Blair and student-athletes
Danielle Adams, Sydney Carter and Tyra White. Coach, opening comments.  
COACH BLAIR: We played awfully hard, not near as well as what we did against
Texas. But Oklahoma didn't play as well as they did against Texas Tech.  
That game on Wednesday took a lot out of both of us, because both of us
usually execute better than we did. But I thought middle of the first half we
came back, made our little mini run, and the key to it in this tournament, and
I've told them all along, quit waiting for Danielle to score 40 and have
balanced scoring. And that's what we had.  
A 6'6" kid makes a whole lot of difference. She alters shots, she deters shots
in there. And since they put her into the lineup, I think Oklahoma will be
very good in the NCAA Tournament.  
She was 6-for-6, kept us really from scoring at will in there. We did all
right on offensive boards. But at the same time that's what everybody in the
league is having to do, because of Griner, is go find some taller kids that
can play post if you want to try to win championships here during Griner's
four-year run.  
I thought we did a good job with our bench in the second half. When they made
their run, I started calling Carter's number. And we'd been calling Tyra a lot
in the first half, and she was good, bad, good, bad, good bad, but she hit
those five in a row that really made the difference.  
Danielle's got her in the first half. Didn't look like she had 13 points. But
when she hits the board she played an average ballgame and still had a double-
double.  
And, folks, this is the first team ever in the Big 12, four straight years in
the championship game. And now it's up to us to figure out how to keep that
streak going by winning one here. But we're looking forward to playing Baylor.
They're our sisters right down the road. We know each other very well. We know
what they're going to do. It's not going to help our seed one way or the
other. If we win, we're going to be a 2 seed; if they win, they're going to be
a 1 seed. That's just the way it goes.  
Let's go out, we're in this thing to win championships for A&M, hopefully it
will be a great weekend for both our men and our women. Open it up to
questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Sydney, could you talk about what's the difference in your game in the
first half and second half?  
SYDNEY CARTER: Just the all-around scoring. I think that in the first half I
got in foul trouble, so I had to come out. He had to protect me because he
needs me on the defensive end as well. But I think I took better shots and
they left me open. So I think I just knocked the shots down in the second
half.  
  
Q. Sydney, talk about what is it like to be in the zone, some of us haven't
picked up a ball in a while, especially just take us back to that stretch you
were really feeling it especially after the third 3?  
SYDNEY CARTER: I can't explain it. It's like I'm having an out-of-body
experience there. Yeah, off the record. But it's just -- I'm pretty -- I'm a
pretty emotional kid out there on the defensive end. You never really see me
too much emotional on the offensive end. When I'm in the zone, I think you can
really tell. It's an awesome experience.  
  
Q. Danielle, could you just talk about the feeling of being in position to
win a postseason title here, and in what's basically your backyard?  
DANIELLE ADAMS: It's great. It's always great to play in a Big 12 championship
in Kansas City especially in me and Tyra's hometown. This is in front of our
family. We know we always have a team and our team is going to go out there
perform each night aggressive on offense and defense. Carter did a tremendous
job today. She was kind of iffy in the first half, but you see she came out in
the second half just firing away and knocking down shots.  
And Tyra, she's just aggressive on offense, taking it to the basket. And, I
mean, I'm just glad I have teammates like that who can just back it up.  
  
Q. Sydney, speaking of being emotional right at the end of the game you got
the steal, had the ball, the clock's running down. Was that neat to just kind
of stand there and hold the ball and smile?  
SYDNEY CARTER: Of course. It would have been much better if that was a
championship game. But it just feels good to get the win. We didn't play our
best game, but it's a relief to know we can pull out a win like that against a
team like Oklahoma. It just feels good to come out with a win.  
  
Q. Danielle and Tyra, Coach Blair talked about the fatigue factor, the fact
that you guys have played difficult games yesterday and then having to come
back out here today. And I know that's the nature of the beast when you talk
about a tournament like this. But talk about how that affects you and the legs
and the bounce that you get and having to play days in a row like this?  
DANIELLE ADAMS: That's a good question. I mean, it affects you just because
your legs are tired. You're deep in the season, postseason, you've been
playing all these games. And your legs are just trying to give up.  
But we tried to not let that make a factor in how we perform each day. But it
set a factor today in the game, but we pulled out a great win tonight against
a very good, well-coached Oklahoma team.  
TYRA WHITE: I think it plays a big factor, but you just have to give it to
Coach who coached us to just rest our legs for the big turnaround for
tomorrow, playing a 11:00 game. We have to rest our legs, watch film, and stay
off our feet and hopefully get the win tomorrow.  
  
Q. Tyra, can you just talk about the third matchup with Baylor? You guys
know these players so well and the games have been pretty dramatic, especially
the one at Waco. What do you think can be the difference-maker for you guys to
be able to beat them this year?  
TYRA WHITE: I think the difference-maker is us. I think when we were at Waco
we had a big lead. We let it slip away. So just keeping our composure, keeping
our turnovers over because that's really what caused the game at Waco -- we
were up like by I think 11 or something like that. We just let our composure
just slip. The third time everybody knows, everybody plays, so it's just down
to execution at the end.  
  
Q. Danielle and Tyra, we make so much of the big two, the two Kansas City
kids account for much of the Aggies offense. Could you talk about the
frustration having to sit there most of the second half and also the
excitement of seeing the other kids come through?  
DANIELLE ADAMS: It's no frustration at all. I've got tremendous teammates that
can pick up the slack or do whatever. That's what Carter did tonight. She came
out the second half hot. Tyra, she's always going to do her thing. And we're
just glad we got the win tonight and we're just looking forward to tomorrow
against a great matchup against Baylor. And hopefully the third time's a charm
and we pull out a victory here in Kansas City.  
TYRA WHITE: I think our teammates are mentally tough. They come out prepared.
When we go down, we're always there to pick up other slack. So I think we're
all just kind of accountable to each other. I think that's the main key.  
THE MODERATOR: Congratulations. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. We appeared to capture during the game a play called by you where you
were going to Tyra White, and Sydney Colson as she walked the ball up she said
let's go to Sydney Carter. Is that in fact what happened?  
COACH BLAIR: No, I don't think so, because I was calling Carter's play. I was
just telling her where to go. We were running -- we were running what we call
3. That's the Allen Iverson play where she comes across the double screen over
there one-on-one.  
But the second option is the double screen for Carter coming back up high.
That's what we were having. So all I did was tell them to run 3. It's Tyra's
first option which we figured we needed to throw her over there, get her on
the back side and then bring her off the double screen.  
Well, one of our posts screened, the other one didn't, and I think we still
scored on it. But that's what the play was. It's the old Iverson play that
everyone runs, and Tyra's pretty good on it, particularly when we were at Waco
she had 29 points and about 12 of them are off that same play.  
By the way, we did beat Baylor in the trivia contest. I want that duly noted.
We got beat by Kansas State or Oklahoma in the first round, but we hung on and
we won the trivia, so we're 2-and-1. We'll try to go 2-and-2 now. I'll let my
AD know that.  
  
Q. Can you talk about your 3-point defense, particularly with Ellenberg and
Robinson today?  
COACH BLAIR: I thought early it was good. In the second half, they just missed
because we're so used to playing help side defense. Vic trains them so well to
have two feet in the end in the basket. But when you have a post player out
there and the 3-point shooter behind us, and then we're running -- we're
thinking help, help, help, we've got to take a charge, there isn't a charge
because we're stopping Robinson so they're skipping the ball and we're playing
-- running into a pinball machine bouncing off the post player.  
We need to leave one outside and one in, particularly if they don't have the
inside game. We'll make that adjustment, because we'll see those plays again.
But they had some great looks, particularly Whitney Hand.  
And I would really like to compliment Whitney. This is the best she's played
in about a month, and I thought she had an outstanding ballgame for them. And
give Griffin a lot of credit, because I think she's turning into a great,
great freshman post player.  
  
Q. With all that Sydney Carter does for you defensively and the grunt work,
how good does it feel for her to have a game like this offensively?  
COACH BLAIR: I think it's good. Robert asked that question, what happened in
the first half. Two fouls happened in the first half and she sat 13 minutes.
So she played seven. But she missed a couple of looks early that were open
that we call for.  
After that, she's just a gamer. I mean, she can go all day long. And she does
so much for this basketball team, on and off. And loose balls, whatever. And I
want her at the free-throw line. Colson was running on fumes. I had to play
her too many minutes and her free-throw shooting very much suffered.  
But Colson, look at what she did. 4-for-12 from the field. You say, hey,
that's not good, but she was penetrating. We were getting 19 offensive boards.
Next, eight rebounds for her. That's got to be a career high. All on the
defensive end. That's huge. Eight assists. Three steals. She should have been
setting up on this table, too.  
  
Q. Just your thoughts on a third matchup with Baylor.  
COACH BLAIR: First, I'd like to challenge Kansas City to come out and see two
of the top teams in the country, not just in the Big 12. And we've played the
last three years in this championship in front of 3,100, in front of 4,000.
We're better than that, Kansas City. We want you there. We want you out. We
want you to meet our kids both on and off the court. They're selling out on
the men's side. It's a great thing.  
You have two great ball clubs here and you have ten others that have earned
the right to have the attendance improve over here. But the ones that are
here, they're making the difference.  
The game with Baylor, they were able to go through the Big 12 North and rest
their kids not just because that's how good Baylor is, and so they didn't have
to play the minutes that we had to play. And we had to go through the Big 12
South. That's a whole new different cat when you have to go through the
athletes that we see in the Big 12 South, including Baylor.  
We had this same scenario in 2008 at Oklahoma City. We beat K-State by one in
front of 12,000, we beat Oklahoma, and then we didn't have a whole lot in the
tank by the time the second half started against Baylor, and we lost by nine.  
But our kids want this rematch. We want to play Baylor four times. We know if
we play Baylor four times we're in the Final Four because that's how good
Baylor is. We're looking forward to it. Everybody just said the Longhorns and
Aggies are supposed to be the greatest rivalry in the world. How about Baylor
and A&M in basketball? Forget all those other sports. Let's just talk about
basketball. And it's a tremendous rivalry.  
And you all heard enough out of me and I need a Diet Coke, and we'll see you
all tomorrow.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

BAYLOR  86  
KANSAS - 51

  
THE MODERATOR: We are now being joined by the Lady Bears and Coach Kim Mulkey.
Her two student-athletes Melissa Jones and Brittney Griner have joined us
also. Coach, your thoughts about this afternoon's games. Okay, we'll just take
questions for our student-athletes.  
  
Q. MJ, first minute of the game, I think you had a three, a rebound, a
steal. Did you feel like your old self out there?  
MELISSA JONES: It felt great to get on the floor and play with the team. I
think we were well prepared going into this game. Just everyone's mentality
and just mentally prepared.  
  
Q. How much better is your eye? Is it better at all?  
MELISSA JONES: Actually, yes. I can see that there's like light. I don't know.
It's still dark, but I can tell that there's light, if that makes sense?  
COACH MULKEY: I do want to say something. Everybody in this room disclosure
right eye. Disclosure right eye, not your left eye. And try to write on that
pad of paper. Some of you can't write with two eyes, now try to do it with one
eye. Can you believe what you just saw out of that kid today?  
She hits the first three of the game, she gets rebounds, that's the story of
the game. She can't see. She's gone from completely black seven days later to
fuzzy black. And today she's a little Catholic girl. It's Ash Wednesday,
she'll be at mass at 5:15. She said Coach, I can see light. If I'm headed
toward a light, I can see something bright. I don't even know if I described
what I witnessed that kid doing today.  
So that's what I want to say about Melissa Jones. That's unbelievable. I'm
sorry to interrupt. Go ahead. Keep that right eye closed though.  
  
Q. Brittney, it just seemed like today you guys had everything clicking
really well. Even though you had this game in hand, I saw a lot of effort out
there. It wasn't like your effort even let up. And I know you guys have really
focused on that, and can you talk about how important that is in March to have
every single possession effort?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: Well, Coach always tells us never take a possession off, and
today I don't think we did. Our intensity in the first half was amazing. It
wasn't in spurts, it was all the way through. I thought with MJ knocking down
those threes and getting us ready, just out there high fiving and chest
bumping. So we were just -- we really raised it together.  
  
Q. Brittney, late in the game you and destiny had a little fast break with
her leaving the break. Talk about that play and were you thinking maybe a dunk
on that?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: I was definitely thinking maybe a dunk. I saw one person
back, me and destiny out. I remember looking at it, she glanced over at me and
I pointed up. She gave it to me good. Couldn't dunk it, so I definitely was
thinking about banking it.  
  
Q. Was it in the back of your mind that Kansas might want to come in here
and get revenge since you guys had a lopsided victory over them over the
year?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: We really, you know, didn't think about that first game. We
just came out like it was the first game we played against them. We just knew
we had to come out and jump out ahead and keep strong. You know, when the team
jumps on you hard in the beginning, and that's what we were trying to do is
get out and have intensity and just not give up.  
MELISSA JONES: Kansas is a great basketball team, so everyone possession we
had, something good was going for us. We never stopped trying. Their effort
was just outstanding. They have great athletes out there. They're very
prepared going in. They're a good team. Just a couple good things going for
us.  
  
Q. I know it's hard to explain because it's hard for us to even imagine what
you're seeing now. But the thing I'm even more impressed about than your
shooting is you kept your rebounding totals up, and I know peripheral vision
has to be part of rebounding along with instinct. Can you just talk about do
you feel like just as stronger rebounder? Do you know where the ball's coming
even though that part of your vision isn't anywhere near what it usually is?  
MELISSA JONES: It is a bit awkward. I almost feel like I'm catching with my
chest. I can't like quite catch it sometimes. But a lot of it is muscle
memory. I still know where to go to get a rebound or something like that. So I
can still read that, it's just I guess a little bit difficult to still
visually see what exactly I need to.  
  
Q. You might have addressed this in previous games. But how do the glasses
aid at this point right now?  
MELISSA JONES: The glasses are just primarily for my good eye, so heaven
forbid something happen to that one, then I would be out of luck entirely. So
it's just for production for my good eye to make sure I don't get a poke or
something scratched or something.  
  
Q. Do you think she looks cool in the glasses?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: Definitely, I think we all should get a pair. Same effort out
there, you know.  
  
Q. You've tried to put this into words before, but Jones really is a pretty
amazing competitor. I wonder if you can kind of talk about how no matter what
sort of obstacles she's faced -- I look at her numbers today, 8.7 assists,
nine rebounds, how she's able to do things?  
COACH MULKEY: I don't know how you do it. I catch myself driving down the
street, closing my eye. I'm other thinking how is this kid doing this? I just
think it's the make-up of her personality that, okay, I've been giving this
little obstacle. I've been given the blessing that they tell me my sight is
going to come back.  
I can either choose to feel sorry for myself or say, Coach, I'll give
everything I have. Just don't let me embarrass myself. If you see I can't help
the team, just get me off the floor. That's kind of the agreement I've had
watching games yesterday. I still hadn't made my mind up if I was going to
play her. Because truthfully, win or lose this tournament, there is a bigger
picture for our basketball team.  
Yet, as I talked to her, it wasn't begging me to play or anything like that.
She said, "I'm like you, Coach. I have mixed emotions, but if I do play, just
don't let me be taking away from somebody else that could be doing it better."
That is kind of the agreement. Watch her, observe her, get her off the floor
if she's not helping on our basketball team. Well, I don't think I could get
her off the floor today.  
That's just an unbelievable story. It is ten days now that she's not been able
to see. Each little thing that happens, a change, it's like we all start
hugging each other. While we are very confident in what the
neuroophthalmologist and many specialists have said that her vision will be
back, not probably, not maybe. We believe them. But until you see progress,
you just kind of have your stomach stay in knots.  
So this morning when she woke up, she said she can see some light. She still
can't see out of it, but she knows when the light is close to her eye. That's
telling the optic nerve signals to the brain, the brain back to the optic
nerve. That's all we want. That's good news. And time, like with anything in
life, time is going to heal her eye. What a competitor.  
  
Q. Destiny looked aggressive shooting the ball today?  
COACH MULKEY: Destiny had one of her greater games. I didn't realize Destiny,
Griner and MJ could have had double-doubles. I wanted to get them off the
floor. Get them off the floor as quickly as possible, rest tomorrow, come back
on Friday and Saturday.  
So, you know it was just I saw an intense basketball team that took that floor
for Baylor. If they can do that a couple more days in the tournament, I feel
good about our chances of winning it. Who knows, it's a basketball team that
is so talented, but when that intensity matches their talent, it's special.  
I thought our defense, how many shot clock violations, how many hurried shots
did they have? How many contested shots did they make? The tone was set with
Melissa Jones, but it was set on the defensive end of the floor very early in
the first game.  
  
Q. Coach, is there an added excitement for you and the team that has that
atmosphere and how it changes this part of the season?  
COACH MULKEY: I think it is for those players from last year that experienced
it. But like Odyssey Sims, she's in there freaking out because she has to stay
in the locker room for 30 minutes. What? The new rules with the media coming
in. They've got excitement in there too. They don't know. They've never
experienced some of this. And the ones that have experienced it have only done
it for a year, other than Melissa Jones. They're excited.  
They're basketball junkies. Some want to go to the men's game tonight. Some
want to come back over here, and as long as they're watching basketball. I
love it.  
  
Q. Considering what you just said about MJ and your admiration for her,
there was a moment late in the first half where she faked out a KU defender
and it went up a three. Went in and turned to the crowd a little bit, shook
your head and smiled. What was going through your head?  
COACH MULKEY: That am I really witnessing a kid that ten days ago had two good
eyes and she's putting on a performance like this with one eye. I don't know
that any of us could expect that in athletics. I knew that she would compete,
but to make shots, to get rebounds, to guard people and really, truthfully,
look out there and it's almost like you didn't know it.  
If you didn't know it and you were watching her play, you wouldn't know it. I
just couldn't -- I still can't imagine that kid playing as well as she did
today. I teased her after the game, as I said earlier. She's a little Catholic
girl. She just smiles from ear to ear all the time, but she's human like all
of us. She's had her moments and her breakdowns within all of this. That's why
you stay with her, and keep encouraging her, and her mother keeps encouraging
her. She is everything a coach dreams of coaching.  
I've said this many times and I'll say it again, if I'm a WNBA scout, I've got
to give Melissa Jones a look. Now I'm saying that, and I've got a 6'8" kid
that's a phenom. I'm saying that, and I've got a point guard that's a phenom.
Melissa Jones is our glue. Melissa Jones' presence on the floor makes us
better. I'll say that to any coach.  
I was so glad she was rewarded with being all Big 12, because every coach in
America should have the pleasure of coaching a Melissa Jones.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

BAYLOR  86  
KANSAS - 51

  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by the Kansas Jayhawks Coach Bonnie Henrickson
and her two student-athletes, Monica Engelman and Angel Goodrich.  
COACH HENRICKSON: I give Baylor credit. They got after us on the defensive
end. We're trying to go from doubling in a man defense on a miss and doubling
a zone on a make. And both defenses going into the locker room were equally as
far as field goal percentages, they were saying they were six or seven in
transition on our turnovers. That's obviously a problem for a team that's that
good in the half court offense, or one-on-one and score that in transition.  
And we talked about going in, your best defense may be your offense. Not
turning the ball over and giving them high percentage shots. But like I said
yesterday when we were talking about what happened with Brittney Griner,
certainly she's impactful on the offensive end.  
But the longer you watch her and you have that opportunity to play against
her, just how much she impacts the game on a defensive end. Again, especially
for a team that scores and spends a lot of time throwing the ball inside 52-18
in points in the paint. She changes that because there's not much room to
score, and the lane's awfully crowded.  
  
Q. Angel, can you talk about what Bonnie talked about Brittney and how much
and how difficult it was for you guys to try to feed the ball to Carolyn and
to drive yourselves?  
ANGEL GOODRICH: We tried to bring her out and bring the fours or when we had
two bigs in, whoever Brittney Griner was guarding, put them on the ball and
get it down. But she really didn't commit to one person coming up high. So we
had to change that up and kind of go through the hustle.  
  
Q. Monica and then Angel, I believe after the K-State game coach had said
that this team has played the schedule in everything to where you should get a
WNIT bid. What are your plans over the next few days? Will you take a breather
from basketball or will you go ahead and get back in the gym and look forward
to the announcements this weekend?  
MONICA ENGELMAN: The plan is to take a little break, get off our feet a little
bit. Depending on what day we're going to play, we'll be hitting the gym. And
then focus on school because we have midterms coming up. We'll take a little
break, work on ourselves and get back to the gym.  
ANGEL GOODRICH: Just like she said, we're going to talk a break a little bit,
and then once we come back in, we've got to focus on what we have to do and
get better each and every day.  
  
Q. Angel and then Monica, what do you attribute your shot clock struggles
with all the shot clock issues you guys have throughout the game?  
ANGEL GOODRICH: Well, at the beginning we wanted to, like Coach said, we
wanted to slow it down just, so we weren't rushing anything. Then we kind of
waited too long and needed to adjust the offense and try to get the defense
hammered in the screen. So once we got that we were free. We had to try to
find open man. I think we kind of panicked after it started getting low.  
MONICA ENGELMAN: Same thing. We kind of wanted to control the tempo a little
bit at the beginning. Then a couple of low situations and a couple of extra
plays, so from that we scrambled and tried to find a way to get good ball in
the hoop.  
  
Q. Monica, you really stepped up and took that leadership role today like
you had yesterday. What was driving your performance today?  
MONICA ENGELMAN: Just the opportunity for my teammates. We all talked about
coming in the game and being aggressive. I think I try to keep up with that
goal and expectations.  
  
Q. Melissa Jones is basically playing with one eye out there. What did you
think of her effort and what she did for them?  
COACH HENRICKSON: She's a tough kid. She's been a tough kid since she got
there. Didn't surprise me. I'd be surprised if she didn't bring to the table
what she brings.  
No excuses. She's a no-excuse kid. Leave-it-on-the-floor-every-night kid, it
speaks volumes to her character and the pride she plays with for herself and
her team.  
  
Q. Monica, can you talk a little bit about Griner's effect directly on
Carolyn? She seemed to settle for more jump shots today than I've seen her
take all year?  
MONICA ENGELMAN: At our place she struggles, gets one deep in the first half,
and then get two and quick shoots.  
So I told her you don't want to finish this and never try to challenge her
one-on-one. She's trying to go up and under. But if you get Griner deep, she's
not going to move. She's just going to wait for you to release it.  
I was trying to talk to her about a hook shot and get over the top of her, not
present the ball to her. But, when you play these guys and have a chance to
win, like in the game against Texas Tech. They score from the perimeter, small
scores from the perimeter and they're big scorer on the perimeter, Wickett,
scores and makes the three, then Mallard comes out and knocks down the shot.
Baylor struggled offensively and they shoot 20 -something percent from the
game. They go 3 for 27, so you know, they hurt themselves as well.  
But you'll have to make perimeter shots. And sometimes your bigs are going to
have to score from the perimeter because of how effective she is. So if she's
altering your shot, you have to make the extra pass. And that's a big, long
kid under the rim.  
  
Q. Given what happened the first time and the fact that it would have taken
a monumental effort to beat these guys today, can you just rate the
disappointment in the locker room?  
COACH HENRICKSON: Yeah, I will say it might have been more disappointment. The
result was the same, do you feel the same, no. I was embarrassed for her. I
mean, I get it. But thought we competed, but we made mistakes, and we both
made mistakes, and there's no doubt about that. It comes a point where you
have players that get us on the glass in the first half. It was a little
disappointment that we just shoot ourselves in the foot too many times in
league play that we're headed to the postseason tournament. Not being
disrespectful or not appreciative of that tournament and that field, but
that's going into the year, that's not our goal. But we'll huddle back up here
and be excited. And get on a run here in the postseason.  
Yeah, it's still disappointment. Don't misunderstand what I'm saying. But I
felt like we competed in night and day. I watched that thing late last night,
and it made me sick. I didn't sleep. We had no fight, we had nothing. We just
let it happen. The result was the same, but it felt different. I don't think
I'll feel different when I watch it on film.  
  
Q. You mentioned already that's not where you wanted to go, but this is four
in a row now. Are your kids disappointed? Does it drive you crazy?  
COACH HENRICKSON: Yeah, it drives us all crazy. But we're going to have to get
over that fast because in the NIT, those that don't want to play in it don't
last very long. There are a lot of teams that are excited about it. It might
be their first chance at postseason for whatever reason. And we have Krysten
that played in it, Aishah that played in it. Angel was on the bench for that
run we made. Krysten will tell you playing in Kansas in front of 16, 000
people for a championship was the highlight of her career.  
So we're a group, and by the time we get back together, this group is in a
good place to be able to make a run. Now we've got to catch our breath here
and get over the disappointment and we'll allow them a chance to do that. But
they're a competitive group. They play with a lot of pride. They want to hang
a banner in Allen and get this right. They want to keep playing. They want to
play in the other one.  
But it's not like they don't want to play. They'll play and compete with a lot
of individual pride and program pride in that tournament with no doubt,
absolutely no doubt.  
  
Q. Boogaard and Jackson both had some surprisingly impressive performances
today. What do you attribute that to?  
COACH HENRICKSON: Well, we played Carolyn and Krysten together. And we worked
on that walking through the hotel last night playing two bigs. Because we
wanted to be able to in taking the post -- Griner guarded Carolyn, so Krysten
got in low post touches against their fours and had some success there and hit
that high post jumper.  
Today we used the pick and pop. And the four's kind of sit and grind the lane.
So she's a perimeter face-up. She scores the very first play in the second
half. We go post to post back screen. She moves up the ball and Angel drives
it, and we throw the extra pass, because they'll disrupt and destroy your
offense pretty quick. So the answer to the low shot clock was when you get in
your primary look and secondary look and it's still not there, that's what
happens. You end up with a low clock. Then we were aggressive with the primary
stuff and it was late.  
So those two, Krysten ends up scoring the four. She doesn't have the Griner
match-up. So we play Carolyn high. Carolyn plays the four spot just to keep
her eye and try to get her in the lane. And on the face-up she hit some shots
in rhythm.

OKLAHOMA - 69

  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by Texas Tech Lady Raider Coach Kristy Curry
and her student-athletes. Coach, your thoughts about tonight's game?  
COACH CURRY: I'm just really proud of my team. I thought we came out and
competed. You had two very good basketball teams competing. It was a great
game, I'm sure, to watch. We're excited about our postseason. I'm so proud of
this team and what they've done to get to this point. We feel like we've got a
great opportunity in the NCAA Tournament.  
  
Q. Mo, what did you feel was the difference in the game in the end?  
MONIQUE SMALLS: Just executing and not turning over the ball.  
  
Q. What do you guys take away from this one? Obviously, you guys fought
right until the end. How do you feel about the way you played and what you've
got next?  
MONIQUE SMALLS: I feel like we should have executed better and not turned over
the ball and not rushed into the lane and slow down. But this is not the end.
We're still playing. We've got the NCAA Tournament, and that's what we're
looking forward to right now.  
  
Q. Talk about Mo slowing things down. Did you have those rallies when you
were slowing things down? Did you think you were playing your best offense?  
CASEY MORRIS: Yeah, I feel like we just let them run through us a little too
much. We talked about just playing our speed, and they dictated what speed we
played.  
  
Q. How tough is it to play a team twice as quick a time as you guys did?  
CASEY MORRIS: It's tough. But obviously we could have won. We just made some
mistakes that we shouldn't have made. But we still have more basketball to
play and that's what we're looking forward to.  
  
Q. Can you expand on running your offense and letting it come to you the way
you did in those spurts that you were successful there?  
COACH CURRY: I don't think it was a lack of effort. The kids at times were
maybe trying too hard or going a step too fast. But, again, we outrebound them
by four. We score three more field goals, and the basketball game was won at
the foul line, bottom line.  
  
Q. What did you draw up for that last play?  
COACH CURRY: We had to get in our four cross press break and wanted to get the
ball in to Mo or Chynna. And that was very similar to the Kansas State ending
where Chynna hit the runner and scored.  
Chynna has the ability to get her shot off. And regardless of what you think
there at the end, we weren't able to make a play or get a call. So not to
criticize anything, but the bottom line was, you know, I thought, good Luck.  
  
Q. I know you guys are projected for the tournament like an 8, 9 seed. How
do you feel about where you stand? What do you take away from this game going
forward?  
COACH CURRY: I think we put an exclamation point on last night. Obviously to
play a top 16, 17 team in Oklahoma, beat them a week earlier. The way we
finished the season and the wins that we have, we feel like we're better than
an 8 or 9 seed. I don't know how you could explain anything differently right
now.  
  
Q. You kind of talked about this sophomore class growing up this whole time.
How much does this add to that learning process?  
COACH CURRY: Well, that's a great question. That is one of the teaching points
I've made in there. We're going to be sitting in the same position a year from
now. We'll have one kid overseas that will be watching on the internet, and
there are 13 people in the locker room that can draw upon tonight and know
while we don't feel a little better.  
Again, I'm just -- we've matured so much and so much to look forward to. I
wanted them to know I wasn't disappointed in them, and that every step of the
way they've learned from their mistakes and learned from adversity and
persevered. That's what we've got to continue to do and grow from every
experience.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

TEXAS TECH  71  
OKLAHOMA - 69

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by the Sooners of Oklahoma, and Coach Sherri
Coale. And we have several student-athletes up here. Coach, we'll ask you to
make an opening comment briefly, and then we'll take questions for the
student-athletes.  
COACH COALE: We feel very fortunate. I thought our kids played really, really
hard. Not necessarily very well, but really hard. And made enough plays down
the stretch to win the game.  
I thought there were a few late where we tried to hand it to them, and they
said no, you keep it. And we said no, here. And nobody really wanted to win.
Probably a sign of two teams wanting to win so badly they got in their own
way. I think the job Kristy Curry has done with her squad has been
extraordinary. They're playing with great confidence. They know what their
strengths are. They play toward them. They're tough on the interior. They're
very, very good basketball team. And she's got them playing exactly the right
way at exactly the right time. So we feel very fortunate.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Carlee, what got into you tonight?  
CARLEE ROETHLISBERGER: I don't know. It was just fun out there. Everybody was
playing hard. When everybody was playing hard you get good shots.  
  
Q. (Indiscernible)?  
CARLEE ROETHLISBERGER: It felt good. Honestly I was out there with two minutes
left and I look up, and I was like oh, I have 18 points. I had no idea. Like I
said, everybody was just working hard and that's when it's fun and people make
things happen?  
  
Q. For Whitney, can you talk about that last play?  
WHITNEY HAND: All right. I'll reenact it for you guys, because I went up to
pressure the ball, and she said, "No, no. You get back, because I'm not very
quick." And they passed it in and she took off like 100 miles an hour, and
took off and put my hands up like Jesus, please. And it started falling, and
Jas was there, thank goodness. That's about it.  
  
Q. Danielle, this is a repeat of last year's championship match that you're
going to have in the semifinal against A &M. This is always a battle between
you guys. Can you just talk about the third time meeting them this season?   
DANIELLE ROBINSON: Yeah, we think A&M is a great team. They run their system
extremely well, and they pressure the ball extremely well. They played really
well this season against us. So we're coming into the game with some momentum
and so are they. So it's definitely going to be a good match.  
  
Q. Whitney, I'm the one that demanded you come in here. Can you just -- last
year we saw you here coaching. Can you talk about what it means to be back
playing and just talk about your ordeal over the past year and a half?  
WHITNEY HAND: Yeah, last year was -- I mean all I remember is A.T. getting
every rebound in the world. That was kind of my mindset today. I know we had 8
to her 18. I'm so thankful to be playing, especially with these girls the last
year. They're my best friends. I'm going to cry.  
But it's an honor to be here. And I think I forget that sometimes. In the
first half I was in my way. And Lindsey Cloman's injured right now and she's
like, hey, you get to play; and Coach was like make a difference, you know.  
So it's just that perspective, and I think if I told you my journey, it would
be an hour-long.  
That's kind of what I came from, and it's a blessing to be here playing on the
same floor with these girls.  
  
Q. Clearly you're not 100%. How were you successful?  
DANIELLE ROBINSON: By throwing my hands up and saying, Jesus, please.  
  
Q. Danielle, can you talk about what Whitney meant coming back this year
even though it's been a half year?  
DANIELLE ROBINSON: It's been real, real special having Whitney back. We were
kind of anxious and really wanted her back last year, but we knew it couldn't
happen. Just in her eyes she's seeing things that we haven't seen. And that's
why she's so great on the floor right now.  
She still can relay that information to us. Just her presence, I mean, she's
not 100%, but you have eight boards, that's remarkable. Just her presence is
what we really miss, and we're glad to have her back.  
  
Q. Nicole, you had a big night on the boards with 11, and that's obviously
going to be a big key against A &M. Can you talk about how important it is,
because they rebound so well from a lot of different positions on the floor?  
NICOLE GRIFFIN: Like we always say, rebounds give life, especially offensive
rebounds. It's just something that I can bring to the team. That's one of my
jobs. So it's going to be a big factor against A&M. So I just have to continue
doing that.  
  
Q. A &M got you guys twice this year. Talk about what you need to do
different this time? What has to change for you guys?   
DANIELLE ROBINSON: I think we need to do what we did the first time, and that
is to compete on every possession. I think they outtoughed us down at College
Station, and we know what it feels like to be right there with them. We're
just going to have to go into the game with some momentum and know what we're
capable of doing.  
  
Q. Carlee, can you just talk about -- I know you've worked so hard this
year, but there have been some real ups and downs in the last month or so. How
have you been able to maintain a positive outlook when you go through some
valleys in the Big 12 like the way you guys have?  
CARLEE ROETHLISBERGER: It's funny with the people on our team, we're still a
young team. We still have a lot to learn. I think that every day we get better
every day we grow. Even if we trip and fall, we get back up, and we proved
that. We've made it to where we win one, lose one.  
But eventually we'll get on a streak. We're going to go in to the end of the
season, and there is no better time than now.  
  
Q. Will you fill out my story on Whitney? Just kind of talk about what you
saw when she got hurt and how she helped you even when she couldn't play, and
how she's helping you even as limited as she is?  
COACH COALE: We run out of adjectives when we talk about her. We truly do.
She's one of the toughest competitors and toughest kids you'll ever meet.
There's been no sympathy. She doesn't look for outs. She doesn't whine. She
doesn't complain. None of us has any idea how much pain she's actually
enduring, but I can guarantee you, it's quite a bit.  
She's half, maybe 60% might be a stretch in terms of her physical well being,
yet she's impacting the game with eight rebounds and I don't know, 7 assists.
I think that the really important part of that, that people don't understand,
maybe nobody can really understand except competitive athletes who have been
injured, is how hard it is to still contribute knowing what you used to do or
what you are capable of doing but can't do now. It's not just a physical
limitation, it becomes a mental limitation. And Whitney has been tough enough
to fight through that and decide you know what, I can't do what I used to do.
But I can do something, and I've got to do that something as well as I can.  
You can tell. I can't take her out of the game. If she comes out of the game
for a few minutes, everything goes nuts. So I have to get her back on the
floor playing on one leg. She's just a special, special kid. And I don't have
words to describe her.  
  
Q. Once she starts playing she's playing 37 minutes, 40, 44, I mean it's
incredible you're getting those kind of minutes from her.  
COACH COALE: Because she's a presence kid. She's making shots. When she's on
the floor in uniform the other guys believe we can win. It's huge.  
  
Q. Coach, you can kind of tell it was Carlee's night when she was dribbling
towards the rim. Kind of lost the ball and ended up being an assist because
Griffin gets the ball, it goes in. Carlee smiles and it's kind of her night.  
COACH COALE: She's been playing very well of late though. She had a great
Senior Night game against Oklahoma State. She was really good against Baylor,
really good against Baylor the game before that.  
So it's sort of a senior who is using the accumulation of time to her
advantage.  
  
Q. So were you with Whitney there at the end just throwing up your arms and
saying Jesus, please?  
COACH COALE: I think I had gone to giggling by then. Really, seriously. We
have every chance to put the game away, and we just were not able to. Then
Vegas gets that steal and you think, okay, here it is, finally. The whole time
I kept thinking these kids just need something good to happen to them. They
tried so hard, they worked so hard. They're believers. They keep showing up,
all this great stuff. And Tech nails a tough three. And you're thinking can't
one good thing happen to these kids, please? And then Vegas gets the
deflection, I was like thank you. She misses the lay-up. I don't know. I don't
know. Maybe finally something good happened right at the end.  
  
Q. I asked Danielle what has to change this time when you play A &M?
Anything different than what she said?   
COACH COALE: They're awfully good. They can score it every single possession.
I don't know how you guard Danielle Adams. I don't have any idea. She's a
conundrum. She's so big inside and so strong. If you put a guard on her, she's
going to take you right there. If you put a big on her, she's going to step
out and shoot threes. If you get her in foul trouble, she's just a nightmare
to guard. I think Sidney Colson is their heart and soul. She makes plays. I am
so ready for her to graduate. Just makes play after play. They're so deep.
They keep coming at you and bring Gilbert in. They have that size at the post.
Defensively they're sound and solid and they wreak havoc with what you do and
they rebound. They're just really, really good.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

KANSAS STATE  56  
IOWA STATE - 53

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by the Kansas State Wildcats. Coach Deb Patterson,
her student-athlete's Jalana Childs and Brittany Chambers. Coach, your
thoughts about this afternoon's game?  
COACH PATTERSON: Well, another classic, gritty possession by possession, Big
12 women's basketball game. I know we beat a great team today and a great
program. So it's a special moment for us.  
I really, again, can't say enough positive things about the performance and
the toughness that we got out of our basketball team, and the step-up plays,
in particular, that we got from Brittany and once again Jalana who was
visually, I think you could see she was limping a lot today with that hip
flexor. Just still brought great courage. Wanting to go back in and out of the
game, and just a great win for our program.  
It wasn't a pretty basketball game on the offensive end for us, certainly in
the second half, but I thought our defense was really difference making in
this game.  
  
Q. Brittany, you guys had lost twice during the regular season. Did you come
in with an enough-is-enough attitude in this game?  
BRITTANY CHAMBERS: Very much so. They were both very close games and in both
games -- hat's off to Iowa State. They played their butts off. We thought we
could bring a little bit more. Especially since they played last night, we
really wanted to go at them. Yeah, it was time. It was definitely time.  
  
Q. The same thing as the previous question, but what do you think was the
difference in winning this close game versus losing two close games to Iowa
State in the regular season?  
JALANA CHILDS: The fact that we lost doesn't settle well with us in the past
two games with them. So we definitely wanted to come out with a different
mentality. That's to fight hard from start to finish. We may not have come
with that mentality in the past two games that we've played them, and I think
that was definitely a difference in us, and we didn't want to lose again.  
  
Q. Just how bad was the hip bugging you, and how much do you feel like it
limited you in the last 13 minutes of the game?  
JALANA CHILDS: It was -- there was a time when Poppens drove on me and I just
stretched it too far. It just got really sore. I knew I could move as much as
I wanted to. But I wasn't going to stop. I know you saw the tears, it was
painful, but I wasn't going to stop.  
  
Q. If you can answer, then Brittany, just your thoughts on going against
Baylor? It's obviously a very different type of team than Iowa State. You've
only faced them once as opposed to facing Iowa State twice. If you could both
talk about that, because you are playing better in the last week of the
season?  
JALANA CHILDS: It's definitely just a big challenge for us. We don't want to
come out with how we did the first time we played them. I don't think we're
going to -- I don't think there is anything we'll focus on differently. I
think we have been playing well, and I like that about us. I want us to keep
that mentality that we came with today in the past two games. They're a tough
team, and everyone knows that; so we want to come out strong and hard and not
relent.  
BRITTANY CHAMBERS: Yeah, Baylor's a great team. The first time we didn't come
out with the fight that we usually show in most games. That is the reason we
were 10 seconds and 1 in 12 tonight is because of our fight. I think against a
team like Baylor, you have to give it your all. I mean, not let them -- like
not back down to them. They're a team you can't back down to.  
  
Q. Could you talk about you had that little run where you got the friendly
bounce on that one, and you had like three baskets in a four-minute span. Did
that make the pain go away?  
JALANA CHILDS: Well, I was just focused, very focused this game. There wasn't
-- I didn't really get off to a fast start like I usually do, and that's
because I didn't care what I was going to score today. I was trying to
distribute the ball. I got some looks into Britt and looks into Mariah. And
that's what I like about us.  
When I'm getting double teamed, someone's open so I was going to throw it. I
wasn't really focused on me. I just let the game come to me, and I think I did
a great job at it today.  
  
Q. You outscored them 36-18 in the paint. Was that a point of emphasis you
guys had coming in?  
JALANA CHILDS: We always emphasize on points in paint. It was no different
than any other game. Good numbers, I guess, so that's a good number for us.  
  
Q. I wasn't sure who had Bolte in that last shot. What was it like watching
those last two three pointers go up after you guys had led so long?  
JALANA CHILDS: When I saw Bolte running, I didn't care what was going to
happen to me. I heard their bench calling foul. I didn't foul. My hands were
straight up. I made sure that I was in her face. I hobbled out there, but I
got to her. When those two threes on No. 5, and then I think No. 10 got a
three off those were definitely daggers to the heart.  
  
Q. You said you saw Bolte running, what went through your mind as far as
going out and covering her instead of staying inside?  
JALANA CHILDS: No one's going to guard her, so I have to. Taelor got screened
first, then Brandy got screened, so I just ran out there to her and made sure
she didn't get a good look. So it was a good shot. Thank God she didn't make
it.  
  
Q. Can you talk about just what Brittany means to the team? She's got 83
three pointers, and that's fifth all time in the season at K-State. It's
pretty staggering. Also, Brittany, does it feel like it's been that many? What
kind of ride has this been like for you this season?  
JALANA CHILDS: Well, Brittany's definitely our most productive player. We need
her on the court like she was today. I think we've grown a lot, and she's
grown a lot as our point guard this season and over the past two years. It's
been awesome to see. Some people may not understand looking from the outside
what goes on, but she's grown so much and we are definitely proud of her.
She's distributing the ball well. She's scoring well; and her 83 threes are
awesome. I want to be like her one day.  
BRITTANY CHAMBERS: I don't think it feels like that, no. I guess Coach has
given me the green light this year. She gave it to me last year. So I take
open shots. And my team does an unbelievable job of screening. For as much as
they face guard, for me to get up as many threes as I got is a tribute to my
team and how much they screen and get me open. So hat's off to them. Yeah, I
just take them when I'm open, I guess.  
  
Q. The players described what the defense looked like on that last three-
pointer that Bolte took. How far from what you envisioned that play looking
like did it end up happening?  
COACH PATTERSON: Well, it was such a scramble play. We saw, or I saw Bolte
break and open. It seemed when you're watching it from our angle, it seemed
like she was open for like ten seconds. Then Jalana just out of the scramble,
everyone understood over the course of the game how we wanted to defend. So
they knew that it didn't matter who was guarding Kelsey, somebody needed to;
and Jalana just did a such a tremendous job of identifying out of the
scramble, which is not easy to do. It's not easy to do for a post to
instinctively run to that shot, especially after the kind of chaos of the
previous two possessions.  
When I saw Jalana there, honestly, I felt really relieved once she got there
because of her length and her size, because Bolte can shoot over just about
anybody else and would be great at drawing contact. But Jalana pretty much had
her -- Jalana's size made Bolte really up right. And Bolte knew the two wasn't
going to help her.  
So both of those things played perfectly into our hands out of the scramble.
You could not imagine drawing it up that way.  
  
Q. Number 300, how's that sound?  
COACH PATTERSON: Well, it's a great feeling to know most of all that we won
this game today. The 300 to me is just a reflection of all the people that
have been a part of Kansas State's women's basketball staff and teams during
the course of those 300 wins.  
So to me, I don't take notice of it aside from when someone is says it. To me
it's all about today and this victory, and that's what feels great.  
  
Q. Do you feel any closer to Wichita right now getting this win?  
COACH PATTERSON: Well, I feel as though we're definitely a tournament caliber
team. And hopefully the committee will see things that way, and I feel very
confident about our chances to be in the tournament.  
  
Q. Finally, what about Friday?  
COACH PATTERSON: Any time you're lining up against one of the premier players
in the league and one of the premier programs and teams, you look at it and go
this is a tremendous challenge. I think we'll look at it relative to how we
measure ourselves the last time we competed against Baylor or played Baylor. I
didn't feel as though we competed at all. I think we were there. But I don't
think we competed.  
We look at this next opportunity to play like an opportunity to compete
against that team. Then just see where it takes us. We know they're a great
team. Great program, great players, but that's what Big 12 basketball's all
about at this point.  
For me as the player's said, it's just about the fight and the competitiveness
that we work to bring to the floor, then the game will take care of itself.  
  
Q. The adjustments or the things that you had to do differently when Jalana
reaggravated the injury?  
COACH PATTERSON: Well, I think really for us, our players were prepared.
Chantay Caron again came in and played great minutes for us. Not necessarily
on the offensive end in terms of production, but defensively she was very
accountable. Brandy Brown was tremendous again. She he goes so unnoticed for
how she helps us win.  
So really there weren't any major adjustments that we made. It really was
difficult for us on the offensive end which was evident to everyone, I think,
down the stretch from those last eight minutes on.  
Some of that I think I could have relieved with timeouts, but against Iowa
State, I just felt so strongly that this game would come down to the last 30
seconds or minute. So our players made all the adjustments just by virtue of
coming in and doing what it is they do. Nothing special.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

KANSAS STATE  56  
IOWA STATE - 53

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Coach Bill Fennelly of the Iowa State Cyclones
and Hallie Christofferson and Kelsey Bolte. Coach, your thoughts about this
afternoon's game?  
COACH FENNELLY: First of all, I want to thank everyone in the Big 12. This was
a great event. An honor to be a part of it. It was exciting. The game itself
was typical Iowa State-Kansas State. Close, low-scoring, hard-fought, right
down to the wire. They made a couple more plays than we did. Unlike the first
two times we played, maybe it was our turn to make the plays, but they did
tonight. So congratulations to them.  
I'm proud of the effort of our team and how hard we played down the stretch to
get down like we did against a team like that and have two looks at the basket
to tie the game was great. But they outplayed us in certain areas today, and
they deserve to win the game.  
  
Q. Kelsey, Kansas State said you guys did a really good job of setting
screens to get you open for that last shot. They had a scramble on the post to
come out on you. Did you ever feel like you had a ray of a look? What was the
last possession like as far as trying to get the shot off?  
KELSEY BOLTE: Yeah, I had a pretty good look at it, but she's a pretty big
girl so it's hard to shoot around her. But probably the best look I could have
had, I guess.  
  
Q. You had a frustrating day. Was it just the inability to get the ball?
What made it so tough for you today?  
KELSEY BOLTE: Yeah, they played good defense on me. Most of my shots were
contested. I missed a lot of shots that I usually make. So they had good
defense, they disrupted me a little bit. So they did a good job.  
  
Q. What did you feel was different between this game and the first two times
you played K-State?  
KELSEY BOLTE: Well, I think Chambers did a really good job of taking it to the
basket. I think she got a couple of and ones on us. We did a good job of
trying to go around the screen, we hedged out a little bit, but she did a
great job. We did a good job on Childs as well. Tried to force her a little
bit, but couldn't get enough stops. We just couldn't do it defensively.  
  
Q. What was this game like as a freshman? The team was down by 13 and you
scored 8 straight to help get them back.  
HALLIE CHRISTOFFERSON: I just try to stay calm, and take what the defense
gives us, and we have to take open shots.  
  
Q. Hallie, what was it about their offense that allowed them to get so many
points in the paint against you guys?  
HALLIE CHRISTOFFERSON: Well, we knew that we had to keep Childs in the paint.
Just they're very physical in there, and that's what any Big 12 team's like.
Just their physicality, probably.  
  
Q. Hallie, you scored 8 straight. You were down 13 and got it to eight
straight and Lauren hits the three pointer to get it to five. At that point
are you feeling like momentum's on your side? How much do you think things can
change emotionally for your team at that point?  
HALLIE CHRISTOFFERSON: Yeah, definitely. We had a nice run there at the end.
And that's what obviously teams like to come back. We had the momentum, and
the crowd was definitely in it. We just had to get more defensive stops and we
lacked in that area.  
  
Q. Kelsey, Brittany Chambers, did she play differently than she did the
first two tiles you were playing or was it just guarding mistakes on defense
for you guys?  
KELSEY BOLTE: I don't think she played any different. She dribbled the ball a
lot, dribbled around, trying to create a lot for herself. She was just able to
do that really well today. She did a great job.  
I think we tried to defend her as well as we could, but like I said, she
dribbles the ball a lot and tried to create a lot for herself. She did a good
job.  
  
Q. The first two games were very hard fought against Kansas State as well.
What would you say is the difference in making the edge go their way this
time?  
COACH FENNELLY: I think early we missed some shots that I think we need to
make. We got really hurt inside. Our post play besides Hallie wasn't very
good. And I think you extend so much effort chasing her off the three point
shot, especially Brittany Chambers that they dribble drive to the basket. They
did a little better job of that. Getting the ball in the lane off the bounce.
We rotate it a little bit late.  
But it's a typical game with them. All three games were eerily the same. We
just won two out of three. But the scores are the same. The game's are the
same. Somebody makes a couple of shots. We had two really good looks at the
end of the game after being down 13. Our kids played hard.  
But that's how these games go with them. They're very well-coached. They're
well-prepared. They're hard to score on. We knew that. It was difficult for us
to get some looks at the basket. Had some turnovers at bad times, but that's
Big 12 basketball.  
  
Q. Could you assess where this puts your NCAA Tournament chances, this
loss?  
COACH FENNELLY: I don't know. I'm not on the committee. I think if you look at
our numbers, we probably are a team that should be considered. I think several
of the teams that played to be are in the NCAA Tournament. But they're not
going to call me and ask me.  
But I honestly believe that. If you look at the strength of our league and the
strength of our teams and what they've done all year long, I would be
disappointed if the Big 12 doesn't get seven teams in the NCAA Tournament. I
think we've earned that.  
All we can do is we're 22-10, the numbers are there, and whatever they decide.
I've never been -- which I probably should. I grew up in a political family.
But I've never been someone to politic in front of the committee. I don't
think that's my job. I think we've done what we can do now, and we'll wait
until next Monday, and hopefully our name will come up. If not, we didn't do
enough.  
  
Q. Talk about Hallie. I know she hasn't played as much in the last couple
games, but it seemed like when you needed her in the second half, she was
trying to will your team back?  
COACH FENNELLY: I think Hallie's struggled a little bit offensively. She might
have hit the freshman wall a little bit. But when you see a kid in this
environment as a freshman literally bring our team back almost single-
handedly, that says a lot about her. She is a very calm person approximate.
She doesn't get too rattled.  
But she's a phenomenal kid. She deserved to be on the Big 12 freshman team.
She played much bigger than that, and certainly hit some big shots and gave
our kids some energy. She was certainly our best post player today.  
  
Q. I wondered if you could talk for a moment on about the atmosphere out
there? You had a couple of teams with really terrific fan support it looked
like. It was just a fun atmosphere.  
COACH FENNELLY: It really was. Both teams have a great core fan base. I think
they enjoy this kind of game. They know it's going to be a competitive game.
Two teams that I think do things the right way, and represent the league and
represent their schools in a very, very positive way. I think they appreciate
the effort of the kids.  
I think they appreciate the kinds of things that they do on the court, off the
court, the way they carry themselves. It was a great environment to play in.
That is what these tournaments are all about.  
It was a great day. Obviously the result wasn't what we wanted, but the
environment's very special here. Every time we play K-State, it's that way,
home, away or neutral, so a great environment. Certainly appreciate the fans
and the way they do things.  
  
Q. I'd ask Kelsey to start with about Childs coming out on her when you guys
worked to get her open. How rare or how tough is it for a post player to get
out there on the three-point line shot like that?  
COACH FENNELLY: It's tough. You've got to have someone who is committed to
doing it. She made a good play. It's tough when you're out of timeouts. Our
kids ran the play pretty well. It wasn't a wide open shot, but Kelsey had a
look at it. You know, the shot that Chas had right before that couldn't have
been more wide open.  
So when you're down 13 with 7 to go and you have two looks at the basket to
tie the game, you have to feel good about it. It was a tough shot, but she got
her shoulders by the kid. But it was really good defense that made it, instead
of a wide open shot -- really as the play was developing she looked to me like
she was going to be wide open.  
But Childs made a great defensive play that made it hard on Kelsey to get a
shot off. To Kelsey's credit, she tried to get one up there. It was a good
look. It didn't go in but that's part of the game.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Goestenkors from the Longhorns is now with us with her
two student-athletes, Kathleen Nash and Yvonne Anderson. Coach, your thoughts
about this evening's game?  
COACH GOESTENKORS: Just really disappointed. I give A&M credit. Their
defensive intensity and pressure was really, really good. Some of the best --
well, it is the best that I've seen all year. They were ready to play in
passing lanes and they got us back on our heals. They've done that
consistently through most of the game that's we've played.  
So credit to them and their defensive effort. But for us, just very
disappointed with the way we handled the pressure. I didn't feel like we
played with a lot of poise. Obviously, 31 turnovers, you've got to do the
little things well to be successful, and we didn't do that.  
All the turnovers, and the pressure, we just couldn't defend. When they turn
it over up top, there is no defense. They got a lot of just breakout lay-ups,
so overall just really disappointed with our lack of valuing the basketball.  
  
Q. You guys are a fairly veteran team with veteran guards. What do they do
to force so many turnovers that's better than what other teams do?  
YVONNE ANDERSON: I think for us it was more just us making mistakes, allowing
the pressure to kind of mess with us in a way we were throwing the ball to
them.  
They had a couple of those, and that's what their team's big on is that
pressure defense. A lot of the times there were charges, they were throwing
the ball to where no one was, throwing the ball to the other team. I think we
just let them get in our heads tonight, and we didn't execute the way we
wanted it to.  
  
Q. You talked yesterday about how you really wanted this for your last game
against them. Where's the frustration level for you with the way you all
played and this being your last game with A &M?  
KATHLEEN NASH: It's frustrating. We've gotten close the last time we played
them. This time we didn't fight back in the second half. It was pretty much
the same first half, last game to this game. But the difference was the second
half. We didn't come out and fight back.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the three-point defense in the second half? You were
really able to exploit them. What was different this time about their three-
point defense?  
KATHLEEN NASH: I felt like most of the three-pointers I took were pretty
rushed, pretty contested more than usual. There were a few that were just wide
open. But most of them had to be pretty quick, because they were getting out
on me.  
  
Q. You said you were disappointed, but are you surprised? You've got some
guards who had played, even freshmen at the end of the year?  
COACH GOESTENKORS: Disappointed and surprised. We're a much better ball
handling team than what we showed this evening. Like I said, I give A&M
credit, but at the same time I don't know when I've had a team with 31
turnovers. So we're a much better team than what we showed tonight.  
It just seemed to snow ball. They got us back on our hands early ask got some
easy run outs. We didn't really recover and gain our poise. When you've got a
junior back court you expect them to take care of the ball and run your sets
and give the them confidence. But when they got a little shaken, I think
everybody else did as well.  
  
Q. Yvonne got into foul trouble early, and I guess you were upset with the
third foul she got, taking a charge at mid court. I don't know how you explain
that. But also, were you playing in the zone because Yvonne didn't have as
many minutes as usual, and just trying to stop the penetration?  
COACH GOESTENKORS: Absolutely. We've had success with them in the zone the
last game. And K-State just played them in the zone and beat them. So I
thought they weren't as effective against the zone as they were on man-to-man.  
So we need to try to protect Yvonne, but at the same time we knew the zone
would get to us the last time. So we were hoping for the same result. I
thought they were well prepared for the zone as well as the man-to-man. They
picked us apart on offense.  
But a lot of it was transition lay-ups. It wasn't even our quarter court
defense, it was the fact that we had no defense. Like I said, when you get a
steal at half court, it's pretty easy to go down and make a lay-up.  
  
Q. I know you've got a good RPI and you're in a great league. Any fear that
committee members will see this particular score at this time and have second
thoughts maybe?  
COACH GOESTENKORS: I don't think so. A&M's ranked highly for a reason. They've
beaten a lot of teams badly, and I hate to be one of them. I know her strength
of schedule is around 10, and it will go up after this game again, even though
it was a tough loss because they are highly ranked. So it's been a tough
schedule for us.  
I feel like we're in, but we've got some work to do if we want to make any
noise while we're there.  
  
Q. After the game yesterday, everybody seemed so confident. You talked about
sustaining things for 40 minutes. Do you worry about what this does to the
confidence after this?  
COACH GOESTENKORS: I would if we had a game in the next day or two. But
because we've got some time, I told the players we're going to boot camp.
They're going to take a couple of days off, and then we'll be on spring break
next week. So, sad for them, but glad for me. Two days, we're going back to
boot camp and we've got to work on the basics of basketball, passing, ball
handling, the little things. Against great teams we have to do the little
things well, and we did not.  
We didn't hit free throws. We didn't set good screens. We didn't make good
passes. So it's good for us, actually, that we have this break where we can
just really break things down and get back to basics. I think we will gain
confidence through that.  
  
Q. I know Baylor and A &M are going to be 1 and 2 seeds. I know you hope to
get in and win it yourself. But would you think their chances of winning it
all this year are pretty good?   
COACH GOESTENKORS: I think they're both pretty good. I think it's going to
depend on, as always, it will depend on match-ups. But they're both very, very
unique. That is a great thing when you get into the tournament. Baylor is
unique because of Brittany Griner. Nobody gets to practice against that,
nobody can prepare for that.  
I think A&M is very unique because Danielle Adams is such a unique player as
well, because she's so big and strong, but she can shoot the three.  
Their defense, you know, in the NCAA Tournament so many times you're a little
nervous so sometimes your shots aren't falling offensively. It's the team
that's play great defense and can rely on that defense to get them through
those cold shooting times that are successful.  
So because of those two reasons, I think they've both got a great shot of
getting to the Final Four.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

TEXAS A&M  77  
TEXAS - 50

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Texas A&M Aggie's Coach Gary Blair. We have
three student-athletes, Danielle Adams, Sydney Colson, and Tyra White. Coach,
opening comments and then questions from our players.  
COACH BLAIR: That was the best defensive game we've played in a long time, and
the energy was there. We had great point guard play in transition, and really
on half court offense.  
But most of the first half we were just simply in a transition game. We had in
the mist about five lay-ups it might have been over by the half. But we made a
couple of bad decisions. Colson is the only one allowed to make the behind the
back pass. That will be a rule that we'll put in.  
But pleased with our team. We said we have to have a balanced score. We cannot
just rely on Danielle. We almost had all five of them in double figures. Elonu
did a lot of nice things in there for us, and it goes unnoticed.  
Tyra is a scoring machine, but we didn't need her shots. If they would have
played us more man-to-man, we would have been going to Tyra a whole lot. But
they were mixing up their defenses. Doing a good job.  
What we did on Fussell and Nash, I thought that was the key to the ballgame.
Fussell and Nash, and we took charges. That's Aggie defense. That's Coach
Schaefer defense. And he's the best at teaching it, and our kids might be the
best at executing it. I'm very proud, and I've got 58 seconds and I'm out of
here.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach Blair. Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Sydney, why are you so good at forcing them into turnovers?  
SYDNEY COLSON: I think just like any other team we play, we like to come in
and come out with a lot of aggression on defense. Just doing things that we
wanted to correct the mistakes we made in the second half when we played them
in Austin. They came out and scored 48 against us. We knew we had to come out
and keep up the intensity we had the first half.  
Our posts did an excellent job hedging on ball screens for us. We did an
excellent job being in the held defense and charges. Our guards were getting
out and denying passes on the wings.  
When we're playing like that, it really helps us convert in fast breakpoints
and I couldn't be more pleased in the way we played today defensively.  
  
Q. Can you elaborate more in the three-point defense? They really hurt you
in the second half down in Austin. What did you gals do differently on three-
point defense tonight?  
SYDNEY COLSON: Just basically seeing who the shooters are. When we played them
in Austin, they were getting down, mocking down their shots. We weren't doing
a good job of getting back first awful. We weren't doing a good job of finding
our man. First thing we needed to do was stop the ball in transition, and find
our shooters.  
We didn't do that well in Austin. But I think we came out here focused and
everybody did what they needed to do and we executed our defensive scheme.  
  
Q. Danielle, and then Sydney, the loss at Kansas State was so out of
character the way you guys played. But in some ways was there a silver lining
in that that you sort of maybe, I don't want to say woke you up, but the way
you played tonight was a response to how you had played them?  
DANIELLE ADAMS: We talked about it. We all agreed that we needed that loss. We
went out and played our hearts out. But as a team we knew we needed that and
we just looked past it and looked for it in this game in the tournament. It
was a great fight tonight, but it was a great loss at that.  
SYDNEY COLSON: I think in that game it had been coming for a while, I think.
We had been playing a lot of teams closely even at home. They weren't coming
out with the intensity we played with early in the season, and early in
conference.  
We had some close games, like seven-point games at home. We just weren't doing
a lot of things correctly. We were out of character, I think. They came out
ask took advantage of us not playing well. We looked like we didn't take the
game as seriously as we should have. Their point guard had an excellent game
and other people stepped up for them.  
I think it woke us up in a sense. I think that it helped us get our minds on
what matters and knowing that we need to come out and play hard every game no
matter who is in front of us. I think that we responded on Senior Night when
we played Nebraska, and we responded today.  
  
Q. Danielle then Tyra, you won a tournament here last year. Is it a little
bit different field tonight out there coming back home? Can you talk about
coming back home for the second tournament in a row?  
DANIELLE ADAMS: No, it's not a different feeling. We just have a better team
this year. We're playing more aggressive on defense and just trying to repeat
our tournament championship. But it's no different than last year or any other
year that we've been in Kansas City. We're just looking forward to playing
each game game by game instead of just looking forward to the tournament
championship. But it's no different at all.  
TYRA WHITE: Going along with what Danielle said, there is really no difference
playing here or College Station or playing in Austin. We just want to come out
every game and force turnovers. I think we did that a lot and cut down our
turnovers too.  
Besides our family being here, it's just another game for us.  
  
Q. Sydney, 11 in a row against the Longhorns. Could you speak to that?  
SYDNEY COLSON: I think it's a big deal when you have that streak going against
anybody. We came out here and we were in Austin saying it was a big deal for
our program to go out and get ten wins in a row against any problem.  
But today, Coach said I didn't think we'd see it again, but I'm asking you for
the 11th one. We came out and fought hard like any other team. It happened to
be against Texas. I'm just I'm just proud of the fight no matter what.  
  
Q. Could you talk about Adams? You're trying to get the ball down to her
early because she had stepped out with two threes. Half her points early was
the three. Could you talk about her game tonight?  
COACH BLAIR: I thought she was solid. They were double teaming her a lot.
Sometimes she was giving it up. We got the easy pass underneath, and she was
very unselfish. Yeah, she had some turnovers and Carter had some turnovers,
and Colson had some turnovers. We'd like to do better, but Adams is going to
take what the defense is going to give you.  
I really emphasized and talked about how well Baylor played today without
Griner having to get 30. And the four-point Destiny Williams went off. That's
what we want from our team. Let them spend a lot of attention on Adams. Then
you have a little White, a little Gilbert coming off the bench and Colson is
starting to find the seams of the defense.  
That is the key right now is Colson, not Adams, but Colson is playing more
under control and attacking the basket.  
  
Q. What is the key to Chassidy Fussell holding her to eight points and
really scoreless. The 3:55 Mark was the first point?  
COACH BLAIR: I think the last two times we played her -- in the first game at
our place she had 17 in the half. It looked like the second coming of Steve
Nash. But all of a sudden, we paid more attention to her. We're not coming off
the shooters. When Fontenette or Anderson penetrates and goes to the basket,
we're not going to come off the shooters. We'll take the charges, which we
took six of them tonight, three by Adams.  
But we're not going to come off of Nash. I think two times we came off Nash
and she missed open shots. We've been very fortunate because that was the key.
We knew they hit the drivers in Anderson, and Fontenette.  
But we wanted to stop Fussell and Nash. And that is the key. Fussell's a very,
very good player.  
  
Q. Sydney said 11 in a row is good against anybody. Does it mean anymore to
you because it's the rivalry of the school?  
COACH BLAIR: It's supposed to. I'm not a born Aggie. I'm an Aggie now. In any
sport, you compete. We've got marriages. They get along. We get along. Gail
and I are good friends. Right now we just happen to have their number, and
Baylor sort of has our number right now. We need to change that up.  
You give me a couple of wins against them, I'll give you a couple Texas wins.
Well, maybe not. But that's what I want to do. I just want to play hard. Our
goal was to come in and get better. Survive and advance, but get better today.  
Like I said, this was the best defensive game we've played in a long time. And
they're a transition game. All you have to do is write the story, 44 in the
paint, 37-9 off turnovers. 13 -9. 18-0 against a fast-breaking team. Their
bench scored more, and I'd like to give a lot of credit to Hartung, she came
in and forced her way around.  
So did -- where's my other girl? Bass. I thought Bass had a whole lot of
energy. I think she's going to be a fine player for them at the three
position. But give those two credit. Look what we did against their starters,
but give those two credit for energizing that team with the very short bench
that they have right now.  
  
Q. What would you say your group learned from the Kansas State loss?  
COACH BLAIR: Childs went out 35 seconds into the game. You're losing 17
points, and all of a sudden sometimes that's just life on the road. We're
going to have to go to Manhattan every year now. That really excites me. Then
going to Ames every year, that's even worse. Give your opponent credit. We
woke up Kansas State, and now they're in the NCAA Tournament playing very
well. I hope like heck that shut Baylor down a little. Right now Baylor's
playing well.  
But give Deb Patterson, she's one of the most underrated coaches in the
country, and nobody gives her a enough credit. Everybody talks about a lot of
others, including myself, but they need to talk about Patterson and what she's
done over the years. You know she's had eight WNBA players? Eight. And most of
them have been shooters.  
So they do something in Kansas. They know how to shoot the ball and I'd like
to have a couple of those.  
  
Q. A lot of people think Texas is in even though they were 7-9 and only won
one game here. I know you talked about them when you were in Austin. Is it
enough just to play a great schedule since they don't have a great signature
win?  
COACH BLAIR: That's a hard question because I'm going to speak for Texas and
our league. We need seven teams in. A lot of teams across BCS conferences have
bottoms of the league, particularly the Big East. You're going to go 6-0
against the bottom of that league. All you have to do is split and they're
going to get ten teams in.  
Do you think Texas does not deserve to get in over Syracuse or St. John's or
some of these other people? Oh, crazy. That's a very good team.  
I've been in that predicament before. I've been the 7 and 9 or 6 and 8 team in
the SEC. I got to the Final Four one time 7 and 7 tied for 6 in the league. I
was Cinderella plus.  
Who knows? Gayle is getting better. Gayle is the key to their team. They've
got to have Gayle on the floor for 30 minutes. Then I told her going through
the line, I said girl, you're getting better and better. You don't have to be
a scorer to be an enforcer. We had Buchanan for five years, so we know what
that's all about.  
Give Texas credit. They've worked hard to get back to this spot. But give the
rest of our league a lot of credit because Baylor and us have been in the Top
5 to eight the whole year. Sometimes those losses are going to happen. But
Gayle's done a great job with that team with a short bench and that's been
very hard.

### [Linda Lappe](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21392)

### [Meagan Malcolm-Peck](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21820)

### [Brittany Spears](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20156)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Kansas  71  
Colorado - 45

  
PETER IRWIN: We're now joined by the Buffaloes from Colorado. Opening comment
about today's game.  
COACH LAPPE: Well, you gotta give Kansas a lot of credit. I thought they came
out and executed very, very well. They did what they needed to do to win that
game.  
We didn't play our best by any stretch of the imagination.  
PETER IRWIN: Questions for our student-athletes first.  
  
Q. Brittany, you guys came out really aggressive in the second half, cut it
to 2 after that. Did you guys just not shoot the ball well or did they make an
adjustment? What happened during their big run?  
BRITTANY SPEARS: We wasn't making any shots. We couldn't make layups, missed
23 open layups, so it was mainly us not making shots.  
  
Q. Meagan, what was the problem on offense? Like a struggle from the opening
tip?  
MEAGAN MALCOLM-PECK: Yeah, I think we -- none of us were moving around and I
think we kind of played individually and went back to not playing together as
a team, and I think we needed to cut and screen bodies more because they were
trailing screens. We needed to curl and pop and we just couldn't get it
together. And like Spears said, the wide-open layups and we definitely didn't
play as well as we could have.  
  
Q. Does Kansas do anything different from other teams to take away the
3-point shot?  
MEAGAN MALCOLM-PECK: I mean, they definitely pressure out on the 3-point line
and as we've struggled with teams that pressure and I think we need to learn
how to play against teams that pressure and learn what to do to work against
that. But, yeah, they definitely pressure.  
  
Q. Brittany, after you set the record, the career record and pulled your
team within two points, they went on the big run. Did you guys think at that
point you had gotten yourselves back in the game before that big run?  
BRITTANY SPEARS: Oh, yeah, we thought that we was back in the game because we
were only down by two but then they went on a run and we all just panicked and
went separate ways, I guess.  
  
Q. The record may be bittersweet, but you're now CU's career leading scorer.
Does that feel good?  
BRITTANY SPEARS: I would have rather got the W and scored two points. That
doesn't matter. I just wanted to win.  
  
Q. You guys have to wait a week to find out, but how badly would you guys
like to play in the WINT?  
MEAGAN MALCOLM-PECK: For sure we all want to keep playing for our seniors, and
I don't think that was a good game to go out on especially with how much we
love our seniors. So we definitely want to keep going.  
BRITTANY SPEARS: You don't want to go out losing by 25. So, yeah, we wanted to
come out hopefully our season keeps going.  
PETER IRWIN: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Linda, as an alum, I know you know Lisa Van Goor and she's been at the
top of that list for a long time. If you could, just talk about what Brittany
has meant to the program, especially this season the way she's improved other
aspects of her game, and even though I know she is probably disappointed now
what this means to her to become the all-time leading scorer?  
COACH LAPPE: I think it's a huge accomplishment. That record has been standing
for a very, very long time, since the beginning of our program. And for her to
be able to come in and do what she's done in the last four years I think is
pretty special.  
She's had to do a lot for us this year in every different way. And she's taken
on that responsibility. The good thing about Spears is that she's worked very,
very hard, and so she can be proud of that record. And her teammates can be
proud of it and they know and she knows and our staff knows that she's shot
more shots than anybody that I think I've ever coached. She's in the gym more
hours than anybody that I've ever seen.  
And she just loves the game. And she grew up loving the game. And so for her I
know right now she doesn't -- it's not that big of a deal to her. She just
doesn't say that. It really is. And I think she would rather have won and
never have gotten that record.  
But looking back, she's going to be very proud of that record and I'm proud to
have coached her for a year.  
  
Q. You guys were doing well behind the arc coming down the stretch, kind of
turned things around. Do they do anything special or just having trouble
getting your shots?  
COACH LAPPE: No, they do. They tag every single screen. They don't really get
the helps out a whole lot because they were so keyed in on our shooters, and
that's why we had so many layups. And that's why we got to the rim as much as
we did, is because they were on us and they were on our shooters.  
And they closed gaps very, very well. They're quick. They're athletic. So even
when we do have a somewhat open shot, they close that gap fast. And so if our
feet weren't ready to go and our hands weren't ready, then we weren't going to
get that shot off or they were going to block it.  
And so I felt like we had some really good looks to the basket especially in
that period of time where we didn't score for seven minutes. We got offensive
rebounds and put-backs or attempted put-backs and we did some really good
things and stayed with it.  
We just could not get that ball to drop through that net.  
  
Q. This is bittersweet because this is the end of Colorado's long, long stay
in the Big 12. I know you still play in the WINT but do you plan on watching
the Pac-10 tournament this week and does your focus start maybe turning more
officially now to that?  
COACH LAPPE: I think we do. We really haven't watched too many Pac-10 games
except for when we can, because we were so focused on doing well in this
conference and representing Colorado as we leave the conference. But now we
definitely start to focus on the Pac-10 and we'll be watching a lot of film
throughout the summer and getting ready for their teams and their strengths
and their weaknesses and the types of players that they have, because it is a
little bit different than the Big 12.  
So, yeah, we're happy to be going, but it's also -- it is a little bit
bittersweet because we've had a lot of success in the Big 12 and the Big Eight
and playing a lot of the teams that will still be in this conference.  
PETER IRWIN: Thank you, Coach.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Iowa State  69  
Nebraska - 61

  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by the Huskers from Nebraska. Coach Connie
Yori, your thoughts about this afternoon's game.  
COACH YORI: Well, it was a fun game to be a part of. Didn't want to come out
on the side we came out.  
But I thought we've had to rely a lot on shooting 3s and kind of live by it
and you die by it. And that kept us in the game through the first 35 minutes,
37 minutes.  
And then we couldn't make shots. And they have an improved inside game from
where they were a year ago. They go down to Poppens and she's able to make
plays down the stretch for them.  
But I think Mansfield was the one -- we played a lot of zone. I've been
coaching for 25 years, and this is the first year we've ever played any amount
of zone that we're playing because of where we are health-wise. We've had to
go to that a lot.  
We started the game and, man, they score 14 points in the first, I don't know,
four and a half minutes. So then we went to the zone, and I thought that was a
factor.  
But I thought Mansfield hitting the shot she hit, you expect Bolte to hit
shots whether it's man or zone. But I thought Mansfield was a real key for
them. No, they made more plays down the stretch.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions of the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Lindsey, did you guys think you had an upset in you today? Did you feel
confident coming down here that this could have happened, what happened?  
LINDSEY MOORE: We did. We talked a lot about how we're going to play like
there's no tomorrow. Because for us, a tournament isn't promised for us.  
So coming into this tournament, we knew we had nothing to lose and everything
to gain. So we just wanted to come out here and play hard. If an upset was
possible, then definitely do it.  
  
Q. Jordan, when you went into the locker room, what was the mood? What were
you thinking?  
JORDAN HOOPER: We were excited. I guess we were super duper happy to come back
out in the second half and upset the No. 5 team in the Big 12.  
  
Q. Either of you players can answer this. How much did you give up by
putting so much emphasis on Kelsey and did that leave Chelsea maybe with some
looks that she might not ordinarily get down the stretch?  
LINDSEY MOORE: You know, we -- obviously Kelsey's a great player and she's
going to make great shots. For us it was a focus that we just contested her
shots. And I think we got down to where we were worried about so much about
the outside we kind of spread out our zone. And they were able to get good
looks inside and Chelsea was just able to finish around the rim.  
  
Q. Lindsey, this has been such a turnaround coming in the last year and then
having so much weight on your shoulders this year and the team struggling a
little bit more, but what have you learned about yourself this season, just
going through the adversity that you have?  
LINDSEY MOORE: You know, I learned that I need to become a better leader out
there on the court especially with the loss of Dominique. I learned I need to
be more a more vocal leader out on the court and get my team going and just be
dependable and make shots down the stretch when we need them.  
THE MODERATOR: Congratulations, ladies. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Connie, other than the result, did you get about everything you wanted
out of your kids today?  
COACH YORI: Well, I think our players have competed really throughout the
season. There's only been a couple of times this year where I've left a game
saying we didn't come into it ready, we didn't compete hard. And I feel like
we've been competitive.  
Scores sometimes aren't indicative of the effort that we have put forward,
because we ran out of gas with some limitations. We've been in games, we've
been in a lot of games with ten minutes left and we just haven't had enough
fuel to finish.  
And then the lead expands. But I feel like we've been -- the last couple of
weeks we've been really competitive in games. You look at our A&M score, I
mean, which is our last game of the year, that was not indicative of what
really happened in that game.  
So obviously we have some limitations and we gotta do a better job of
recruiting, better job of coaching, but I think our kids have done a really
good job of continuing to work through the struggles and handling adversity.  
And that's what you want, that's all you can really expect from any group of
young women and just keep pushing forward and have the attitude that they're
going into every game and trying to win it. And I feel like we've tried to do
that. I feel like our kids have been real good from that standpoint.  
  
Q. What adjectives would you describe what Poppens did against your school's
No. 2 all-time shot blocker down at the end?  
COACH YORI: Well, adjectives. Let me think, adjectives. Let's see, a
journalism major with a -- she's powerful. And she's a strong kid. And she
gets the ball in the low block. And she got deep. And she overpowered us.  
And Cat got -- we're playing zone so Catheryn got caught playing a little flat
in our zone. Because you've got to cover more than one person in a zone. And
that's what allowed her to get those touches. I don't think those are
adjectives, are they? No.  
  
Q. Connie, how would you gauge Jordan's improvement this year and what are
the things you think she's going to be working on next season as a
sophomore?  
COACH YORI: There's some little things she's gotten better at. But in the off
season, she absolutely needs to develop more to her game than just being a
shooter. She needs to be able to put the ball on the floor. She needs to
develop as a passer. She needs to develop as an inside scorer.  
I think she can do all those things. She needs to get stronger with strength.
She will be able to do those things more and she's -- she's as good a shooter
as maybe I've coached. And I know her numbers don't necessarily reflect how
good of a shooter she is. But she's a really good shooter.  
Largely because she has to take tough shots because of the fact that we don't
have a lot of scorers. She's got to take tough shots. But she's got to develop
some other facets of her game, as I mentioned, and I think she will.  
  
Q. How much did Jordan's fourth foul kind of mess up what momentum you
thought you had at that time?  
COACH YORI: Well, we struggled with foul trouble here the last half of the
season, and Jordan has been one of them. And again that comes from being young
and playing behind the play. She has a tendency to take herself out of
position and she gets herself into trouble that way.  
But both her and Catheryn have been in a lot of foul trouble this year for us,
and obviously that's had an impact. Had an impact today. Both games against
Iowa State previously, those guys got in foul trouble. We tried to emphasize
that. That's one of the reasons we went to zone, too, you think you can stay
out of foul trouble a little bit better.  
  
Q. It's officially goodbye now. I know you probably haven't had much time to
look at the Big Ten as busy as you have been, but your thoughts about making
that transition?  
COACH YORI: Honestly, I could not even tell you what's going on in the Big
Ten. And we're focused on our season. We're focused on our next opponent.  
We're going to take the off season to try to catch up and watch some film, and
we've taped a lot of Big Ten games. And we'll learn from that. But I just want
to -- I feel like the Big 12 has been a great league for us, and there's so
many people in this league that I respect. Bill Fennelly is one of them. I
think it's interesting that we ended up playing our last game in the Big 12
against someone who I have great respect for.  
And I think he does a great job with his program. I think his kids go about
their business the right way. And so it was intriguing that that's the way the
opponent we had in our last game.  
So I'm just thankful that the Big 12 stuck together. I said that in the summer
when it was going on. I'm sitting there from almost from an outsider's
perspective, you don't have a lot of involvement in it watching, and I'm just
saying, well, I just hope they stick together so these guys can continue to
have a good league in the Big 12, people in the Big 12 office continue to have
jobs. So we're just really thankful that everybody -- that there's still a Big
12.  
We'll be looking at the Big Ten starting here in the next couple of weeks.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Kansas  71  
Colorado - 45

  
PETER IRWIN: We're now joined by the Jayhawks from Kansas. Coach, your opening
comments before we take questions for the student-athletes.  
COACH HENRICKSON: I thought defensively we were active between deflections and
turnovers. The numbers aren't high. We had 16. But I thought we were
disruptive. I thought they struggled to get into rhythm because of our
pressure.  
Aishah in the second half denying some touches at the elbow and extended where
they tried to initiate a pass to run some screening action for Spears. And
Spears is a phenomenal player. In three games her numbers are impressive, 21,
but that's -- for as much as we work and try to slow her down, for that kid to
make average 20 against us this year, she's a phenomenal offensive player, and
we had our hands full. I thought we guarded some other people pretty well and
forced some tough 2s.  
Obviously the defensive field goal percentage, for us to hold them to 26
percent, I think a chunk of the second half they were shooting 18 percent, and
just real proud of the defensive effort.  
The zone was good for us in the first half, creates the cushion. They don't
get much in rhythm, and give them credit because they killed us on the
offensive glass. Our first shot defense was good, our second shot defense
wasn't very good. But I thought offensively we had good rhythm, moved the ball
around a little bit, shared the ball.  
A good win and survive and advance in March.  
PETER IRWIN: Questions.  
  
Q. Monica, basically it was a game of two runs. You had that little run from
the first half where you hit a couple of 3s and then the big run in the second
half. Can you kind of talk about what was going on during those two runs?  
MONICA ENGELMAN: In the first half, we were kind of in a little hole for
ourselves and we kind of -- for me shooting, I built momentum and kind of dug
ourselves out a little bit. It was a little bit of a spark player. In the
second half I think we did a good job defensively getting a stop and getting
deflections and running in transition.  
  
Q. Were you surprised how well you guys were able to play when Carolyn went
out with three fouls and how well you were able to score with her on the
bench?  
MONICA ENGELMAN: Not surprised. Gotta be prepared for situations like that.
With Carolyn out, you have to find different ways and --  
COACH HENRICKSON: We practiced that a little bit on the road with Carolyn out.
So we had plenty of practice.  
MONICA ENGELMAN: I wasn't so surprised at my teammates and myself. We kind of
picked up ourselves a little bit.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about the start of the second half, Colorado came out
with a lot of energy, cut it to three, how did you respond to that and maybe
regroup a little bit to stretch it back out?  
CAROLYN DAVIS: We always talk about not letting the other team come out and
make a run. When they came out and did that, it wasn't what we had planned to
do. And I think that it was great for us to just fight back. We didn't let
them continue to make a run. We got stops and we pushed in transition, and
that's what cut the run.  
  
Q. Most of that run was Spears too. How did you feel overall that you guys
did on her?  
CAROLYN DAVIS: I mean, she's going to get her shots. She's a great player, and
I think that we did the best job defending her. She got a few open looks down
the lane when guards got clipped in screens and we didn't rotate and help. At
the same time I think we did great with shutting down the other players around
her. That's what helped us get the win.  
COACH HENRICKSON: You look at them the last four games, they're averaging 10
for 24 from the 3 in their last four games. They got 2 for 13 here, 3 for 17
at our place, and 2 for 7 there. So we defended the 3. We were going to have
to defend the 3. That's why they win at Nebraska, they win at Missouri, 11 for
37 against Baylor at home. When you look at them at the numbers, that's where
their growth had been.  
I thought all the players -- Seabrook comes out and gets 2, and we talk about
even she, and a lot of them, their first shot 3s have been her in the last
four games, and we gave her 2, and then we buckled down, we were much better
there.  
When you're going to space and spread yourselves to guard the 3, it's going to
leave lanes to drive. And then they just drove it on us.  
Our first shot defense was good. It was the in the zone. The zone, we come out
and play the zone, man miss, a zone make. It's good on the first shot, and
then Malcolm-Peck, the two offensive rebounds are the shooter, shoot and
chase, shoot and chase. That's where the Spears is most dangerous on the
offensive rebound, on her shot. She chases it. Great offensive rebounder.  
  
Q. Let's talk about Baylor. I mean, I know there's got to be a bitter taste
from the first meeting. Talk about playing them tomorrow.  
CAROLYN DAVIS: First game was tough. We don't think we went out and competed
our best. We didn't go out and execute or do any of the things that we plan to
do. And I don't think that we'll do that this time.  
I mean, we're ready for this game. We're ready to continue to move on, and
it's another game. We've got to prep for it tonight and play them tomorrow.  
  
Q. What makes them so tough? What will you do tomorrow?  
MONICA ENGELMAN: Be more aggressive. I think we were very passive the first
game. First things first, you have to be aggressive whatever you're doing.  
  
Q. Are you guys excited about the opportunity to see them again?  
MONICA ENGELMAN: It's another opportunity to -- we play them in conference. We
weren't very satisfied with our performance. But I think we're more excited.
It's the next game in the tournament, second round, so trying to survive and
advance.  
COACH HENRICKSON: They're coachable, baby, aren't they?  
  
Q. You guys not only are advancing to the second round but you just picked
up your 20th win for the season. What does that feel like for your you two
players?  
CAROLYN DAVIS: It feels good. Coach tells us we haven't had that in a while in
the regular season. That's what we tried to get to. We didn't get that, but we
still got to it. And it's a big mark for us, and we just want to continue to
get wins.  
MONICA ENGELMAN: For me, I'm excited about it. And I want to build off of it.
So that's pretty much it.  
  
Q. Bonnie, can you frame the 20 wins? That's kind of the --  
COACH HENRICKSON: We do a really good job in the non-conference and league
play. We're at times pretty good and we've got five overtime games, 4 and 1.
About eight one-possession games. When we're aggressive we win, and when we're
hesitant and tentative we didn't. That happened to us in the last regular
season game at K-State at our place, happened at Texas Tech at our place.  
When we talked yesterday when we circled up, I said being wise and being
experienced means you've made mistakes. We've got some awfully talented kids
who just got hesitant and tentative. So I said if we think, remember anything
from those situations, moving forward because there's so much to play,
remember that. It's not a play called down the stretch; it's your mentality
and whatever play is called. It's no magic we're running offense in one game
and run the same offense and didn't knock it down.  
And like with Monica and Angel who have their the ball in their hands so much
especially late and Carolyn will be a primary look in all of those things, I
think moving forward to learn from where we struggled, that we don't get 20
earlier, which is obviously the direction and climb in the league standings,
those are situations you've got to learn from.  
Same thing in the Nebraska game, all those late game, one-possession games. I
think that's most important. That's what we've talked about down the stretch.
Don't ever lose the lesson in a loss, don't lose the lesson, but don't hang
around and let it weigh you down. You've got to move on.  
  
Q. You've obviously played in some great arenas in the Big 12 in front of
some big crowds. Talk a little bit about the atmosphere and playing here in
Kansas City in the Big 12 tournament for both of you, please?  
MONICA ENGELMAN: It was fun. It was good to see all the kids up at the top. I
don't know if they were here for us or they were just hanging around.  
COACH HENRICKSON: Sounded like they were.  
MONICA ENGELMAN: The bands and stuff. We have the cheer squad and stuff, so it
was really fun, friendly atmosphere.  
CAROLYN DAVIS: Yeah, it was fun. We had a lot of fans here from home. So that
was great to see them travel here to see us. And, of course, the kids up top,
that was always cute. I mean it's just great. Great to see as the week goes on
the fan base that will be here.  
PETER IRWIN: Thank you. We'll have questions for Coach.  
  
Q. It seems like sometimes it depends on which game which team of yours kind
of shows up. Today seemed to be the team that showed they're capable of
beating anyone in the Big 12. And like you talked about, sometimes it's not
that. Is there any concern with that, with the way this tournament is set up
and back to back and kind of keeping that?  
COACH HENRICKSON: I think the two going back, if you try to recap every game
in the league, the two games that are most disappointing are Baylor, given the
Oklahoma game, although we get it to 10 against Oklahoma at home, we're -- for
whatever reason, we don't have a pulse. We didn't have a pulse in the Baylor
game.  
That is no knock on Baylor to take anything away from them, obviously how
talented they are. But we remember what that felt like in the locker room,
just we just rolled over and let it happen.  
But I think outside of that, yeah, we have been inconsistent. If there's
anything we've done consistently is been inconsistent, whether it's from one
media to the next or stretches where I was proud today where they cut into it
and we grew it, grew the lead and went back to how we grew it and got it in
the first half on the defensive end. And then got good shots, good shots in
rhythm and did a better job there.  
And that's a growth and a maturation and a toughness, and you can't be soft in
this league. You just can't be from possession to possession, from media to
media, to half to half, and we haven't been all of those things consistently
enough to be as successful as I certainly thought we could be from a win-loss
column in the league play.  
  
Q. Do you think the first time you played Baylor that you guys maybe got
caught up in the fact that of the Griner, of Griner?  
COACH HENRICKSON: Kind of hard not to do. I mean, I thought our -- of course I
thought their mentality was fine. We're shocked that we just didn't have a
pulse -- just shocked and embarrassed, quite honestly, we didn't have a pulse.
And they were, too. And they were, too.  
And, again, not to take anything away from them, because they can do that to
you. They can do it to you, because they're that good. But when someone starts
to punch you you can't put your hands in your pocket. We didn't have anything
back. We didn't have an answer.  
And it's four-minute games. One possession at a time. All of those things.
But, yes, I say that with absolutely taking nothing away from how good they
were that day and how good they've been consistently through the season.  
  
Q. Talk about the 20 wins again, just from a program standpoint. Just talk
about the benchmarks.  
COACH HENRICKSON: Right, if you're in basketball it's 20 wins and that's
important and the kids are proud of that.  
And it's hard for me to go on and on and on about it because we hoped we had
that maybe a month ago. We were hoping it would have been more than that by
now.  
But if you're in basketball it's 20 wins, and that's important. And the kids
are proud of it. And, again, but still proud of it but wanted it to happen
sooner than -- wanted that in February and not necessarily have to wait until
March.  
  
Q. Having said all that about Baylor, what do you say to your team tonight
to prepare for tomorrow? Obviously you'll do Xs and Os, but what kinds of
things do you tell them? What's the message tonight?  
COACH HENRICKSON: We talked a little bit in the locker room before we got out
of there about remembering what that felt like emotionally, after that. And I
don't think any of us have forgotten that. And that's important.  
But it's a new day. It's a new game. A different game. Same teams obviously
and our prep will be -- it's challenging because it's going to be in the hotel
and a taped floor and try to go through rotation what we need to do
defensively. And as you look at it, how much Griner -- who do we go to?
Carolyn Davis. And I think Colorado took one shot in the paint.  
Now it's not a focus for them. That's not who they are, sit down and block.
But she's phenomenal offensively, but she's been tough defensively because of
how she changes the game.  
I mean, at their place last year, Sharley Morris (phonetic) comes off and
almost from 16 feet away throws it half court because they'd come off and hit
2. She can do that. It's what she can do on both ends of the floor.  
But this time of the year, there's as much here, there's as much here in your
ability to focus and concentrate and execute a game plan, but it's 50/50
balls. It's a gut check. It's a toughness. It is there's a scheme obviously
and to execute and play and do the things to give yourself a chance, but
there's another element, too, that we have to embrace and hurry and accept
that challenge tomorrow.  
  
Q. As an opposing coach you said some really nice things about Brittany
Spears, and she hasn't had maybe a lot of talent around her but today became
the all-time leading scorer for that program. How would you assess especially
how she has maybe matured this year because it seems like she plays better on
both ends this year?  
COACH HENRICKSON: She's worked harder defensively. She's more active in
passing lanes. Her steal numbers have always been good, but I've called it
like possum; she'll sit back there and wait for you, and then she has those
go-go gadget arms, she goes and gets a ball in the passing lane that nobody
thinks she can get.  
She's been more aggressive in passing lanes. If you look at her willingness to
deny entry, she doesn't sit there and gamble for steals and be undisciplined.
She's more disciplined defensively and her effort is better there.  
I think from when you watch her and as much film as we watch, I think her
emotional maturity, I think she's been a better teammate, not that she was a
bad teammate, she plays with people around her better, but she recognizes when
she needs to be able to take over, and give her credit for that.  
But her ability for one-on-one and her efforts on the offensive glass and how
much you have to prepare for her because of the all different ways she can
score, I've always been a huge fan of hers and her ability one-on-one
offensively, have been more impressed with her on the defensive end and
respect her commitment on that end before because I think that was the knock
on her before. She played on one end and rested on the other. But I think her
effort has been much better on the other end.  
She needs to still do that for the young kids, because if your best guy is
giving you the best effort and attitude, you've got a chance. I'm not in
Linda's practice, but I think she would be able to say that about her this
year.  
PETER IRWIN: Congratulations.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Texas Tech  75  
Oklahoma State - 52

  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by Texas Tech, Kristy Curry. Coach, your
comments, and then we'll take questions from the student-athletes.  
COACH CURRY: I thought the second half, our energy, defensively and on the
boards and going to the offensive glass on both ends was outstanding, and we
did a much better job the second half.  
So really proud of my team. And I thought it was important down the stretch
that we understand the difference in putting a period on tonight and an
exclamation point, because we're fighting for seeding.  
And our goal coming into Kansas City, it's a brand-new season, and our goal --
we feel like we can win this tournament.  
I'm really proud of my team and the way we came out tonight, especially the
second half.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Mo, can you just talk about the way the offense was clicking in the
second half and just running so smoothly?  
MONIQUE SMALLS: In the second half, everybody was looking to score. We weren't
trying to be so passive. If you were open, we took the shot. If there was a
drive there, we took it. Instead of just taking our time, we just saw the open
areas.  
  
Q. What sort of adjustment did you feel like you made in the second half
with the 26 points versus 49 the second half? What did you guys feel like you
did differently?  
MONIQUE SMALLS: We picked up our energy. We encouraged each other. If we did
something bad, we were like don't worry about it, shake it off, it's in the
past, keep moving on.  
  
Q. Kierra, first half there, you know, you guys get down 8-0 and they're
playing that zone. Seemed like you guys were really patient and didn't panic
and start jacking up a bunch of shots in the outside. Is that kind of the way
it felt for you guys, you kind of took your time and looked for shots against
their zone?  
KIERRA MALLARD: In practice we've been working on our zone, getting better.
The coaches told us to look at the open area. So we just got the ball in the
middle and go high/low and then go rebound.  
  
Q. Can you talk about defending McIntyre and keeping her from getting the
open looks close to the basket that she got the last time you guys played?  
KIERRA MALLARD: Yes, I've just been moving my feet around trying to meet her
early so she won't get her open position. Basically just moving my feet.  
  
Q. Both players, about your opponent tomorrow, Oklahoma, you beat them last
time. Great shooting by them one half, poor shooting the next. What's the best
recipe for beating them tomorrow, starting with you, Mo?  
MONIQUE SMALLS: I would say defense, stopping penetration, stopping 3-point
shots, and getting through screens.  
KIERRA MALLARD: Just talking on defense and just playing offense, our game.  
  
Q. Kierra, after all that Jordan's been through, how good was it to see her
play ten minutes, have five points and just really be involved tonight?  
KIERRA MALLARD: What happened in the past is the past. She worked hard every
day in practice. She can play anytime.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. How much did you feel like defense was creating offense for you guys in
the second half there?  
COACH CURRY: We feel like our defense is our best offense. A lot of ball
pressure. We got some deflections. We did a great job of giving them one
opportunity.  
We just were aggressive on both ends of the floor. When we can come out and be
aggressive in that mindset, we feel like good things are going to happen on
the defensive end and it's going to give us more energy on the offensive end.
I loved our aggressive attack, passionate energy the second half.  
  
Q. When you see the 24 to 5 bench points, what does that mean to you to see
that sort of depth?  
COACH CURRY: I saw Kelsi Baker, Shauntal Nobles, when you look at the energy
Nobles and Baker had tonight off the bench, you know, at Oklahoma State they
were absolutely horrific and they know it and they've grown from it. That was
the difference in the game was our bench energy tonight.  
And I'm so proud of how hard our fours and fives -- there's no letdown when
they come in. I thought Kelsi and Shauntal's energy was absolutely
spectacular.  
  
Q. OSU seemed to get a lot of close shots but they didn't seem to be easy
shots. Can you talk about the interior defense you played, even when they had
the ball near the basket?  
COACH CURRY: We wanted to do a good job of making sure that every shot was
contested, that we were trying to be physical and aggressive inside. I thought
one thing that really made a difference, we brought the double tonight.  
And we haven't done that in the past two games from our 3 spot. I thought we
were running four hands at them instead of two, even when they caught it
inside when we were moving on the pass instead of when they caught it.  
We were trying to stunt them a little bit as far as not just two hands there
but four and being really aggressive, and I thought it was effective.  
  
Q. Could you talk about why your team appears to be the hottest in the best
league in the country right now, playing really good basketball?  
COACH CURRY: We have one senior, and we've really grown up a lot. Our
maturity. But I will say Casey Morris and Monique Smalls and Chynna Brown and
Christine Hyde, that sophomore class, they're just our heartbeat. We went
through the rough six-game stretch and a lot of people questioned that.  
Mo lost her grandmother, flew down a week and a half early to go see her and
say goodbye, and then passed away a week and a half. We went through a lot of
things off the floor that -- no excuses, but these kids have been through a
lot and they fought through some adversity that we had.  
And, again, from our point guards to our twos and threes, they've been our
heartbeat lately, their energy and passion.  
We're really growing up. We've had to make mistakes and we've learned from
them. You can make mistakes. They either work for you or against you, and
we've grown from those.  
  
Q. Facing Oklahoma again in such a short time, what sort of challenges does
that pose for you?  
COACH CURRY: Well, I think the thing that we have to draw upon is the fact
that -- the same thing with Oklahoma State, we played Oklahoma State and then
we turned around and played OU. So hopefully we can approach this the same
way.  
And I think the thing about it is, I mean, they're a great basketball team.
Obviously we understand how to be successful against them and how to be
unsuccessful. And we need to draw from both experiences.  
I mean, we had the lead there at halftime and felt we turned the basketball
over and made a lot of mistakes on the offensive -- didn't rebound and we
improved at home.  
And, again, we've played 640 minutes of basketball in Big 12 play, and we
understand when we've been most successful. And we're going to use all those
experiences tomorrow. We've got our hands full.  
  
Q. In the first half, the poise and patience you guys showed, getting down
8-0 and playing against their zone, a lot of teams in a tournament atmosphere
could have got a little panicky but it didn't seem like you did.  
COACH CURRY: No, you know, like our poise at the one, two, three, I think
we've grown up there. They've learned a lot along the way. We want to make
sure that we do all the little things against the zone from our ball reversal,
shot fake, pass fake, still dribble. We were patient and poised, and patience
is a virtue sometimes, and it really paid off for us.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Texas Tech  75  
Oklahoma State - 52

  
PETER IRWIN: Coach, your thoughts about tonight's game.  
COACH BUDKE: I want to congratulate Kristy and her team. I thought they played
like an NCAA Tournament team tonight. I thought they played like a team that
beat the number one team in the nation tonight. I think they're going to have
a chance to have a good run in the NCAA Tournament.  
I thought tonight they got very physical with us and I didn't think we
responded very well. This reminded me a lot of about four years ago in
Andrea's freshman year we lost in our first round and then we won the next
three years. It kind of reminded me about that. People asked me last night how
do I think our team will play.  
We've been playing well, got a great win over Texas in our last game. But this
is another level that we have not -- a lot of our kids have not experienced
yet. It is a more physical time of year. You're allowed to play more physical,
and I just didn't think we handled it very well. But we'll learn from it. We
feel like we should be invited to the NIT and we'll go home excited about
playing the next season which hopefully will be the NIT.  
PETER IRWIN: We'll take questions for our student-athletes.  
  
Q. Vicky, can you and Toni both talk about the physical play. You got a lot
of close shots but never any easy shots?  
TONI YOUNG: Posting up or whatever they were really physical, a little bit
bigger than us. Like you said, we got to play a lot more physical. Instead of
powering through the contact, we kind of faded off from it instead of going
and finishing our shot.  
VICKY MCINTYRE: We let their physicality of their play get to us and we didn't
play our game.  
  
Q. Toni, you guys did not shoot -- either team did not shoot well in the
second half. Then they go in a 19-0 run in eight minutes in the second half.
Was that due to them being physical or you guys just weren't doing anything,
meshing at all offensively? What happened in that run?  
TONI YOUNG: We may have set back a little bit. The physicality did kind of get
to us because we were trying to feed the ball inside. And our posts, we
weren't hitting the shots we needed to.  
PETER IRWIN: Thank you, ladies. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Talk about that run, if you would. Did that have to do with them being
physical or just late on the basket or combination?  
COACH BUDKE: A little combination. And I think your confidence level drops at
both ends. Now, if you have a veteran team you understand that, okay, if we're
not scoring, we have to play better defense. We have to rebound better.  
And they understand that part of the game, I think, a lot better than what we
do right now. We let it bother us at both ends. We actually got beat on a
couple run-outs tonight. That hasn't happened to us all year long. I think
it's really feeling bad about the shot I just missed.  
And these kids care, and they're great kids. And I love them to death. And
when they don't play like they are capable of, they feel like they're letting
down the team, the school, their family, and they carry that burden at both
ends.  
And they'll learn. They'll learn. It's gotta get a little tougher at the other
end when you're struggling at one. But we didn't do it tonight.  
  
Q. Kristy said that they hadn't double-teamed you in the post the first two
games but they did it tonight. Was that a bother? And were they not ready for
it, or just good defensive strategy or what?  
COACH BUDKE: Actually, we've had that quite a little bit lately. So we
actually were ready for it. And the counters that we had that we've been
using, so there really wasn't anything new that we had to do tonight. Just
didn't work.  
And I think if you go back and look at the tape now, you know, when we scored
22 the first half, we had some really nice opportunities without the double-
team there that I felt we should have been in the 30 to 35 range in the first
half. And that just kind of carried over.  
Again, it really reminded me of four years ago.  
  
Q. I know you'd rather win, but in a losing effort, Vicky McIntyre has 21
points, nine rebounds, five blocks. As you move forward from here, seems like
a pretty good building block?  
COACH BUDKE: We really feel with Tiffany, Toni, Vicky, those three are very
good ones to draw to right there. And Toni didn't have a great night tonight.  
She'll be the first one to tell you that. It's hard for us to win with Toni
struggling like she did tonight. But Vicky, Vicky's a force in this league and
Vicky as a freshman does demand a double-team.  
And so I think that's exciting for the future and as we continue to get better
players around her we're excited about the kids coming in next year.  
And it won't be quite so easy to double-team her.  
PETER IRWIN: Thank you, Coach.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Texas  79  
Missouri - 66

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by the Tigers from Missouri. Coach, your comments
about this evening's game.  
COACH PINGETON: Last games are always tough. A lot of emotion in our locker
room right now. But, first of all, congrats to Gail and the Texas team. I
thought they played real well, shot the ball real well tonight.  
They're an outstanding team. They've got some tremendous perimeter players.
And I've got a lot of respect for them. We knew it was going to be a battle
this time of year, new season. It always is but I'm proud of our girls. I
really am. I think our seniors have been outstanding this year.  
The leadership, the foundation that they've helped us lay for the future of
our program, and, you know, we finished what we started. And I thought we went
down fighting and working hard. And together. And that's something that I
think these girls can be really proud of.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for our student-athletes.  
  
Q. Rae, let's talk about the emotion of the game. I saw more frustration in
your face through the course of the second half than I think I ever have. It
looked like just you were having a real difficult time of it. Talk about what
was going on at that point.  
RAESHARA BROWN: When you're talking potentially the last game of my season and
you want it so bad and you know how important every possession is, and it's --
it's disappointing because you can't get those back.  
I always want to do more for these girls in the locker room. I put such a
heavy weight on my shoulders, whether I'm making a mistake or thinking I can
do something better. And these girls have done a tremendous job of having my
back and helping me out through the course of this year. And you just want it
so bad.  
And I think that was more my feelings throughout the game.  
  
Q. Shak, let me have you talk about the same thing, the frustration of the
second half, because you guys were pulling closer and they're pulling away
again.  
SHAKARA JONES: It's kind of like Rae said, when this could potentially be the
last game of your college career, and you want everything. You want every
loose ball, you want every rebound and every shot to go in, just those type of
emotions.  
I wouldn't just say all the way frustrated, I would say more of just fighting
out there, fighting for everything.  
  
Q. Either of you, what kind of changed defensively. I know you fell behind
32-15 and seemed like you guys finally found that defensive energy, maybe you
guys would have hoped to from the start. What kind of changed at that point?  
RAESHARA BROWN: I think we just decided to play a little harder. We were I
think a little timid, a little soft with our own ball defensive. I think in
the second half Coach challenged us to dig in deeper and give it everything we
had.  
And we were more determined that they weren't going to beat us one-on-one. We
weren't going to keep giving them uncontested layups. And as we made a little
run, we were getting defensive stops and making them take tough shots.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Could you just talk about Flores's toughness? I mean, late in the second
half, if memory serves, she hit the deck hard. She obviously looked like when
she was in pain she was getting up, but she was able to get back and keep
playing.  
COACH PINGETON: I've seen so much growth in her throughout the last 10 or 11
months, and that's a kid that's actually thrown up at halftime and comes out
and continues to compete pretty hard in the second half.  
I think part of it, she's still starting to understand really how much she can
impact the game at both ends for us. And it's not uncommon to see her on the
floor for loose balls and making those effort plays.  
And I think pretty consistently she had a couple of games after she hurt her
finger kind of in the middle of the season. But I think consistently I can say
she's been one of our hardest workers this year and not afraid to make those
hustle plays and extra-effort plays.  
I thought she did it again tonight. I think she was a great player. I think
she can score from the inside, has the ability to step away from the basket.
Defends well. Changes shots. Pretty versatile for her size.  
But somebody that will certainly be an anchor for us next season.  
  
Q. Could you talk about RaeShara, just the fact that she seemed to kind of
do everything for this team this year?  
COACH PINGETON: Well, it's hard to talk about our seniors without having some
emotion, just because you know where our program's at and really where this
team was at 11 months ago.  
And I think when you're a new staff and you're a senior it's so hard, and the
buy-in from that senior class has just been outstanding. And consistently for
the last 11 months they've done everything we've asked of them.  
And a lot of it was they didn't know what they didn't know and maybe never
been challenged at this level before for one reason or another.  
But the season's gone so fast. It really has. That's a pretty unique statement
to be able to make when you haven't won at the level that you're used to
winning or would like to win at. And a lot of times it drags out a little bit.
But it really hasn't. This season's flown by and it's because of our senior
class. And Rae's been a big part of that.  
She's such a strong leader and a great player. And still until the final horn
sound wanted to be the best she could be for her teammates and for Missouri
women's basketball.  
And I think it's pretty admirable, a player like her, with her abilities, to
continue to be a sponge day in and day out and just trying to get better on
the court, off the court, with her leadership style.  
And she certainly -- they all have, they've surpassed my expectations. Am I
satisfied, absolutely not. But they've certainly surpassed my expectations.  
When you look at this group, when you look at the lack of experience and depth
and maybe skill level that we had and for us to be able to beat three top 25
programs this year, and early on I think we had the reputation that we kind of
quit at the end of games.  
And just the growth that we've had has been -- it's been pretty amazing and
fun to be a part of. At the end of the day winning's important and I'm a bad,
bad loser, but at the end of the day it's so much bigger than that.  
And these girls have grown, and I'm proud of it and happy to be a part of it.  
  
Q. I wanted to ask you about the game, three, four minutes into the second
half, it was an eight-point game, you guys had a layup that just hung on the
rim, they come down and hit a 3. Instead of it being six it's 11. How big a
stretch was that?  
COACH PINGETON: Huge. There were a couple of huge plays like that in the
second half that we found a way to keep battling back and giving ourselves a
chance.  
But give Texas credit. They hit some tough shots. Hit some big shots when they
needed to. They're a talented ball club. Nash does what she does, knocked down
3s on us. And just a tremendous player. And they've got some very skilled
perimeter players.  
And so frustrating on our end, but, really, I think you've got to give Texas
some credit, because Gail's done a tremendous job with that program. And they
hit big shots when they needed to.  
  
Q. Doing some big picture stuff here, I'm sure when the season started you
did not come into this and go, wow, I sure hope we come out of this with five
wins. That aside, it still sounds like you were very pleased with the amount
of progress that's been made toward the ultimate goal. How much do you think
you've taken towards where you want the program to be in this first year and
is it as much as you wanted to get out of your first year?  
COACH PINGETON: Well, you've gotten to know me pretty well over the past
couple of months, because I certainly didn't go into this season thinking five
wins would be great.  
Losing's hard. There's no doubt about it. And when you're in the trenches with
your players and really trying to help them grow on and off the court, and you
face the adversity that we faced this year, which was the challenging times.
There's not an easy day. But that's the cool thing about what we do. There's
so many teachable moments.  
And like I said, you know, in the big picture that's what's most important.
And I think there's so much that happened in that locker room and on that
court and individually and collectively that people on the outside, they
wouldn't have any idea. And they shouldn't. They watch us play the game and
it's Xs and Os and a scoreboard.  
That's been neat to be a part of. And it's laying the foundation, and you've
got to do that. It was the same at Illinois State seven years ago. There's a
certain way. There's certain standards, there's certain expectations that you
place on your team.  
And I think the groundwork that we've laid and that these seniors have laid,
there's no doubt in my mind it's going to be so beneficial for years to come.
And one day down the road hopefully within the next couple of years we're
going to look back and say this is a class that laid that foundation. And I am
proud of them.  
And, again, I'm a bad loser. But I think when you're in this position and in
the trenches that we're in, I think you've really got to -- you've got to take
time to acknowledge those small victories, and we've certainly had some big
ones this year.  
  
Q. You had some struggles defensively there especially early. Do you think
maybe your team came out a little flat or was it something else?  
COACH PINGETON: Absolutely I don't think it was flat. I'm going to give our
girls more credit than that. I think there's -- just throughout this season
it's been amazing. Probably more emotion than usual just because of so many
changes that took place in this team individually and collectively. But maybe
it locked up a little bit. Maybe afraid of failure, afraid of this being it,
the last game that they play.  
I think more of those emotions than anything. There's a fine line, and our
girls are still learning that between playing to win and playing not to lose.
And that's just not something that changes with the flick of a switch. That's
a mindset. That's a mentality. That's a mental toughness that it takes a lot
of time to continue to grow in that area.  
So I don't think it was flat. I think it was more just maybe just having it
right between the ears and playing not to lose and maybe a little tight rather
than just letting it all hang out and saying, hey, let's just put it out there
and whatever happens, happens.  
Part of that, again, I'm going to tell you Texas is a good team. They're a
bubble team. Out of the gates they were shooting about 80 percent. They didn't
miss a lot of shots early on in the game. In the first half they shot over 57
percent. They were hitting some good shots, so we have to give them credit,
too.  
  
Q. And after that early stretch, what did you kind of say to the team to
maybe challenge them? I know Texas was lights out, but seemed like the defense
was uncharacteristic in the sense that maybe not closing out as well and they
were blowing by you guys one-on-one. What did you kind of do to challenge
them?  
COACH PINGETON: Well, they've been so resilient all year long. And it's
constantly getting them to understand that there's more in their tank. They
can play harder. At halftime I just said there's absolutely no doubt we can
play harder, we can guard harder, we can contain. We have to roll up our
sleeves and dig in and really just try to get to the innards, and they're
still trying to understand what it is to be successful.  
We haven't had success. They've had very little success for the last few
years, and so they're still understanding what that takes. Have we grown? Yes.
But does it happen overnight? No. So it's a constant battle to get at the
innards and really challenge them to dig deeper and play harder.  
  
Q. Did it ultimately seem you guys were playing catch-up the whole game
after that stretch? Did it ultimately seem that one run was ultimately what
kind of tilted the game?  
COACH PINGETON: I thought -- again, I was proud of our girls. I thought we
could have thrown in the towel, and we didn't. We kept making some runs in the
second half.  
Again, credit Texas. They hit some big shots, and every time we made that run
they responded. And that's what good teams do. That's what experienced players
do. That's what great players do. And they certainly did that.  
So we had fight in us. I thought we fought. We competed until the end. You saw
players on the floor for loose balls and whatnot. Yeah, the better team won
today. It's the bottom line: The better team won.  
We've got a lot of work to do. We have a lot of work that has to take place in
the off season and a lot of growth that has to continue to take place, and
we're excited about the challenges ahead. I can't tell you, me and my staff,
we're ecstatic about just the challenges and the opportunities that we have
for the future of this program.  
  
Q. Rae really came out in that second half, all over the court. How did her
play set the tone for the rest of the team in the second half?  
COACH PINGETON: You can only do so much. She's a veteran ball player, she's
played a lot of minutes, she leads the conference in steals. She's been where
some of our other players haven't been in regards to these kind of situations.
And so she wasn't going to go down without a fight.  
And I think you alluded to this earlier, just the emotions, the frustration
that she was playing with. I think there's a lot of things that went into
that. You know, it's hard when you're a senior and you've really -- the buy-
in's there and your passion about the game, and I think you've seen so much
individual growth in yourself.  
A lot plays into that. But she's been our anchor all year long, and she's done
a lot of great things for us on both ends of the court. She had a tremendous
career.  
I think this year she's been a tremendous leader. And she's someone that we're
going to remember in our program for a long, long time, along with the rest of
the seniors.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Iowa State  69  
Nebraska - 61

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Coach Fennelly, and we'll have an opening
statement.  
COACH FENNELLY: Thank you. I think, first of all, I want to commend the
University of Nebraska for a great effort. It's been an honor to coach against
Connie Yori. She's a class act. They've represented our league in an amazing
fashion.  
I've had two odd 5-12 games in this league. One was Ceal Barry's last game as
the coach of Colorado and now Nebraska's last game in the women's game, Big
12. But I really think the way they conducted themselves all year was amazing.
And Connie's an outstanding person. They've got a great team.  
It was a game that we kind of anticipated it would be. First tournament game,
a little bit of jitters, but like I told the kids after the game, and everyone
hears it, is just move to the right, survive the game, forget anything bad you
did because it doesn't matter and we get to stay in Kansas City and be part of
what I think is the best conference tournament in the country.  
Very proud of our team, and certainly we had to work for it and that's the way
it should be in this tournament.  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by our student-athletes. Questions for the
student-athletes.  
  
Q. Why did it take you 35 minutes to get Chelsea the ball? Could you talk
about her finish, the way she came down the stretch?  
KELSEY BOLTE: I think we kept running the same play and they kept kind of
cheating out on the shooters on the outside, and that was the lane wide open
for Pop-ins and for Chelsea. So we kept feeding it to her, and she did a great
job of finishing and making the free throw as well.  
  
Q. Why not earlier? Was that just something that happened late in the
game?  
LAUREN MANSFIELD: I think that's just kind of the way the game happened. I
mean, when she's open, we're going to try and get it to her, but I feel like
the defense kind of really spread out because we're making our shots, so that
was nice, and so we got it to her and she did really well with it.  
  
Q. Lauren, I know you like to pass the ball. Tonight you were kind of a
scorer. Talk about the role. Was that planned or just kind of happened?  
LAUREN MANSFIELD: Just kind of happened. I feel like they left me open on the
zone as well, I'm sure they were chasing Bolte. So I started to hit a few, so
it took me some too. But my teammates really had my back and told me keep
shooting, keep shooting, so I did that, yeah.  
  
Q. Kelsey, what was it like at halftime in the locker room when she made the
3-pointer and what was the mood and especially of your coach?  
KELSEY BOLTE: Well, before Coach even got in there, we kind of collectively
decided it wasn't good enough.  
Any team that scores or that shoots, makes seven 3s on us, we weren't doing a
good enough job. We decided we needed to step up and play way better defense
than we did. Obviously Coach Fennelly wasn't happy about it, but we weren't
happy about it either.  
  
Q. Kelsey, you guys had trouble scoring in your last game against Missouri.
What did you do differently offensively to score more points this time?  
KELSEY BOLTE: I mean, we hit our shots. I don't think I made -- I think I made
two shots at the Missouri game. And Lauren really stepped up. She had five
3-pointers. That's great. I think our shots were just falling tonight.  
  
Q. Lauren, Chassidy had that big 3 with eight minutes left or something.
Were you telling her to shoot or was she -- was that a shot she should take
there? Or was it just -- talk about that play right there.  
LAUREN MANSFIELD: I feel like when she's wide open she's been making them,
those kind of shots. So we try and help her and tell her you can shoot that.
And I guess just depends on the game, and that was really a big moment in the
game and everyone was really excited for her.  
  
Q. For either of you, talk about tomorrow. You've got K-State, another team
you swept in the regular season. You just saw them. What kind of challenges
does that present and will it be difficult to do it a third time?  
KELSEY BOLTE: Yes, we're just going to prepare like we always do. It's a game
just like any other one. We're going to prepare. Obviously stay off our feet.
Already had a game today, so we're going to prepare just like we always do,
get everyone ready, get the team ready, and we'll be ready to go.  
  
Q. Anything particular about Kansas State from those two games? What's
unique about them in matching up with you guys?  
LAUREN MANSFIELD: Definitely their shooters. They can really shoot the ball.
Wide-range shooters with Chambers, so that will be something that we are
really concentrating on, I'm sure. I think that's the main thing, just getting
to the shooters.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Following up on what was asked as far as halftime, what was the message
there at halftime?  
COACH FENNELLY: Basically the message was exactly what Kelsey said. We had
given up seven 3-point shots, and I think six of the seven were defensive
mistakes on how we were -- talked about guarding. And we talked a lot about
like you do in tournaments, if we keep doing what we're doing, we're going to
go home. And we need to play better, smarter defense.  
And I thought -- held them to 23 points in the second half, and it was very
uncharacteristic of the defensive consistency of our team. You have to give
Nebraska a lot of credit. They ran some good stuff. They caught us in some
mismatches. But our team, the core of our team has been the attention to
detail defensively, and it wasn't there in the first half.  
And I thought for the most part it was in the second half. And that that kind
of turned the game a little bit. And we also had some foul issues. Lauren got
two fouls. Anna Prins gets two fouls. And we had to play some people that
probably weren't ready for this moment, this stage.  
With only nine players and two of them in foul trouble, that was probably the
biggest concern, just could we get it to halftime without anyone in major foul
trouble. At least we did that.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Chelsea a little bit? She took it to the hole three
times. Got two 3-point plays.  
COACH FENNELLY: Pop always plays hard. She struggled early. She got into foul
trouble. Had five turnovers and got herself going a little too fast.  
But, you know, when they ran their zone against us, we tried to spread them
out, and Lauren and Kelsey Bolte both made ten 3s. Their percentage was better
than Pop. Probably not a bad choice to let them shoot. The good thing with
Pop, she offensively rebounded the balls, some huge plays, stepped up made the
free throws. She's always a kid that plays with an amazing amount of energy. I
think she was shook up by the intentional foul call and I think it took her
out of her flow a little bit.  
She had a couple of turnovers early. But the one thing about Chelsea is
there's never -- there's never a time when we've walked out of any building
any day where we didn't say the kid busted her butt every minute she was in
the game. It's not always perfect, but as a coach you want people to compete,
and she competes every second of every play, and she's that way every single
day.  
  
Q. What did you think about that play? Did it look inadvertent to you?  
COACH FENNELLY: It was inadvertent. Chelsea Poppens is not going to do that to
anybody on purpose. They were scrumming, fighting for the ball. That's the
rule. It's a new rule. If someone makes a contact above the shoulders, they're
going to make the call.  
And obviously there was a lot of discussion. So they wanted to get it right.
But it was a big play of the game, because we go down three and they get the
ball back, and luckily we get a stop right there and come back and stay in the
game.  
And when that happens to you as a player, you get a little flustered, because
you're like -- you're out there and you're the one they call it on.  
So it was something that happens in a Big 12 tournament game. And, number one,
it happens, and, number two, luckily no one was hurt. And that's what you want
to focus on.  
  
Q. Talking about that play a little bit more. Did it do anything to spark
you guys? Because you didn't trail after that.  
COACH FENNELLY: I think it did a little bit. You know, you need something, a
rallying point sometimes. And I think the other thing it did, too, to be
honest with you, our kids were a little tired.  
I think it gave us a little bit of an extra break and they could stand there
and catch their breath a little bit. And I think the other thing that
happened, which is so typical of the best fans there are, is our fans got into
it at that moment.  
And I think they sensed -- I mean, our fans show up is one thing. But they
have an amazing ability to know when our team needs them the most.  
And I think at that moment there was like a dead period and all of a sudden it
got really loud and I think our kids got energized. And Kelsey Bolte had them
together and I'm waving at them, and one of the officials is pointing, like do
you want to talk to them, and I'm like, hell, they can -- I'm sure whatever
Kelsey is saying is better than what I'm going to say anyway, so just stay
there.  
It was a well played last seven minutes by us certainly at a time when it was
going to determine who won the game.  
  
Q. Kelsey scores 15 points but doesn't score a bucket the last 16 minutes of
the game, you talk about her teammates stepping up, I know it's been a big key
here.  
COACH FENNELLY: It has. They play a lot of zone, and we try to run. Like
Kelsey said, we ran the same play a lot because they were just running at her,
which opened it up for Pop. Anna had some great looks, didn't go in, but great
looks at the basket. Certainly Lauren's 3s were big. Chas hit one.  
Even in the zone they did a great job last part of the game of just shading.
We tried to move Kelsey around a little bit. They defended her really well.  
But when you run at someone before they get the ball, which they had to do,
that opens up other areas, whether it was Lauren or Chas or -- someone has to
be open. You can't commit. That's what Kelsey Bolte does to you. She hurts you
just by being on the court and everyone's so conscious of guarding her that
other people get open. And for our team today those other people made the
shots.  
Sometimes we haven't. And when we haven't, we usually got beat. So tonight it
was certainly a night where between Pop and Lauren and just a few other people
made enough baskets to survive.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the one-day turnaround, playing K-State for the third
time in the season?  
COACH FENNELLY: You know, the one-day turnaround -- if you're the 4th seed,
then you talk a lot about getting the extra rest. If you're the 5 seed, I'm
glad we played today and we're used to the court.  
The kids want to play. They sit there -- they're all nervous. It doesn't
matter. I mean, we're going to play a really, really good team that we beat
twice, which is great.  
We play low-scoring, hard-fought games with them. The challenge for us will be
to stay out of foul trouble because we aren't very deep without Z; that's a
player we don't have. But the alternative is being on the bus going back to
Ames. And if we've got to roll them out there tomorrow, we'll roll them out
there tomorrow.  
But they want to play and they're excited about playing. If you weren't
playing, you'd be practicing. And they're looking at me like let's just play
because this practice thing is getting real old.  
The main point of it is if we lose tomorrow it will not be because we're tired
from today. That's not fair to the other team. We're going to show up and play
and hopefully it will be a great quarter final game.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Texas  79  
Missouri - 66

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by the Longhorns. Coach, we'd like your opening
comments and then we'll take questions for the student-athletes.  
COACH GOESTENKORS: Just really happy to come away with a win. I told the team
I thought it was very appropriate that we were playing Missouri again in the
tournament, because that was our first conference loss.  
So we had an opportunity to show how far we've come. And it was very similar,
I thought, in many ways to the first time we played and that we had a nice
lead. And they're such a feisty team. They're an excellent team. And they
never give up. They keep coming back.  
And so the same thing happened where they made their run at the beginning of
the second half, and we withstood it, and then we made a run of our own. Then
down the stretch they hit a couple of 3s and started to make a run again. And
this time I thought we showed much more poise and we were able to close the
game out.  
So I think this was good for us for so many reasons, because we did show how
far we've come. And I give a lot of credit -- I thought it was a great team
effort. I thought in the first half both teams shot the lights out.  
In the second half I was disappointed at halftime that we were only up one on
the boards, and then in the second half I think we outrebounded by 16 in the
second half. I thought that was a real key to the game for us. It was team
rebounding, and I thought our bench came in and gave us great minutes as well
whether it was Tiffany Moore, Anne Marie Hartung rebounding the ball for us,
Kristen Nash just rebounding and to have Flores pick up that fourth foul.  
So give lots of credit to Missouri. They've done a great job, had a fantastic
season. I'm just proud and pleased to be moving forward.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes first.  
  
Q. Kathleen and Yvonne, you were really pushing the ball and scoring a lot
in transition early. I know you had a high-scoring game when you were at
Colombia. Was that part of the game plan, just to push the ball early?  
KATHLEEN NASH: That's always part of our game plan. But we were focusing on
playing aggressive defense so we get tips and steals. That really helps our
transition.  
YVONNE ANDERSON: I think especially this game we wanted to come out and just
kind of send the message earlier that this wasn't going to be the same game
kind of the way we played in Columbia, and I think that's where we saw that
aggressiveness early on in the game. We just tried to continue it throughout
the game.  
  
Q. If you two would talk about, all three of you, actually, seemed like you
all played with a real sense of urgency tonight. I wonder if you could all
address that, the emotions going into this.  
KATHLEEN NASH: We're trying to make the NCAA Tournament right now. So that's a
lot of motivation for us. We have a lot of urgency because of that.  
And especially having lost to Missouri at their place, that really added to
it.  
ASHLEY GAYLE: I agree. I think that a lot of it was revenge and being able to
come back and beat a team that -- I mean, they were the first game we played
in conference and being able to show how much we've grown as a team and
beating a team that beat us initially.  
  
Q. Kathleen, what made you go without the protective mask today?  
KATHLEEN NASH: I mean, my mask -- my nose had just been feeling a little
better lately. And it's not very sensitive. So I went without it in practice
to see how it was, and it doesn't bother me. So I'll just keep playing without
it, I guess, until I get hit, if I do.  
  
Q. Yvonne, could you have figured a better way to celebrate your 21st
birthday, especially with your father being here and able to see you play
tonight?  
YVONNE ANDERSON: I really don't think there is. I'm so glad we won and we were
able to just play the way we did. Because not only did we win, but we won
playing the way we feel that makes us the most successful.  
  
Q. Kathleen, how close are you to feeling as if you're not even thinking
about flying elbows or anything when you're out there on the court?  
KATHLEEN NASH: I don't really think about it when I'm out there on the court.
I try to just block it out. The only time I think about it is if it gets
bumped, and then it will be painful for a few minutes. But I don't really
think about it other than that.  
  
Q. You all seemed like really loose at the beginning of the game and came
out strong. Was that the feeling before the game?  
KATHLEEN NASH: It was definitely the feeling before the game. And we've had
some great practices, and so that really boosted our confidence, too.  
  
Q. Ashley, you really seemed to have your fire lit tonight, both offensively
and defensive, you got a couple of fouls there quick. Can you talk about your
overall game and how pleased you were?  
ASHLEY GAYLE: I think as a whole we just stepped up our game. I think that we
played so well in practice that sometimes it gets a little disappointing when
we see how we play in games. But I think today you finally see how we
practice.  
And I think our post game is really strong tonight. And I think there was a
lot of people rebounding and great passes from the guards. I know I got a
couple passes after they switched, and that was definitely because of the
guards, good passes, and we got out in transition. So I think today we were
everything that we want to be.  
  
Q. Kathleen, could you talk about drawing the Aggies again tomorrow in terms
of showing how far you all have come?  
KATHLEEN NASH: Tomorrow is personally my last chance. We just want to come out
with everything we have, play with confidence and get a win.  
  
Q. Particularly for Kathleen and Ashley, they talked about the difference in
the rebounding stats from the first half to the second half. What changed?
What do you think brought about that change?  
KATHLEEN NASH: I mean, Coach was on us at halftime about rebounding because we
were only up one. So I think that was probably a big part of it. Especially on
the offensive boards when there's a shot up, we went and got the ball.  
ASHLEY GAYLE: I think we did a great job boxing out. I know a couple of their
guards average something like six rebounds a game. So I think everybody knew
we had a huge job to do on the boards. So our first half wasn't as good as we
wanted it to be, so second half I think everybody just had it in their mind to
grab a rebound.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. There was a point there fairly early in the second half you guys were up
eight. They had a drive to the basket that kind of just rimmed off. Kat came
down and hit a 3. Instead of you being up six, you're up 11. I don't know if
you remember that sequence. Was that a fairly big play in the game? Because
from there it seemed like you guys were pretty much in control.  
COACH GOESTENKORS: Yes, that was huge for us. Basketball is a game of inches.
It could have gone in or out. And I know if it would have gone in it probably
would have put a little more pressure on us.  
But we just talked about not really worrying about the score, just playing our
game, which is attack. And so when she did miss it, our first thought was to
get the ball down the floor.  
I thought it was one of our better transition games, and I think we
transitioned into that and attacked the basket, and then they helped and we
kicked it out to Kat for a wide-open 3.  
And we always expect, if she gets a wide-open shot, we're more surprised when
she doesn't make it. So I think that was a key play in the game.  
  
Q. In that second game against A &M when you were down and you fought back
and were really able to get some really big defensive stops, do you feel like
there was something that you guys -- that finally clicked right for you in
that game, and is that something obviously you're hoping to maybe get a little
earlier when you're facing them tomorrow?  
COACH GOESTENKORS: I felt like in the first half they came in and really set
the tone. They're very, very physical team. I think the most physical in our
conference.  
And if you allow them to take your space, they will. And especially Adams, she
does a great job just getting you down on the low block and moving you
underneath the basket where you really can't defend her.  
And I thought in the first half they dictated tempo and really got us back on
our heels and set the tone. In the second half it was all about passion and
pride. That's all I talked about at halftime was coming in with the attack
mindset and not getting pushed around and bullied around.  
I thought in the second half we had that attack mindset, especially I thought
Yvonne just had a terrific second half for us. And we made a nice comeback. So
we have to have 40 minutes where we have that -- whether you're on offense or
defense, we have to be in attack mode and can't get pushed around.  
  
Q. How assured are you that you're going to make the tournament right now?
Does that take a lot of pressure off, do you feel like?  
COACH GOESTENKORS: I feel like we're in. But, again, you never want to take
anything for granted. So we've really stopped talking about the NCAA
Tournament because now we're just talking about the Big 12 Tournament.  
And so I think that's a good focus for us right now. We don't need to really
think about big picture. We talked about it before. But now this every moment
is what matters to us.  
  
Q. Did you play more today like you were open all year?  
COACH GOESTENKORS: Yes, absolutely. We had an inside attack. When you look at
the best teams, not just in the league but in the country, they have a good
inside and outside attack. And we've been very guard-oriented for a good part
of the system. A.G., she's played so well against Texas Tech. That was a good
game for us as well, and then struggled the next game at Oke State, and you
could see the difference.  
I was real happy. She's had great practices. Like she said, it's very
disappointing when you see her practice so well and then not have a good game
or be in foul trouble.  
Now we're hoping she can put a string together, because we need it to be
successful.  
  
Q. Did you tell her anything to get going against Tech?  
COACH GOESTENKORS: We talked as a whole team that we -- to be a great team we
need to have a post presence. A.G. is a great post presence on defense, but we
need a post presence on offense as well. And so we really have been running
some more sets to try to get her the ball with two feet in the paint where
it's a little bit easier for her when she gets it off the block she's not as
successful.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_HARTFORD, CONNECTICUT_  
  

CONNECTICUT  73  
NOTRE DAME - 64

  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us from Connecticut is Head Coach Geno Auriemma along
with Bria Hartley, senior forward, Maya Moore, freshman center, Stephanie
Dolson, and sophomore guard Kelly Faris. Coach, an opening statement, please?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I was, as you can probably tell watching them, it was a real
struggle. I thought the first half was very difficult to get anything done at
both ends of the floor. We had a difficult time trying to get into some
offense that made any sense, and we had a difficult time keeping them out of
the lane ask getting to the free-throw line and all that stuff.  
We kind of regrouped and went over a couple things. When we came back out, the
first five minutes of the second half set the tone for the rest of the game.
Made some big plays, made some shots, we got the ball inside a little bit more
than we did in the first half. It was exactly the kind of game that I thought
it would be going in.  
  
Q. All season it's been team concept, team thing, lot of contributions. Talk
about how that helped you tonight and the way you guys finished this run?  
MAYA MOORE: We needed every person to contribute tonight, and I thought we did
a good job, especially in the second half, stepping up, hitting good shots,
running our offense and executing what Coach was drawing up for us. Whether it
was dominating the boards like Kelly did for us tonight or hitting some big
shots and making some great passes like Bria and Tiffany were doing on and
Stef finished really well tonight. It took all of us, so I was really proud of
the way everybody stepped up.  
  
Q. Maya, you've won four of these in a row now. Talk about how meaningful
this one was just because of how difficult it was to get here?  
MAYA MOORE: Yeah, it's been definitely the most difficult year, but we have
shown some resilience. I think overcoming some odds and being mentally you
tougher than people probably thought we would be, and finding a way to win.
Just going through the regular season and being consistent enough, just enough
to win all of those games. To know that you can't really look to your left or
right, you've got to suck it up and play through it, because we don't have a
lot of reserves coming off the bench. That takes a lot of mental focus for a
long stretch of time.  
Because of that we've developed. Especially Bria and Stefanie have developed
quicker. It's just a blast to see that, and see it in the games.  
  
Q. Can you talk about tonight fighting through those double teams and being
productive? Also, could you talk a little bit about where you feel you've
grown the most during the course of this season?  
STEFANIE DOLSON: You know, I tried really hard in practice just to push myself
more, going harder, getting my stamina up, my endurance, and I struggled out
there today. But I just tried to fight through.  
I think the thing that I've progressed the most is just my mentality. Going
out there and just playing as hard as I can, and not focusing on how tired I
am. There was one timeout where I was just so exhausted. But C.D. talked to
me, and I had to fight through it, because we don't have a lot of depth in our
bench.  
So I think I definitely just like I said, my mentality's definitely gotten a
lot better.  
  
Q. Maya, right after the final buzzer you gave Stefanie a hug and said
something. Would you mind sharing with us what you said to her?  
MAYA MOORE: Probably something like you're my MVP or I'm really proud of you
or something along those lines. I gave her like eight hugs. I don't really
remember what I said at that one.  
I was just really proud of the way she stepped up and had everybody's back
tonight. Relieving a lot of pressure, I think, for all of us, by scoring in
the post. Every time we threw it in there, it seemed like something good would
happen. She would either do her hook shot, didn't get frustrated.  
So I was just really congratulating her and making sure she knew that what she
did tonight was really special.  
  
Q. For Bria and Stefanie, a lot was asked of you both this year. What's it
mean for you guys to see your hard work pay off? Not only to win a
championship, but to be named to the all-tournament team?  
BRIA HARTLEY: It's definitely a great feeling. It's our first time winning the
East Championship. We're just really excited and just glad that we went out
there, played hard and won.  
STEFANIE DOLSON: Yeah, I'm super excited. I mean, it feels great to know that
we just won our first Big East Championship, hopefully for more to come. So
it's a great feeling to know that we went out there and played hard. The fans
were there supporting us. They were great tonight. It's a crazy feeling.  
  
Q. Maya, do you feel that the team was discounted this season? If true, did
that perception fuel the team this season to the point where it's at now?  
MAYA MOORE: We take any motivation that we can get. It is an unusual year, and
some of the challenges that we're facing this year, we haven't necessarily had
to in the past, so we just use it to make us better. We use it to make us more
focused, more competitive as a challenge to be mentally tougher for longer
stretches of time, knowing that you're going to have to play more minutes. I
think we used it in a positive way.  
  
Q. There were a lot of plays in this game, but you were up 5 with about 2
minutes to go. You missed the shot and Stefanie went through about three Notre
Dame kids and gets the ball to score instead of them coming down only down 5,
you're up 7. Can you talk about how key that play was for you guys?  
MAYA MOORE: That's one of the big plays I was talking about. She was there.
She had my back in that instance. It's all those little plays that you look
back on, and that makes the difference, hustle plays, getting a loose ball,
getting an offensive rebound. That's what I think sometimes gets overlooked is
the little plays when it comes to championships. That's what makes the biggest
difference.  
Like she was saying earlier with how her mentality has changed and matured,
and that's the mentality that we've seen in Stefanie, and everybody's
mentality has to be just not being tired. Going after every loose ball and
staying with the play. So that was a big momentum mover for us.  
  
Q. Geno, just coming into the season, losing Tina was such a huge hole for
you guys. It seemed in this tournament, Stefanie came out 24 the first day, 24
tonight. How important was she for you guys to win this tournament, and
looking forward to the NCAA Tournament having her play really well right
now?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah, I mean, I think it's hard to win championships if you
don't have somewhat of a consistent scoring threat inside. Whoever that is, it
doesn't necessarily have to be a center or any particular position.  
I think what Stefanie has done is given us a little bit of a comfort level
that we didn't have probably September, October, November, December. We were
more having to make jump shots, have to get down in transition. Our half court
offense wasn't as comfortable in it. Now that we have somebody like her that
we really can count on night-in and night-out, we have a chance.  
If she hadn't developed to the point where she's at now, I don't think we'd
have any chance going into the NCAA's. Same with Bria. I think the two of them
playing the way they did this week says a lot about what our chances can be
going forward.  
  
Q. Do you think Notre Dame deserves to be mentioned in the talk for No. 2
seed?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I don't see who else has played a better schedule and had as
much success as they've had. I haven't seen every team, but I would put them
up against any other team that would be a 2 seed. So, yeah, in my mind I think
absolutely. Absolutely.  
  
Q. Is this as gratifying as any championship that you can remember just
because of what you guys had to go through to get to this point?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah, it is. There were a lot more areas that we had to cover.
In some years every mistake we made would get exploited and this is one of
those years, like 2003, 2004 maybe, 2005, '06, '07, whenever we won the
tournament those years.  
Any time I think you don't have a wide margin for error, I think it's
rewarding, because everything has to go right. You can see how easily it could
go wrong.  
Kelly plays one way last night, plays a different way tonight. Hard to -- it's
hard to predict how people are going to behave night-in and night-out. For as
bad as we played in the first half, to go in up one, I thought that was pretty
amazing. It really was. I was shocked, shocked. To get killed like we did on
the boards and still win.  
  
Q. Bria got her third foul in the first half with 4:00 and change to go.
Tiffany fouled with 1:00 and change. What goes through your mind? You left
Tiffany in because you looked on the bench and obviously there weren't a lot
of options. What's going through your mind? You know that's an Achilles. How
difficult is that and how worrisome is that?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, against a team like Notre Dame you just -- your worst
fears are going to come true because of how they play, how they get the ball
from point A to point B, and what they do when they get in the lane and how
aggressive they are.  
For me, we're trying to manage it so that we have enough offense out on the
floor to help our defense. I know we're going to be good defensively
regardless of who is playing. But trying to keep enough offensive players on
the floor is a real challenge sometimes, especially when you have two of your
best offensive players, Bria and Tiffany, with those fouls. Now you're looking
out there and Kelly's struggling, so it's Maya and Stefanie and that's it.  
Yeah, during that time I just kind of shook my head and let's see what
happens. Let's just play and see what happens.  
  
Q. (Inaudible)?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah, yeah. Exactly what happened tonight. We get in foul
trouble, we get killed on the boards. We don't shoot the ball particularly
great. A game like this could have easily gone the other way.  
So that would have been impossible the last couple of years. We would have won
a game like this by 25 points a couple years ago and last year, but not this
year. This year, if we don't have all five of our starters play well, we could
lose to anybody. I mean, not anybody, but some people.  
  
Q. Was there ever a point in time in the fall or first few weeks of the
season when you were worried Stefanie wasn't going to get to this point this
soon?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah, I think there were a lot of times watching her practice
that I didn't know how long it would take. When the season started, to be
honest with you, this is what I thought. I thought if we could get ten minutes
from Stefanie Dolson and we can get ten minutes from Heather Buck, that's 20
minutes.  
The other 20 minutes we'll kind of zig and zag and figure it out. So that's
what I thought going in, and obviously I don't have any idea what I'm thinking
about, you know, because none of that ever came to pass. Maybe that's why she
developed so quickly because she wasn't put in a situation where, hey, Stef,
just give us 10 minutes. She was put in a situation where you need to give us
30 minutes every night, and it needs to be really, really good.  
Sometimes that forces you to be better than you are, quicker than you want to
be. So you look at her play the last three days. Look at the player that
fouled out in the first 12 minutes against Baylor the second game of the year,
and that's not the same person, not even close.  
  
Q. If you had to vote for most outstanding player of this tournament, who
would you have voted for?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Unfortunately, I didn't get to vote. But I know who I would
have voted for.  
  
Q. In your 27 years now, have you ever had a player develop as quickly in
season as Stefanie has done for you to be able to play 12 minutes and then 40
in the championship?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah, probably only one, but she had a lot to overcome because
she was big, and slow, and not very bright and lazy and didn't work really
hard. It took a long, long time to get her to where we needed her to be.  
But Kara probably is the only one that comes close to what Stefanie did. And
Kara was MVP, not MVP, she made the Eastern all regional team as a freshman
after playing like four or five minutes a game in November.  
Other than that, no. No, no. As I said, this one might have happened quicker
simply out of necessity. But Kara was a dominant player, it's just it didn't
look like that because we had Rebecca and Jen and Nykesha.  
So it didn't quite look like that. During this time during Kara's freshman
year, she was a dominant player. And I hope that Stefanie -- Stefanie can't be
what Kara was because she's not as tall and doesn't have the same amount of
help around her that Kara had. Hopefully we can get some of the same results
though.

_HARTFORD, CONNECTICUT_  
  

CONNECTICUT  73  
NOTRE DAME - 64

  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us now from Notre Dame is Head Coach Muffet McGraw
along with Skylar Diggins and Natalie Achonwa. Coach, an opening statement,
please?  
COACH McGRAW: I was pleased with our competitiveness today. I thought we
really fought, we battled. We got down about 13. Cut it back to three, really
kept going at them, kept attacking the basket.  
I thought Natalie Achonwa off the bench had a great game for us, a double,
double. Frederica Miller gave us a great first half. But in the end we missed
too many shots. We got a lot of really great looks and shots around the basket
that just didn't fall for us. And Dolson, she really hurt us again. We thought
we were going to double team her, but we didn't get down there in time and she
was too much for us in the post.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for our student-athletes.  
  
Q. Natalie, can you talk about being able to come off the bench and produce
the way you did?  
NATALIE ACHONWA: When Coach came to me looking for me to contribute off the
bench, I just tried to come in and utilize the minutes that I was given and
tried to compete.  
  
Q. And Natalie, can you follow up on just what you take from this tournament
and how you came into this tournament off of a tough game and the way you
produced in this tournament?  
NATALIE ACHONWA: I think that that loss coming into the tournament against
DePaul gave us motivation from. From the git-go we knew we had to reprove
ourselves from our finish in the regular season and I think we did that in the
first few games. The first one was ugly. We came out and we gave DePaul a
little payback.  
Then tonight we wanted it. There was a stretch where they had gone on a run,
and that killed us.  
  
Q. Skylar, what is the level of frustration on your team's behalf losing to
UCONN for the third time this year?  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: Obviously, losing period frustrates us because of how we've
been working to get to this level. You know, we work very hard. And I think
this team had the mindset that we were going to win.  
I think we didn't play not to lose, we played to win tonight, and that is the
difference. Obviously playing against a team like UCONN three times and losing
is very frustrating. We know that was the end of our second season. We're
starting the tournament. We'll see where we're at on Monday. We can't do
anything but learn from it and move on.  
  
Q. Skylar, looking at the big picture, what do you take out of this
tournament that can help new the NCAA's?  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: The Big East is great for getting us ready for the tournament.
Great teams. This is an Elite 8, Final Four game, championship game with this
tournament. So we're going to take this momentum to where we're at. See what
we need to work on, and like I said, get ready for this tournament which will
be very competitive. But we're excited to get started and excited to get back
in the gym.  
  
Q. Skylar, as far as the missed shots, was it anything they were doing
defensively or you just weren't knocking them down tonight?  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: I think it was a little bit of both. We got them in foul
trouble, they got us in foul trouble, and we needed people off the bench to
step up. They did. They held it down for us in the first half until we were
able to get back in in the second half.  
In transition, I felt like a couple of possessions in transition hurt us,
maybe some rotations, just Maya and Dolson. So on the offensive end, we were
making some shots and the shots we took were some bad shots. The other shots
we usually make those shots, but they just weren't falling.  
Great defensive pressure. The Connecticut team's going to get up, and they're
not going to let you get the ball in the screen, so it was a combination of
both.  
  
Q. Coming in here, you had the home crowd advantage. Did you just want to
keep the crowd as quiet as possible as long as you can?  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: I think we wanted to play hard. We were winning the four-
minute games, I think. We were saying we have to divide it up. Like I said,
when you play a team like UCONN, the game can seem so long.  
So for us we were playing together. We had great positive criticism. We felt
like it was just the foul trouble that got to us early. But the crowd, I
really wasn't paying attention to the crowd. We figured it out when we came
here. We knew that.  
Just really playing with each other, and playing together, and playing hard.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Natalie Novoste's coming back from the injury? Is she
getting medical treatment now, is that why she isn't here?  
COACH McGRAW: Yeah, she hyperextended her knee, and she wanted to get back in
and play. It was obviously bothering her after that. But you know, she wanted
to stay in, so we left her in. I think it affected her shots a little bit down
the stretch.  
She usually makes a few more of those. We got really good looks and she did
what she needed to do. She drove it to the basket. I thought the beginning of
the first half really killed us. She got some good looks in the first half,
just didn't knock them down.  
  
Q. (Inaudible)?  
COACH McGRAW: I thought she really hurt us in the last game as well. She
played really well when we came out here last time. Had about the same number
of points, I think. She's a big force inside for us to guard.  
  
Q. Hayes and Hartley both had three fouls after the first half. Did you
think you can get them maybe in foul trouble a little earlier in the second
half when they got the fourth late?  
COACH McGRAW: That was our hope. Maybe that's why we missed so many shots, we
were trying so hard to get them to foul us that we probably should have
concentrated a little more on trying to make the shot. We knew they weren't
going to come over and guard us because they were in foul trouble.  
So we went over to attack those two and we did that. But Natalie was maybe
trying too hard to get fouled.  
  
Q. How much is what Natalie did in this tournament help you going forward to
the NCAA? She's another huge inside presence of a freshman that played really
well tonight and just the whole tournament?  
COACH McGRAW: I thought she had a great tournament. I thought she could be on
the all tournament team because she did so many things for us off the bench.
She's playing with a lot of confidence. She was a real force inside. You could
see she wasn't intimidated. She was encouraging her teammates. I thought
defensively she was trying to lean on Dolson, which wasn't quite as good as we
hoped.  
But overall I was really pleased with the way she played. She's a battler in
there. She's going hard after the ball. Got great looks around the basket. So,
yeah, that's big news for us going forward.  
  
Q. Can you talk about how difficult it is to knock UCONN's composure or
crack it? It seems like you were going after them, going after them, and they
never lost their poise?  
COACH McGRAW: Yeah, there is a certain comfort level at home that is hard to
shake. It's hard to win on the road in this league. When you have the home
court behind you as we did in South Bend, it's a much different game. I think
you're more comfortable. You don't get as rattled because you have the crowd
behind you, and I think that's a big factor.  
Also when you have Maya Moore on your team, I think that helps your poise a
lot. She made some really big shots. I thought she looked cold in the first
half, but then she hit some real daggers on us in the second half in that run.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S

### [C. Vivian Stringer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16227)

### [April Sykes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21809)

  
_HARTFORD, CONNECTICUT_  
  
CONNECTICUT - 75  
RUTGERS - 51  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us is Head Coach Vivian Stringer along with Khadijah
Rushdan, and April Sykes. Questions for our student-athletes.  
  
Q. Khadijah when you came into the game, I'm sure you saw Maya had an
offensive game last night. Did you expect her to go get into the flow of
things?  
KHADIJAH RUSHDAN: All great players do. We saw she didn't have such a great
game though, but she rebounded, you know, when things aren't going well,
obviously great players always find something else to go off of, whether it's
rebounding and playing defense or anything like that.  
So we didn't expect anything less from her than to come out and give as great
of an effort as she always does.  
  
Q. How much does the game plan change when Chelsey's struggling with foul
trouble like that?  
KHADIJAH RUSHDAN: It hurts us a lot because she's a great rebounder. When we
lose that, we lose a lot of you are inside presence. It's hard with them being
such a big team like that. And us having no answer for Dolson because she's so
big, and it really hurt us.  
  
Q. 18-14 midway through the first half, and then UCONN gets the three three
pointers in a row. How tough was it to overcome a run like that?  
APRIL SYKES: It's always tough when you get knocked down. Us being a young
team, we still don't know how to get back up and keep fighting. . We thought
we were at that level. Coming to the Big East where we played a couple of
great games. And here we just showed that we weren't mature mentally prepared
to face someone like UCONN. It showed in this game we didn't get back up. Any
time you play not someone like UCONN, you have to match points and play
defense in. When you're not scoring on offense, and you're giving up things on
defense, you're never going to win.  
  
Q. April, were they doing anything differently on you?  
APRIL SYKES: No, they were just playing UCONN basketball. The whole thing was
powerful. UCONN didn't do anything they haven't done against anybody in the
country. It was our mindset, and we didn't do what we were supposed to do?  
  
Q. April, with some time off now before selection Monday, what do you want
to work on, what needs to change going into the tournament?  
APRIL SYKES: Defense, rebounding, taking care of the ball have always been our
main focus all season. We have three main goals for our team, defense, rebound
and take care of the basketball. Let everything else come down on ourselves.  
I think a lot of times we got complacent on offense tonight. I know myself,
I'm just going to say I played horrible. I apologize to my team for that. It's
just everyone has to come together and play as a team. We can't get out of
ourselves and start going for ourselves or we're never going to compete with
Tennessee, Baylor and UCONN.  
  
Q. Vivian, playing off what April just said, what do you think you need to
do to be able to play with the Connecticut's, the Tennessee's, the
Stanfords?  
COACH STRINGER: Just like she said, one, play defense, two, be able to get up
when we get knocked down and stop the bleed. Handle the ball, not turn it
over, and recognize and execute on the offensive side of things. We didn't do
any of that.  
The big time players show up in big time games. We didn't show up. We didn't
deserve to be out there playing on the same floor with Connecticut. And quite
frankly, Geno did us a big favor by bringing in players whose names I don't
even know, and they still scored because the basic things we were talking
about, getting a front position, no.  
How are we going to handle this kid if we're not fronting? We didn't
recognize, we didn't spot. It was amazing. It was like somebody had blown
smoke in our face because we didn't even recognize where people were.  
In a man-to-man situation, if you have no one, you mean to tell me you don't
know to pick up something or somebody? I was stunned at some of the match-ups
that I saw. Guards guarding Dolson? And centers out there picking up a guard?
Are you kidding me?  
No, it was really I was really, really frustrated. We didn't show up. We did
not show the mindset. Honestly, we're not that young. We've got four juniors,
four or five juniors. That's enough. We only have two freshmen.  
Now if you want to count the walk-ons, they don't have any experience. They
were just people that we picked up in the recreation league. But they didn't
play that much. They didn't affect the outcome of the game.  
We can't say that they have more players than we had. I'm not trying to make
an excuse. You're not going to get that from me. It's just what April said.  
We have to pay a lot more attention to the details. We think we know. The
great teams know how to win. Every player on that team is able to get it done.
Keep in mind the last time Maya didn't do well, and then Stefanie Dolson
showed up, right? Dolson got 12 points, only got 12 points but nine rebounds.  
But, hmm, Kelly Faris, did we expect Kelly to get 19 points? Hello. Because
you have no slouches on that team. Everybody in their own right can flat out
get it done.  
So when you kick the ball to them, they're not trying to go outside of
themselves. There was nothing that they did, quite frankly. All we needed to
do was to do what we do, but do it a little bit better. Take care of the ball,
execute. Take care of the ball and execute.  
But as much as the game demands physical skills, the game also demands mental
toughness. We had major breakdowns. I can't even tell you.  
So ten seconds after the huddle, and we say we're going to do this, and all of
a sudden some people are playing zone and playing man. Wow. Nobody knows where
Maya Moore is. Everybody in the country knows where Maya Moore is, hello. The
truth of the matter is we just needed to learn to be sharp. Learn how to
focus, and get here and play and not make excuses. Too often in the huddle I
thought she said we said to stop it.  
It's typical, we've got to learn to accept responsibility. Accept
responsibility, go on with it. Not mind whose fault it is, and who didn't say
what, but to be able to get back up and get back up. That's very clearly the
things that separated Stanford, Connecticut, Tennessee, Baylor, and maybe a
few other schools.  
  
Q. Also, why didn't you press, Vivian? I mean Georgetown had quite a bit of
success with that. That's always been your signature. It seems that they were
vulnerable to that or proven to be vulnerable?  
COACH STRINGER: I know, I know. No, no, let me tell you something. I'm not
even going to say who. I'm ticked because we did know to press. But guess
what? We have people that -- how's this. Even at the point of pressure, we
press 94 feet. We're on the ball. How can it be that if that's what you do,
you forget to go there? Now that's deep. If there's two people on the floor
that have always got to be covered in our press, it's got to be both of the
wings.  
The other person's standing in space. Are you kidding me? If you can't be
alert for a game of this magnitude, you're not going to be alert for anything.
I'm upset. I'm just upset because we needed to be 1000% sharper and know how
to get hungry and to get after it. And we didn't. We were stunned and did not
recover.  
Why didn't we press? I love the press. We had already made a decision before
we walked in here. When we were at home, we didn't press. At Rutgers we did
not press but a couple seconds, right? Here we said we're going to press from
the jump. We were going to press from the beginning. As soon as we went into
the free throw.  
  
Q. At the beginning of the game?  
COACH STRINGER: At the beginning of the game. As soon as we went to the free-
throw line. But, of course, here's the problem. If we only went to the free-
throw line four times, we've got four shots, period. That's what triggers it.
Once we started, we stayed. But we only made one of the four that we've got.  
Now whether the fouls were called or not, it doesn't really matter. We only
got four foul shots. If we could have gotten to the free-throw line, maybe
made it, it would have started us ask triggered us off much faster.  
Then we said okay, since we're not getting to the free-throw line, as soon as
we score we're going to press. But then there would be breakdowns whether it
was pressure on the ball or pressure in one of those two positions, the wing
position. Why? Because we probably were thinking there were two people back,
the point guard and someone else.  
When that happens, that extends and makes the other people go down, but two
things that will make them have to come up, and that is to pressure the ball
and pressure the two people who are in the best receiving position. We
pressured one of the people that was in the best receiving position, but we
let the other one just get it.  
So now we're playing up and down the floor. 94 feet and we're in a run, a
chase. You've almost got to beg us not to try to track that down because there
was no way they were going to be able to catch up to that. Why that happened
is beyond me. So we were much more pleased. We felt much more pleased with the
effort of the people who stepped in, the little guards, the little people. The
little people that were in towards the end because they best epitomized what
we were trying to get done.

_HARTFORD, CONNECTICUT_  
  

Notre Dame  71  
DePaul - 67

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, an opening statement, please?  
COACH BRUNO: Notre Dame is a very good basketball team. We got beat by one of
the best teams in the country. I love my team, I love the way my team plays
out there. We didn't make enough stops down the stretch with the same stops we
made in the first half of last week.  
We had a tough time inside tonight. We usually get more done inside, and
didn't get a lot done inside tonight. It's tough to win when you don't have
balance. Keisha here showed why she's a first team All-American. She did a
great job of helping us scratch points any which way we could.  
But we are at our best when we have inside outside balance cooking, and we're
never able to get anything going inside.  
Sam was her normal, tough self. Again, I just love this basketball team.
Hopefully the crash and burn experience from one and out basketball that's
taken place tonight will get us prepared for the crash and burn one and out
tournament that starts a week from Saturday.  
  
Q. Sam, you spent the last 8 minutes of the first half on the bench, and
your team took over and made some shots to get things going. Was it tough to
watch that happening because you couldn't be out there? Or was it a blessing
in disguise because they were playing so well at that point?  
SAM QUIGLEY: I think it was a little bit of both. Not being on the floor you
feel like you're not helping very much. But I tried to help them out, and
Deirdre had defense. We were running because we were changing it up a lot. So
I tried to help as much as I could.  
  
Q. What happened on the last play when they got the turnover and they got
the ten seconds left? What were you trying to do, and what happened on that
play?  
SAM QUIGLEY: We were trying to get the ball up high, get to the top and make a
play. Mallory defended me really well, got to my body. She caused a turnover.
Keisha, she caused a turnover. We're both equal as players.  
  
Q. Sam, can you talk about the rivalry with DePaul. It seems to have become
one of the top rivalries in women's basketball, at least in the midwest.  
SAM QUIGLEY: Yeah, I think just the distance between our two schools is big.
We're one of the two teams in the Big East that are in the midwest. So that
rivalry has always been there. It's really competitive and always fun to play
them because they're always really good, so.  
  
Q. Keisha, 31 points, you made 11 of them and did it in a variety of ways.
Were you feeling anything special tonight? You knew you had to step up. What
was your mindset going in?  
KEISHA HAMPTON: I only had 31 points. But, I mean, it's still a team game. My
teammates found me when I was open, you know, Felicia, Sam, Katherine, Anna.
They helped me. I just didn't get them by myself. They all did things to
contribute to what I did tonight. I just did it in various ways trying to get
to the lane and shoot the three, post up. Whatever I could do to help my team
win.  
  
Q. There are more games to play, obviously. For Hampton to have this kind of
a game and a post-season setting, is there value in that moving forward for
her?  
COACH BRUNO: Absolutely there's value. These tournaments, you want to win
every game you play and you want to win these tournaments. It is experienced
one and out basketball, and that is what the NCAA Tournament is. It's what
makes the NCAA Tournament the great tournament, the great sporting event in
America. Fans love it. Media loves it. And it's great for the fans and media
because you get to prognosticate who is in and who is out. And you get to
prognosticate who is going to be where and all these games are lined up.
Except for one team on the men's side or one team on the women's side,
everybody else has a crash and burn experience.  
So it's one and out, and that's why it's such a great tournament. So this is
absolutely practice for that. This is the kind of game that you're going to
play every game from this point forward. It's going to be this kind of a close
basketball game, a tough basketball game. A basketball game that's going to
come down to a couple of possessions just like it did eight days ago, and we
were on top. It came down to a couple of possessions today when we weren't on
top.  
That's why it is of value because there still is basketball to be played. It's
always value.  
This is a great group of players and they've committed themselves very
strongly over the last five years to do well in the postseason. So it's really
why it is such a valuable experience.  
Notre Dame is a great rivalry, and something that goes back to Coach Ray Meyer
having played at Notre Dame. I don't know if people realized that, but he was
a captain at Notre Dame and an assistant coach when George Mica at Notre Dame.
That's how he got to DePaul. So this thing goes deeper than these five games.
Dave Corzine sitting back there had some great rivalries against Digger.  
So this has just carried over to the women's side. When you are in the
midwest, the three Catholic schools between Milwaukee, and Marquette, DePaul,
Chicago, and Notre Dame and South Bend, it's a Catholic three-team mini
league, if you will.  
So it's a great rivalry, and these players understand the intensity of the
rivalry, and that's really what the game -- it always means more than just
another college basketball game.  
  
Q. When you played at Connecticut, you made a comment in the postgame that
still stuck with me was that you had felt that you hadn't gotten it right in
getting your team to peak towards the postseason. Do you feel this team is
peaking at the right time to head into the NCAA Tournament? Did you get it
right this time?  
COACH BRUNO: I feel like we're in the process of getting it right, for sure
that we're getting better. We still are getting better. That's important that
you never quit on getting better. But truly, once you know you've peaked --
you don't know until the season's over. When you look back at the season and
say maybe that game on January 30th is our best game. Maybe that game on
February 28th was our best game.  
So you really don't know if you've peaked or not until everything is over. The
consistency that we need. We need -- you know, Notre Dame did a great job of
taking us out of our inside game tonight. Thus Keisha had to step up, and she
stepped up beautifully tonight.  
At the same time when you look down, we had nine assists. Usually we have 20
assists, 21, 22 assists.  
So the young man asked the question that left the room. He was here for a
question, but he's gone. See how they are. That's part of what you have to do
on the fly to scramble a game and just scramble a win. We want to put the ball
in Keisha's hands all year. We'll always be happy to put the ball in Keisha's
hands and we wanted to put it in her hands at the end of the basketball game
as well.  
It's not what we do totally as a team. We do more as a unit, and more out of
our inside game. If we that's why I'm answering this the long way about the
peak. I still think we can peak. There is a reason Coach Auriemma voted for
Felicia Chester for Player of the Year in this league.  
She still gave her blood, and guts and soul to this game tonight. It's just
that we weren't productive enough getting her going inside, and Notre Dame
deserves a lot of credit for that.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the impact that Achonwa had today? Can Notre Dame
change up it's strategy on the inside game?  
COACH BRUNO: We ran something in the first play of the game, and they backside
helped her. You know, that's what they pretty much stayed with. We were just
trying to spread the floor. Still had opportunities to get the ball in there.
We did get the ball in there. You've got to knock it down. You give them roots
and you give them wings.  
When the game starts, they have to have wings and fly. You get them the ball
and they have to make plays. When it's over with and they win, these guys made
all the plays. When it's over and didn't win, I'm proud to be the idiot that
didn't get it organized right. Because that is the way it works in the sport.  
At any rate, I just really think that's a huge part of the game. To be asked
about it strategically, we weren't getting inside in the first half either. We
didn't have anything going in the first half, second half at halftime, Coach
discussed it. We've got to get something going inside there. We just can't
count on dribble penetration and throwing them in from downtown even though we
do that well, you still have to have some balance going on here. And we never
were able to pick up the basket.  
We still win this game if we make some clutch stops. In the first half, we got
to a point in the first half that we started this game nine down and went in
six up. We 15-point swung this thing in the first half. We got into a rhythm
defensively where we were 1 and outing them and making plays defensively would
help people and scramble them and picking up loose balls.  
That didn't happen nearly as consistently in the second half. Once we get
through talking about getting the ball inside and having a balance, you've got
to still make stops in this game. We had some stops. A lot of stops made in
the second half that we didn't end up with the basketball. And they ended up
with the basketball after we rotated, made the stop and got the ball. Then
they're knocking it down, and that is where you're scrambling and where the
free throws come from. With all of that going on, we still make a stop here in
the end of the game, our two stops at the end of the game, and our one and
outs and we still can win this basketball game not having our inside game
going. We can see when everything isn't going to be rosy. That's what the
tournament's all about. Making it ugly. You'd like it to be pretty in the
tournament time, but it's often ugly.

_HARTFORD, CONNECTICUT_  
  

CONNECTICUT  75  
RUTGERS - 51

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with Coach Auriemma. An opening statement and then
some questions.  
COACH AURIEMMA: We really talked about how yesterday there were two distinct
teams that played. We played one way in the first half, and we played a
completely different way in the second half. Usually when that happens you
just have to look at whether or not mentally we're in the same place, whether
our energy level is there.  
This time of the year that is kind of the difference between winning and
losing. And today I thought it was there from the opening tap, pretty much to
the end. We just looked like a different team than we did in that second half.
We moved better, we were more patient at times, we were more aggressive at
times. Except for a couple of possessions, it never seemed like we were rushed
or in a hurry.  
Our defense allowed us to do what we did. I'm glad that it was everybody, that
everybody got involved. That it wasn't just Maya having to get 40 and the rest
of us stand around and watch. I'm glad everybody got involved and everybody
played well.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Maya, you seemed more aggressive from the start tonight than yesterday
and got off with a good 7 points in the first four minutes and surpassed
yesterday. Were you constantly trying to get more involved quicker?  
MAYA MOORE: I think so. I just wanted to run hard in transition, get inside,
establish our inside game. I have to do a better job of being more of a
presence inside. And that opens  
things up for us on the perimeter like gets us to the free-throw line and
helps us get into a rhythm if I can establish myself inside.  
So my teammates do a great job of finding me, and Stefanie did a great job of
screening for me as well. So that was definitely a focus.  
  
Q. Can you talk about getting your shot back tonight?  
KELLY FARIS: Yeah, it's been a while. It actually felt good to knock some
shots in. Kind of going off what Maya said, we were getting the ball inside
and out. That spreads out their defense and opens you their perimeter. So my
teammates did a good job of finding me as well on the outside.  
  
Q. You haven't had a lot of games where you scored less than 10. I think
five in your career. What do you like after those games when you have a game
like that? Does it bother you? Do you have trouble sleeping at night? And what
happened to your chin?  
MAYA MOORE: Just kind of got physical a little bit. When we were having a
practice, I kind of banged into one of my teammates. Yeah, so it's just a
little boo boo. Nothing serious. I slept last night. I was tired.  
But it definitely does bother me. It's not necessarily the stats, it's just
the way I played and overall the way our team played. It bothers me greatly
because that's how we determine whether it's a good game or a bad game, not
just on the scoreboard. You guys know that just from knowing how we are.  
I think it was -- we took advantage of it though. We didn't make that game
yesterday for nothing. I try not to make it for nothing by responding the way
we did.  
So I think we saw a big difference between yesterday's focus and today's
focus, even though we played two very physical teams.  
  
Q. Stefanie, given your size advantage, were you surprised that Rutgers,
apparently part of their strategy was to go inside and try to score over
you?  
STEFANIE DOLSON: I wouldn't say surprised. We knew they'd come out being
extremely aggressive. You know, they have two big posts in there. A lot of
teams think that they can beat me with their quickness. But I think I've
gotten a lot better on my defense, and just working on that, staying straight
up and not fouling. So I wouldn't say I was surprised.  
  
Q. Maya, you had 23 assists on 25 baskets. You don't do that very often,
particularly not against Rutgers in the Big East semifinals. Is that just an
indication of the zone you're in moving without the ball and passing?  
MAYA MOORE: Yeah, I thought we had a good feel for each other today, just
getting out in transition. I think Kelly did a great job of being in just the
perfect spot first for the pass whether it's me driving and kicking it for a
three for her, or Tiffany finding her inside. She did a really good job of
moving inside, outside which makes it tough.  
So when we have players like Kelly moving well like that, Michala gave a great
pass to Stefanie, and we were just clicking. All the practice that we do, how
much time we've just been working on our offense. It's starting to click in.
It's so fun that we can play that way, especially against a team that is
usually pretty good at getting the other team out of their offensive rhythm.  
  
Q. You had a great offensive game. But can you talk a little bit about the
defense you played on Sykes and on Rushdan that perhaps gets lost a little
bit?  
KELLY FARIS: Yeah, coming into the game I knew that April was under -- she is
their best three-point shooter. I remembered the last game we got beat on too
many open shots, too many open threes. That was something that we stressed
coming into the game.  
So defensively as a whole I know we took a lot of pride in it, and personally
I do. So they're going to get an open and they're good at hitting those
threes, some of their players are.  
It's one of those things that we stress, like I said. That was one of our main
goals coming into the game.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Can you just address 23 assists on 25 turnovers, particularly against a
team as good as Rutgers?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I think probably my answer is when we're generating some
movement and the ball's moving, that's kind of how we play. You know, that's
the way we've always played. Whether it's Rutgers or anybody else, I think you
have to sometimes be a little more patient. We were patient when we needed to
be. Sometimes you have to be a little more aggressive, and we were aggressive
when we needed to be.  
So we had a pretty good rhythm going. Once we got into that nice tempo, and we
have unselfish players that are pretty good passers. So you get nights like
this.  
  
Q. What did it say about Stefanie that they couldn't get by her?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, they were catching the ball in Hartford, and when
Stefanie was playing them from East Hartford. So she wasn't close enough to
them to have them go by her, which was part of the plan. If Stefanie can play
good position defense and she can get to the spot where she needs to be, most
of the time she's going to do a really good job with that. As the year has
gone on, she's gotten much more aware and more anticipating where her man is
going and, you know, she's not the greatest -- if you're not blessed with the
greatest quickness in the world, knowing where you need to be and how to get
there quicker, and that's what's been the difference in this last month, month
and a half.  
She's gotten a little more aggressive, and she's gotten way smarter.  
  
Q. Couple months ago we were sitting there and you were talking about
inverting Lorin and Stefanie on the end, because Lorin at 5'5 " was out
rebounding them considerably?  
COACH AURIEMMA: She was.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the evolution of Stefanie as a rebounder, and the
approach she's taking and the foot work? What's making her so much better?  
COACH AURIEMMA: When you're a freshman, and you're not quite sure what to do,
it takes you a while to get out of high school mode. So, November/December,
lot of silly fouls, lot of late to where she's supposed to be. People are
being very physical with her and knocking her off her spots that she wanted to
be in.  
You know, and actually started to work much harder in practice and push
herself a little bit harder, and expect more of herself in practice. She's
gotten more confident, and her confidence shows on the floor.  
You can't ever understatement what it means to be a good player. I would have
to say she's at her peak right now confidence-wise.  
  
Q. Two things, first, how much easier is the game when Maya comes out and
plays the way she does in the first four or five minutes. You can see she's
getting off. And secondly, do you think enough people appreciate all the other
things she does? Everyone sees the points she scores, but the rebounding, the
defense, the tip-in passes, the things she does that make her a great
player?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah, I think people sometimes focus on the win, the shots
going in. That's never an indicator of how well somebody plays. However, when
Maya's making shots, invariably she's doing 15 other things out on the floor.
What happens is you just feel like you're being overwhelmed by her. It's a
three, it's a post-up, it's a jumpshot, it's a steal in transition, it's an
offensive rebound. It's just coming at the other team from so many angles that
it almost looks like there's three or four of her out there. You're right.
That's what makes her so good is when she's scoring, it's impossible to figure
it out what to do with her.  
Even last night when she couldn't get anything to drop, she still got 13
rebounds. You know, she's going to find something to do to help you win the
game. Most nights it's everything, some nights it's just a couple things.

_HARTFORD, CONNECTICUT_  
  

Notre Dame  71  
DePaul - 67

  
THE MODERATOR: Notre Dame will face UCONN tomorrow night at 7:00 on the Big
East Championship. Joining us is Head Coach Muffet McGraw, along with
sophomore guard Skylar Diggins, freshman forward Natalie Achonwa, senior
forward Devereaux Peters, and senior guard Brittany Mallory.  
COACH McGRAW: It would be really hard to pick a player of the game when so
many people contributed in so many big ways. Brittany at the end, and the free
throw was the play of the game. I thought she did so many great things. I
think the go ahead basket down the stretch, Skylar penetrated and she did a
nice job on the boards. She played like a veteran. That was really great to
see. I thought Skylar came out in the second half. And we just attacked. We
played our game a little more in the second half. I was really pleased with
the defense on Chester. I think she had 20 on us in the last game, and we held
her to 0 for 7. I thought the double team was effective.  
But Hampton, wow, she can really play. She did an outstanding job. We couldn't
stop her, and luckily we had enough scoring on the other side to win the game.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for our student-athletes.  
  
Q. Can you describe what happened at that play at the end of the game on the
half court turnover?  
BRITTANY MALLORY: They had been running that play where they screen down and
came up for Hampton to go the one and one off the ball screen. I just cheated
up a little higher than I usually did. It was a loopy pass, and I got a hand
on it, and we dove after it, and luckily hit her out of bounds and we got the
ball.  
  
Q. Devereaux, can you talk about what adjustments you made in the second
half to become more of a factor?  
DEVEREAUX PETERS: I think I was just looking for it a little bit more,
stepping in front of guards. Lot of times there were little guards on me
looking for it. Just trying to step in front and get to the right spot. I
don't think I was in the right spots I was supposed to be in. A lot of place
that's we talked about at the half. I was trying to get to the right plates so
my teammates could find me.  
  
Q. Skylar, talk about the rivalry you have, the last five games were five
points or less, and last week. Just talk about how it's become a rivalry
between the schools?  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: Them being close to us and being such a good team, we know we
play them, and it's going to be competitive. We've got kids that play us from
chi town. They've got kids that are looking at Notre Dame. It's just a
competitive game. Everyone's going to be up for that game, and with it being
so close, we go there and we know their fans are going to be up and their
student section is going to be hyped. We come there and did the same thing.
Being in a neutral ground was different. It's still a competitive game like
you could see, and I think we were looking up to be able to come up with the
victory.  
  
Q. Natalie, can you talk about the difference between last Monday night and
tonight? And just how you were able to be mentally tough and deliver for Notre
Dame tonight?  
NATALIE ACHONWA: I think we showed up where it really counted. We showed a lot
of heart. Before the game even coming into the game we knew that we need
revenge. We need to get them back for last week. It slipped away from us last
week, and we weren't going to let that happen this week. I just tried to be
physical. Tried to shut down Chester. We worked on it trapping her, double
teaming her, Devereaux and I coming over for the trap. We took her out of the
game. She didn't score at all. Like Coach said, Hampton did work. But that was
a defensive goal for us, and we achieved that along with the win.  
  
Q. Skylar, in the last I think it was probably the last 15 minutes, you guys
started with a nine-point lead. You guys started a 9-0 run, pretty much at
that point DePaul took over and made 50% of its shots over the last 16 or so
minutes. What was different with it? Were they just making the shots and what
were you doing to allow them to make the shots?  
DEVEREAUX PETERS: It was a team thing. The team defense coming together. We
really made sure that at halftime we really had a talk with each other. And it
came down to team defense. Making sure we stepped up our intensity. Stepped up
our focused and made sure we stayed together in the defense and in the game
period. That showed the difference. We played with more emotion, we played
with more tenacity, and we just played with more stick-to-ittiveness. When you
play a team like that, you have to maintain that enthusiasm and focus
throughout the game for 40 minutes. We were able to come together enough to
escape.  
  
Q. That game in 2004, do you know what happened then?  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: That game against Connecticut, I believe. I was a fan watching
it. They wrote a book about it. So I don't like that book. Obviously we know
it's a great opportunity for our program. It's going to be great to a team
like that team, okay, UCONN. Yeah, we played them so many times and we know
we're going to be up and ready for that game. I think this is a great game to
beat a great team like that and carry the momentum into tomorrow night is
going to be great. It's going to be a great atmosphere for basketball, we'll
be up and excited and hopefully we'll come out with a championship and one for
Coach McGraw.  
  
Q. What, if anything, did you learn from the first UCONN games, and how much
did that help you tomorrow night?  
DEVEREAUX PETERS: First game, I think we could beat them. The mistakes that we
made were ours in the second game we didn't avoid that. We knew what we had to
do, we watched film on it over and over. We worked on it in practice. And
we're going to come out tomorrow, be intense.  
We have to start like we did in the first two games. We had great starts and
have to maintain that and make sure we stay together. I think when this team
stays together and we have people clicking, we're a dangerous team. I think
our best basketball has been has yet to be played.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the second half adjustments with Devereaux and in
rebounding?  
COACH McGRAW: You know, I think they got determined in the second half. I
thought in the first half we weren't getting any offensive rebounds, they were
killing us on the boards. We talked about rebounding at halftime. It was a big
push for us, and I thought both Becca and Dev did a good job, along with Ace
in the second half. That was our main focus that along with stopping Hampton.  
  
Q. You said it would be hard to pick a player in this game. How valuable is
Skylar down the stretch and setting a tone for you guys?  
COACH McGRAW: Every time we got the ball in transition, that's what we wanted.
She was attacking the bass set, getting to the foul line that was the best
shot she could get. She plays with the speed, her attack mentality, her
competitiveness, she makes a huge difference in our team.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the difference between Achonwa from last Monday to
this Monday?  
COACH McGRAW: I thought she battled defensively. As a freshman playing against
a fifth year senior, I thought she did a good job. She played with more
confidence than she had been playing in the last couple of weeks. But tonight
she was a completely different player. She was strong with the ball. She was
confident. I think the offense helped her defense or vice versa.  
But I think she played well at both ends of the floor, and that was a huge
improvement from where she was.  
  
Q. First off, where does Becca's status, because she went back to the locker
room, and also for you, I mean, you were the only one in this group that's
been around for the ten-year anniversary of it, and fitting that you play them
ten years later in the title game?  
COACH McGRAW: Yeah, I hadn't thought of that. That is very fitting. I'm not
sure what Becca's status is. I haven't had a chance to talk to the trainer.
But she's doubtful for tomorrow. But it's great to be back in the championship
game. It's been a long stretch for us, so we're happy to be there.  
  
Q. I was just wondering if you can expand on what exactly happened to Becca
and why do you think she's doubtful?  
COACH McGRAW: I would think it was her ribs. They took her back. I don't think
they had a chance to get an X-ray or anything. They brought her back to the
bench. But I think they'll probably check it out. We did have a doctor with
us, and he's probably with her right now. So we'll probably find out more
later. But she took a hard shot and a hard fall.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 6, 2011

  

### [Terri Williams-
Flournoy](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20559)

  
_HARTFORD, CONNECTICUT_  
  

Uconn: 59  
Georgetown: 43

  
THE MODERATOR: We have Georgetown now, Sugar Rogers and Coach Williams-
Flournoy, Coach?  
COACH WILLIAMS-FLOURNOY: I thought our team came out and played extremely well
in the second half, we teed up the game at Georgetown, we held them to 59
points, forced them into 21 turnovers, but once again we weren't able to
contribute on the offensive end, and that really hurts.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. How much did the big girl inside -- looked like you tried to do a couple
of things to stop her, how much of a factor was her being able to score the
baskets in the game?  
COACH WILLIAMS-FLOURNOY: It was 24 points of a factor. You know, so that's a
lot of points inside and we don't, we play "small ball" we don't have the
inside presence to stop a big kid like that so unfortunately when you hold
Maya Moore to 6 points and Dolson steps up and hits 24.  
But that's always been our achilles heel all year long we don't have the
presence inside to defend like we need to and I thought Adria Crawford and Tia
Magee worked hard in there trying to defend her.  
  
Q. Coach, what do they do defensively that causes you and everybody else so
much trouble that you can only put up the points you did tonight?  
COACH WILLIAMS-FLOURNOY: I don't know if they do anything, we're getting the
shots, I think sometimes they push you off the block and make you rush a
little bit but if you get 70 shots up you've got to make at least half of
those or 40/60, we can't make 16 for 70.  
  
Q. Coach, just like Syracuse, you started off strong in a different way,
this time, tying them at 5 and 7, and then 11 to 10 down, just like Syracuse
kinda struggled toward the end of the half and then throughtout the rest of
the half. What has been the difference?  
COACH WILLIAMS-FLOURNOY: We hit shots. We started the game with these guys and
Syracuse hitting shots, as great of a defensive team as you have the score is
never going to be zero to zero so we have to contribute on the offensive end
as well as we contribute on the defensive end.  
  
Q. You held Maya to 6 points, her lowest this season. What is it in
particular that you did?  
COACH WILLIAMS-FLOURNOY: We tried to limit her touches and crowd her a little
bit and make her have to give the ball up. We knew that Maya could hurt us if
she continued to score so we wanted to get the ball into other people's hands,
didn't plan on one of them having 24.  
  
Q. Sugar, what was the difference in the second half? You had 8 straight to
get it within 11, what was the difference between you and the team in the
second half?  
STEFANIE DOLSON: I think in the second half we played hard, in the first half
it was just rowdy, I guess because of the crowd, and in the second half we
played hard.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you,

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 6, 2011

  

### [Shoni Schimmel](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21814)

### [Jeff Walz](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19715)

  
_HARTFORD, CONNECTICUT_  
  

Notre Dame: 63  
Louisville: 53

  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us is Coach Jeff Walz and Shoni Schimmel, Coach?  
JEFF WALZ: Hats off to Notre Dame and their entire team, I thought they played
extremely well. They did a great job of finding a way to get to the free-throw
line and unfortunately we could not. You know, they shot a very impressive 20
of 25 from the line and unfortunately we go 3 for 7, so that's a discrepancy
in the game when you're trying to compete with a team as good as them.  
You've got to find a way to get to the free-throw line and unfortunately we
could not. I thought they played extremely hard. They played well, Devereaux
played an outstanding game, did a nice job of finishing around the paint and
Skylar came on and had a great second half for 'em.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. Skylar stole the ball in the half-court and got the layup in the second
half, what was going through your mind? How did that feel?  
SHONI SCHIMMEL: It wasn't a good feeling but to get back and get the offense
going was just the plan. I mean, it's not always a good feeling when you get
your pocket picked so just try and get out there and run the offense and get a
shot up.  
  
Q. Shoni you guys didn't quit and cut it to 6 at one point, can you talk
about the fight when you're down 19 and battling back and making a game out of
it?  
SHONI SCHIMMEL: I mean, just with the support that like the coaches and
everything and the team backing it up. Charmaine Tay came out and played her
heart out. For her to do that, it got everyone else going. We just went out
there and tried to keep going as a team and that's what we did.  
  
Q. In that stretch there was a stretch of about 10 possessions, you force
seven Notre Dame turnovers, can you talk about what you guys did
defensively?  
SHONI SCHIMMEL: We got our hands up in the passing lanes and that's exactly
what we did and we got big stops there for that seven-turnover possession and
we pushed it back at 'em and went at 'em.  
  
Q. Shoni, I haven't seen a lot of your games but moving and opportunities
off the ball tonight how did that give you guys different looks and how did
that adjust to what you guys planned to do and how Notre Dame responded?  
SHONI SCHIMMEL: Getting off the ball is a different look, and you've got
Charmaine Tay at the point position, she'll drive it, pass it she's working on
her jump shot but I mean she hit some tonight so it's pretty good for her,
so...  
THE MODERATOR: Any questions for Coach?  
  
Q. Jeff, looking at the second half you guys put a big emphasis on
rebounding, Notre Dame did and you guys came out strong and were attacking the
boards, was that a point of emphasis for you guys, something you wanted to
work on the second half?  
JEFF WALZ: Yeah, they did a great job at their place the first time we played
'em, they outrebounded us in the offensive end, our goal was to try and make
sure we made a presence of trying to go to the offensive glass, we came up
with 18 offensive boards but we only get 13 second-chance points and we held
them to 8 offensive boards but they come up with 11 second-chance points.  
So even though there is a discrepancy in the number of offensive boards we got
from them, the number of points we actually converted off of, were not that
big.  
  
Q. Jeff, when you guys played at their place you got down the end of the
first half and didn't battle back in the second half but tonight you guys
fought back and had a chance to cut the game to one possession in the last few
minutes, what does that say about your young team?  
JEFF WALZ: I was pleased with the heart that our kids played with, we had some
lineups on the floor that we normally don't play, especially with the first
half with the foul trouble that we had.  
I thought we just continued to fight, continued to play hard. You know, it's
something where we will break this film down and show 'em the things we did
well.  
Defensively I thought we played well, got our hands on some passes and if you
take away the steals at half-court, take away the unforced turnovers that lead
to easy baskets for them, they're scoring 55, 56 points and that's a very good
basketball team and that's really what we've been trying to emphasize this
entire season.  
  
Q. Can you elaborate on Devereaux Peters' impact, not just offensively but
defensively?  
JEFF WALZ: She played fantastic. I'm friends with her and her entire staff,
and when Devereaux comes to play they're as good as a team as there is and
when she doesn't they're average. Because she is such an impact player, and
for our league I hope she continues to come and play every night because they
can make a deep run just not in our tournament but in the NCAA Tournament. She
moves well, can score around the basket, can defend a guard. I've always been
really impressed with her and excited to see her playing as well as she is but
unfortunately she could have played bad tonight if she wanted.  
  
Q. Jeff, you wanted to remind them that as long as you went at runs you
could be okay and I think you guys did that fairly well, they had a 16-5 run
and you guys had a 16-4 run, what does that say about their poise?  
JEFF WALZ: The problem tonight was the run that we gave at the end of the
first half. We had a 24-21, going to the free-throw line to shoot two and
missed both of 'em and you just can't do that. Not against a team as good as
they are. Then we come down and get a great shot with about 40 seconds on the
game clock and miss it and then we get a defense set-up, they call a time-out,
force 'em into a shot they miss, they miss a second shot and unfortunately we
give them a third one for a stick-back and instead of going into half down six
we're down eight and they've got the momentum on their side.  
I told our players I was proud of how hard they played, really proud of, you
know, the fight they showed. We didn't quit. Now we've got to get back at it
and get prepared for, you know, what we hope will be an NCAA Tournament bid
and try and see if we can't win a few games in that.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 6, 2011

  

### [Monique Oliver](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20564)

### [C. Vivian Stringer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16227)

### [April Sykes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21809)

  
_HARTFORD, CONNECTICUT_  
  

Rutgers: 68  
Marquette: 62

  
THE MODERATOR: With this win Rutgers improves to 19-11, and they will await
the winner of the Georgetown, Connecticut game, joining us is Coach Stringer
and April Sykes and Monique Oliver, we will start with questions for our
players first.  
  
Q. Monique, the rebounds were even at halftime and you guys came out and
doubled 'em up. Can you talk about whether that was the point of emphasis at
the half or what you were thinking in term of going after the boards in the
second half.  
MONIQUE OLIVER: Only had one rebound in the beginning and then Chelsea had
three so we knew we had to step it up on the rebounding end. We needed to box
out.  
  
Q. April, what was the difference between the last 10 minutes of the first
half and the way you came out in the second half.  
APRIL SYKES: I think it was us getting control, like we said. When you
interviewed me a couple of days ago about the two-game bye, it could hurt us
or help us and I think we need to do get used to the atmosphere and stay
within ourselves and a lot of times when we go for ourselves it's not being
selfish but we don't realize we're doing it because we want to make a play to
help the team but in the end of the day we're hurting the team and I think
that's the difference between the first half and the second half.  
  
Q. April, can you talk about a possible match-up between UConn?  
APRIL SYKES: Everybody knows they're the best team in the country, we have to
handle ourselves, we have to do what we need to do, if we do what Rutgers
needs to do and play the best we can, that's the only answer I have for you.  
  
Q. April, can you talk about your play in the second half. You seemed to
come out aggressive. Was that the plan?  
APRIL SYKES: Yeah, Coach doesn't praise you what you're not doing your best, I
know that, the second time she got in my chest and she took me out first half
and let me sit the first twelve minutes or whatever, she told me I had one
rebound and I was forcing things, and the second half she told me to keep
going and get the ball until my hand and take my time and don't force a lot of
things and I was 10 times more relaxed the second half.  
  
Q. Can you talk about your offense production. You guys had 68 points and
good contributions from offensively your starters.  
APRIL SYKES: I think it's great because it's hard, we had 4 people in double
digits and turnovers, I had 6, I was overanxious and excited, I usually don't
get those turnovers, but when we have people scoring like that, we usually can
get all 5 starters to contribute more and we are going to be hard to beat, to
continue to rebound and block out is what we need to do.  
  
Q. You and Chelsea dominated inside, did it take a while for you guys to get
going today?  
MONIQUE OLIVER: In the beginning we weren't as aggressive as we usually are
and in the second half we came out stronger.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies, you're free to go. Questions for Coach now.  
COACH STRINGER: That's it?  
  
Q. Coach, can you address the difference in April's plays in the first half
and the second half and what that meant to the team.  
COACH STRINGER: When she said that she was more relaxed I thought that we were
all strained and pushing it. So rather than to let it flow, the offenses that
we generally run at the beginning are all continuity offenses, which means
they're not geared for any particular person, it's set the screen and whoever
has the shot will take the shot, trusting when that's going to happen.  
But we're in trouble when we hold it longer than we should and we hold it
calling for a screen because the continuity patterns do not involve that. So
when you see that that's when I say we're going tore ourselves and we're
struggling and when no one expects the shot, most likely we knew Marquette was
going to show high, and the turnovers were because we were holding the ball
too much and we were calling for a screen and they were showing high and we
started trip and go falling and that's a recipe for disaster, it needs to
flow.  
So I was uncomfortable at the beginning and I know that they were as well. I
was fearful that we would have a problem because we had not played and I know
that sounds crazy, but we did ourselves a favor in that we only played -- we
had a double bye. On the other hand it's a disservice because it is slower to
get things flowing but thank goodness we got that game under our belt. We need
to play extremely well and I thought we were sputtering against Seton Hall,
the score doesn't look like that, but that's the way we played. I have to feel
the game and it's possible for us to lose and I'll be happy because I'm
satisfied with the flow. I thought that we weren't letting it flow as much as
we have to. For this level of play, but I had a feeling that someone like
UConn is going to get our attention so we better let it flow or we're going to
have problems and I think we will, hopefully we got that one out of our head.  
  
Q. You were the last team to beat UConn from the Big East, you might see
them tomorrow night. What are your thoughts on a possible match-up with them
and what's it take to beat 'em?  
COACH STRINGER: What's it take? Um, I don't know, the fact that we were the
last team to beat UConn doesn't mean a lot, other than you have to bring your
A-game all the time physically and mentally, and I have to be on my A-game as
well, me and my assistants because Geno is an outstanding coach and his
players are clearly some of the nation's best. So we will have to figure
things out. If I had the key to that, you know, then I probably would figure
it out, wouldn't I? I'm not going to say right now.  
Do I feel good about the possibilities of this team doing a lot of things I
liked, yeah, like April said, I was hard on them just now, they know that.
That's the way we expect them to play and that game won't get it against UConn
and none of the top 5 schools. Where are you from?  
  
Q. Pittsburgh?  
COACH STRINGER: You're not a UConn -- dug to UConn, wanted to make sure that
you were trying to get me to tell you -- all right.  
  
Q. Coach you had good rebounding in the second half. Can you talk about how
that bodes for tomorrow and what it was that let you turn the turn the
corner?  
COACH STRINGER: It was obvious like Monique said, she had one rebound at the
half, April had one, how in the world are we going to win the game. One of the
things I wanted to do earlier is we wanted to get into our press and if we
worked with one post we could go at that and bring the other one. But the
rebounding was so bad and the only person that was constantly doing that and
if you looked at stats from the last time we played, they had gotten 10 before
and it's unfair to expect them to be the point guard and the leading rebounder
and the toughest defensive assignment, give me a break. I challenge them to
step to it if they didn't get it done in a few minutes we were going to see a
change in who was out there because what was the point of having two posts if
that's what we were going to have.  
They stepped up and they knew we need to do focus on that and we've had that
problem all year. It was good to see us do that and it was good to see us at
the free-throw line but we didn't hit as many as we should have, we were there
the first half four or five times and we need to be there considerably more.
We need to loosen up, let the game flow, attack first and then have the
opposing team respect us, that we will drive, and they stay back for that and
then we can knock 'em down from the outside because we can knock shots down
from the outside and honestly, I hope our "A" game comes over-night because
we're going to need it tomorrow. We're capable of playing better and we better
be able to play better against UConn.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 6, 2011

  

### [Skylar Diggins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20547)

### [Muffet McGraw](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14071)

### [Devereaux Peters](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20548)

  
_HARTFORD, CONNECTICUT_  
  

Notre Dame: 63  
Louisville: 53

  
THE MODERATOR: Notre Dame improves to 25-6 and they will face DePaul tomorrow
night. Joining us is head coach, Muffet McGraw along with Skylar Diggins and
Devereaux Peters. Coach?  
COACH McGRAW: Really pleased with Devereaux's game tonight, I thought they
played well defensively, the six blocks were great, we were disappointed she
didn't get the 10th rebound, but I thought overall she played well and I
thought Skyler hit a 3 that was huge in the corner that boosted the lead a
little bit and when she picked Shoni Schimmel at the point in the last minute
of the game that was kinda the last nail in the coffin for them. They're a
great team, they are -- they have got a deep bench, they pressure, they play
physical and hard and they're going to do well in the NCAA Tournament.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for our players?  
  
Q. Devereaux, you guys outscored them in the first half and it turned out to
be a 22-5 run, and I think you had 15 points or something like that. Can you
talk about what was there for you?  
DEVEREAUX PETERS: I think a lot of times I was open in the post and switch and
stuff and early on we weren't seeing it and Coach talked about it in the
huddle and we were looking for it during that stretch. Really I was in the
same places that I was before and they were looking and making the pass. I was
hitting them.  
  
Q. How difficult was it to not overlook Louisville with big matches coming
up potentially with DePaul and Connecticut?  
COACH McGRAW: I didn't look past them, I don't know. I think the thing this
team has done well all year long is focus on the game we're playing, and Becca
does a great job with her leadership but they come in to practice hard and
they come into every game -- I don't think there was any looking ahead at all.  
  
Q. Skylar, with about 1 minute left you had the steal of Shoni Schimmel and
broke away for the layup, what did you see? I know it was her first possession
back in the court and what was going through your mind when you did that?  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: We talked that there was a minute 12 left and my job was
picking up the ball and with her I knew she was going to be looking to score
so I really wanted to get on her and I looked for an opportunity when she
crossed it and I went forward, and that's just part of getting up and
pressuring the ball.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the control on those blocked shots and makin' those
kinds of plays and not getting a foul on 'em?  
DEVEREAUX PETERS: Obviously Coach wants me on the floor and I don't want to be
off, either, and in practice we've worked on me containing the ball and I
don't have to block everything and going in and looking at the stuff that I
can let go because part of the problem is I can't let stuff go, if they're
there I think I have to get it and make a stop and today I was focusing on
"Today I got a foul, I'm going to let her have it and guard 'em next time."  
On the screens and stuff, they can shoot 3s so we were hedging out and I just
tried to get a hand up and I had to switch a lot and work on my defense and
stay on the guards when we switched like that.  
  
Q. Skylar, talk about tomorrow night's game, you guys are fresh off the game
from playing them last Monday.  
COACH McGRAW: Obviously it's a good redemption opportunity for us, DePaul is a
great team, we know that from their record and, you know, how they've shown it
in the Big East play so we knew they were going to have a great game tonight
and it will be a great match-up again.  
We have to do a better job of contesting and getting out on the shooters and a
better job of team defense and those are the things we worked on in practice
this past week and we're excited for an opportunity and a chance to avenge.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. Did you talk about rebounding at halftime and how critical was that to
your success?  
COACH McGRAW: That was about all we talked about at halftime and I looked at
Becca and I said you need to get 10 and that's what she got. I thought she had
a much better effort in the second half and Monique Reid is a tough block out,
11 rebounds in 20 minutes and she was a tough match-up for her, we did an
awesome job, we didn't rebound offensively as much as I wanted to, I didn't
think the guards did their job, I didn't think Skyler, Natalie and Brittany
did their jobs on the boards, but the posts did.  
  
Q. Muffet, you talked about Devereaux tonight how much better are you guys
when she is playing more than 20 minutes a game because of foul trouble?  
COACH McGRAW: Yeah, she's a key for us, obviously, only sat her for 5 minutes
and a couple of in half and they went on runs when she was not in the game
because we didn't have the same defensive capabilities, she is a good double-
team her, good in the press she does so many things and offensively we can
throw it up and she can get it.  
Her on the floor makes us a very different team.  
  
Q. Was part of the plan to attack and get to the free-throw line?  
COACH McGRAW: Especially for Natalie, that's something she has done well all
year. In that stretch where we turned it over a bunch and they were scoring
and making the run, we talked about keeping the ball and attacking the rim and
seeing if we can get to the foul line.  
  
Q. Muffet, you said you weren't looking past that game but now that you have
the chance to play DePaul tomorrow night what do you have to do to have a
different outcome?  
COACH McGRAW: We have to play better, I thought Chester played really well,
she had a great game in Hampton, and Becca only played thirteen minutes, and
that was hard for us to have a freshman in the game guarding a fifth year
senior so we've got to stay on the floor with her and, two, I thought we did a
good job defensively with the exception of Chester so we've got to find a way
to guard her.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

### [Jasmine Collins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21808)

### [Terri Mitchell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21807)

### [Angel Robinson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18059)

  
_HARTFORD, CONNECTICUT_  
  

Rutgers: 68  
Marquette: 62

  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us center Marquette is head Coach Terri Mitchell along
can senior forward Jasmine Collins and Angel Robinson, Coach?  
COACH MITCHELL: We fought for forty minutes and the final score didn't end up
in our favor but we had nothing to hang our heads about, I thought we did
everything we could to win the game.  
They jumped on us early and we came back and the second half they hit shots
and we didn't. Like I told our players at the end of the game this league
prepares you for any team in the country now it's the next season of the NCAA
Tournament and there isn't anybody we will see in the first round that hasn't
prepared us because our league is so deep and so strong with so many different
styles that we will be prepared when that time comes.  
  
Q. Angel, you closed the first half on the 16-2 run, can you talk about what
led to that and why was it that you were able to not keep the momentum
going?  
ANGEL ROBINSON: Our team gets going and we get defensive stops and we've been
preaching that all year. When we get in the hole against teams it's because
our offense is not great and then we come down and we didn't get the stops
that we need. So they came out hot but we settled down and we up'd our focus
and got the stops and that's why we were able to cut into the lead and we had
to cut back into their lead each media and we executed.  
  
Q. Jasmine, you tied a career high with 17 points, what was it that allowed
you to do that?  
JASMINE COLLINS: I was letting the game come to me and I was focused on my
defensive rebounding and my team helped me and that's how I got the scores.  
  
Q. Coach, could you talk about April Sykes in the second half. She became
aggressive, was that the way you saw it?  
COACH MITCHELL: She did. It looked like from the first half she had -- I'm
sure there was -- they told her to be more aggressive because I think she had
7 straight points there, I could be mistaken, and she was looking for
opportunities to score not just from the three but any way, and her
aggressiveness took us out of the paint and opened things up inside. So when
she started hitting shots, we were compromised and it was able to open up
their inside game.  
When that happened I thought the game turned at that point.  
  
Q. Coach, team went on a nice run to close out the first half, were you
waiting for that run to come back the second half?  
COACH MITCHELL: I was, I thought we had it in us, and it didn't happen because
I know we can get defensive stops. It happened at the end but it was too late
then, and we put on the pressure and probably in retrospect we needed to
pressure sooner because there were several turnovers back-to-back and that's
something for me to remember. I just thought we had the shots, and we didn't
knock 'em down and I felt we were going to get to the lead. We fought every
step of the way, though, and no one has to feel bad about every effort that we
gave today, we just know it didn't go our way and now we get the rest, we need
to move on to the next season.  
  
Q. Angel, you got hit hard on the drive to the basket in the second half.
Are you injured at all? Is it going to bother you for the NCAA Tournament or
are you fine?  
ANGEL ROBINSON: No, I'll be ready, I wasn't going to let that stop me from
playing. Not in the NCAAs.  
COACH MITCHELL: Day in the life of Angel Robinson, she's tough.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 6, 2011

  

### [Doug Bruno](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15667)

### [Sam Quigley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20555)

  
_HARTFORD, CONNECTICUT_  
  

DePaul: 66  
St. John's: 54

  
THE MODERATOR: With this win DePaul improves to 27-5, they will face the
winner of the Louisville Notre Dame game. Joining us is head coach, Doug Bruno
along with Anna Martin and Sam Quigley. Coach, an opening statement.  
COACH BRUNO: I thought our basketball team did a great job and they got a win
over the Big 10 NCAA team and Kim does a great job with the program so it was
a tough, hard-fought game, my only regret is I wish I could have gotten Sam
off the floor more tonight and there were some technical regrets but in the
big picture -- that's what Sam does and we played her almost forty minutes
tonight.  
  
Q. Sam, you guys ran in the first 15 minutes of the game and then they
started to press you, what was it that slowed you down or allowed them to get
back in the game?  
SAM QUIGLEY: I think it was a combination of a lot of things, they were taking
us out of our offensive sets and they were getting a lot of rebounds,
offensive rebounds so that's something we've been focusing on this year and we
let up a little bit.  
  
Q. Coach can you talk about the prospects of facing Notre Dame again a week
after you had a close battle with them?  
COACH BRUNO: I really have to talk about facing Louisville first because
Louisville beat our butts and they did a great job of winning at the KFC a few
weeks ago. If they get through this game, they have the potential -- 25-point
win over Kentucky, that's a great win. If Notre Dame does win, that's what
tournament ball is all about, facing people within a week -- St. John's had to
beat a tough West Virginia team, they had to play a great game last night for
their victory over West Virginia and that's what tournament basketball is all
about.  
Our players played a tough ballgame on Monday night, it was a great win for
our program because this group has put together a great season. Yet losing at
Louisville and at Marquette we needed our collective psychees to come back.
Notre Dame is one of the best teams in the country as well and when you go
player-for-player, down that lineup it's a great basketball team. If they win
tonight we're going to have our hands full, they have three first-team all Big
East players, nobody else does so that should tell you something right there,
they have the defensive player of the year, they are just a talented
basketball team.  
  
Q. Anna, you guys didn't make a shot in the last 5 minutes and they started
to come back, can you speak about that? Your shots weren't falling and they
were maybe going to come back, can you talk about that?  
SAM QUIGLEY: They had great defensive intensity and they wanted the game and
so did we, but it was a tribute to them for their defense but if we stayed
together as a team we were going to pull it out.  
  
Q. Can you both discuss the fact that you're known as a 3-point shooting
team but when the shots aren't falling you were able to get other things done
tonight. What was it that you were looking for there?  
SAM QUIGLEY: This year it's something that we've been working on and it's
helped us is being patient on offense, getting an inside/outside balance and
just because they aren't falling doesn't mean there isn't something else that
can come to us.  
COACH BRUNO: It's important for us to establish an inside and outside game and
take what the defense gives us, they were sending a second player to Felicia
and she didn't score like they can but she occupied St. John's people and it's
huge for us to have an inside presence. The whole idea of this game is for the
three's to set up the post feeds and the slashes and vice versa, they're
intermixed and that's what we're trying to do and have been trying to do and I
think it's important for us to establish both inside and outside balance.  
  
Q. Sam, you guys are an experienced team, your senior class has been around
for quite a few years and you've pulled off quite a few wins this year. The
semi-finals thing is new to this team since you guys have been there, how do
you feel you're prepared tore that?  
SAM QUIGLEY: I think we're going to be prepared to play good teams, the Big
East gets you prepared and we've had that benefit for the past 16 games or
whatever so we're getting ready for the postseason and knowing that every game
could be your last.  
COACH BRUNO: Postseason basketball especially league postseason basketball is
a one and out crash and burn deal.  
It doesn't -- it matters in the questioning, it's a great question about, you
know, we make it into the semis, but when you're a player and you don't look
like it you're in the quarters, the semis or the first round. You know going
in if you don't get the job done tonight you're going home.  
In that respect that's why these league tournaments are fun for the fans the
media and the players. It's an experience that doesn't take place in the NCAA
because of the day off in between so it really is -- I think our players have
experienced -- they've won a game here, one of the only teams in the league to
have won a game in this tournament for the last six years now.  
And while it hasn't always taken them to the semis because we didn't come in
double byed like this, they have a good understanding now of ice bathing it
tonight and what they got to do tonight and Sam has to -- she's just -- I just
wish she would mess up sometimes and I asked her to do her final online at
midnight and she said "It's done" and we have other people that have to get
their finals done and she's already done with it. That's the kind of kid she
is. They are good student athletes and they've got to turn it around fast
against a good basketball team, whoever comes out of it.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, you guys.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 6, 2011

  

### [Geno Auriemma](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14072)

### [Stefanie Dolson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21811)

### [Kelly Faris](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21810)

### [Maya Moore](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19726)

  
_HARTFORD, CONNECTICUT_  
  

Uconn: 59  
Georgetown: 43

  
THE MODERATOR: With its win Connecticut improves to 30-1 on the season and
they will face Rutgers some night at 6 p.m. We will start with questions for
our players. Joining us are Bria Hartley, Vanessa Moore, Stefanie Dolson, and
Kelly Fairs. Questions for players. Somebody must have a question for players.  
  
Q. Maya, talk about the victory and how Stephanie played tonight.  
MAYA MOORE: I think that's one of the best part of our team is when somebody
is struggling like I was tonight offensively, we pick each other up and finish
inside, she got herself in good position and made some tough plays in there.
You know we had to pick up for each other.  
  
Q. Stephanie, the game looked physical. Do you have a tough time inside with
them because I know they were banging you real hard and usually when you
pulled the ball down it was trouble but when you kept it up high you did well,
was it physical inside?  
STEFANIE DOLSON: Yeah, but we knew coming into the game that it would be an
extremely physical game and coming into the game I knew I had to be strong
with it when I got the ball and a couple of times that I did bring it down it
got stripped so I had to get my mind right.  
Anytime I got the ball I had to keep my elbows out and go up strong with it.  
  
Q. Kelly, talk about the win?  
KELLY FARIS: We came out the first half but that second half was not
Connecticut basketball so it's one of those games that we had to pull
something together, unfortunately, and it's frustrating as players that we
know we didn't come out and play the game that we wanted to play.  
When it gets down to that, you know, we're the team that has to figure out a
way to do it and unfortunately it wasn't the best way but we got it done
tonight.  
  
Q. Maya could you characterize Georgetown's defense, it's the second time in
nine days that they put you through the ringer that no other team has been
able to do this year, what is it they do?  
MAYA MOORE: They're aggressive, they're long, they rush you and try to make
you speed up and make it a fast game. It was just a matter of us keeping our
composure, and when we did we got great looks. So it's about outlasting them
mentally, with the pressure that they put on you, just finding the right
player, cutting hard and playing more aggressive than their defense.  
  
Q. Maya, what kind of challenges does Rutgers present tomorrow?  
COACH AURIEMMA: They're also good offensively but they like to slow it down.
At times when we played at their place we struggled getting into an offensive
rhythm so that will be something that we need to focus on establishing the
tempo and the flow of the game and then rebounding and not letting them get in
the lane because they're really tough when they get the ball inside the lane
either by dribble penetration or to their post.  
  
Q. Kelly, when Maya is struggling, do you guys go "oh, no, we need to try
something different today "?   
KELLY FARIS: Obviously when Maya isn't normally getting what she gets at the
offensive end we as a need to look at it and do things a different way and
sometimes we struggle with that. We get stuck standing around and give her the
ball and wait for her to do something with it so it's something that we tried
to work on and sometimes we do it well sometimes we don't.  
There were times tonight we got stuck standing around and we've got to figure
out how to execute better than we have been.  
  
Q. Stephanie and Bria, if you could comment on your first Big East
tournament game that you got to play in?  
BRIA HEARTLY: It's a different level of intensity that you have to come out
with, you have to know that if you lose you go home, so you have to come out
and play hard. I think it's a great experience so far.  
STEFANIE DOLSON: Uh-huh.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach next?  
  
Q. Geno the offense has struggled all year but you always said the defensive
wins the game for you, can you talk about that?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah, we take tremendous pride in the fact that we are going
to play really hard on the defensive end and play smart and try to make the
other teams do something that they're not comfortable with or get their points
in a way other than the way they normally get 'em.  
I thought we did a great job of that tonight, you know, I think we forced them
into taking a lot of shots they probably wish they hadn't taken or, you know,
taking longer to get those shots than they normally would. You know, that's
what good defense is.  
You're not going to shut anybody out, but you can make it so that it's
difficult for them to get the shots that they want and to execute what they
want to execute and, you know, for most of the game I thought we did a really
good job of that.  
  
Q. Geno did you think the game would play out the same way as the game in
Washington?  
COACH AURIEMMA: It didn't, we scored 37 points in the first half, we were up
20, I think at Georgetown we were up 3 or 4 or whatever and for whatever
reason the first half wasn't like the second half, so the same team that
scored 37 in the first half gets 8 or 10 or 12 in the second half and to me
that's unexplainable, I wish I had an explanation but I can't explain it.  
I guess that's what happens when you play and how do you explain it? I have no
idea.  
  
Q. Rutgers is the Big East team that has had the most recent success against
you. Can you talk about the match-up tomorrow and what they do well and what
they've done in the past to have success against you guys?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Rutgers does the same thing year after year after year,
doesn't matter whether they're playing us or anyone else. You know, they pride
themselves in being really good defensively and they control the tempo of the
game and they really run their stuff, they're going to execute as long as they
have to get the shot they want and they make it difficult for teams to get
good shots against them.  
That's been their history since the first game they played in the Big East.
We've had a little bit of success against them over the years so hopefully we
can have a little bit more tomorrow.  
  
Q. Geno can you talk about the physicalness of playing Georgetown versus
Rutgers in back-to-back nights with only six players?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah, that's just the way it is. That's the conference right
now, you know, you've got teams that finish 8, 9 and 10 that are probably as,
you know, as physical and as good as the teams that finished in the top four
or five.  
So I don't think there is any easy games, I don't think there are any games
where you just come out here and you're going to get away with, you know,
playing soft, and Georgetown does a really good job of getting the game going
the way they want to get it goin' and they forced the referees to make a call,
one way or the other and that's an aggressiveness that you just -- you don't
see very much on other teams. They play to their style and Rutgers is going to
play to their style and it's probably going to be the exact same thing
tomorrow, you're going to have to grind it out, either team, whatever wins
tomorrow is probably going to have to put up with forty minutes of it being
difficult to get a shot.  
We're hard to score against, they're hard to score against so who knows. I
don't think tomorrow's game is going to be 90-89. I don't think.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 6, 2011

  

### [Barnes Arico](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20546)

### [Da'Shena Stevens](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20545)

  
_HARTFORD, CONNECTICUT_  
  

DePaul: 66  
St. John's: 54

  
THE MODERATOR: Joining me is Kim Barnes Arcio and Da'Shena Stevens. Coach,
opening statement?  
COACH BARNES ARICO: I thought they came out and took advantage of us early and
DePaul is a great basketball team. We were battling back all game. I was proud
of the effort our kids gave and we made some runs to try and close the gap and
make it a good game but DePaul has some great players and they did it down the
stretch.  
They came away with the victory but I was proud of how our kids fought,
especially in the second half and my best wishes to DePaul because they have a
great team.  
  
Q. Late in the first half you guys came up with some good defense and you
started slowing the clock down and winding the clock down, what else were you
trying to do at that point to prevent them from running up and down the
Court?  
Da'SHENA STEVENS: Our main focus was to get back in transition and they were
hitting 3's on us so just to find the shooters and try to rebound because they
were getting some second chances in the first half.  
  
Q. How tough is it with a team like DePaul when you have to guard the 3
because of their great 3-point shooting, and when you take that away they were
getting cuts inside and getting to the post players, for a team that has both
of those things?  
Da'SHENA STEVENS: It makes it hard to defend them when they're hitting their
shots, you go out to the shooter and you leave it open for the bigs down low
and they can finish and it makes it tough but you've got to try to take
something away and that's what we tried to do tonight.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about you did win a game in the tournament and what
that means for the team going forward in the postseason.  
COACH BARNES ARICO: I thought yesterday was an outstanding game for us, I
think West Virginia is a great program and for us to come to the Big East
tournament and get that victory was a great victory for us and helps our
resume getting into the NCAA Tournament. But we knew playing back-to-back, we
really exerted ourselves, spent a lot of energy playing West Virginia
yesterday we knew today was going to be tough especially the way DePaul plays
and the way they like to run, and I think that showed a little bit of fatigue
for us today, but yesterday was a great win and it helps us and it's great for
our team to come here and get to this round especially with the competition in
our league.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEDIA DAYS
(WOMEN)](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS+%28WOMEN%29)

  

## October 27, 2011

  

### [Coquese Washington](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18021)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
Q. With so many returning starters and co-Player of the Year preseason and
picked as the favorite to win the conference, do you feel like you have a
target on your back or do you welcome the position and pressure?  
COQUESE WASHINGTON: We welcome the position. Four years ago when we first got
to Penn State, this is the position that we hoped to be in some day where we
can start off the season truly having an opportunity to compete for the
conference title. So I'm excited about being in this position and I'm excited
about the challenge that lies ahead of us because our conference is really
competitive, and so it's going to be a tough challenge for anybody in our
conference to win it. And I'm just happy that we're in a position to do that.  
  
Q. How do you prepare your team psychologically? It's a big difference
between being the hunted versus being the hunter?  
COQUESE WASHINGTON: You're right, it is, and we talk about that with our team.
Last year in some ways we kind of surprised people. We snuck up on some
people, and we talk about that, that we're not going to surprise people with
how we play, with our style of play, with our talent level. So the challenge
is for us to practice and play at a consistently high level every day, so then
you don't have to worry about another team elevating their game against you.
If we're used to practicing and playing at a high level every day, both as a
team and individually, then we should be okay with having -- being a target.
We should be okay with being the hunted. So that's the challenge, and that's
what we talk about.  
  
Q. If there was one area that you're really saying, we need to get better at
to reach a championship level, what would it be?  
COQUESE WASHINGTON: Oh, no question, our defense. No question at all. We have
to be a better defensive team. We have to be a team that -- sometimes last
year we'd do some things on -- it can't be that easy to score against us. We
have to have a tougher mentality defensively, have a tougher disposition
defensively. And if we can do that, then I think we can elevate our play
overall.  
  
Q. You talked about consistency, and with consistency, I think about Alex.
Is it key for her to just really start that every single day? She's obviously
got the talent but a little bit of ebb and flow sometimes last season.  
COQUESE WASHINGTON: Yeah, definitely it starts with Alex. Yeah, she's the
engine of our team. She's the heart and soul. Everybody feeds off of her. So
she sets the tone, but I think across the board, I mean, individually you look
at so many of our players, Maggie Lucas was up and down, Nikki Greene was up
and down, Mia Nickson was up and down. It's not just Alex, it's all of our
returning players who played big minutes last year have to play at a
consistently high level. That's a task for them.  
  
Q. I know you work a lot on the big picture at Penn State. What's the
feeling there, and what will the feeling be to be preseason No. 1, have Alex
get the honor that she has received, Tori to have climbed up to where you were
for so many years with ticket sales and just the energy around women's
basketball?  
COQUESE WASHINGTON: That's a great question. Penn State has a lot of passion
about women's basketball fans. It's an athletic community that really supports
our program, and the energy and the buzz around campus over the summer, when
we got back to campus in the fall, has been really high. There's just a lot --
a strong buzz, and I think these kind of honors and expectations that are
coming from outside, I think that will just continue to help create a level of
excitement for us.  
And again, it's something that we enjoy and we welcome it, and we're going to
embrace it. We're not going to shy away from it. We're going to enjoy it and
embrace it and hope that helps us in terms of getting more people in the
stands this year.  
  
Q. This conference is loaded with guards. It's like a great big guard
picnic. What is the mindset for you in terms of preparing the interior game
and in terms of how you can compete there since there isn't the Jantel
Lavender's or --  
COQUESE WASHINGTON: Thank God she didn't have a fifth year of eligibility. I
like our post game and I like what our kids can do. I hate to sound like a
broken record, but it goes back to our post players being consistent. Quite
honestly, they need to be a little greedy. They're a very unselfish bunch of
post players and they're so willing to let our guards jack up all the shots
every night. I'd like them to be a little bit more greedy and determined,
especially on the offensive end of the floor. But again, it goes back to
consistency, them playing and dominating the game inside on a nightly basis.  
  
Q. We talked a little outside, for Alex to get the respect that she's gotten
with this preseason honor, I mean, last year we used to talk -- it was like no
one even knew she was out there, and suddenly she's got a spotlight. What
changed do you think so people understand really how great she is?  
COQUESE WASHINGTON: Maybe graduation of other players, quite honestly. I mean,
our conference has had some pretty good players. When you talk about Jantel
Lavender and Kachine Alexander and Kalisha Keane, you're talking about players
who played very well in our conference for a long time. And I think their
graduation opens up the floor for us to talk about some of the other good
players in this conference such as Alex Bentley and Karisma Penn, Jaime
Printy, players like that now can get a little bit more of the spotlight.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the impact of losing a player like Julia Trogele and
the intangibles she brought every day?  
COQUESE WASHINGTON: We miss her, and we see it every day, just the leadership
she brought. And one of the things that Julia did was she was kind of that
glue kid; she took the pressure off of everybody else. You know, if Nikki
wasn't doing what she was supposed to do, Julia took up the slack for us. Alex
wasn't doing what she's supposed to do, Julia took up the slack. If Maggie
wasn't doing what she needed to do, Julia could take up the slack. That's a
luxury to have one player that can take up the slack for all five positions,
and we don't have that. And not having her on the floor, she was a calming
presence for us, and so now, again, you talk about the growth of our team, our
players have to step up, and now Nikki has to be responsible for Nikki, Maggie
has to be responsible for herself. We don't have that veteran who can pick up
the slack for you when you don't get things done.  
And then her presence in the locker room. Her nickname was the German
Sergeant. She kept them in line, because Julia has German decent and they
called her the German Sergeant. She kept them in line in the locker room and
made sure they were prepared and focused and did what they needed to do. So
we'll miss her a lot.  
But I have tremendous, tremendous confidence in our captains, Marisa Wolfe and
Mia Nickson, our captains this year. I have a tremendous amount of confidence
in them and their ability to lead us off the court and in the locker room, and
certainly Alex Bentley will be our voice on the floor, and I think her growth
as a point guard will help kind of take care of some of the things we'll lose
with Julia not being on the floor.  
  
Q. The rest of the conference has selected you as the big dog, so to speak.
Who do you see in your mind, a couple of teams that are going to be very, very
competitive and maybe be a thorn in your side this season?  
COQUESE WASHINGTON: Whoa, again, and I can't say this enough, our conference
is so competitive from top to bottom. You know, last year you watched the
conference and you see there's no bad games. 11 beats 5 and 10 beats 3 and
nobody is surprised. And I think we're going to have the same kind of
conference race this year.  
But if I had to pick a couple teams, Purdue is going to be really good this
year. I think their depth and their strength and the way that they play
defensively, I think they're going to be pretty good. I think Iowa, you know,
they're returning everybody, and I think they should be pretty good. And
Michigan State is a returning conference champion. They'll be pretty good.
Ohio State, I think you can't count out Sammy Prahalis, and I know they lost a
lot with Jantel graduating. And then Michigan -- really every team I think
could be pretty good. You're just going to have to see how teams gel and how
they come along.  
But the one thing I will say about our conference is we have really strong
coaching in our conference, and I think that's one of the reasons that our
conference is so competitive. We have good coaches and good game plans, and
it's tough to prepare for teams because you know that the coaching and the
preparation of every team you're going to face is going to be so high. So I
have a very healthy respect for every team in our conference, every single
one.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEDIA DAYS
(WOMEN)](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS+%28WOMEN%29)

  

## October 27, 2011

  

### [Sharon Versyp](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16880)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
SHARON VERSYP: Just really excited about this group of players coming back. We
have six seniors and a well-balanced underclassmen, and just really trying to
rebound off of our season last year. Had about a month and a half taken away
from us, so we're just very anxious to continue really what we felt we started
at the end of the year. And obviously being able to go to Europe in August,
having ten practices and being able to play some games with injured players
coming back and some freshmen, we're just really excited to get underway.  
  
Q. How much of a leg up does a trip like you made to Europe give you going
into the season?  
SHARON VERSYP: Well, I think it can be extremely beneficial because we had all
of our players returning. We obviously had some key injuries last year, and
then now they allow freshmen to be able to travel with you, so I think it's a
big advantage if you plan it correctly. You know, and we've been kind of
pushing the trip back many years because of just certain injuries and certain
things. Just being able to gel and be somewhere else and really depending on
each other going into different areas of the country I just thought was just a
very, very big springboard.  
We got to do some different things, defensively do some different things,
offensively got to be able to experiment a little bit more, and we want to
push the ball a lot more. We finally have some players that can put the ball
in the hole, so we were able to do a lot of up tempo with a 24-second shot
clock over there, so the pace of the game and the conditioning of our game is
going to be very different this year.  
  
Q. Just a quick overview on some of the injuries and where they are since
the last time we saw you guys.  
SHARON VERSYP: Well, KK Houser, again, tore her ACL first three minutes of our
game, our first game last year, and she has recovered extremely quickly, very
well. She was able to practice all summer as well as play in Europe, so I
mean, she's still trying to get all her rhythm back, but her quickness and her
just being back on the court, she's the catalyst and the key for our team. She
was when she was a freshman, as well.  
Drey Mingo now is totally physically, emotionally and mentally very, very
healthy. She has 85 percent of hearing in her right ear. She only has 20
percent in her left ear. It's still very difficult for her to hear out on the
basketball court because of the sound and acoustics. So we're doing what we
did last year with her communication. She feels obviously like this is really
her time to shine because of all the things she's gone through, and I have to
say she is above and beyond playing, practicing, mentally tougher than I've
seen a kid in a long time.  
  
Q. I'm going to probably ask this to every coach: As you look through the
personnel in the conference, very, very guard heavy in terms of where the bulk
of the talent is. Speaking of Drey Mingo, where do you see her or push her to
kind of dominate, take over from an interior position?  
SHARON VERSYP: Well, for her, I mean, she's our go-to player, there's no
question. I think by the end of the year last year she really was able to have
a variety of moves down low. She can use her right or left hand. She can turn
and face the basket and attack, and she's one of our best three-point
shooters. If somebody that has great size is defending her down low, then
they're going to have to guard her away from the basket with that confidence.  
But right now she's so physical that it's going to be very hard not to allow
her to even catch the ball, and she's just -- again, has that mentality that
scoring is first for her, passing is second.  
  
Q. With the high expectations of this team having everybody back, how
competitive has practice been to this point?  
SHARON VERSYP: It's probably been the best since we've been at Purdue. Our
staff, we have 14 players, and right now every position is competitive, three-
hour practices are always intense. There's no let-down. I think it's the
hardest working group. So you're going to continue to get better because of
those things.  
And then there's some times you obviously can put a really small lineup on the
court and a very large lineup. So I think the only way you get better is being
competitive every single day in whatever drill you're doing, and every single
player doesn't like to lose.  
  
Q. What's the impact been of the facility? I know you have some festivities
going on of late, letting people in on what it looks like, just for your team
and what it makes them feel like and you feel like?  
SHARON VERSYP: Well, the Mackey Rededication will be 11/11 weekend. It'll be
an amazing festivity obviously for myself, being on Purdue's campus when I was
about 10 or 11 and seeing all the changes and kind of being a part of it right
now. It's wow, it's awe -- you walk on the campus and it's just so different.
You know, you walk into all the areas and you just -- there's just a different
mentality. We always had history and tradition, and we always appreciated
everything that everyone had during their era, but now it's obviously at a
different level. You have a championship mindset.  
And I think the locker room for our players obviously is one of the biggest
things that they enjoy the most, because when they walk in there they're going
to see the National Championship trophy, they're going to see all the former
Big Ten championships, they have to walk through an area where they're going
through history and tradition and everyone that played before them. So it's
just a different type of pride and tradition that's in their minds every time
they step into that room.  
And then Mackey is just different. The court is totally different, has more
black to it. One side where the media was has leather chair backs and then
some gold on the bottom, gold chair backs, and it looks bigger, it's exciting.
So every time when people do come back, I just think they're going to be so
amazed and so proud.  
  
Q. Parity is the term that's been used with this conference for a very, very
long time. This season in particular what's your strength? What sets you
apart?  
SHARON VERSYP: I think our depth and experience can separate us a little bit.
We've always been a defensive team. If we haven't had people that can score
the basketball, I think our defense has always been a positive. And I think
this year we're going to have about five or six scorers that we haven't had
before. So other teams have the same mix, but I think with our experience and
different players in different slots, I think we have some good things going
for us.  
  
Q. Courtney Moses was kind of thrown into the fire last year playing the
point guard position. Where do you see her game now in year two and where do
you see her playing with KK on the floor?  
SHARON VERSYP: Well, I think her mentality of the entire game has grown, which
that's what we needed. She's a scoring point guard, and I think that was very
big for us last year, and now she's starting to understand that she needs to
set up other players and how to get the ball inside to a Drey or Antionette or
Alex, and now playing side by side with KK, KK is the quickness, the
excitement, the defender, and now Courtney can play some two. So Brittany
Rayburn doesn't have to play 35, 30 minutes. Courtney can get up and down the
court. And right now when you just start practice, she's our best three-point
shooter. I think anytime you have that much experience as a freshman and have
to play a point guard position, then you just understand everybody's role, and
you can see that she continues to build off of that.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEDIA DAYS
(WOMEN)](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS+%28WOMEN%29)

  

## October 27, 2011

  

### [Sunny Smallwood](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22738)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
SUNNY SMALLWOOD: First of all, as you can see, I'm not Coach Yori. I'm sure
that's who you would like to expect up here, but considering her circumstances
with her issues with her recent knee surgery, I am replacing her today. She is
doing better, just so you know, and I'd be happy to answer any questions about
her health. But she's doing better and at practices now, and we're happy to
have her back and her bark back, as well, and we're excited about that.  
But in terms of this season and what we're excited about is the fact that we
have a tremendous point guard that's going to be leading us this season, and
we're going to be also returning Lindsey Moore at that position, who will be
leading us, and I'm sure for any of you who have followed us in the Big 12
know that she was an honorable mention pick in the Big 12. And then we also
have a returner in Jordan Hooper, who was an All-Freshman pick for us, as a
sophomore this year returning. And then we also have another young lady named
Kaitlyn Burke, who's going to be a fifth-year senior in our program who's
going to be a tremendous leader for us this year, which we're very excited
about, because with our young team, that's going to be a crucial thing for us.  
We do have four tremendous incoming freshmen who were a top-25 recruiting
class that are going to provide some impact for us, and we're very pleased
about that. So on behalf of Coach Yori, I'd like to open it up for questions.  
  
Q. Do you expect Connie To be coaching the first exhibition, and when do you
expect her back on the sidelines? And how have you guys managed without her?  
SUNNY SMALLWOOD: To answer your first question, yes, we do expect her to be on
the sidelines coaching that first exhibition game. We are all in the process
of determining how that's going to be. She's currently on the sidelines in
practice, either on crutches or in a little cart, if you will, and so she kind
of zooms around on this little cart or on crutches. So far she hasn't taken
anybody out, which is nice.  
So we're currently determining -- we know she can't sit on the bench because
she doesn't have a lot of flexion, which is partly why she's not here today,
she can't travel. So we're determining whether she'll be standing kind of at
the front of the bench next to the scorer table or possibly on that little
cart maybe under the scorer table right away. But she definitely will be
coaching that first game.  
At practices it's been great. We have such an amazingly driven team. We have a
great group of leaders. As I mentioned already, Kaitlyn Burke, our fifth-year
senior, also Harleen Sidhu is a returner, who's given us great leadership,
even though she's not quite cleared but almost cleared from a PCL injury. And
then also Lindsey Moore, who is providing tremendous leadership and stepping
up her leadership I might add.  
Even though we're young, the kids are passionate, they're driven, they know
where they're headed, and I might also add that the staff has ben incredibly
engaged in doing their jobs in a very top-notch way.  
  
Q. You're obviously brand new to the conference. What is your assessment of
the Big Ten Conference overall, of these teams, and how does that compare to
where you're coming from, from the Big 12?  
SUNNY SMALLWOOD: First of all, we are very honored to become a part of the Big
Ten conference. You know, to come from the esteemed Big 12 and then enter the
amazing tradition of the Big Ten Conference, we couldn't be more excited. I
mean, it's going from one great conference to another great conference. Having
had eight teams in the Big Ten make it to postseason last year, tremendous
representation, and it sounds like they're on track. What we know of them so
far is mostly what we know on paper. Obviously we haven't had the opportunity
to do a lot of video, a lot of scouts or anything like that yet, but on paper
there is a lot of class, and they return a lot of top-notch players. So we
know it's going to be a tough conference, and we're extremely excited about
the fact that it's going to be very competitive. We feel like we're going to
fit in and we're going to compete very nicely.  
  
Q. I'm going to help your scouting report a little bit. It's a very guard,
guard-oriented conference, a lot of really, really strong guards, but
obviously having graduated some post players that were key in a lot of areas,
it kind of leaves a lot of people to question just how strong we'll be in the
post. How do you consider your team? How does Nebraska kind of fit into that
landscape? And what are you looking for in terms of playing the game from the
inside out?  
SUNNY SMALLWOOD: You know, if I were to tell you about Nebraska, which is
really fun for us, we, too, are -- we're fast and we're versatile, so we're
going to probably be guard-oriented, if you will, but our post players are
going to be -- they're going to be fast and versatile. We're not a big team by
any means, but what we do have inside, again, I will just say, again, fast and
versatile. They can play inside, they can play outside, and so that's going to
be the style of our game. It's going to be up tempo, offensively and
defensively, and that's how we plan to attack.  
  
Q. Last year was kind of a transition year for you guys after graduating
Kelsey Griffin and Yvonne Turner, a lot of young players got experience. What
did you learn about your team through last season that will help them from a
confidence standpoint this season?  
SUNNY SMALLWOOD: I think that it was a little bit about what we learned about
our team and what our team learned about us as a staff, and that is Coach
Yori, she is a person of toughness, a person who is going to expect a great
effort, and of course she recruits players of great character, and that's the
team that we developed throughout the last season.  
And then when you put this new group of freshmen with the team that we really
worked on developing last season, I think that that's the group that you're
going to see when we put on the floor this year. That's the seasoning we're
hoping to put out there. Until you put them out there you don't know how it's
going to pay off. Of course we're hoping that the foreign tour will help us
with our chemistry, bringing them all together. We're still going to be
extremely young, so that's always a fun-filled adventure. But we're excited
about them, and we're enjoying coaching them, and so that's what we're looking
at.  
  
Q. You guys had a summer tour. Talk about what you learned from your team,
how that will help you going into the season and into these practices. And
also, what have you seen from Jordan Hooper improve from last year to this
year?  
SUNNY SMALLWOOD: I think from the minute we took the court going into the
summer, we gotten days of practice, of course, for the summer tour, and we
utilized that very well. We had two-a-days for each one of those ten days,
which we felt like was very important with that young team. And from the first
practice, we already discovered a very big change of intensity, a very big
level of passion, and I think that was partly due to the incoming freshmen.
They just are a group that loves to compete. They have great skill, and they
don't like to lose. And if you look at the résumés of each one of them, that's
partly what they bring for us.  
And so they're adding something to it right away along with the group that we
return. So from that group going into the summer, that was one of the things
that we noticed right away, just how we practice, and that's a value that
Coach Yori brings to our team, is that what's important to her is that we be a
great practicing team every single day, and that if we do that, she expects
that we will show results.  
So when we went into the summer, we felt like after that summer of those 19
practices that we were able to have and then getting to play four games
overseas, we just noticed that we stayed big-picture mostly when we did our
practices, so we had mostly everything in, which again, with our situation,
with Connie being out, it really paid off for us because the kids had already
heard their voice, they had her voice in their head, so that paid off for us
as her assistant coaches having to take over for a couple months here, and
then that transition has been that much easier for all of us throughout that
time.  
I think, too, in terms of just knowing what the expectation was, it really
paid off having that system in.  
Did I answer your question?  
Jordan Hooper, thank you for reminding me.  
I think Jordan Hooper, what we're really excited about Jordan, she already is
an offensive presence. I think most all of you probably know that, but what
we're excited about in terms of what she's improved about her offense is her
ability to put the ball on the floor. She has really improved that aspect of
her game. And then she was already a really good rebounder, which I think
she's continuing to improve on that, but she herself has stated she wants to
be a better defensive player, and I think she's making a big commitment to
that.  
  
Q. Regarding recruiting now with the change from the Big 12 to the Big Ten,
does that change your recruiting base and your recruiting landscape?  
SUNNY SMALLWOOD: I think what it does is it adds to it. We're right in the
middle, and so we have that ability to recruit from almost anyplace. We have a
staff that has ties to almost everywhere in the country, which is a benefit,
but now that we're in the Big Ten, we have that ability to venture into Big
Ten country, and so I think it just expands to what we're capable of doing. I
think that's going to be an advantage for us. And we're definitely trying to
take advantage of it.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEDIA DAYS
(WOMEN)](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS+%28WOMEN%29)

  

## October 27, 2011

  

### [Suzy Merchant](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17249)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
SUZY MERCHANT: We're excited about the season. I think having the opportunity
to practice a little bit earlier for the second straight year has been a
positive thing for us. Our team is a little different this year compared to
last year. We lost some leadership and certainly some key players. At the same
time we're really excited about our youth. We went from a team that was pretty
guard intensive to a team that has some power post opportunity and very long
and athletic, really from the 2 through 5 positions.  
So we're excited about our length, we're excited about our athleticism,
certainly getting Madison Williams back, as she was injured last year right
before we started the season, will make a big difference for us. We have the
Defensive Player of the Year back in Lykendra Johnson and certainly just a
special player.  
  
Q. You talked about your team getting a little bit bigger, a little bit
longer athletically. Across the board in the conference it seems like it's
almost a guard-oriented league right now coming into this year. Can you talk
about what you see as a guard versus post across the board in the league right
now?  
SUZY MERCHANT: Well, I think probably the biggest difference is just the 4
position. If your 4 man is a face-up 4 or if they're a power 4, the one nice
thing for us is we have the ability to have size in that position but be a
face-up position, too. We have some pretty talented kids that play that 4 spot
for us, Lykendra can go back and forth between that position, certainly for us
probably the most impactful freshman we've had so far has been Becca Mills.
She probably has a really good chance to start for us at the 4 position. But
she's 6'4" and unbelievably talented and can shoot threes, handle the ball,
pull-up jumpers and then she can post, as well.  
I think that versatility is probably the biggest word that you would use in
terms of guard versus post-oriented team, and we used that versatility to our
advantage last year. We lost Madison Williams, we moved Lykendra into the 5
position. She was a 3 and moved her to a 5 and became a very guard-oriented
type offense and spread the floor a little bit more and shot a lot more threes
than we had in the past.  
I think we're a team -- the nice thing about our team, I think we're two teams
within a team. We have that power game and that size. At the same time we can
also put a team out there that's very versatile that can be a very guard-
oriented team at the same time.  
  
Q. Just the rule changes with the arc and the three-point line, and also
they're going to use the experimental rule with the ten seconds. Just kind of
your thoughts on some of those changes and how they'll impact the game.  
SUZY MERCHANT: Yeah, I'm against the 10-second rule in the backcourt for
women. I think we have a 30-second shot clock. That's a pretty fast pace, and
I don't think that's really necessary for our game.  
The three-point line, I've said this before, I don't think it's going to
affect the game that much because you had two lines out there, and to be
honest, our kids, we shot behind the men's line more times than we didn't. I
went back and watched some footage when I got my first question about that,
and really it wasn't -- most of our shots were from behind their arc. I don't
think it'll be as significant as maybe what people are thinking it'll be.  
Do I think field-goal percentages from the arc will go down? Yes, but they
have anyway because kids play a lot of summer ball and they don't spend as
much time individually in the gym with repetition on getting their shots up.
That's just across the board. I don't think it has anything to do with moving
the line.  
  
Q. Are you able to evaluate Madison at this point versus the player you
recruited and where she is health-wise with her game?  
SUZY MERCHANT: You know, she's probably about 80, 85 percent right now. They
went back in in June and cleaned up some things in her knee that were a little
bit of an issue for her. That set her back about four more weeks. But at the
same time, she's tough, she sat a whole year. It was really important on
October 2nd when we were able to start practice that she was on the floor and
not in the corner riding a bike or lifting her leg up and down. Just the
mental aspect of being part of the team in a role that was significant was
important, and we accomplished that goal. And she's been doing every single
drill we have, every scrimmage session. Her biggest issue is getting her lungs
back, getting her in a position where she can go up and down for longer
periods of time for an aerobic pace. That's our biggest challenge right now.  
  
Q. You talked about your versatility being a strength, but also defense has
always been really the cornerstone for what you're doing. However, in a very
guard-oriented or at least a lot more guard-focused up and down, a lot of
coaches talk about being a lot more up and down this season, does that change
things for you defensively, are you looking at or stressing putting more
pressure on the ball in the backcourt or anything at all defensively that you
think you're going to have to do to be even more competitive than you have
been from a defensive position?  
SUZY MERCHANT: I think we're pretty proud of our defense at Michigan State,
and we've statistically been the best team in the league defensively in most
categories certainly last year, and rebounding, as well. Those two things. We
were plus-8 rebounding, which was top ten in the country and didn't start
anyone over 6'1".  
Am I emphasizing more? Sure, I think I'm doing a lot more teaching this year
than I've had to do in the past just because we've had more of a veteran group
and understanding, so slowing down a little bit more. Working on our bigs
being able to handle perimeter players, that's something that is -- we do
every day, closeouts every single day, defending down screens, flare screens,
double stags, and Madison has got to be able to do that, Becca has got to be
able to do that, Jasmine Hines got to be able to do that.  
So our big post players have to be able to handle situations that are going to
put them away from the basket, and that's the way the game has gone, and you
don't want to render someone ineffective.  
So our biggest thing defensively right now is maybe less about what other
people are doing but what are we going to be able to accomplish with some key
people on the floor with their size and not be put in a position where we're
compromised defensively.  
I haven't gone through a lot of that with Allyssa DeHaan. I feel like we're
pretty equipped and we understand like that's going to happen. We certainly
open up the year with Villanova in New York City and Villanova is a five-out
team, flare screens, curls, flips, we understand that we're going to get it
right out of the gate. We're used to that.  
And then there's teams in our league that really run kind of that motion,
five-out-type offense. A lot of our veteran kids understand how important it
is to be able to guard your man one-on-one, and at the same time be in held
position, so we've focused a lot on that.  
  
Q. You lost three significant players but none more significant than losing
a four-year starter at the point guard position, and Jasmine Thomas has come
along and I know you have a freshman coming in. Where do you see that position
coming in in regards to your team and the success of your team?  
SUZY MERCHANT: Yeah, that's a great question. That's probably the key for us.
Inexperience is the best word for it. Jasmine has played a backup role for us
for two years and has done a good job, but she's never been relied on night in
and night out for performance, and to run a team, and she's had some up and
downs and some challenges. Our freshman coming in out of Chicago, I just love
her, Kiana Johnson. She's got a swagger, a confidence about her. She
understands the game. She's quick. She can score deep threes. She can get to
the rim. How is she as a leader? I think that'll be her biggest challenge, but
I can tell you this, this is a team that is behind her, and they've verbally
talked to her about stepping forward. They're behind her. They want her to
lead them. It doesn't matter how old they are. They know how important it is
for a point guard to be that strong leader, and they've kind of opened the
door for her to step through, and she's doing it.  
You're right, that's a key position for us that you lose a four-year starter
at the point guard position as important as Kalicia was, as important as
Cetera was, there's something about a point guard that can just carry a
presence, and that's the unknown for us certainly.  
  
Q. Going back to Lykendra Johnson, are you anticipating her getting a
significant number of minutes at three this year than with maybe being on the
court with her and Madison and Becca?  
SUZY MERCHANT: Yeah, there's some things we can do offensively and defensively
that put her in a position to do that, to go have the opportunity to go back
and forth. I think early on we'll kind of keep her in that post position just
because of her leadership. She's coming off her best numbers and most
significant numbers in a Spartan uniform, so to change her position kind of
wouldn't make a whole lot of sense.  
I've had experience with that. I did that with Cal trying to get her on the
court in the past where maybe we had an Aisha Jefferson, Loren Aitch, Allyssa
DeHaan, kept those kids and I put Cal at the 3 one year. She just wasn't as
impactful. And not saying that L.J. can't play that because her first two
years she was a 3 man. But she's coming off a significant Defensive Player of
the Year Award and then turn around and put that as a double-double number
basically night in and night out for us and a First Team All-Conference
performer. I think our focus is going to be keeping her where she's at and
building from there.  
  
Q. I have to ask you about last week. The football break team beating
Wisconsin, you're so close with the men's team, the football team. Were you
there, and what's that experience been like for your team to sort of
experience what that was like?  
SUZY MERCHANT: Yeah, we've had two really great back-to-back weekends there in
football. We beat our rival at U of M and then turned around and had the
Wisconsin Badger game. I was actually on the 10-yard line. I had some duties
with homecoming, and so I was at the 10-yard line, at the end that it
happened, so I couldn't tell if he was over the line or not. But I was like
about 20 yards from where the officials were kind of in their little circle
there. And I just thought to myself as a coach, they're never going to call
this a touchdown, right, they've got to play it out. But that replay is just
really impressive, that they can do that and get the call right.  
I've never been to a game with 77,000 people, after that happened and the
cheering took place, nobody left, nobody moved. It was probably a combination
of the shock and the awe of what just happened, at the same time just watching
those boys celebrate, and nobody left. It was like 15, 20 minutes before
anybody started to file out. It was just an amazing night. Those are plays
that championships are made of right now. That's how championships are won.
You just need that one little thing to go your way, and really neat to be so
close to it.  
I actually then watched Kirk Cousins jump -- he was right next to me, he
jumped into the stands to hug his mom and dad and family. That was cool. I got
a picture and got to Tweet that right. So right in the mix. But it was neat.
We had some pretty big recruits in that weekend, too, so that was even better.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEDIA DAYS
(WOMEN)](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS+%28WOMEN%29)

  

## October 27, 2011

  

### [Joe McKeown](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19252)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
JOE McKEOWN: Well, I think first of all, I'm just really excited to be going
into our fourth year at Northwestern now. It seems like the other day we just
got here, and just the way our players have adjusted to things that we try to
do to turn things around, to win 19 games and 18 games and just have back-to-
back winning seasons. I think it's given us a foundation that we're looking
for. Just a real exciting time to be at Northwestern with what Coach Carmie is
doing and Pat Fitzgerald, and on the women's side, to try to keep up with our
lacrosse program, who just won their sixth national championship in a row. The
bar is set really high. Like I said, we just feel like we're on the right
track.  
  
Q. With two back-to-back successful seasons and a postseason berth, what's
your reception like when you're out recruiting, especially in the Chicago area
and Illinois, which is a pretty good hotbed for basketball?  
JOE McKEOWN: Yeah, that's a great question. I think my staff has worked really
hard. We've tried to have a lot of people -- I think Northwestern was really
an untapped, undervalued athletic program to begin with, and now I think just
being able to get people on campus, on the lake, and just understanding what
it's like to be a student-athlete at Northwestern, I think recruits have been
really receptive to that, not just in the Chicago area but nationwide.  
Obviously like any coach, you want to keep the best local players, you want to
keep them at home, so we're -- that's our number one goal every day.  
  
Q. What kind of an impact do you see Morgan Jones making this season?  
JOE McKEOWN: Morgan Jones is a freshman from Orlando, Florida, and 6'2", and
what I like about her is she can play all five positions. I think her impact
will come as we just get on the floor and start playing. She has a great
basketball IQ. Like any freshman, I think you're going to go through some ups
and downs, but I love her attitude and she's a really competitive kid. I'm
trying not to throw everything at her in November, but we're real excited to
have her in our program. Really gifted and a great kid.  
  
Q. Obviously when you lose a big presence like Amy Jaeschke, you have to
kind of regroup. Who are you developing in that spot and what is your mindset
on the inside game this year in terms of the personnel you have?  
JOE McKEOWN: If you're Amy Jaeschke, who was an incredible player in the Big
Ten and All-American First Team All-Big Ten the last couple years, drafted by
the WNBA, she just kind a contract to go to China. So we're real excited for
her and hopefully the future playing basketball for her a long time.  
It's hard to replace anybody that could just bail you out of a game, a
possession, a half, all those things. Had she not been there when I took the
job, I don't know -- she kind of bailed me out, too, when you really look back
over the last three years. I was really fortunate to coach her.  
But we have -- what it does, it creates opportunities for other people, too,
and Kendall Hackney, Dannielle Diamant, I think Morgan in some respects, are
all going to have places to step in and more pickup scoring loads. Amy was an
unbelievable scorer, but she was really unselfish, too.  
Yeah, I think all those guys just need to get used to playing without her,
too. I've got to get used to that, too. It's hard on me.  
  
Q. I want to ask you a little bit about two players in Kendall Hackney and
Brittany Orban that showed flashes of talent were a little bit inconsistent at
times this year and I wonder what you expect out of them in terms of increased
leadership and performance?  
JOE McKEOWN: Yeah, I think Kendall and I have had great conversations. She was
one of the All-Big Ten teams last year as a sophomore, and I think she
benefitted a lot from playing with Amy. I said, Kendall, now it's your time.
You have to step up, create your own shots. I think the biggest thing for
Kendall is to be there every night, be consistent. But she has a great
attitude, great work ethic. She's had a tremendous summer. Yeah, I think
she'll be ready. And Brittany Orban is -- there's nothing about her that ever
changes. She's the most consistent person ever. I think she has the same thing
for breakfast every day, her whole life. She ran a marathon, she just takes on
challenges as they come.  
She'll go through a wall for you and just a really tough, hard-nosed, glue-
type player that coaches love to have their players on the floor.  
  
Q. You inherited Amy Jaeschke, but what that meant was that's the style of
play you were going to play because she was going to be in the ballgame, and
now even at year four, it's your thing, what you want to make this team. From
a flow, from a look, more GW like? What's it going to be?  
JOE McKEOWN: I'll tell you, that's a great question. I would love to say yes.
I think we'll be a hybrid, a little bit of both, just because we have players
used to playing a certain way. But we're going to run and try to press. One
thing with Amy in the low post, this year we don't have that, so it'll open up
the floor. We want to really try to attack the basket.  
We put it on the floor a lot better this year than we have in the past, and we
have not been -- I think one of the greatest stats we had every game was we
led the league, might have led the country, in assist-to-basket ratio, which
meant every time we scored, it came off a pass. I'd like to see us just take
the ball and go to the basket this year. It's a little deceiving. And we would
like -- we're going to be a lot deeper. The gap between talent on our team now
has really closed, so we weren't able to play enough players the last couple
years.  
So those two things will help us. We would like to press and run and go back
to the days at GW we could turn people over and get easy baskets. I'd like to
lead the nation in scoring again. I think we did that one year. That was 1987
or so. We were first or second.  
  
Q. You kind of answered my question, but I'll regroup. When you start to
consider what the league looks like this year and what your team specifically
looks like this year, what is the one strength you see that you have where you
can really, really possibly elevate above other teams in the conference?  
JOE McKEOWN: You know, I think you can't just focus in on one player
defensively against us. I think we'll have seven or eight players that can
score. That's what I'm seeing in practice. Hopefully that will continue
throughout the Big Ten season.  
But to me, probably the one difference for us is we're a little more balance
in our -- so far in practice, and again, that may change as we get into the
season. But that's probably the one thing. We've got more weapons I feel like.  
  
Q. We all know about Amy Jaeschke being gone, but the significance of losing
Beth Marshall at the point guard position, how much does that impact your
team, as well?  
JOE McKEOWN: It does. She on and off the court was a great leader, really
helped me try to rebuild a program and just had a toughness and a certain
energy that she brought every day to practice. And then in games she just had
that attitude that every time she shot the ball it was going in. When it
didn't, she was surprised.  
There's things you can't teach, and I think our players -- it just gave them
some confidence just having her on the floor every day. So we'll miss that. We
have some young players that I think will step into that role, but again, you
can't replace experience with youth. It has to -- you've got to go through the
process.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEDIA DAYS
(WOMEN)](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS+%28WOMEN%29)

  

## October 27, 2011

  

### [Felisha Legette-Jack](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16871)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  

  
Q. How come you never passed the ball in college? I'm sorry, let's move on.
(Laughing). This season obviously a lot of changes and you just spoke of
losing a lot of your scoring, so who is, if you could pick two or three
players that you're looking for to kind of pick up in terms of leadership this
season, as well as being a scoring impact in a conference that's going to be
very, very competitive?  
FELISHA LEGETTE-JACK: Oh, our conference is very competitive. My colleagues
went out and got some amazing student-athletes to represent their institution.
I had my best success as a coach when I had no idea who was going to be the
scoring leader, when Whitney Thomas and Kim Roberson and Amber Jackson, those
young ladies played for me, there was never an idea who would be that leader,
that go-to person. They all collectively decided to come together, and
whenever it was their time they'd show up.  
Last year we all knew that Jori Davis was that person, that leader, that go-to
person, and it really wasn't good for me. The year before that it was Jamie
Braun. So now we're back at square one where we don't know who that person is.
It's just a group of us that's going to just kind of roll our sleeves up,
bring our lunchbox and put it down and try to go to work and just represent
Indiana the best way we know now.  
  
Q. Just wondering I guess when you were talking about having that individual
that you start to rely on to score like Jori Davis, what's the issue with
that? Do you think it's something where the rest of the team stands around and
expects that one player to step up every night? What's the advantage maybe of
having a team where you don't know who the leading scorer is going to be?  
FELISHA LEGETTE-JACK: Well, you have different weapons. We certainly went into
that season last year thinking Sasha Chaplin was going to be a viable option,
Georgie Jones was going to be a viable option, but they both had to nurse knee
injuries, so there was just one person that stood. This year I think Jasmine
McGhee knows how to put the ball in the air and get some things done and Linda
Rubene, another junior college kid that's coming in, she hasn't discovered how
to pass the ball, either, so it's fun in practice. But I think with this
particular group, I think they like the fact there's no go-to or there's no
one-woman show, if you will, and they really have a lot more fun this way.  
My hope is to keep this balance.  
  
Q. In such a competitive conference, what do you see particularly with the
personnel you have this year that has to be your strength, particularly if you
look at last year what has to change, what do you have to do better overall?  
FELISHA LEGETTE-JACK: We have to score the basketball. You know, our mantra is
our defense. I think that we do a tremendous job defensively. I think we held
people to under 64, 65 points. That's not awful. It's not great, either. But
we couldn't put the ball in the hole enough. Jori led the entire conference in
scoring, but there was no second, third, fourth person, and so I think if we
can score the basketball a lot better and distribute it around a little bit
better, I think that we'll have a lot more fun for one. Our Hoosier Nation
will continue to come out and watch us play for two, and I think we will win
more basketball games if we put the ball in the hole a little bit better.  
  
Q. In addition to Jori Davis, losing your point guard in Whitney Lindsay,
how would you assess that position and what do you feel about the point guard
position?  
FELISHA LEGETTE-JACK: Oh, that's critical. All my mentors always say when you
have rookie point guards that you're going to struggle a little bit. But
somebody forgot to tell Candyce Ussery that. We have a young lady coming in
from St. Louis, who is a really intellectual kid that really understands that
if you go out there and play, and they have five and we have five that we have
a chance, even though she's a rookie. I think Andrea Newbauer is going to help
grow her. Andrea was here last year but she had back surgery so we didn't
really get a chance to see her. I think she's a real confrontational kind of
point guard. Reminds me of a Lindsay Whelan, not nearly as talented as her
yet. I think with her strength and her girth, she gets inside and gets to the
free-throw line a lot.  
So we have two point guards we are going to rely on. They're young. It's going
to be fun. It's going to be interesting. I'm not certain what's going to be in
my water bottle yet, is it going to be vodka or water? I can't tell you guys,
you're the media. But you know, they keep me guessing and they keep it light,
so I'm excited.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about the freshmen and the transfers and how
important they'll be this season in getting into that rotation pretty early.  
FELISHA LEGETTE-JACK: Well, it's hard to keep them back. I love what Quaniesha
McCurty is bringing. She's a 6'5" kid out of Georgia who really runs the floor
like a guard, can handle the ball pretty well. I think that right now her
strength is her problem. Have to get her stronger. Jazz McGhee is a phenomenal
scorer. She has a knack for it. There's nothing conventional about what she
does, but she knows how to finish the play and she knows how to get the ball
in hole. Linda Rubene is that same kind of kid. And I love what Necole
Sterling is going to bring. She's that kid from Virginia that's going to be
the confrontational young lady, that's going to make people follow her because
she has no fear. Then there's Candyce Ussery who is just a real methodical
point guard that can shoot the three, but also get the ball to the right
person. But her strength is going to be a concern at the beginning, as well.  
  
Q. You mentioned the importance of having success in front of Hoosier
Nation, and I know that was a struggle with the team last year, obviously
losing the last seven home games. What do you tell the team in terms of
building energy back on the home court?  
FELISHA LEGETTE-JACK: Well, what we decided to do this year with this young
team was take them on the road. Our first three or four games are on the road,
and I think it's a privilege to play in front of your home fan base, and we
haven't earned that right to represent. So we're going to try to go on the
road and become road warriors and work on our craft, and hope when we come
back home that we understand what it's supposed to be like to represent your
school at home. You have to protect home plate any means necessary. We didn't
have that eye of the tiger, we didn't have that fight that I can say I was
proud of when we played at home.  
The road is one thing you can't really control, but home, you have to have a
different kind of swagger, and we want to go and earn that right by going on
the road early and hopefully we can do a better job this upcoming season.  
  
Q. It's a conference full of guards. You just mentioned you have a 6'5 "
center. I know playing in the post is very dear and true to your own heart
having a lot of success there. What kind of emphasis are you putting on
playing that game from the inside out? And from a personnel perspective do you
talk to your players about, this is a place where you could dominate because
there's just not a lot of really aggressive post this season? We don't have
the big Jantel Lavenders anymore.   
FELISHA LEGETTE-JACK: Are you sure she's not coming back?  
  
Q. I'm positive, I checked.  
FELISHA LEGETTE-JACK: I couldn't control that. We've always been a team that's
built our house from the inside out, and we've really tried to emphasize that.
We even had -- I'm still stuck on the Whitney Thomas era, but she was 5'11",
we believed that inside out was the way you do it. I like what Sasha is
looking like in the gym. Sasha Chaplin is back and healthy, knock on wood.
Andujar is a confrontational post player and I love the way Georgie Jones is
running the floor. We still have some great players in the post. I love
Johnson at Iowa, I love what Mingo does from the inside out from Purdue. So we
can't disregard that this conference still has to the really good post
players. But I think we're always going to be who we are and we are always go
from the inside out. Jazz is going to shoot the ball, Linda is going to shoot
the ball, but they'd better make sure they see our big kids before they let it
go.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEDIA DAYS
(WOMEN)](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS+%28WOMEN%29)

  

## October 27, 2011

  

### [Jolette Law](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18032)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
JOLETTE LAW: I'm very happy about this year. My kids are feeding off of the
momentum that we had in the Big Ten Tournament. I have five newcomers that are
raising the bar for my team, and just looking forward to a great year this
year.  
  
Q. I've kind of thrown this question around a lot, just because looking down
the personnel of this conference, so very, very guard heavy, no particularly
dominant post player per se, but then you have someone like Karisma. Do you
actually prepare her for the fact that she could possibly be dominant in the
paint, that there's not a lot of competition, no offense, just calling it as I
see it, necessarily in the paint? And if so, what kind of things are you
saying to her to get her prepared for a year where she could really, really
continue as the best scorer and rebounder in the conference?  
JOLETTE LAW: Well, each and every day I'm trying to -- last year Karisma was
like in the top five in every category. I'm challenging her that that's not
enough. In order for us to win, you must be in the top one or two in the
conference. You must also be a great leader, both on and off the court. We've
learned as a team, we've learned that it's not just about Karisma Penn, but I
am very, very happy that I have a dominant post and I have finally some other
supporting cast around her. But each and every day I'm challenging her to be
the best of the best, not just the best of the Big Ten but the best in the
country. I'm raising the bar with her, and she's accepted the challenge thus
far.  
  
Q. I was wondering if you could talk, Lana Rukavina really developed toward
the end of last season. Could you talk about that growth and maybe what
happened during the offseason with her?  
JOLETTE LAW: Lana was our most improved player. She accepted a challenge. As a
coach you need to find out your personnel and see what works. I found out that
Lana Rukavina, she's better than most guards, so I had to reevaluate and find
some things that fit her into other offense, and she's been responding. I told
her I need more from her this year. I need her to be more versatile on the
block. She's been working extremely hard, her confidence is extremely high,
and I'm looking for her to have a very, very great senior year.  
  
Q. How do you take the four days in Indy last March and take that energy,
and has it been able to -- does it really carry over? Those were some amazing
days and games and shootarounds and just the energy that was surrounding your
program.  
JOLETTE LAW: You know, since that last game, our kids in the locker room were
just like, Coach, we understand. We get it. You don't have to tell us anything
now. We get it. We're going to focus next year on the little things. And it
started when we went back to Champaign this summer. They came up with a theme
this year, it's our turn. We want to do things a little different. We're going
to focus on the little things, and we want to do it together. We want to be
about team.  
Now I have in my mind nine assistant coaches on the sidelines when I'm talking
to my freshmen. I'm seeing each one of them pulling them to the side,
demonstrating all the little things, how the rest of the floor -- how to be
strong with the basketball. It's very encouraging when you're at practice and
you see that now they understand what I've been trying to teach them all last
year. Now it's carrying over and they're being little assistant coaches to my
freshmen. It's definitely been a blessing.  
  
Q. One of the areas that was a weakness for your team last year was
consistency from the guard position, and you had two freshmen who really
started playing well at the end of the season, Amber Moore and Centrese McGee,
and now without Centrese, how is Amber coming along and who else is going to
pick the slack on the perimeter position?  
JOLETTE LAW: Amber Moore is playing extremely well right now. She's playing
with a lot of confidence. I'm very confident right now in Kersten Magrum, who
a lot people forgotten. She's probably in the best shape she's been in. She
keeps telling me, "Coach, this is the best shape I've been in in my life, I'm
hungry, I'm ready." She will also add some more scoring power on the
perimeter.  
I also have a very, very good freshman class, and I'm going to rely a lot on.
I have versatile guards. I can play Nia Oden inside and out, Taylor Tuck has
been playing inside and out. Ivory Crawford and Alexis Smith have been playing
like veterans. So I feel like I have a little bit more offensive pressure on
the perimeter. They handle the ball extremely well. It's just now getting them
a little bit more experience.  
  
Q. Out of the newcomers is there anyone in particular that you're kind of
expecting to make an impact so that we announcers can go "ooh" and "aah"?  
JOLETTE LAW: Ivory Crawford and Alexis Smith. I would put those two names out
there based on what I've seen the last couple days of practice. They've been
playing extremely well, very aggressive, and I'd definitely just put those two
names out there, Ivory Crawford and Alexis Smith.  
  
Q. Looking back at last season as a whole, I mean, when you guys were
struggling through Big Ten play, you had to notice this wasn't a 2-14 team
looking at your scores and things like that. What do you think your experience
taught you going through that type of slump, losing some close games?  
JOLETTE LAW: You know, my mom always told me when I was a little girl, you
have to go through something. When you look at a diamond, a diamond had to go
through the fire, and trust me, our team went through the fire last year. But
I just think through all the ups and downs, the close games, the stumbling
blocks, at the end it let me see what my mom was always telling me. It started
to shine, started seeing the glistening in my team. I think this year, their
energy, their passion, all the things, the team chemistry that I've been
praying for for the longest is finally there. It taught me a lot. I really
became a better coach last year. It's probably one of my happiest years last
year through the 9-23 because my team finally came together and they became
about team, and they didn't give up. And each and every day they just looked
at me like, Coach, you never looked like you were defeated, and we fed off of
your energy.  
"And in retrospect I watched you and all the things that you guys have kept
constantly getting better, you guys made me a better coach." I learned a lot,
and I just thank God for the experience.  
  
Q. This is a different kind of question, Bobby Kelsey is in her first year,
never been a head coach before, much like yourself when you came to Illinois.
If you were going to give her some advice on what approach to take to take
care of yourself and be successful with your program, what would it be?  
JOLETTE LAW: Just, you know, take each day one step at a time, continue to be
yourself, continue to be a sponge and feed off of your assistant coaches,
don't doubt yourself, just do what you've been taught to do. I'd just tell
her, just stay the course. That's the one thing from year one, year two, year
three, now I'm in year five; just stay the course. Do things the right way,
good things will happen.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEDIA DAYS
(WOMEN)](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS+%28WOMEN%29)

  

## October 27, 2011

  

### [Bobbie Kelsey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22737)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
BOBBIE KELSEY: Just delighted to be here representing Wisconsin. We've been in
practice now for 18 practices. We've had 18 practices. I know that because I
changed the number on the practice plan every day. But we're working really
hard to put in the things that we feel will help us be successful, and the
players are really excited about the opportunity that they will have to
showcase their skills.  
  
Q. Obviously coming in as a new coach, one of the toughest things to do is
to get the players to gel and to get them to buy into your system. On a scale
of 1 to 10, 10 being they absolutely have bought in, this is going to be
great, we're going to win a championship; on the scale of 1 to 10 thus far
where do you think you are in terms of that kind of success?  
BOBBIE KELSEY: An 11.  
  
Q. Excellent.  
BOBBIE KELSEY: Yes, and I don't say that lightly because I've been a part of
other new staffs that have come in, and you don't always have that buy-in. You
really don't. When I first spoke with the team before I addressed the media at
the press conference to announce my hiring, I told them there's always one.
There's always one somewhere in the bunch that will not get on board, so I
hope there's no one like that in the room because it will be a short stay.  
I don't know if they were like that before or if somebody was in there before
and then they decided to get on board, but I haven't had the issues of kids
not complying or doing what's asked. I've just been blessed. They're not
angels, they're not perfect, but they have all bought in. They've all decided
that they didn't get a vote about who would be their head coach, they did not
ask them their opinion, but they got lucky.  
I've been able to bring the experiences of my past, most recently at Stanford
University, with four Final Fours in four years, so I think they believe that
I may know one or two things about playing basketball.  
  
Q. When you take over a program, in your mind you know what as a coach maybe
you want to do eventually. What will you be able to do this year? What will
your system be as far as offensively and defensively?  
BOBBIE KELSEY: Offensively I think the players that are returning did not have
an opportunity for whatever reason to showcase their individual skills.
Obviously when you lose 61 percent of your scoring, there's some concern about
who will be able to step in and fill the void. But they are Division I
basketball players, and they were recruited to play basketball, so I take that
as an opportunity for them to then step in and showcase what they can do.
Obviously all of them have to be able to shoot and make a shot. You don't have
kids out there that can't shoot or be a threat because then they're not
guarded. So I think they like that because who doesn't like to score. All the
kids I've ever coached loved to score. I've never seen one that did not.  
So all of them have an opportunity. I tell them if they don't shoot and
they're open, that's going to hurt our team. So they get in the gym, they work
on their shot, and obviously the conditioning from my past where I've been,
Stanford, they've always been known for conditioning, and I think that the
kids at Wisconsin, this is new for them. They have not been pushed to the
places that I've been pushing them, but I say it's only going to make us
better because we don't want to play a half-court game. We do want to get up
and down the floor. Not quick shots, not bad shots, but push the pace and the
tempo offensively and then play smart on the defensive end, really play
scouting report defense. If someone can't shoot, you may not be as close to
them. If they can, you guard them.  
We might have to double in the post, things like that, that we did at
Stanford, and it was very successful. I don't want to give it all away, not
that there's any secrets, but we're looking to do certain things to keep
people out of foul trouble, to preserve our energy, so to speak. But these
kids are ready to go, they really are.  
  
Q. You've had to obviously come in, assess your talent, one big chore, but
the other big chore is assessing this conference. What do you see in terms of
this conference of where your strengths can be or some areas that you think we
will be challenged?  
BOBBIE KELSEY: Strength-wise, I think that me being new and the system being
new and the players that were there previously, the scorers, so to speak, that
are graduated, maybe people don't know that much about what we'll do. That's
kind of the unknown. It's good sometimes because people can't prepare as much
for your team and maybe the expectation is that they don't have a lot, so they
don't take you very seriously. I don't know that to be true, I'm just making
generalizations.  
But as far as the Big Ten Conference, it's a really rich women's basketball
conference. A lot of the teams have done really well over the past years, have
gotten to the Final Four championships, obviously Purdue winning
championships. But for Wisconsin it's an opportunity for us to then really
maybe sneak up on some people, maybe achieve what others think we can't.  
So I think the girls are really excited about it, and they have an opportunity
to showcase what they can do. They're very excited about that.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEDIA DAYS
(WOMEN)](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS+%28WOMEN%29)

  

## October 27, 2011

  

### [Jim Foster](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16894)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
Q. I'll start with the obvious question. I'm sure you get plenty of
questions about Jantel and how your team changes this year. What is your
team's biggest strength when you look at obviously it's a different dynamic,
but you're still Ohio State; what's your team's biggest strength this year?  
JIM FOSTER: Our guards. Sammy Prahalis and Tayler Hill have improved
significantly over the summer. They're both playing great basketball. Amber
Stokes is healthy. This is the first preseason she's gone through. And Raven
Ferguson is a pretty talented player, even though a freshman.  
  
Q. They always talk about players getting the senior bump, and it's kind of
hard to imagine Prahalis playing with any more energy or spark than she does,
but talk about her going into her senior season.  
JIM FOSTER: Well, I think she is playing harder on a more consistent basis.
Her defense has improved, and she's very cognizant of the fact that she has to
lead this team, and she's done that through the summer and into the fall. I'm
very confident that she is going to have a great senior year.  
  
Q. As you approach the season, is it kind of energizing from a coaching
standpoint to sort of have a different approach to the game, not just have --
it's great to have a Jantel Lavender, but it also means that the middle has
got a lot of bodies in there defensively, offensively. Is it kind of fun to
have the floor opened up at all?  
JIM FOSTER: Yeah, it's always fun. We are going to play differently. We're
going to be much differently offensively in how we play, style of play. I'm
very comfortable that our post players are very good face-the-basket players
and we'll probably be more of a European look.  
  
Q. In preparing for this season, who did you watch? Did you watch more
European basketball? Were there NBA teams you watched?  
JIM FOSTER: You know, I've been around a long time. There's not much --  
  
Q. I know, but I didn't want to say that.  
JIM FOSTER: I've seen stuff over the years that I like and put it in the back
of my head, that when I have a team where that would apply, we would -- I'd
like to do it.  
And this year I think the right group. Ashley Adams is an absolute terrific
passer. Everybody talks about Jantel, but I think Ashley shot 73 percent in
the Big Ten last year, blocks a lot of shots. She's not as dynamically
athletic as Jantel, but she's a very efficient basketball player. And we've
got some other post players that have really worked hard and are very good
passers and make good decisions. I think we're going to be a much better
passing basketball team than we've been. I think the ball is going to move a
lot more than it has.  
  
Q. Four newcomers this year. Anyone in particular that stands out that could
be that diamond in the rough for you or that you've seen some really good
things that will make an impact?  
JIM FOSTER: I don't think Ferguson or Beach are diamonds in the rough, I think
they're diamonds. Both are very talented players and have interesting skill
sets. Raven Ferguson on the low block is a very, very difficult player to
guard. She can shoot the three, she can put the ball on the floor, but she's
got post-up abilities that will get us some of the post-ups that Jantel gave
us. I think you might see us score some from the block with our guards.  
  
Q. Before last season, you were really excited about Scullion and what she
can bring and then the injury. How does she look? Is she healthy and how much
of an impact --  
JIM FOSTER: Well, she's a little banged up. What I see of her, I really like.
It's nothing related to last year's injury. She's full go there. But I haven't
seen enough to have an opinion. But she'll be ready.  
  
Q. It seems like the last decade when we come to Media Day, Ohio State is
picked to win. Now you're not even in the top three. How much do you get a
sense that your team is really embracing kind of this new position that
they're in right now?  
JIM FOSTER: I told my team the first day we practiced, I said, this Goliath
thing was a lot of fun, but I've got a lot of experience being David in my
coaching past, and I'm sort of looking forward to it.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEDIA DAYS
(WOMEN)](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS+%28WOMEN%29)

  

## October 27, 2011

  

### [Pam Borton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14360)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
PAM BORTON: Obviously I'm very excited to have 11 returning players and four
starters coming back. And I think with those four starters, we have a true
point guard back in our program, which is very exciting for me as a coach. You
know, point guards are very crucial to your team and so forth, but I'm very
excited about how we've been practicing the last three weeks. I think as a
coach you can tell a lot from your team how your practices are going and your
work ethic and intensity level, but I think our team has come a long way and
we've gotten better each day. I really like my team and the way we've been
practicing and the direction we're heading.  
We return Kiara Buford this year, one of the top four scorers in Big Ten this
year, so I think her life will be made a lot easier this year with having a
point guard with her by her side, so less ball handling. Our turnovers have
already been cut even more in half in practice, which has been nice.  
Having a point guard like Rachel Banham. She's one of the 20 kids in the
nation last year. Obviously makes my job a little bit easier, and it's a lot
more fun as a coach having that type of player on the floor.  
  
Q. Do you see Kiara being able to fly back over to the 2 now, and how will
that help her game this year?  
PAM BORTON: I think she can be more of a scorer, less ball-handling
responsibilities, less play-making every single time down the floor. You know,
shot clock plays, end-of-the-game situations, I think a lot of that fell on
Kiara, and I think obviously her shooting percentage went down because she was
forced to take a lot of bad shots. A lot of the weight is taken off her
shoulders, and I think having a point guard that can create her own shot and
she's got a pull-up, she can get to the rim, she's got a three-point shot as
well as make other people better. It's going to make the game easier for
everybody around her. Obviously I've had a couple real special kids in my
program in the past in that position, so it's nice to have a kid like that
back on the court.  
  
Q. Specifically for Rachel, when you're challenging her to actually the lead
the team, she's obviously got a lot of skills, but what is it that you're
looking for her in terms of being vocal, in terms of other things to lead this
team to get them to the next level?  
PAM BORTON: Well, I think in just running the team, I think she's got a great
understanding of the game. You know, as a coach you're not coaching every
possession and every pass, and I've found myself doing that the last couple
years. You've got a point guard that can call the plays and run the team and
not coach every pass and every play. She's very intelligent, she wants the
responsibility, she wants the accountability, she wants the pressure. I'm
looking for her to be a scorer first and foremost, and I think once she proves
herself as a scorer, which she's a prolific scorer, I think she can be able to
draw two and three people on her and be able to get other people open shots,
and just like I said, make the game a little bit easier for everybody else.  
We lost a lot of games last year at the end of games and giving up leads, and
I think this game is a guard game and who's got better guard play and better
decision-making. I think that'll help us down the stretch in games.  
  
Q. She's drawn comparisons to Lindsay Whelan, which is a lofty thing to live
up to. How do you manage those expectations and allow her to not feel that
kind of pressure to take the program back to where it was then?  
PAM BORTON: I think you worry about that, especially when you have a freshman,
and she's from half an hour away from campus, and same type of Minnesota kid,
same type of family and the whole works. But I think we all know that there's
only one Lindsay Whelan. Lindsay Whelan is a once-in-a-lifetime player, look
what she did this year, my goodness sakes. But I'm trying to shake Rachel in
practice. I'm trying to get under her skin, I'm trying to shake her and I
can't do it. I think she welcomes the pressure, she wants it. I think when she
hears she's being compared to Lindsay Whelan she's not a kid that looks at
that as oh, my gosh, this is pressure but looks at it as this is an honor and
this is why I came here. I came here to help this program and to do this and I
want to be able to take this program where Lindsay did.  
So I think she welcomes that and she's a special kid mentally, her mindset.
I'm still learning about her on the court, as well, and coaching her, but I
think she's going to be -- so far, so good.  
  
Q. Some of the rule changes, talk about the arc now under the basket and how
much you think that will impact the game? Will it clean up some of the things
that have gone on inside in the past?  
PAM BORTON: Well, I think it'll maybe clean it up a little bit. I am not sure
if it's going to make that much of a difference than what everybody thinks it
will. I think it'll make the calls a little bit easier for the officials. For
coaches as far as teaching, it helps us teach our kids better positioning and
better help-side defense in the second line and just emphasizing that. So
obviously we have to do a better job teaching as coaches.  
I think it'll make the calls a little bit easier for the officials.  
  
Q. One of your challenges last season was field-goal percentage, and I've
been asking this a lot: In a very guard-oriented conference this season, what
are you doing differently to really, really try to play the game from the
inside out? I know you have great guards, but obviously getting those
percentages up by getting into the paint a little bit with the post, are you
focusing on that? And do you have a strategy that you think can get you
ahead?  
PAM BORTON: Well, I think we've -- I think across the country, I think field-
goal percentage has gone down. I think the players are bigger, faster,
stronger, more athletic, and I think if you look at the percentages, teams
across the country are better defensively than they were offensively. I think
that's just the trend, men's and women's basketball.  
I think Jim Delany has done some research on that. I think it's just the trend
in the last few years. But in looking at our team, obviously we want to score
more points in transition. I think we can with an up-tempo point guard and
just getting our team to really run the floor. I think Katie Loberg will be
starting for us in the 5 position and she's a great runner, great athlete, as
well. So we want to try to get some easier points in transition.  
Like I said, I think when you've got a point guard that's able to create easy
shots it makes the game a little bit easier for players on the floor. You find
yourself with the ball in your hands right on the block and you've got an easy
lay-up because somebody has made you an unbelievable pass or somebody is in
the lane and draw kick for a six-foot shot on the baseline and nobody is
guarding them, and I think that's what a point guard does. Your team, they
give you a little bit easier shots from being able to create.  
Katie Loberg is one of our more improved players on the team and obviously
we're going to be looking to get more points in the paint this year playing
from the inside out.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEDIA DAYS
(WOMEN)](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS+%28WOMEN%29)

  

## October 27, 2011

  

### [Kevin Borseth](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18022)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
KEVIN BORSETH: First of all, I'd like to thank the media for coming today to
support us. You guys are our voice to the public, and certainly Big Ten is
really a committed and very together conference, and we're certainly very
proud of that, and we're proud to be a part of that.  
We're excited to get the season started. Last year we won 17 games and were a
little short of getting in the NCAA Tournament and something that our players
are very determined to get back to this year. Practices have been going really
well, and I guess that's where we're going to start. I'll open to any
questions.  
  
Q. (No microphone).  
KEVIN BORSETH: We're really a program that really is not a star-ridden
program. Everything is kind of balanced, and over the course of my career I
think we've had all of our teams pretty balanced. I think we've got to get
scoring from every area. Courtney, Carmen, Rachel Sheffer had a great year
last year in scoring. We've got probably eight or nine kids we think could
play in different capacities. I think our biggest thing now at the end of the
shot clock, who do you give the ball to? I know last year we gave it to Ronnie
a little bit with some of those screen but Courtney was involved, as well.  
But I think we're pretty much a balanced team. We always have been.  
  
Q. (No microphone).  
KEVIN BORSETH: Well, could be Nya, could be Courtney, could be Brenae Harris,
the freshman from Marion, Ohio. Generally your point guards are kids that run
in that situation, kids that get involved.  
  
Q. Could you talk about the transitionary phase right now within the
conference. A lot of really quality post players have graduated and it's
starting to get back to a little bit of a guard league. Where do you think
that is right now in terms of what this season is going to be like in terms of
post play versus guard play?  
KEVIN BORSETH: It was interesting that the three players we put up for All-
American nomination and Player of the Year were all guards, Samantha Prahalis,
Jaime Printy and Alex Bentley were the three kids we put up, so it was
interesting to see that. Kind of caught you off guard, especially all the big
kids we had last year.  
That's really a good question. Somebody asked me before where our conference
was, what type of conference we were, where the strength lied. I think there's
a lot of good teams in this conference. I know with the big kid from Ohio
State being gone, that we maybe got one of those post players this year that's
got that capability. But I think every one of the players certainly relies on
those kids. I think the game has really opened up a little bit, and because
it's opened up it's given a lot more ability for those players with a lot of
skills on the perimeter to put the ball on the floor a little more, the luxury
of being able to take it to the basket a little bit.  
  
Q. You addressed some of the rule changes that are going to happen with the
arc and then the three-point line and what kind of impact you think that'll
have on the women's game?  
KEVIN BORSETH: It's kind of interesting if you watch the three-point line from
all your videotapes, for the most part, all of us were shooting the ball from
beyond that arc anyway. When I was with Green Bay we went overseas, I want to
say about four, five, six years ago, and the international arc was out there
and never seemed to bother. So I don't know if the players are really going to
notice that when they go down. I don't think before the game they're going to
say, gee, the arc is nine inches further, so that's going to be a big thing.  
So I guess moving it back really made it easier on the floor because those two
lines were pretty confusing from that perspective.  
That little smiley face underneath the basket, I don't know. A couple years
ago we added a rule for whatever reason, the coaches wanted to get away from
players being able to take charges underneath that basket, and for some reason
they allowed that to happen, and there always seems to be a two-year hiatus on
these rule changes when they make them, kind of like the spin move, where you
can't spin and not get called for a travel. And there was charging underneath
the basket that they allowed, and it really wasn't what the coaches had
wanted. So they put the arc in that made it consistent with the men's game,
which I guess makes sense. But if you watch the videotape and take a look at
it, you'll scratch your head at a couple of those demonstrations on whether
the kids standing in that box actually are in legal guarding position or not.  
But it is what it is. I guess you don't want kids to take charges underneath
the basket. It already has the ability to be pretty volatile game anyway with
all the collisions. We certainly don't want to add any more.  
  
Q. When you look at last year, what is the one thing that you say -- I mean,
you can't fix everything. I know every coach wishes they could, but if there's
one thing this season that you said, this has to change if we're going to
produce 20 wins this year, what is it?  
KEVIN BORSETH: You know, we've been -- I think we're relatively consistent
when we play on both ends of the court. I think our kids generally play
extremely hard. They play together, and they're very intelligent. They've got
a high intelligent team. They play smart. I think that consistency is good to
have, but I think we've got to have the ability to get to another level. I
think that's the thing you have to be able to do. You have to be able to go
over the top, and I don't know that we've really done that. We did that last
year. We played really good basketball, really sound, solid basketball, but
just never really got over the top with it. I think that's an area that we've
got to get a little better at this year.  
  
Q. You guys have to be coming back with higher expectations from a player
standpoint with the success that you had last year, how has that translated
into practices so far?  
KEVIN BORSETH: You know, you can tell when those kids are on the court how
much more together they are. I think that probably is -- they know each other
a little bit better, they learn what each other's strengths and weaknesses are
so they can feed off them or guard against them, if you will. I just think
after last year, the season ending the way it did and the success that we had
early on, it probably is eating in their bellies on the inside, I'm certain
that to be the case. But they really are -- in practice they've taken a little
bit more -- they're a little more intense in practice. Things have a little
bit greater sense of urgency than they have in the past, where generally there
was just one or two of those with a greater sense of urgency, that sense of
urgency has kind of spread to a lot more players, which is good.  
So I think they feel it. I think their expectation level is really high within
themselves, and that's a good place for it to be.  
  
Q. Changes to Crisler, how has that impacted you, your team? And you're
smiling, so it must be good.  
KEVIN BORSETH: Yeah, it's really nice. I keep telling everybody the same
thing: It's hard to imagine that you could paint the ceiling black and it
would brighten the place up. But all new seats, new scoreboard, it just looks
clean, and I guess that's what you expect when you think of a major university
and the Big Ten and the facility that we have.  
It's an unbelievable facelift that Crisler has gotten and of course now our
play development center, we just moved into our offices this past week, and
it's probably 80 to 90 percent complete at this point. Right now they're
putting the floor in for it, and our players haven't seen it yet. We're going
to take them in next week, so it's going to be one of those reality shows,
home makeover reality shows or something like that because it is absolutely
phenomenal. I walked in and it's like you can't even speak because your mouth
is open and you look at it and say, wow, this is absolutely unbelievable.  
So we're -- it's like driving a new car, you get in every day and you feel
really good. But you can't dent it.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEDIA DAYS
(WOMEN)](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS+%28WOMEN%29)

  

## October 27, 2011

  

### [Lisa Bluder](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16868)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
LISA BLUDER: Can't believe another year is rolling around again. They say as
you get older, they come around faster, and I think that's very, very true
right now.  
Happy for Jaime Printy being acknowledged as one of the top five players in
this conference. That is a very difficult thing to do. It's a great
accomplishment. This is such an unbelievable conference, and now with the
addition of Nebraska it's even tougher. But for her to be acknowledged as one
of the top five players as a junior, I think, really is a tremendous
accomplishment for her.  
Congratulations to Penn State for being the preseason favorite. I definitely
see that happening. I think they're a tremendous team, and Coquese has done a
great job.  
We're looking forward to the year. We think we've got a great non-conference
schedule to prepare us for the Big Ten, but obviously getting ready to tip it
off pretty quickly here.  
  
Q. You mentioned Jamie. Let's start there. She's already proven what she can
do as a scorer. What are you looking for from her this year as opposed to
years past in terms of helping her grow and helping your team win?  
LISA BLUDER: Like I said, Jamie has proved herself already on the offensive
end. Everybody knows she's an incredible three-point threat. But she's more
than that on the offensive end because she's proven that she can get to the
rim, she can accept contact and still convert the basket. She's a fabulous
free-throw shooter, so she can make you play the old-fashioned way with the
old-fashioned three instead of the new three. See, I'm that old.  
But Jamie can continue to work on her leadership skills. She can continue to
work on her defense and rebounding. Those are all things that can make her a
more complete player. I think she's already a pretty complete player on the
offensive end. I'd like to see her finish that out, becoming a more conscious
defensive player than she is right now.  
  
Q. You obviously lost a lot in Kachine Alexander, but more than just the
numbers, the energy that she brought every single day. Who's got to pick up
the slack for that?  
LISA BLUDER: You know, the energy is the hardest thing, really. Isn't that
funny, such an intangible thing? You can all say, who's your defense stopper,
who's going to get those rebounds, but when you think of Kachine people think
of that energy right away. What a great example to really other kids around
the country of how important such an intangible like that is to a team and to
being a successful player.  
Really that's something we're still working on. Kachine was such a dominating
personality that nobody had to assume that role the last four years. So now
somebody has got to learn to assume that role. Usually big players are not
those type of personalities, but Morgan Johnson is trying really hard. She's
got the most personality out on the floor. She was often a recipient of
Kachine's emotion on the floor.  
But we're really trying to find that person still. You know, who's going to
come up with the rebounds and the defense. You don't have one person, okay,
you're going to pick up the defense and the rebounding of Kachine. That's got
to be a team effort.  
  
Q. For the first time in a number of years you have some real legitimate
depth on your team. How do you expect that to change the way you can play the
game?  
LISA BLUDER: Yeah, it's been so long, you're right, it's been a long time
since we've had 12 healthy bodies. In practice it's really nice. But yeah, in
games it's going to make a difference on how we can play. I think that we will
be able to be more up tempo, and I feel like our team has always tried to push
the ball pretty hard. And that's something that I think we can do even more,
and I think it can also adjust how we substitute because you're not just
substituting when a player has foul trouble or when a player is hurt, but now
you can substitute for lack of effort or any amount of other things. So it
makes you a lot, I think, able to substitute and use the bench as a motivator
where we have not been able to use that in the last several years.  
But we think that defensively we can do some different things more in the
three-quarter court as well as full court.  
  
Q. I was just going to ask, are you going to be able to coach now and not
worry so much about foul trouble and not feel like, all right, we've got to
protect?  
LISA BLUDER: I hope so, although we're a team that's not bringing All-
Americans off the bench, that sort of thing. So we have to make sure that our
top players are still playing smart. I want them to play hard, but they also
need to play smart, too.  
  
Q. Speaking of All-Americans, with Samantha Logic coming in, what does she
bring as a freshman? I read about your European tour and what she brought
there, but what does she bring to this team and how do you expect her to
impact it?  
LISA BLUDER: Samantha, you wouldn't pick her out of the lineup as the All-
American quite honestly, but when she gets on the court, you'd better be ready
to play. She has a grit about her that I really enjoy, and Kachine had that
type of edge. I think really good players have a little bit of an edge to
them, and she has that. She is a tremendous competitor at whatever she does.
She's a very good passer. She's versatile, she can rebound, she's not scared
to be physical at all, and I like that about her.  
But she just has a real good ability to see things unfold before they actually
happen on the floor, and that's kind of a gift.  
  
Q. You had an unfortunate seed at the NCAA Tournament where you were playing
at probably one of the best low-seeded teams in history on their home court.
Is there any possible changes that can be made to prevent that in the future,
or is neutral site just not relevant or doesn't work well enough in the first
couple of rounds?  
LISA BLUDER: Yeah, I have made the NCAA gods mad at me, I know that. I don't
know why, but I have. It was a great game. We played Gonzaga there. That was a
really, really good women's basketball game. You know, we've tried to go to
more neutral sites with the eight sites instead of 16; it didn't work. So we
won't be anxious to go back to it. I know they won't be. You try it once, it
didn't work, you're not going to rush back to that same sort of thing again.
We're obviously not there yet. It's really unfortunate because the national
tournament should not be played on somebody's home court. But that's where we
are, and so we have to deal with it. We can't control it.  
  
Q. Is there any particular player that you would identify as the diamond in
the rough, perhaps Morgan Johnson or someone like that, that may just very
well, or you're hoping will very well step up this year and make a huge
impact?  
LISA BLUDER: You know, we've always tried to be a very balanced team, and I
think that we will be again this year. I think we'll have tremendous balance
on our team. You talk about Morgan Johnson, she's a three-year starter. You
talk about Kamille Wahlin, four-year starter at the point guard position for
us. We've got a lot of really good point guards in this conference, but I
really like Kamille Wahlin and the way she leads our team.  
We've talked about Jaime Printy. Kelly Krei is somebody that people forget
about on our team that is really playing well as a senior, and I think this
happens sometimes with seniors, they've kind of been role players up until
their senior years and all of a sudden a lightbulb turns on, oh, my gosh, it's
my senior year, it's my time to make an impact. Kelly is playing with a little
bit more assertion than she has in the past, and I really like that. We have
another kid that was not on anybody's radar last year, Kalli Hansen, college
transfer from Kirkwood, won two national titles her freshman and sophomore
year. Really was kind of a role player for us last year, and this year she may
start, she may not start, but she will play a lot of minutes, and she is doing
some really good things in practice. If she can stay healthy, she could be
somebody that people just don't think about when they think of the Iowa
Hawkeyes until they see us this year.  
  
Q. When I watch your team, to me a big part of your success will be Morgan
and her ability offensively to sort of maybe things work around her a little
bit more because defensively her shot blocking, her enthusiasm makes such a
difference. How is she a different player now during fall practice than she
was at the end of last year?  
LISA BLUDER: I think Morgan has really enjoyed being a mentor this year. We
have a freshman Bethany Doolittle from St. Paul, Minnesota, who's 6'4" and a
true post, and we haven't had a true post to go along with Morgan ever in her
career. So I think she feels good that she can play and know that somebody is
on the bench that can come in and is not going to be detrimental to the team,
if Morgan has to go out that we can replace her with a center and not have to
change what we're doing by bringing in a power forward, someone out of
position to play her position. I think that gives her a lot of comfort. And I
think she's really enjoying being that mentor this year to a freshman, and
trying to bring them along, and that's really developed her leadership skills.  
And it's just made her more boisterous on the floor, more demanding in the
post, and so I think that's been a really -- she has grown through trying to
help somebody else grow, and that's kind of neat to see.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 6, 2011

  

### [Julia Trogele](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20494)

### [Coquese Washington](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18021)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Ohio State  84  
Penn State - 70

  
MODERATOR: We'll ask Coach Washington to make an opening statement and we will
open the floor for questions for the student-athletes.  
COACH WASHINGTON: Congratulations definitely is in order to Ohio State. I
thought they played a pretty good game and certainly they're going to be a
team that can go in the NCAA Tournament and have a fantastic run when they're
clicking on all cylinders like they were today. They're a tough team to
compete with.  
And really proud of our team, the fight that we showed and the competitive
spirit that we brought to the game.  
MODERATOR: Now open it up for questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. This one is for Julia. I guess I'll start off you had a great game
yesterday, today struggled a little bit. Can you kind of talk about that a
little bit? Was it the presence of Ohio State size inside or something else?  
JULIA TROGELE: I just think my shots weren't falling. Really doesn't come down
to offense. I don't really think so. I think it's more of the defensive
effort. We didn't really get back in transition fast enough. They got a lot of
transition points. I think that, you know, we kind of played very selfish on
offense at times, so something we just have to work on going into the NCAA
Tournament.  
  
Q. Julia, you talked yesterday about how you just didn't want to leave
without it and unfortunately you have to. I guess just want what your thoughts
were walking off the court, in the locker room, talking to teammates, maybe if
you don't mind the intrusion just what's going through your head?  
JULIA TROGELE: I guess just disappointed that we didn't grab the opportunity
and really take the chance to make a statement and take the championship. I
think that I'm very proud of my teammates, how hard they fought. I think I
could have contributed a lot more, but overall I'm just proud of my teammates.
And there's certainly things we have to work on the next two weeks to prepare.
Season's not over yet, so of course, you know, we don't want to hang our
heads. We just got to work on some stuff and get back at it.  
MODERATOR: Other questions for the student-athletes? Thank you, ladies. And
now we'll accept questions for the coach.  
  
Q. Coach, we were talking in the beginning because the pace was so frenetic,
is it three -- three games in three days and the first thing to go might be a
little defense on both sides? I know that's no excuse, but is that part of why
offense being such a high efficiency early on and the defense wasn't as -- for
both teams, as --  
COACH WASHINGTON: Well, I think the game of basketball is you can -- sometimes
great offense trumps great defense, and by no stretch am I saying we played
great defense, but when you have two high-powered offensive teams and you've
got four, five players on the floor for each team that can make shots and make
plays, something's got to give, and, you know, you get a lot of wide-open
looks. You got two teams that can make wide-open looks, and they just made
more of their shots than we did ours.  
  
Q. Coach, as an opponent, you and Ohio State, what can you say is the
biggest difference between the Buckeyes now versus the Buckeyes a couple
months ago?  
COACH WASHINGTON: I think they play with more intensity and particularly on
the defensive end.  
  
Q. Speaking for the Big Ten, would you like to wish Jantel a bon voyage, you
don't deal with her anymore, a great career, but that's the last you'll
probably see of her?  
COACH WASHINGTON: Personally I like playing against -- coaching against great
players. I think it makes -- helps you become a better coach trying to figure
out how to deal with great players. So I know she's leaving, but I hope Ohio
State and the rest of the conference coaches continue to recruit talented
players because it makes for a better conference and it makes it more fun to
play in these types of games when you're playing against some of the nation's
best players.  
  
Q. Coach, could you maybe expand a little bit on how Ohio State was able to
play on offense? The stat sheet doesn't really tell you a whole lot about
differences other than that Ohio State just shot really well from the floor.
Can you talk about their ball movement, what they were able to do? Because
there were times they were just moving it really well out there.  
COACH WASHINGTON: Well, Ohio State has a lot of talent on their team, and you
have to pick your poison with them. And they struggled at times this year, but
it's not because of lack of talent. And once that talent is clicking on all
cylinders, they're tough to guard. The first half Samantha Prahalis is having
her way on the ball screen, you make the adjustment, and now Jantel Lavender
is getting shots and you worry about those two, and Tayler Hill can turn
around and hurt you.  
They got three, four McDonald's All-Americans on their team. They're a tough
team to prepare for. They got talented players that can make plays. So it's
really quite that simple. They've got a lot of good players, and when they're
playing well, and they're making shots, they're tough to defend. They're tough
to defend. And I thought we could have defended better certainly.  
But the reality is I'm really proud of our team and I feel like Ohio State
played like a team that has seniors and juniors who have been here before,
many times before, and understood how long the game is, and our team didn't
understand how long the game is and played with impatience very, very early in
the game. And that impatience led to poor decision-making, that impatience led
to -- we were trying to make ten-point plays, and instead of just being
patient and understanding how long the game is.  
But that's the difference between a team that's been there and experienced
playing in this type of game and a team that hasn't, and it's a lesson that I
hope we learn because we plan on being back here. This is not the last time
you'll see us here.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about Alex Bentley, the year she's had and the
tournament as well?  
COACH WASHINGTON: She's the engine that drives our train. And when she's
playing well and clicking on all cylinders, we're a much better team. I
thought she came up this weekend and was pretty focused and worked hard at
running the team. And I'm happy that she's able to come back to Indianapolis
and have a good showing this weekend.  
  
Q. Coach, I think you talked in Columbus about the arrival of Tayler Hill to
go with Lavender and Prahalis this year, and how important is it for the next
level of the NCAA Tournament to have three at the party like that?  
COACH WASHINGTON: Well, I think they got four at the party at a minimum,
because I don't think you can count out Brittany Johnson, and really you can
talk about Ashley Adams and some of their role players. They all step up.
They're very talented. They've got a lot of weapons.  
So but what Tayler Hill definitely brings to them is another ball hander,
another player who can create her own shot and opportunities offensively. And
when she's able to do that, it takes a little bit of pressure off of Sam
Prahalis and opens things up for everybody else.  
MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Ohio State  84  
Penn State - 70

  
MODERATOR: We will skip the opening statement from the coach and go straight
to questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Samantha, at the very end you threw the ball over to Jantel. Was that
like a little sign of respect: Here, you dribble this one out, you finish this
one? Or?  
SAMANTHA PRAHALIS: I didn't think of it, but I just passed it.  
  
Q. What's going through your head at the end, Jantel? You've had a
remarkable run here, three MOPs and three titles. And, like you said
yesterday, you got good reason to like this town. Put it into words what it's
meant to you.  
JANTEL LAVENDER: I just think it's fun winning for my teammates, and
especially this year with where we came from and how people just kind of gave
up on our team and we just kind of all stuck together, and that's what makes
us feel that much better.  
And, I don't know, I think we played great tonight. We great defense and we
played great team basketball. It makes it that much better just coming from
where we were. Tonight was fun.  
  
Q. Sammy, you kind of lost the last nine minutes of yesterday's game and
then you came out very aggressively in this game. Did you feel like you really
needed do that in this game just to re-establish yourself?  
SAMANTHA PRAHALIS: Well, it was just how the game was. I was getting -- I had
a lane -- every night's different for me. Some nights people are hot and I got
to find them. In the first half I was having my way and having open lanes. So
it's just what the game brings.  
  
Q. You guarded Lucas for a lot of the game, and she's basically 1-for-10 and
0-for-6 from 3, but what were you guys supposed to do with her and how did it
work?  
SAMANTHA PRAHALIS: Just lock and trail. She's a really good shooter with a
quick release, so it was lock and trail. I mean, it did a lock and trail and
then lock her up, or let her go off. We can't have her go off in a
championship game.  
  
Q. Jantel, this might be unfair, but do you think this might be the most
balanced of the three Ohio State teams that's won the title, maybe the best of
the three?  
JANTEL LAVENDER: I think it's the most talented team as far as different looks
that we had. I think we have a lot of different things to look at on our
perimeter, like Sammy with her ball handling and her ability to shoot the 3s,
Brittany, Tayler's ability to drive the ball. It's just that we have a lot of
different looks, and I just would say more talented I guess.  
  
Q. Samantha, can you talk about your team's confidence level coming off this
nine-game win streak now entering the tournament? Where do you stand in terms
of confidence?  
SAMANTHA PRAHALIS: We're very confident. We've been moving the ball good. But
we don't forget where we was a month ago. All we have is each other, and I
think we realize that now and we play for each other.  
  
Q. Samantha, it seemed like when you were out there especially in the second
half there was a stretch for about three or four minutes that you looked kind
of like the Phoenix Suns out there; there was a lot of fastbreak and there was
a three-pass sequence. Can you just talk about how that felt just to be kind
of in that role as a team?  
SAMANTHA PRAHALIS: I think when we play good defense and rebound the ball, we
could run. Jantel runs the floor the best, so getting her layups, having
Brittany spot up, and everyone is unselfish to the point where they'll look
for each other, make the extra pass and get good shots.  
So when we're in transition, we really like to be in transition, but it all
starts from our defense.  
  
Q. Jantel, 13-9 about four weeks ago, and here you are nine wins in a row.
How far do you feel like you've come and what -- how many ways?  
JANTEL LAVENDER: I think we've come a long way as a team mentally with
toughness-wise. I just think we came together and tonight in this tournament
we proved that we are a good team and we can, you know, contend with any team
in the country and NCAA-caliber teams.  
And, I don't know, I just think we really, like, know who we are now, and I
think we're playing like that. We can have situations come up and, you know,
get through them and still be able to play a good game. And it doesn't matter
what's thrown at us, because we've dealt with adversity at the beginning of
the season, and I think that made us a lot tougher.  
And it's shown these last nine games that, I don't know, we are a good team. I
don't know what to say. I'm just so excited about the win. I don't know. It's
just a lot of things that we've overcome as a team, and I'm just excited that
we can get through those things and play still.  
  
Q. I'm kind of curious, Jantel, studying all your numbers and all these
incredible stats and I feel like years from now I'm going to get into debate
with somebody about some of the greatest players ever seen and your name
should come up first, and again we can go on and on about all the things
you've done, but it really doesn't matter; it's just winning, right?  
JANTEL LAVENDER: Definitely. I'm a team player. And like I said to someone out
there, it's just I would trade in any MVP or any Player of the Year for my
teammates to win, for us to get a championship, for us to win big games.  
And, I don't know, I just really enjoyed this part of it, the championship and
the (indiscernible). It can never get old.  
  
Q. Jantel, can you talk about just being here in the past and how much that
experience played into being able to come out here and be calm and competitive
early?  
JANTEL LAVENDER: I definitely think our experience here has helped us win this
game tonight. Penn State, they're a great team and I think it's like their
first time coming -- I mean being in a championship in a couple years.  
I think our -- us having that experience in the last three years just, deal
with three games in three days and be able to know how to ice, know what we
need to do in order to be ready for the game.  
It just really -- I don't know. It's just a difference with being able to --
with being there as opposed to not being there, having that toughness and
knowing that, overcoming it mentally I would say.  
  
Q. Jantel, did Samantha give you the heads up on the piggyback ride? Did she
warn you she was going to do that?  
SAMANTHA PRAHALIS: That's a tradition. We did that all three years.  
  
Q. You've done it all three years? Have you really? Serious?  
JANTEL LAVENDER: Yeah.  
  
Q. Here? Same spot, probably. But you remember that, huh?  
SAMANTHA PRAHALIS: Yeah.  
  
Q. Really?  
SAMANTHA PRAHALIS: Yeah.  
  
Q. And you don't stay there that long, though; it's like you don't want her
to throw her back out --  
SAMANTHA PRAHALIS: She's thrown me around a little bit.  
  
Q. Has she really? Not too heavy, is she?  
JANTEL LAVENDER: Not at all.  
MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. We'll open it up for questions for the coach.  
  
Q. I'm sorry, Coach, I'm overly sentimental, but I just feel like you need
to -- I'd love to have a statement on just being able to watch her play the
last three years.  
COACH FOSTER: I've said this before: I'm not going to talk about that until
the legacy is complete. Yeah. So call me in about five weeks. Okay?  
Yeah, great player, I love having her, but people -- it's not done yet. And I
don't like to -- the resumé is not finished. But then call me and we'll have a
long talk.  
  
Q. Does this feel like kind of a long -- like three different seasons really
and does it seem like what happened in the middle of it is like a long time
ago now?  
COACH FOSTER: Another lifetime. Yeah. Long time ago. But it's -- we are who we
are, and we are a byproduct of our experiences and we had a lot of them and we
grew up a lot.  
  
Q. I wonder what was going through your mind here. You've got the last
minute or two to -- you know it's coming. I mean, what went through your mind
as you knew they were going to soak it up and celebrate this?  
COACH FOSTER: I just wanted to get the seniors on the floor together and let
them play together at the end. They came in together, accomplished a lot
together in this tournament, and wanted them to have that experience of being
together.  
  
Q. Coach, could you maybe talk about what Jantel and Sam brought today in
particular? Really seemed like this was a much smoother-flowing team on
offense than we've seen in the past two days. Can you kind of get into that a
little bit?  
COACH FOSTER: I might have to debate you on that. I mean, I think we had some
pretty good offensive performances in this tournament. Different. Different
every night. Brittany with her 3s against Iowa last night. If a certain play
works, I'm not going to show you that we have 15 of them. We're going to keep
running that until you guard it.  
So last night was Jantel, and today -- you know, you used the Phoenix Suns
analogy, and I think you probably offended Sammy a little bit. She would much
prefer you be referring to her as a Laker. Well, the Lakers are champions and
she loves Kobe.  
  
Q. Can you talk about how this championship is different from the last two,
or is it at all?  
COACH FOSTER: To be quite frank, last year was sort of -- was more a relief,
you know, the feeling of relief because we had -- we're not who we are this
year. This year walking into this tournament I thought we were really playing
well, I thought we were focused, I thought we were together, I thought the
ball moved extremely well and that we really understood how important the
defensive aspect was for us.  
So I would say this -- this was the best team of the last three, and I think
how we won this I think is a reflection of that.  
  
Q. Coach, can you please talk about your senior class and how they've
developed as young adults? Not basketball players but how they've --  
COACH FOSTER: Well, they've all grown up tremendously and understand and fit
into their roles. I don't think there's -- if there's going to be one person
that sort of reflects that class, everybody looks at Jantel, and why wouldn't
you? I mean, the numbers. And Brittany and Al, but Sarah Schulze is a kid that
is playing on one leg. And to watch her effort, her attitude, her -- it's
inspirational to everyone, let alone her teammates, and it sort of typifies
and identifies that class.  
  
Q. The way Penn State plays and 70 points is a pretty good number for you
defensively?  
COACH FOSTER: Yeah. Yeah. Real good. It's a possession game. You know, I heard
the announcer speculating whether or not it would be wise for us to run with
them. And if you look at Sammy's motor, maybe we should take their analysts'
credentials away from them. Why would you run with her?  
  
Q. Coach, looking at this win, a lot of people are talking about how things
are much different for you. How are they different, and what are the constants
throughout?  
COACH FOSTER: Well, they're different because we are handling our business,
they're different because we've -- we understand the value of helping from a
defensive point of view, and we understand a scouting report and what our
assignments are within the framework of it. We understand that when we move
the ball around the floor we're a very talented team and a difficult team to
defend. But I think more than anything we have better understanding of who we
are as people, and we had to figure some stuff out.  
  
Q. Is it fun to watch your offense go when Sammy gets rolling like that and
just finding people and finishing?  
COACH FOSTER: Yeah, everybody -- you have to pick your poison and how are you
going to guard us, you know. Last night it was, okay, we're going to play
Lavender, single coverage. Okay. And everybody's on board. We like that. And,
oh, we're going to double team you. Okay. Well, we like that. We'll adjust.  
And then tonight we're going to extend on Johnson and we're going to space the
floor a little bit and we're going to open up the middle. All right. We like
that.  
So we're going to just play. We're going to figure out what it is you're
trying to do, take away what it is we like to do and then we'll adjust and try
to create opportunities for the player that -- you know, from Friday night,
Brittany taking 14 3s to Saturday Jantel taking 20 shots to today having 23,
23, 17. Whatever it takes.  
MODERATOR: Any more questions for the coach? Thanks, Coach, for joining us,
and congratulations.  
COACH FOSTER: Thank you.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

### [Julia Trogele](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20494)

_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Penn State  79  
Illinois - 64

  
MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Maggie, can you just talk about your day today in the run that you put
together late in the second half to really put things away?  
MAGGIE LUCAS: You know, it was kind of an up-and-down game. There was a lot of
runs. You've got to hand it to Illinois. They really -- they never held their
heads down, got to give it to them on that. But the run, I think we just stuck
together when it got hard. We could have hung our heads when they came back on
us, but we just stuck together even more, got some stops, and that led to our
offense.  
  
Q. Julia, could you talk about the day you had free-throw line? You took 12
free throws, hit all of them. And the free throw discrepancy, you guys shot
twice the free throws that Illinois did. That looked like a huge part of this
game. Can you talk about that a little bit.  
JULIA TROGELE: I think we were just being aggressive going to the basket and
knowing that, you know, we were going to get fouled, and we took advantage of
that, made our free throws. I've never been to the free-throw line this many
times, but I'm glad that the refs are finally calling some fouls for me. Just
kidding.  
It was just being aggressive, going -- you know, going to the basket and
making sure that when we did get to the line that we finished and kind of hurt
them on the line.  
  
Q. They're not going to do it anymore now that you said that. You know that,
right?  
JULIA TROGELE: No, they will.  
  
Q. Julia, props to the other team maybe from you guys. Are you allowed to
admit that you didn't expect to be facing Illinois in the semifinal here?  
JULIA TROGELE: Honestly, I wasn't surprised. I think they really had nothing
to lose and I think that they came in to the Big Ten tournament just like any
other Big Ten team. This conference is extremely competitive, so I think that
any team on any given night can win.  
So I don't -- I wasn't really surprised, I was, you know, happy for them, but
I knew that we were going to take care of that.  
  
Q. This is for Maggie. What on the floor occurred in the last ten minutes
that enabled you guys to put them away? Were they just getting tired? You guys
just feel it? Or what happened out there? What was the big thing that
occurred?  
MAGGIE LUCAS: One of the things I noticed when I was out there was our bigs
were just cleaning up the rebounds and making it really hard for Illinois'
guards when they would drive to the basket. I mean, they were influencing so
many shots and then getting the rebounds and getting out to the guards on the
run.  
So I think it had a lot to do with our post players just taking care of it,
rebounding the ball so well.  
  
Q. Maggie, Illinois actually took the lead there in the second half and you
guys came back. It really seemed like that one 3 that you hit kind of turned
the tide a little bit. Can you speak to that a little bit?  
MAGGIE LUCAS: I can never say it's just one play in a game. So many factors go
into a win. I'm glad the shot went in, but that didn't get the win for us.  
  
Q. Julia, the veteran of the team, can you describe what halftime was like
when they made that big push, got back into the game, what was the mindset
like at halftime and how were you able to come back in the second half?  
JULIA TROGELE: The mindset at halftime, of course we were pretty disappointed
in ourselves for letting them get back in the game, but I think we knew they
were going to make a run or two, so it was kind of like we were just
encouraging each other. And we knew that we had to come out in the second
half.  
We're usually a second half team, so I think that that plays to our advantage.
And we weren't really discouraged, we knew that we just needed to take care of
businesses and play our game. And be up, really. We couldn't let them get any
uncontested shots, any second-chance opportunities from rebounds.  
So, like Maggie said, I think our post really cleaned up the board and we
created some turnovers and that sparked our offense.  
  
Q. For either of the players, Illinois was a team that hadn't trailed yet in
the tournament up until this game. How important was it to get an early lead
and build that question early on?  
JULIA TROGELE: I think it's important, but the thing is we wanted to really
extend the lead and we kind of let them come back in the game. But, like you
said, it builds a lot of confidence. And I think that it shows you that -- for
them, for example, they weren't ever down, so -- and they got those two wins
against Wisconsin and Michigan. So for us it was the same thing. We knew that
we could win the game having such a significant lead.  
  
Q. For both you, I can't ask you what you were doing 15 years ago, but you
do understand the significance of 1996, don't you?  
JULIA TROGELE: Yes. That was the last time we were in the Big Ten Tournament
championship.  
  
Q. And you won it.  
JULIA TROGELE: Oh, we won it? Okay.  
  
Q. Might bring that up --  
JULIA TROGELE: Coquese said that we were already giving her gray hairs back
then, even though we weren't even committed then.  
But, yes, I think it's really significant for us. And I think that this just
shows like for the whole season we worked extremely hard and we think that we
deserve to be in this game and we want to go home with a title.  
We didn't play all these games during the season, battle this hard, to not
take it home.  
  
Q. Maggie, you're not going to get off the hook that easy. You got a chance
to do something you haven't done in 15 years tomorrow. Maybe you won't dwell
on it, but it's got to mean something.  
MAGGIE LUCAS: I mean, it means a lot being in a championship game. So many
teams want to be in our shoes right now. So we have to bring a 40-minute game
tomorrow. We can't have any comebacks like we let just happen there.  
So we have to bring 40 minutes of mental focus tomorrow.  
MODERATOR: Thank you. That will do it for the student-athletes. Now we'll open
it up to questions for Coach Washington.  
  
Q. Coach, when you went in the locker room at halftime, they had made that
big run. How much maturity did the team show in the second half that maybe you
hadn't seen in the past?  
COACH WASHINGTON: Maturity? Wow. Interesting choice of words. Maturity. Well,
we've been a second half team for most of the season. We usually play a little
bit better the second half. Sometimes it takes us the first half to kind of
get a feel for the game and how it's being played and what we need to do and
sometimes for them just to settle down and get in the game and not play with
so much emotional -- you know, up in the air, being up in the air emotionally.  
But, you know, I felt like we played better the second half, and I encouraged
them to do that.  
  
Q. (Off microphone)?  
COACH WASHINGTON: Uh-huh. Encouraged.  
  
Q. Is there anything in particular that you said in the locker room after
they came back, got it to two, or anything that you can repeat here?  
COACH WASHINGTON: Well, now, my mom is here. I'm very civilized when my mom is
around.  
Honestly, what we talked about was really two things offensively we weren't
executing. We weren't really running any offense. And sometimes, you know, we
want to play up tempo, we want to play fast, and we're good at that.  
But there are times when we're playing fast without a purpose. And we did that
late in the first half. We were playing fast without a purpose. Our shot
selection, it wasn't bad, but sometimes we weren't getting the best shot that
we could have got on a possession. We talked about the need to balance playing
fast with executing offensively once they got back in and had us running and
had us running offense against their set defense. We needed to be smarter and
play with more intelligence.  
And also defensively we kind of got a little lazy when we got a lead. We were
pretty aggressive in the zone to start the half, and then we kind of got a
lead and we got a little bit of complacent, so to speak, and so we really
talked about having more energy on the defensive end of the floor and slowing
down a little bit and executing on the offensive end of the floor, and I
thought we did a better job of that the second half  
  
Q. Coach, kind of following up on that, again, ten minutes to go, all of a
sudden your team started playing a lot better. Was there a fundamental change
you made defensively or offensively or was it just your team started playing
better?  
COACH WASHINGTON: We switched from zone to man to man, and I thought we got a
little bit more aggressive. We got some steals, got some stops, got some
rebounds and got going in transition. So I thought the switch from zone to man
really helped our aggressiveness and our intensity on the defensive end of the
floor.  
  
Q. Seemed like the other big advantage you had in this game was bench
points. You outscored them 33 to 18. Can you talk about the importance of that
both today and looking forward to tomorrow?  
COACH WASHINGTON: Well, I like our bench and I think we have people that can
come off the bench and come into the game and impact us in a lot of ways.
Certainly Maggie does it from a scoring perspective. But the game isn't just
about offense, and I thought our bench came in, Talia and Ariel and Renee
Womack, and they gave us -- and Marisa, all of those guys came in and gave us
some good minutes. Especially defensively.  
And in the first half we were able to be rested for the second half and play
our starters a little more the second half and have energy to finish the game.  
  
Q. The significance of the 15 years since the school has won this, will you
mention it? Will you dwell on it? Will it be a source of pregame speech? I've
heard both sides of how to fire a team up for a game and whether you want to
dwell on it a lot or not.  
COACH WASHINGTON: We're really proud of our history. And we talked about the
fact that we've won Big Ten championships in the past, not in terms of a
drought, but in terms of just the strong legacy that this program has carried
over the years. We've been a program that has had a lot of success in
conference tournament play. We've had a lost success in regular season play.
We've had a lot of success in NCAA tournament play. And we're just happy that
we're in a position now to add to that legacy.  
MODERATOR: Coach, congratulations.

_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Ohio State  72  
Michigan State - 57

  
MODERATOR: We will go ahead as follows where we have the coach have an opening
statement and then we'll have questions for the student-athletes. Coach?  
COACH MERCHANT: Well, obviously we're disappointed. I think we dug ourselves a
hole in the first half. I thought Jantel Lavender was like just amazing and
just caught everything, finished everything. I felt like it was the best I've
seen her play all year. And we kind of had some careless mistakes defensively
as well as offensively. But then I really liked our fight when we came out. I
thought we -- eight and a half minutes to go, it's a tied game, and we were in
the hole. We adjusted at halftime what we were doing with Jantel, and I
thought that made a difference. Obviously slowed her down a little bit for a
while.  
And then obviously we had three straight turnovers and it was a 9-point game
and that was that. And that was disappointing. All three of those were kind of
turnover for touchdowns or follows. And then obviously we fouled them too
much. They shot 26 free throws, I think, to our 12 and 22 to 12 in the fouls,
and that's just -- that was one of our goals is not to put them to the line,
and we apparently didn't accomplish that.  
MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes?  
  
Q. Lykendra, can you speak to the physical nature of this game and how it
affected the flow at a certain point?  
LYKENDRA JOHNSON: In the first half it affected our flow a little bit, but in
the second half, like coach said, I think we did a pretty good job on limiting
her touches, and if she did get it, I was being physical with her. So it was
an all-out war and, I mean, tonight wasn't my night.  
  
Q. Lykendra, could you speak to the difficulty of having to body up with
that gal? I mean, she's got the rep, she's got the points, everybody knows who
she is, but you have to try and get on her and stop her somehow, right?  
LYKENDRA JOHNSON: I mean, yeah. She's a very solid player. I mean, she's got
at least 60 pounds on me or something like that. But, I mean, I'm just -- I
was trying to do anything and everything I can just to stop her. And I think
just trusting that my teammates run in there and have the help side there, it
just changed the whole momentum in the second half.  
  
Q. Lykendra, can you talk about adjustments you tried to make in the second
half with trying to body her?  
LYKENDRA JOHNSON: In the first half we just fronting her, of course. And the
second half coach told me to play behind her, and I think it was better for us
because me, I had a little pride on the line, and she had 21 in the first
half. So just playing behind her and just basically limiting her touches,
trying to do anything and everything. But at that point she had 21 and
probably six rebounds and almost a double-double. I mean, it was a pride thing
on the line.  
  
Q. Kalisha, with Jantel scoring so often, how much pressure did that put on
your offense to try and match her?  
KALISHA KEANE: I mean, any time the offensive team goes down and we're on
defense and tries to score, we get the same opportunity. So we needed to get
stops in order to get good transition looks and good shots at the basket.  
Did we do a great job of it on her? She had a great night, so no. It happens.
I mean, the game was within reach about at the eight-minute mark and then
there was a two-minute stretch where we turned the ball over and they
capitalized on our turnovers. And the game of basketball can switch like that.
So we take this and we learn from it and we get ready for the NCAA tournament.  
  
Q. Kalisha, you talk about that stretch. What happened in that stretch in
terms of how those turnovers were made and what happened defensively?  
KALISHA KEANE: We turned the ball over for what Coach calls a touchdown. You
can't defend that kind of stuff. It's hard to if you turn it over and they get
any transition looks like that.  
And then we put them to the free throw line and, you know, that's not what we
really were trying to do, obviously. So it's tough to guard those things and
then get a flow offensively.  
  
Q. Kalisha, you, Lykendra, Brittney all ended up with four fouls. Did you
feel at some point that you guys were restricted or limited at all being in
foul trouble, and what you were trying to do out there offensively or
defensively?  
KALISHA KEANE: You know what? I'm a competitor, and I know my teammates are
competitors, and we're never going to blame any kind of refereeing or anything
like that. We're going to go out and play as hard as we can and play within
the guidelines of how the game is being played.  
So if we weren't getting calls going our way or if we were, we're staying
going to play as hard as we can. And like I said, tonight was not our night in
that two-minute stretch, but I would never in my life blame any kind of loss
on a referee at all.  
  
Q. Kalisha, the positives obviously outweigh the negatives of this team, how
many wins you've had, the outright Big Ten title. You've done so many great
things. But how much does it sting that you didn't follow through and win
tournament championship? And I'm trying to --  
KALISHA KEANE: You're being very blunt and honest with me. It hurts to lose
any time. Obviously this year we're not very used to losing. So losing
obviously sucks, and losing to a team three times in a season sucks even more.  
But this is motivation for us going into, you know, this next week and to this
next round of playing for our lives. So it's motivation. That's all I can look
at it now. It's over. It already happened. I'm not going to dwell on it.  
  
Q. Can you talk about what you learned about a game like this in terms of
preparing yourself with the atmosphere here and to get ready for the NCAA
Tournament?  
KALISHA KEANE: First of all, this is the probably the best atmosphere I've
ever seen at a Big Ten Tournament in all four years that I've been here, so
that was incredible.  
Preparing happens when you deal with the different situations. So that two-
minute stretch, next time we're in that situation with a turnover, we're not
going to have back-to-back turnovers like that. We're going to learn from the
situation, and once we have that one turnover we're going to regroup and not
allow 2 points to turn into 8 to 10 and then foul and put them on the line. So
you learn from the situations and that's all you can do.  
MODERATOR: Any further questions for the student-athletes? Thank you, ladies.
Now we'll open it up to questions for Coach Merchant.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about like right in that same stretch? I think
it was right when they started to pull away and you had a bunch of players
with four fouls. How does that change and affect your coaching in that spot?  
COACH MERCHANT: It's difficult, obviously. I mean, I think we had four kids
with four fouls. Maybe not all at that same time, but they were definitely in
foul trouble.  
Even Taylor Alton, who only played seven minutes in the first half, had three
fouls in seven minutes. So she was in foul trouble out of gates too, which
forced you to play Cetera longer, who they weren't guarding. That made things
a little difficult for us, too, in terms of options there.  
But like Kal said, certainly our goal was not to foul them and keep them off
the line, and we didn't do that, and they scored between the free throw line.
And I think Jantel's barrage in the first half, it was really difficult to
kind of make that up.  
But at the same time that foul situation, we've dealt with that all year. I've
never had it where there's so many of them, but I do think we played through
it. I think to be able to finish with Kal and L.J. on the floor and Porsche
and have some options, I mean, we didn't have anybody that wasn't available to
us. So you have to adjust and play a little bit different and smarter.  
  
Q. The question I asked them, kind of the same thing to you. You've done
some great things this year and the positives outweigh the negatives. How do
you feel about not finishing the deal here? And maybe speak to what she said
about maybe using this as motivation for the future?  
COACH MERCHANT: Certainly. I think you learn every time you step foot on the
floor, whether it's a win or a loss. Obviously we had three straight
turnovers, two by Brittney and one by Annalise, that you just can't turn them
over for touchdowns. That's just -- not in these big games, not in the post
season, not in survive-and-advance mode. You have to make people work.  
And our defense is obviously pretty solid. It wasn't as good tonight,
obviously. But you can't defend those things. And our gift is defending in the
quarter court. We've been a very good team there. And that's not a quarter
court situation. And you're disadvantaged, which then leads to foul situations
and puts more kids in tough spots.  
So it's -- I liked our fight. I liked our fight coming in the locker room. I
was certainly disappointed in how we performed. But at the same time, to see
them come out and fight and get right back in it and make that, it's not easy
to do that. And I thought we did a great job of getting it to that point.  
And then Britt's got to handle it better. She's a senior point guard. There's
no reason for her to cough the ball up or give it to the other team. I mean,
A.P. is a freshman. Not that I'm going to make an excuse, you have to make a
read. She's got to be a better player at that point too. But those really hurt
us. And Britt's got to learn from that. And she's had four years of making
sure that doesn't happen.  
So against Ohio State I thought they the did a really good job of getting into
our point guards. And in that little stretch, we didn't handle it, and that's
all they need. That's all they needed was just a little bit of a daylight, and
they kind of broke through the wall there.  
  
Q. Lykendra talked a little bit about it being a point of pride for her
trying to guard Jantel. What did you see out of her in the second half trying
to take that upon herself to improve and maybe come out a little bit better
out of gate?  
COACH MERCHANT: I think Jantel was really probably fired up to play Lykendra.
I think Lykendra is hard to play against because she's pretty physical and can
bug people, and we made the adjustment to play behind. We played behind her
before and we've struggled to defend her. She's a great player. I mean, you
know, like I'm glad it's the post-season and I don't have to see her again.
She's -- and have an opportunity to coach her with USA Basketball. She's just
the real deal.  
So you knew you were taking a chance. But we felt like if we could limit her
touches, we could maybe take away some things.  
But then in the second half, pushing her off the block and trying to dig down
from the strong side, I thought that was important for us. And then they got
all the 50/50 balls in the first half, which also hurt us. And then I thought
in the second half we kind of shored that up too.  
I liked our fight, I just think the air kind of came out of balloon there when
Brittany turned it over in A.P. three straight times.  
  
Q. Were some of those turnovers as a result of the lineup they had in the
court at that point? I think they had taken Prahalis out and put in their
stoppers.  
COACH MERCHANT: Well, Stokes is a good defender certainly. I think that's
normally what she does, is she gets up into people. Yeah. I mean, we made the
run at times, too, and when both of them were on the floor, I just -- I mean,
I don't think it was a direct correlation, per se, I just think Britt just
didn't handle it.  
  
Q. It's kind of a follow-up. How physical was this game on the offensive end
for you guys?  
COACH MERCHANT: I think it was pretty physical. I thought they got under our
skin a little more than we like. I think we got to do a better job of handling
that. I think L.J. had four fouls and three of them were offensive. That's
kind of unusual. Hers are usually in the defensive end. So that was kind of
difficult.  
But you got to credit certainly Ohio State. I thought Jantel just played
possessed. That was just the best word for it. She was not going to have it
today. And I think maybe even Lykendra being Defensive Player of the Year just
tried to challenge herself a little bit more and be a little more aggressive.
And 15 for 20 from the floor is pretty impressive. And didn't miss a free
throw. And she did it more than one way. We got her out away from the rim, and
she just killed it from there too.  
She just proved she is a big-time player today, and we didn't really have an
answer for her.  
  
Q. Apologize, Coach. I'm just kind of trying to understand this a little
bit. Looking at Ohio State, comparing it to past years when you faced them, I
thought it was more of relying on Jantel. And last night when I watched them
it looked like a totally different team that they were willing to spread it
around, move the ball around. Is this Ohio State team you faced more
unselfish, or is that more of a problem for you as a coach to face a team that
looked like they were giving the ball up more and sharing it more?  
COACH MERCHANT: I think they were -- I think there's a difference in the two
teams they played. Ohio plays nothing but zone and you don't make one pass in
a ball screening and shoot it. You work this side, top side, you get some
skips, you go inside, you go outside. Or a man team and they go to their two-
man game with a ball screen on the wing and try to create and get it inside.  
So it was certainly -- I think they felt they had a height advantage in there
and also think just Jantel was like wanting to make a point today, that, you
know, she wanted to be the Player of the Year and she was going to against the
Defensive Player of Year at the same time.  
And, you know, it was a good match-up. It was a good game. I liked their
fight, like I said. We just had a two-minute meltdown, and sometimes that's
all it takes.  
  
Q. Kind of looking forward to the next week, two weeks. First, what do you
guys do in the next week while you're in limbo here in terms of practice or
days off or whatnot? And then, secondly, where do you think that this team
will fall when it comes to the Selection Show in a couple weeks?  
COACH MERCHANT: I'm not big into predictions. I think we're a heck of a ball
club. I think we did our body of work this year. We beat some really tough
teams on the road. You look at five losses, two of those were one possession,
one was an away game to Baylor and three were to Ohio State, and one to Iowa
who was obviously a last possession game too.  
So I don't think we've put ourselves in a position that doesn't warrant a
positive seed in a high seed. I think Ohio State is a good team and making the
run in starting to play better basketball certainly, so I think the committee
will see that.  
What do we do now? We takes a couple days off for sure. We'll be off Sunday,
Monday, and regroup on Tuesday and kind of set the plan, course of action from
there.  
But it's an opportunity certainty for us to get better. It really is an
opportunity for us to get better and to have a good balance of what we think
we have to work on to make sure that things like this don't happen, we take
care of the ball a little bit better.  
MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach.

### [Jolette Law](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18032)

### [Karisma Penn](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21788)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Penn State  79  
Illinois - 64

  
MODERATOR: Coach, if you'd like to give an opening statement, then we'll open
it up for questions for the student-athletes.  
COACH LAW: I just want to say that I'm so proud of my kids. In my eyes they're
winners. A long time ago they could have given up, but they didn't. They came
in here and they fought and they gave me everything they had, and I'm glad to
say the future at the University of Illinois looks real bright. I've got these
two young ladies next to me, and the other eight is in the locker room. So I'm
extremely proud to be their coach.  
MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach. We'll now open it up for the student-athlete
questions.  
  
Q. Can you talk about defending Maggie, what you were trying to do and what
it's like trying to defend her whether she's driving or along the perimeter?  
ADRIENNE GODBOLD: No disrespect, but I just felt like I was able to guard her
and I would be able to stop her. And her dribbling skills weren't where they
need to be, I guess. And I'm allowed to stop her on the perimeter and on
driving, like, all of it. I just knew I would be able stop her.  
  
Q. Karisma? Is that how you say it?  
KARISMA PENN: Uh-huh.  
  
Q. I didn't want to mispronounce it for the people taking the quotes. I'm
kind of curious how an athlete doesn't let the losing mentality creep in. You
guys had enough negativity this year. You didn't come to town and play like
it. I mean, I'm thinking -- could you speak to how you guys kept going and how
maybe two games here meant as much as anything this year to you guys?  
KARISMA PENN: We just never got down on ourselves. I think we lost five games
this season in the last couple seconds. So we always knew we were one or two
plays away from just getting the win. So we just never got down on ourselves.
And when the Big Ten Tournament started it's kind of like part three of the
season. So it was a whole new beginning for us.  
  
Q. Adrienne, it seemed like as the game was going along, especially cutting
it the way you did at the half with a 2-point game at the half, can you talk a
little bit about kind of bringing it back and what the mood was going into the
locker room?  
ADRIENNE GODBOLD: We just had to pretty much hold the ropes. We knew Karisma
was on the bench in foul trouble so we just did what we had to do, get stops
and execute on offense, and it was just -- I was the one that was doing it. So
hold the ropes. And we did a pretty good job as a team.  
  
Q. You two might not know this. We're used to seeing Jolette on Saturday and
Sundays around here, so kind of tradition. I'm wondering, you're going to take
way these two games, you're going to think about them, you're going to say we
can build off this. Really, seriously, Karisma, what do you thinking you take
from two days where I think you probably surprised everybody but yourself?  
KARISMA PENN: Like you said, we didn't surprise ourselves, and I think that's
the biggest thing. I don't know if the belief in ourselves was there every
game this season. But just these past two days I can say everybody believed.
And going forward, we have everybody returning.  
So as long as we have confidence in ourselves, we just keep it up and get
better, I don't think anything can stop us next year. We just really have to
look at what we just did the last two days, and there's no reason why we
should have been 9 and 22 this year.  
  
Q. Karisma, can you talk about how much of a difference it made that you
guys played an extra game whereas Penn State had a bye in the first round?  
KARISMA PENN: I don't know because I've never had a bye on the first round so
I couldn't really speak on how that feels.  
  
Q. Karisma, what actually happened on the floor in the last ten minutes of
the game where they were able to pull away? Were they quicker? Were they
playing better? Did they switch defenses on you? What happened out there?  
KARISMA PENN: I think there were a few questionable calls there, and when that
happens the momentum kind of switched. I think the momentum kind of switched
to their favor a lot. And I just don't think that it was called evenly on both
ends, so it was kind of getting to the point where we were getting frustrated,
and I think sometimes frustration just creeps up on you. And I think that's
most of what happened towards the end. It kind of got away from us.  
  
Q. Karisma, following up on that, the free throw discrepancy was pretty
significant. They shot 30, you only shot 15. Would you say that was more of a
style of play type thing, or what was it that had you guys struggling to get
to the foul line?  
KARISMA PENN: No, I don't think it was style of play because they shoot 3s. So
they got to the line 30 times and we got 15 times. I think that's -- I mean,
the numbers speak for themselves. That's crazy.  
MODERATOR: Any more questions for the student-athletes? Thanks, ladies, if you
want to head back to your locker room.  
All right. We'll open it up for questions for the coach.  
  
Q. Same questions earlier, Coach. How did the losing mentality not creep in
with these guys this year? Because you had to worry about it.  
COACH LAW: I did. But I was a leader. You know, I had to make sure that they
always saw -- I had to get the positive at all times and always keep them
focused on the positives. We were very young, teaching them, keep motivating
them, keeping their spirits up in spite of the defeat.  
So I just kept telling them stay the course, we gotta -- just take the
positive out of every game. If we carve out two minutes, if we carve out 10.5
seconds, if we do the little things. So every year -- every day I was just
coming up with a lot of creative things to just keep them focused on the long-
term goals. And I look at the record, and I've told a lot of people, I've told
the press in Champaign, I've released them from the record. I'm just trying to
right now to get the better.  
I have a very young team. A lot of them did play, a lot of them didn't have a
lot of experience, and we had a lot to learn. And I just think that this test
this year was our storm. So it won't be long. So I'm looking at the future and
I feel very confident.  
  
Q. Coach, all season long you and the players have been saying that you were
really close to getting over that hump and really being a good team. Do you
feel like this tournament run kind of proved you guys right in a way?  
COACH LAW: I always knew what we had, and I know I saw a lot in them a long
time ago. But I think finally they realized how good they could be if we all
buy into all the little things and everyone played their role and if we follow
the game plan.  
I told them from day one, October 15, the season is going to come down all the
little things. Don't think about the big picture and the score. It's going to
come down to the little things. I think we learned in these last two days,
they finally saw themselves, you know, wow, if we would have done this all
year long. I went, yeah, I was trying to tell you.  
But it's great that I have them all coming back, and I feel that this
experience really will -- they'll now know what it takes to be -- to go to
that next step to go to the finals and what you have to do during the course
of Chapter 1 and 2 to be able to perform in Chapter 3.  
  
Q. The little things bearing down, it seemed like you guys at the end of
that first half you went on -- I believe it was a 15-to-2 run, closed the gap
to 2 going into the half when that 3 hit the buzzer, and it really seemed like
the building was behind you guys. Can you talks about what kind of maturity it
shows that they were able take that first punch and keep on going?  
COACH LAW: I told them I knew that Penn State -- great team. Like I said, a
great team. Well coached. They have different weapons, and I have the utmost
respect for them. I just said they made a run and we could have -- in the past
probably would have dropped our heads and got really frustrated. But Karisma
was on the bench and there were other people that stepped up and held the
rope. We always say let's hold the rope, hold the rope.  
And I was very proud of how we responded. Went in the locker room, I just told
them the first five minutes of the second half is going to be crucial and
they're going to make another run and we've just got to make sure we are
focused and we're poised.  
And once we got through that and then -- I'm not trying to disregard what
Karisma said, but it was -- they got really frustrated after a while because
there were some calls being made. But that's another thing. You can't let a
tough player, you can't let officials, you can't let anything, the crowd, you
can't let anything rattle you. And that's another growing step that we're
getting to. So I charge that to being young and not knowing.  
So no excuses. Right now I just think the last ten minutes, to answer your
question, Penn State just went to another level and I think we sort of, you
know -- they took advantage of our mistakes.  
  
Q. Coach, you had four players in double figures. I've been kind of watching
your team from afar, and I kept seeing Karisma Penn scoring all the points.
Was this a major step for you watching four players in double figures? And did
you that all tournament, I think.  
COACH LAW: It was a major step for us because I've been asking for it all
year. And I've been trying to build confidence in each one of my players. That
is, not just Karisma; we need to be a total team and everybody needed to do
their part.  
And I just think that, you know, Monday before we got here I just needed more
from them. I need all of you, everybody, whatever you can give, give it.  
I think they all embraced it and started just, you know, playing and, now
they're starting -- this weekend we start knowing what the offense is, we knew
the second cuts, third cuts, third options, fourth options. During the course
of the season, it was option number one, let's get it to Karisma and let's
stay in and watch her.  
But I think we've grown up a lot and now we're moving forward. I think it will
be positive.  
  
Q. Going back to those final ten minutes, I know I asked Karisma this, how
much do you think fatigue played a factor into the final ten minutes, being
that you guys have played an extra game as compared to Penn State who had a
bye?  
COACH LAW: I would say personally I think a couple miscues on defense. I would
say some of it was fatigue. A lot of it had been frustration. Then going to
your bench and everybody got to be ready.  
So I just think that, you know, some of my kids -- that's why I was calling a
time-out. I was trying to use my time-out wisely. You call one and then, no,
we're going to go to media.  
There was a couple times Penn State start capitalizing. I had to burn one
because I knew we were just not communicating and not as sharp as we were
before. So I think it played a little part in it.  
MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

### [Tayler Hill](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20551)

_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Ohio State  72  
Michigan State - 57

  
MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Jantel, did you put a little something extra in your cereal this
morning?  
JANTEL LAVENDER: No. I just think my teammates saw me in good position and I
just took my time and made my shot. It was just an inside joke with my team.
They was making fun of me.  
  
Q. What did they say?  
JANTEL LAVENDER: They watched the after-game film of me, and I said took my
time. I was kind of distracted by the crowd a little bit. I said that like --
they said 250 times, and I just said it again. So I just kind of thought of
it.  
  
Q. Tayler, in a game like that, against a very good team, how much does it
mean to have something like Jantel -- someone like Jantel inside that you know
if you get the ball to her in the right position she's going to do something
with it?  
TAYLER HILL: I don't think it's just this game; I think it's every game. I've
been blessed to play with an All-American player, one of the best players in
the world in women's college basketball. So having her presence down there
takes so much off everybody else. She's just a big presence in the game
offensively and defensively.  
She's a great player. It's not just against good teams, it's against medium
teams or weak teams or however you want to classify it.  
  
Q. When they got to within a tie there late in the game you guys pulled away
with a big run, and it seemed like you guys were having a lot fun. Has that
been the biggest factor here down the stretch for you guys, is just having fun
playing again?  
JANTEL LAVENDER: I definitely think that's a part of it, along with defense,
of course. But this game, we tried to take that approach, just really just be
within the game, have fun with it, play great defense and execute on offense.  
  
Q. Jantel, your battle with Lykendra Johnson seemed like it was very
physical and even personal at times. The game in general looked very physical.
Did it did feel that way on the court?  
JANTEL LAVENDER: Most definitely. That's why we had to really emphasize
reversing the ball so I could get across the floor and get a deeper position
on the block, because she was being so physical, they were fronting that one
time. And, I don't know, it was just patience. And they got me the ball in
great position, so it worked out.  
  
Q. Jantel, Michigan State's lost five times this year now, three of them
have been to you. Do you think that's more of your team getting up for this
game, or are you guys just a bad match-up for them?  
JANTEL LAVENDER: I think the times that we've played Michigan State our team
has really understand who we are as a team and really played hard and, you
know, took the roles that we were supposed to play in that game really
personal, so it's just basically that once we started playing Michigan State,
it was kind of towards the end of the season when we were peaking as a team.  
So I don't think it's necessarily we get up for them, it's just that our team
has kind of turned the corner from where we were in the beginning of the
season.  
  
Q. Jantel, piggybacking off that, we've seen you come here, what, three
years, four years in a row, and you've dominated and you've played great and
-- but could you speak to maybe how this has been different all the way
around. And even though tonight might have seemed like an old Jantel, carry
the team effort, it's been more about this team playing together this time
around?  
JANTEL LAVENDER: Most definitely. It's definitely different because we're
coming in here with a 5 seed and we're used to having a 1 seed. And I look at
it as we're still playing three games in three days. And when we plan teams at
this time, I think that everybody is playing pretty well. And that's the way
we approached it. It's not any other -- it's not any different situation,
except for that the number by our team is No. 5, and I think we're playing
like the No. 1 seed right now.  
So as long as we came here to play and play as a team and play extremely hard
and try to win this thing, it doesn't really matter what our seed was. And I
think that our team really wants to win it, so we're playing like it.  
  
Q. Tayler, could you speak to the atmosphere of this game? The Michigan
State crowd was loud; your crowd was very loud. What was it like I guess
playing in this game?  
TAYLER HILL: I think whenever we played Michigan State there's always an
atmosphere like that, so it was nothing new. I expected their fans to be loud
and I knew our fans are always supportive and very loud. So, I mean, it's just
an atmosphere that we're comfortable in. Every time we play them, it's always
a nice sized crowd.  
  
Q. Tayler, you guys played Penn State in January and lost. You played Penn
State in February and won. There was a huge turnaround at some point around
February 1st. What do you expect to see from Penn State tomorrow?  
TAYLER HILL: I expect them to play hard. We beat them the last time, so I
expect them to play with a lot of energy, a lost intensity. But they're not
going to dictate the game. It's on us how we come out. The first time they
beat us, it was because we didn't play any defense. It wasn't nothing special
they did. It's just we decided to start playing defense.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about your composure when Michigan State came back
and made their run, tied it up? Can you talk about your team's focus --  
COACH FOSTER: Focus a little off track, but we quickly got it back. In
tournament play, the games are officiated differently. What was a foul last
night wasn't a foul tonight. You have to adjust, you have to figure it out and
get out there and really get after it.  
And I just think defensively we're a much, much improved team and we're a
much, much tougher team than we're given credit for.  
  
Q. Jantel, in a game like this when the shots are falling the way they're
falling, just how much do you want the ball? Do you want it every time?  
JANTEL LAVENDER: I want it when I'm open. I want it off the screen and roll
off the plays the way the play is supposed to go. It's not like I'm running
down, though.  
It was just slowing tonight. So whether I screen and rolled or I got position
early and sprinted the floor, got the deep position under the basket early, it
didn't matter. I think we executed in every form tonight.  
  
Q. Jantel, you know that tied a career high for you? Did you know that?
37.  
JANTEL LAVENDER: No, I didn't.  
  
Q. Usually players don't know. You tell them, oh, you know this stat? No, I
didn't know that. Could you speak to how you have good memories coming here
and how your team obviously seems to enjoy -- your coach doesn't like playing
tournament ball so much, but your team seemed to thrive here in the last
couple years.  
JANTEL LAVENDER: I think the atmosphere is fun. It's fun to play the three
games in three days. I think it shows toughness and I think our team is tough
and we're starting to really play together and know that we are a great team,
and I think this tournament is a good thing to have on our resumé to show that
we have toughness going into the NCAA Tournament.  
And I don't know. It was just fun for me; I'm sure it's fun for everyone else.
And I just like playing at Conseco Fieldhouse, so it's fun.  
  
Q. Tayler, speaking of toughness, I think free throws do a lot to kind of
show that. You had seven, Jantel had seven, overall you guys shot 26 free
throws. In a physical game like this, how much of an impact do you think it is
to be able to get to the line that efficiently and convert so often?  
TAYLER HILL: Well, Coach Foster always says one way of showing toughness is
getting to the free-throw line and knocking free throws down. So I think we're
gonna get some of the calls and I think we just kept attacking and we made the
ref blow the whistle the way we were attacking and the way Jantel was perking
up. So I think it's tough that we stepped to the line and knocked our free
throws down and kept attacking. I mean, we missed four free throws.  
MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. Questions for Coach Foster.  
  
Q. Coach, could you speak to how this team may be different in terms of not
maybe just relying on her all the time even though today it looked like it?
Does this team play more together?  
COACH FOSTER: She had 11 points last night.  
  
Q. I know. Do you think this team plays more together than maybe teams --  
COACH FOSTER: I think it plays to whatever our strengths are and what the
other team is trying to take away from us. When they take something away,
they're giving you something. Last night they were giving us Brittany, trying
to take away our approach game. Tonight they were spacing out and playing our
post player one-on-one. Some teams double-team.  
I mean, there's -- and we're smart enough, patient enough to find the hole in
what it is you're trying to do.  
  
Q. They came out on fire, 10-2 type of thing, and then you knew they were
going to make a run in the second half. How did you like the way your kids
responded to their emotions in the beginning of the game and their emotions
--  
COACH FOSTER: I think good teams aren't peak and valley. I think good teams
don't get real high and don't get real low. And I think that's what we've
become. So, you know, other teams, they might come and bring the energy right
away and it doesn't affect us. The way we've been playing, we just sort of
methodically go about our business and know if we execute and we do what we're
supposed to do you need to bring more than emotion to play against us right
now.  
  
Q. Coach, normally it's really hard to win a game when you get outrebounded.
You guys were outrebounded by 11 but still managed to win by double figures.
Can you talk about some of the areas that were really important in making that
up?  
COACH FOSTER: Well, the quality of the second shot, if the other team is going
to outrebound you and get putbacks, that can certainly have a negative impact
on your defensive possession, because it's 50 percent possession. They miss
the first shot, made the second.  
And then there are other teams that rebound sort of in a volley. They may get
three or four, but if it's not being finished, then that's an 0-fer. And
unless they're putting it back in the basket, that is not going to be to your
disadvantage.  
So the numbers, sometimes there's a tendency for them to look dramatic like
that's a pretty dramatic number, 25. But 32 percent is not a dramatic number.
If they're putting that second shot in on a regular basis, then you're in big
trouble.  
  
Q. Coach, you've talked before about how it was about getting them to share
the ball and play better defense and work on team things to get this team
going the way it is now. But in your own words maybe, what's the simple
summation of how you got them to buy into all that after all the steps you
guys went through earlier in the year?  
COACH FOSTER: I've said this before. The players, especially today's players,
they play so many games, they don't maybe have a value that they should for
games, for this AAU culture, you play a hundred games in the summer. So you've
got to get that to be more -- and they don't go through these situations, they
hadn't gone through it, so it's almost a learning experience.  
I've been doing this for 33 years. I've gone through this and my response to
it is: Stay the course. Keep coaching, keep teaching. Make them accountable,
hold them accountable, get themselves to hold each other accountable. And then
you start to grow.  
And that's the only way you dig out of a hole. But that's the only way you dig
out of a relationship that's gone in trouble. It's the only way you dig out of
a problem at work. The only way you dig out of -- you work through it.  
When you have especially these highly recruited athletes, they're not used to
this, they haven't experienced it. They don't know how to act. You have to
teach them. You have to show them.  
  
Q. I was going to ask you something else, but these kids value these games
now, don't they? Your kids are valuing these games.  
COACH FOSTER: Well, they better. Yeah, but we were sitting (indiscernible) and
6 in the lake. If we didn't start to value something really quickly, we'd be
hosting -- sitting in the first two rows watching an NCAA Tournament. I know
that was motivation for me. And we've figured it out.  
  
Q. Coach, a couple keys on beating Penn State tomorrow. What do you think
they are?  
COACH FOSTER: Find Lucas. Bentley is absolutely terrific in the open floor.
They've got a nice post game. The senior plays like a senior. They're a good
team. They're a good team. We haven't seen a bad team in a while. And won't
the rest of the year.  
MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach, and congratulations.

_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Penn State  73  
Purdue - 61

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Purdue, Coach Versyp along with Courtney Moses
and Brittany Rayburn.  
Opening statement, Coach.  
COACH VERSYP: We knew, obviously, Penn State's playing great basketball.
They're a very aggressive team that can score the ball pretty quickly. They
did a great job in transition offense where we did a poor job, and then we
fouled them a little bit too much today. And they knocked down their free
throws. So congratulations to them and for the entire tournament. Hope things
go well.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Brittany, you had that seven-point lead late in the first half; they
closed within one. How much did that throw you guys off rhythm a little bit?  
BRITTANY RAYBURN: We just didn't take care of the ball. We had three turnovers
such that it really changed the momentum for them. And they were knocking down
shots and we were making turnovers and it really changed the game.  
  
Q. Courtney, did you feel at all like open looks were harder to come by
against them? It seemed like they tried to pick it up defensively a little bit
more maybe than the first couple of meetings.  
COURTNEY MOSES: Yeah, they were definitely hungry for this game. And they got
after it on D. But I feel like we did a better job of breaking the press and
getting down, just took a while to get into our offense once we got into the
half court.  
But once we would slow down and execute, we were getting the shots we needed.  
  
Q. Brittany, second half, when you guys did score, come up with a big play,
they seemed to match you. Or they seemed to match that on the offensive end.
Just getting some defensive stops there, was that an issue eventually as you
look back on this game?  
BRITTANY RAYBURN: Most definitely. I think we got into a scoring battle with
them in the second half. We stayed the same distance for a while. But for us
we just need to get a couple of big stops and continue to score and that would
have changed things.  
  
Q. Brittany, did you guys feel all right from a fatigue point of view? This
was your second game I think in basically less than 24 hours.  
BRITTANY RAYBURN: Yeah, I think so. I mean, we have a deep bench. We played
plenty of people. And I think that we should have had the advantage being, you
know, playing already and this being their first game.  
  
Q. Courtney, you guys have a long break between games, and does this loss in
any way take away the momentum you guys have accumulated the last two weeks or
so?  
COURTNEY MOSES: You know, I really don't think so. We just have to regroup,
refocus. Take care of our bodies. And just looking forward to what's next.  
  
Q. Coach, obviously playing IU yesterday, not just being a game, being a
rivalry game like that, does that have any impact on how you came out today,
maybe being a little tired in that second half?  
COACH VERSYP: No. I think if you have to play two teams that you've beaten
twice, it's just tough, bottom line. And we're in great shape. We have a deep
bench. And they played well.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Brittany and Courtney.  
Questions for Coach Versyp.  
  
Q. Their defense a little tighter than maybe it has been in previous
meetings? And you guys seemed to be running the shot clock down under 8, 7, to
get only one look at the basket. How much did that factor into what you were
doing?  
COACH VERSYP: They played us all man to man. They haven't normally done that.
And we knew that they would do that. So we were prepared for that.  
But usually they're a zone team. And they do a 50/50. But they played man to
man. We were prepared for that. But they did. I mean, it's obviously when
you're hungry and teams beat you twice, you know, you're going to get out and
play some great defense.  
And they doubled a little bit down low. So they made some adjustments. And I
thought we were fighting there for a while, then we couldn't get stops. And I
thought that was a big key.  
  
Q. Talk about how this impacts your NCAA Tournament hopes at this point.  
COACH VERSYP: I wouldn't know.  
  
Q. The end of the first half, I think you had two opportunities maybe to get
it to 8, couple of missed free throws and Chelsea missed a layup there, and
they got some momentum. Do you feel like it could have been different had you
maintained a six- to eight-point lead instead of their littler run there in
the final 60 seconds?  
COACH VERSYP: Definitely. You talk about when you're ahead by seven or eight,
we still have to understand that's when you want to move the ball around, you
want to stay real poised, use some time, use the shot clock, if you have free
throws, make your free throws, and when you have wide-open layups, you've got
to make those.  
And sometimes just missing one shot can bring things down or three calls in a
row totally changed the momentum. So it doesn't really matter the
circumstance. But that was huge. I mean, we really needed to keep that.  
  
Q. Do you feel like you still have some momentum from these last two weeks
the way you played?  
COACH VERSYP: Definitely. That's what we talked about in there. It's sad
because we're finally playing the basketball that we should have been playing
in the end of January.  
And so we just want to keep coaching and playing with these kids, because the
last three, four weeks has been a lot of fun, and where they're capable and
being healthy.  
And so I really feel like we have the momentum, and now we just have to, like
Courtney said, take care of our bodies and still practice, day off, practice,
day off, get that rhythm. We've done it before, three years prior to, except
last year, so feel real good about it.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 4, 2011

  

### [Jolette Law](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18032)

### [Amber Moore](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21787)

### [Karisma Penn](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21788)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Illinois  55  
Michigan - 47

  
THE MODERATOR: All right. We're joined by Illinois, Coach Law along with Amber
Moore and Karisma Penn.  
Coach, would you give us an opening statement to start.  
COACH LAW: I think my kids played hard. Very focused the first half. And I
think once we got in the locker room I think we thought the game was over. But
I gotta give a lot of credit to them down the stretch. When Michigan came and
made their run, we stopped their run.  
And like I told them, it's going to come down to every possession. Every
possession counts. I know Michigan is a great team, and they wasn't going to
let up. Even though they were down 20-plus points, they were going to come out
and fight to the bitter end. And they did.  
But I gotta give my young team a lot of credit. We didn't fold. We got stops
when we needed to and we took care of the basketball down the stretch.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.  
Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Either of the girls, can you talk about how a team can lose 12 in a row
and come around and come up with a couple of big upsets come tournament
time?  
KARISMA PENN: We just really believe in ourselves. Even though we lost 12
games, we were never doubting ourselves. A lot of the games were close. We
lost them at the last second, and we knew eventually it would break through,
and it's happening for us now.  
AMBER MOORE: Yeah, even with the 12 in a row, we still work hard in practice
and we get better each day. So we're not hanging our heads. We're keeping,
sticking together and just believing in each other.  
  
Q. Amber, you didn't make any 3-pointers last night, and then you got really
out in the first. How do you explain that?  
AMBER MOORE: As far as shooting, I just had to find my confidence back. I
wasn't shooting the ball very well. But during our little shoot-around, just
getting the rhythm back.  
  
Q. Amber, I know you said in the past this is a team that really starts with
defense. That leads to offense. But seems like in the first half you guys
started well on offense and then that kind of led to the defense in the second
half. Could you talk about that a little bit?  
AMBER MOORE: These past few games we came out really strong executing, just
executing on offense. And when our defense is up, our offense gets a lot
better as well.  
  
Q. Can you talk about how important the start was for you guys coming out of
the gate strong really?  
COACH LAW: It was extremely important. You just have confidence, I knew what
we were looking for, I knew Michigan was going to come out and probably be
aggressive. And it was good to see that my kids, they stuck to the game plan.
We set the screens. We moved the ball extremely well and we got open looks.
And we played together. We played total team ball. We shared the basketball.
And then that opened up -- when the outside shooting was good, it opened to
one-on-one coverage with Karisma. And that's why Karisma had a little bit
more. She didn't have to face double teams tonight as much.  
  
Q. Karisma, you haven't trailed at all yet in this tournament. What's
working for you guys?  
KARISMA PENN: Like I said, I think our confidence is just up right now.
Everybody believes in themselves and we believe in this team. We come out of
the game and we just -- we try to attack the other team first. Before the
game, we're really lighthearted. We just -- we believe in ourselves right now.  
  
Q. Amber, three years ago this program was the No. 9 seed, got all the way
to the championship game. I'm sure aware of that. Did you watch any of that on
TV? Did you see it on TV back in high school when you were watching?  
AMBER MOORE: I saw it. It was a heartbreaker. I know it was, coming down to
the last seconds. And we try to get back to that, sticking together as a team
and just trying to fight as a team.  
  
Q. (Off Microphone)?  
AMBER MOORE: Not really.  
  
Q. Question for both you. Amber, seemed like you carried the load in the
first half, and, Karisma, seemed like you really stepped up in the second half
when your team needed to put the game away. Can you talk a little bit about
like what having two players like you does for your team or just if you kind
of felt like you needed to step up, really get that done?  
AMBER MOORE: I just think our team has developed a lot of patience on offense.
We're starting to figure out what we're looking for in our offenses, and just
being a patient offense. So I think that helps a lot when we're rotating the
ball or swinging the ball, we get it in and out, is what's helping right now.  
KARISMA PENN: I agree with Amber. If Amber is on in the first half, they'll
have to get up on her. So it will open up things more in the second half. And
I think that's what happened today.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. So you've not talked about '08 with them and will you talk about '08 with
them?  
COACH LAW: I did briefly on Monday, when we went and had breakfast. I try not
to put too much pressure on them. Just told them that right now the road that
we traveled that year that we came in '08, we lost a lot of close games.  
At that time I had more seniors and more leadership and only had one freshman,
so I sort of tweaked it a little bit and told them now I have no seniors, all
freshmen and sophomores.  
So I told them right now these games we lost, a lot of people are looking at
our record. Like Karisma mentioned we lost ten games, ten seconds or less, and
it came down to 1.5. It came down to two seconds. It came down to three
seconds. And each and every game I try to be positive with my kids and try to
show them if we just carve out this, if we focus on this a little more,
eventually we'll be able to put up a complete 40-minute game together.  
And I think they started seeing, and I kept them light. We kept teaching,
moving, moving forward, and now they're reaping the benefits because now
they're starting to see it and starting to believe it.  
  
Q. I think you guys are the first No. 11 seed to make it to the semifinals
of the Big Ten tournament. Do you feel like you're playing with house money a
little bit now, nothing left to lose?  
A. Hey, like I told them, we were at the bottom, and right now that's
something that I have to deal with. Like I said, I released the record a long
time for them. I'm not happy or pleased; we were the losing record. I don't
read the paper, but I know it was probably the worst season ever in a regular
season. I'll live with that. I can live with that when I know my team's
getting better and they're getting stronger and I have all of them coming
back.  
I think right now, I told them this is season three. You have nothing to lose,
everything to gain. Everybody else is playing something, what are we playing
for? We have to play for our respect. We've got to play for our pride. And we
have to leave it all out on the floor. Sense of urgency.  
If we can do it in chapter 3, play a 40-minute game each and every game for
160 minutes, we can be that Cinderella story to sneak into the NCAA. So that's
what I challenged them with, and they're responding.  
  
Q. You guys brought that up. I was actually about to ask that: See how
confident you guys are that you can do this? You're two wins away, first game
will be against a Penn State team that looked decent today against Purdue but
they definitely showed some form too. How confident are you guys that you can
pull this off?  
COACH LAW: I have the utmost respect for Penn State. They're young as well,
well coached, Coquese, and they're playing I think from the bottom of the pack
to the No. 2 seed. But tomorrow we don't see a team. We don't see Penn State.
We just right now have to focus on what the final line I have to do. And we
have to compete. We have to be the best team tomorrow, the best team on that
day. And we have to come and be focused and do all the little things, and,
hey, we're just going for it.  
  
Q. After playing last night and playing today, in the second half when
Michigan's coming back, were you sensing maybe your kids were loosening their
legs a little bit?  
COACH LAW: I would probably put it on we were trying to play not to lose.
We've never been in this situation. So I get it. I understand, and I know on
the sideline I had to bring some calmness to them because we've never been up
20 on a great team and down the stretch.  
So I was teaching them in every time-out situation score, and possessions, and
I think we were trying not to make a mistake. First half we were playing loose
and the ball was going. Being so young we've never been there before, I just
knew that as a leader I had to make sure I calmed them down because they
didn't know what to expect.  
So I think we played very timid, very hesitant, and therefore the turnovers
were coming and we were unsure. We worked against the 2-3 zone a lot and it
looked like we had never seen the zone before. But that came with not wanting
to lose, not wanting to make a mistake. I'll charge that more to that, then,
the legs. Because they were in the huddle talking to me like I'm sorry, I'm
sorry, I'm sorry. I just had to give them a sense of calmness.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Centrese McGee being out and how that changed how you
played today and for the rest of the tournament maybe if she's going to be
out?  
COACH LAW: It caught us off guard because in the locker room she'll be fine.
She took some medicine, had an allergic reaction. We thought we'd play it safe
with her.  
But it did. I'm looking down the bench and I'm like, okay, I don't have -- I
only have like seven or eight. It did put a little pressure on us.  
But that's what I talked to my team about. Those who wait also serve. You
never know when the bell's going to be called. Eboni Mitchell didn't play at
all yesterday. And today she played some huge minutes down the stretch for us,
and she stepped in for us. Alexis Burke didn't play at all yesterday, but she
came in and she in the first half played some key minutes.  
Sometimes you don't know when your bell is called. I just challenged my whole
team to be ready. It's unfortunate that Tee Tee couldn't play, but we held on
for victory despite her not being there for the second half.  
  
Q. They shot a lot of 3s, especially in the first half. Was that fine with
you? Is that kind of what you wanted to do defensively on the perimeter?  
COACH LAW: I know they were known for shooting 3s, their offense is based on
dribble penetrating, making you collapse and kicking the ball out for 3s. But
I think my guards, in the past we weren't keeping the ball in front. I think
we did a better job with that. I think we forced them out a little bit. Most
of the 3s were deep 3s versus standing there shooting the normal 3.  
When they start missing, we're just going to contest, make sure we get out on
this, contest and box out. So I know the second half I just told my team, I
think in the second half we start relaxing and not playing as well and they
got loose on two 3s in the second half that brought the game a little closer.
But we knew that they were going to come in and shoot a lot of 3s, and we
pretty much played them that way.  
  
Q. Just a question, Macie Blinn didn't play a whole lot, struggled from the
floor. How much are you expecting and how much do you need out of her if
you're going to kind of make the run that you and your team want to make?  
COACH LAW: I mean, Macie's key for us. And the last time we played Michigan
and in the game footage, Macie was unsung hero in that game. She was there in
the last couple of minutes. Today she was the first person I called off the
bench, and definitely we need Macie to come in, be confident and play. We're
going to need her.  
Like I said, don't look at each kid like Eboni Mitchell, she didn't play
yesterday. But as a Florida game I'm going to need everybody here, and I think
Macie's been the biggest supporter, Coach, whatever you need me to do. I had
her playing the 4 at one point, and nobody knew that. She has the best IQ in
whatever I need her to do. She ran the 4 until Lana Rukavina came back in.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

### [Suzy Merchant](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17249)

_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Michigan State  56  
Northwestern - 25

  
MODERATOR: Coach, we'll allow you to have an opening comment first and then
open it up to questions for the players.  
COACH MERCHANT: Well, it just felt good to play again. It feels like we
haven't played in a while. I know it was last Sunday, but we've had
opportunity to prep ourselves a little bit. But it did feel good to get out
there and start competing again and have somebody we're trying to go against.  
I was proud of our team defensively. Today I thought we were very, very solid.
I thought Jaeschke got away from us when we played them at our place, and I
thought everybody did a great job, because there was more than one person on
her defending her tonight. And I really was proud of our team's defensive
effort.  
  
Q. Cetera, could you speak to the team's defense?  
CETERA WASHINGTON: It's just been the main focus for us throughout the entire
year. And the last time we played them, we really didn't work as hard as far
as fronting Jaeschke and just really thought we keyed in on that, and it
really helped us tonight and we able to get our back side help there in case
they did throw it there. I thought we had great ball pressure on the perimeter
also that was huge for us for them not getting the ball inside.  
  
Q. Lykendra, can you talk a little bit about the job that you and Kalisha
did with Amy Jaeschke and what kind of things you were trying to do to force
her out of her rhythm?  
LYKENDRA JOHNSON: Pretty much. Fronting her, and I'm giving full credit to Kal
because I barely got her the whole game. So Kal did a good job of fronting her
and just not touching the ball, and without her touching the ball, no
freshman's offense is off, so kudos to Cal for her defensive presence today.  
  
Q. Kind of expanding on that, talked about the defense. In the second half
you held Northwestern to a little under 15 percent shooting. Is there anything
you can talk about getting on that kind of defensive roll?  
CETERA WASHINGTON: Well, it was a really sluggish game throughout the entire
game and we knew that coming in the second half we needed to make a statement
defensively, and I think we really did that. And we ended the first half on a
good note defensively, and we wanted to come out with that same focus, and I
think we did that.  
  
Q. Lykendra, when you're playing in a game like this, can you see the
frustration on the opponents' faces, because, I mean, they start air balling
the shots, can you sense that you're getting to them defensively?  
LYKENDRA JOHNSON: Yeah, all around them. If it's a good defensive presence, we
can tell when their shots are falling short. Or when they even stop rebounding
on the offensive end, we can tell. But we use it to our advantage and just
play basketball.  
  
Q. Cetera, can you talk a little bit about the sluggish start off
offensively? What was off for you guys at that point and what did Northwestern
do to you in the first half?  
CETERA WASHINGTON: I know at halftime we sat there and talked about how we
weren't sharp at all, we weren't setting screens. And the person setting the
screens was -- we had a few illegal screens, and it's just like the person
using those screens needs to use it, and the person setting it just needs to
stand there.  
We just weren't sharp at all. We weren't setting screens or using them, and
they played it really tight on Kal, so that pretty much opened up a lot of
things for everyone else. And I think we took advantage of that.  
MODERATOR: Questions for the coach.  
  
Q. Suzy, I know a lot is going to be said about the defense, but can you
talk about what the game plan was coming in offensively and can you talk a
little bit about how you guys attacked the basket, especially in the second
half?  
COACH MERCHANT: You have to give a lot of credit to Porsche. She's done that
back-to-back games for us. She is a kid that can punch a gap and make a
decision about being a scorer or kicking it to shooters. And I just think she
gives us a little different handle at the PG spot, and I played her there a
little more lately, just because I do think she is more of a scorer's
mentality.  
So coming into the game we knew they were going to change defenses. We knew
they were box-and-one, they could pressure going back to their zone. Their MO
is always on misses they're in man, on makes they're usually in some kind of
pressure back to that two, three zone basically. And then -- or if they
weren't in their pressure on makes, they would be in a box-and-one, and we saw
that.  
So we felt like we had an opportunity to really take a look at that where
maybe we could be better. I think we were a little -- what's the word? Just a
little bit tight really, you know. It's just exciting and we haven't played in
a while. And Northwestern had been in the facility and played and won a game,
and it was our first time here. And I think sometimes you get a little bit of
that nervousness going.  
And but once we got settled in, I felt good about halftime. I felt our defense
was speaking to us. And whenever that happens, we usually have good things
come our way.  
  
Q. In the second half you guys went on a 19-0 run to really seal the game.
Can you talk about what you think happened momentum-wise?  
COACH MERCHANT: They had to work really hard to get looks at Jaeschke. I mean,
we're not built like everybody else in the middle, and so we just always talk
about trying to use our speed and quickness versus someone's power. And it's
worked for us. And we have things that we try to do to make sure that, you
know, their strength -- and I think with Jaeschke, they played yesterday,
obviously, and, you know, you're looking at back-to-back games, and I thought
if we made her work throughout a 30-second shot clock, I think that would
really bother them because they rely so much on her getting just touches.
Whether she scores it or not, she creates a problem because people have to
double her and she's a pretty talented kid.  
So I appreciate what Kendra said. I think that's a depiction of our team. Kal
really stepped up and she kept her feet moving and she might give up six
inches, but, you know, that speed and quickness kind of never let her pin and
seal, and that was a big deal for us tonight.  
  
Q. Coach, the 56 points might not look like all that much, but you had three
players scoring double figures, two more scored eight. All-around balanced
offensive effort. With that and how the defense was playing, how tough does
that make you to play moving forward and how confident would you say this team
is to go forward in this tournament?  
COACH MERCHANT: Well, I certainly think we should have a lot of confidence.
Obviously we're coming off a year where we've kind of earned the right to
build that confidence along the way, and then certainly I feel like we're
playing good basketball at the defensive end.  
Any time you can do that, I think you have opportunities to win games. You
look at three of our four losses and they were last possession losses, could
have gone either way. We lost at Iowa -- I shouldn't say that. Two of our
four. Half of our losses were last possession opportunities that we -- you
know, could have gone our way. But they didn't, and so we learned from that.  
And I do think the one thing this team -- the gift it has is it seems like it
has been different people, and more than one, you know. I felt like at
Minnesota we had a lot of good things happen, but Porsche Poole was kind of
the MVP of that game.  
I thought we've had Annalise step up at times. We've had certainly Kal and LJ.
Brittany has been a scorer for us in the past. Cetera has had great minutes
for us.  
And I think we all really band together and try to look at the match-ups and
put them in positions to be successful. You put drivers where they belong and
shooters where they belong, and usually you can get a good opportunity.  
  
Q. How does this rank with the defensive efforts you've had in the four
years here and how does the effort the kids had tonight compare with what you
want from them?  
COACH MERCHANT: I thought we were sharp. I was disappointed the first half,
there were two or three things they did that we went over specifically that I
about lost it on because there's just no reason for that. Like those are
things that we do and we do them for a reason, and that was like a three- or
four-day prep that included the opportunity to go through it today at shoot-
around, and you want to be the best you can be going into March. And you never
know. That one play can ignite an entire game.  
So for us, you can't really accept opportunities that we know what their
trying to do and we let them do it, or we don't communicate it and a kid
that's supposed to switch didn't switch.  
And that's just the name of the game is trying to execute at a high level. But
I did like for the most part, you know, I mean, if you looked at 60
possessions, you know, probably 55 of them, you know, were pretty good.  
MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach Merchant, and congratulations.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

### [Beth Marshall](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21793)

_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Michigan State  56  
Northwestern - 25

  
COACH MCKEOWN: I'm going to the first event so they can get changed and I'd be
happy to answer anything after that.  
MODERATOR: Questions for the student athletes? Please make sure that you state
their name first before asking the question.  
  
Q. Amy, can you sort of describe the frustration level you went through
throughout the game today?  
AMY JAESCHKE: Yeah, I give a lot of credit to Michigan State. They played some
great defense, you know, really rattled us, especially me. They did a great
job fronting me and not letting me get comfortable at all during the game. So
definitely made a frustrating game for me at least.  
  
Q. Amy, is there something that they did differently? I mean, as Coach
Merchant said, she kind of felt you had your way with them last time in East
Lansing. What did you see differently out of them as far as looks?  
AMY JAESCHKE: Yeah, was before I was able post up on a body when we played
them at their place, and tonight they were -- they didn't let me post up on
them at all and just kept fighting around and at the last second would release
any contact and get in the passing lane. So it's really hard for me to even
get the ball inside.  
  
Q. Beth, Amy mentioned being comfortable. It just seems like this game you
guys were never able to get into an offensive flow. How were you able to
rattle you?  
BETH MCKEOWN: Michigan State is very aggressive on defense, and we knew that
coming into the game so we tried to prepare beforehand because we knew they
would switch everything, and we just didn't execute our game plan the way we
should have, and instead of answering their aggressiveness, we kind of backed
down.  
  
Q. Beth, in the first half you guys did a pretty good job of containing
Michigan with only 22 points in the first half. Not bad. What do you think
changed for them offensively or for you guys defensively between the halves?  
BETH MCKEOWN: Well, we just went away from what was working for us. We stopped
contesting shots as well as we did in the first half. And to Michigan State's
credit, they shot really well and they attacked us. So I think we went away
from what was working in the first half.  
  
Q. Last night you guys turned it over 21 times -- I guess this is for Beth
-- and you were still able to win, and tonight 23 turnovers and a loss and
they scored 21 points off turnovers. How important was holding onto the ball
to tonight's game?  
BETH MCKEOWN: Well, tonight our key was to regain more rebounding and taking
care of the ball, and we knew if we could do both of those things we'd come
out with a victory. And as you said, we didn't take care of the ball the way
we should have so it's going to result in a transition point which they feed
off of.  
MODERATOR: Any other questions for the student athletes?  
  
Q. Beth, just one more question. When you guys are hitting your shots from
the outside, you guys are a very effective team. Tonight 0-16 from behind the
arc what. Do you think was going on with the outside shooting and how does it
affect your team when you guys aren't able to establish a threat from the
outside?  
BETH MCKEOWN: I think that our team tries to play inside out, and we just
really couldn't get a flow either way. I'm confident in all of my teammates'
shooting, and sometimes you just have bad nights, and I know our next game
we'll probably come out on fire, so try not to focus on that and just know
that we'll hit the next shot.  
MODERATOR: Thanks, Beth and Amy. And, coach, did you want to have an opening
statement and then have questions?  
COACH MCKEOWN: No, I'm fine.  
MODERATOR: We'll just open it up for questions. First question, please.  
  
Q. Coach, it seems like you were just kind of looking at the stat sheet that
last little bit and just shook your head. I was just wondering what stands out
to you the most in the stat sheet.  
COACH MCKEOWN: The fact that we scored 11 points in the second half. You know,
just -- it's just disappointing, it's just -- that's the best way to describe
it. We played with a lot of heart all year, missed a lot of easy shots some of
that was Michigan State. That was us but, you know, score 25 points in a
tournament game in the second round or, you know, or the second night, that
shouldn't happen.  
  
Q. When they got on that 19-0 run, how hard was that to break that momentum
that they had built up?  
COACH MCKEOWN: You have to score. When you can't score -- we defended Michigan
State, I thought, pretty well, especially in the first half, and I feel we
defended them pretty well at the game in East Lansing, you know. But we scored
-- you know, the best way to stop runs is to score, and we couldn't do that.  
  
Q. How did you see Amy's third and then fourth foul kind of impact the flow
of the game for you guys and sort of the way that things evolved from that
point?  
COACH MCKEOWN: Well, I don't -- you know, I don't have a film so I can't -- I
really don't know. I just have to go with what they said. I don't know. You
know, Michigan State is a very physical team defensively and, you know, I
haven't seen -- I haven't seen a monitor play or whatever.  
  
Q. I was wondering if you could talk after tonight, what do you think makes
Michigan State such an effective defensive team? What do they do right?  
COACH MCKEOWN: Well, I think the one thing when they're playing well
defensively, when they are able to switch and not get hurt in match-ups, they
do a really good job. I think that's probably what they do better than anybody
in our league. And they have a lot of players that are interchangeable.  
In the game at Michigan State we took advantage of that a little bit and
spread the floor, made shots. We had a lot of chances. You know, I think it
was a tied game with four or five minutes to go, three minutes, I don't
remember. But we played well and we were able to take advantage of some of
those switches. Tonight they stayed in front of us, did a much better job and,
again, we -- you know, they play the winner of, whatever, this game, so it
will be interesting to see tomorrow. But when they switched, if you don't take
advantage of it, then they keep you in front and they're really physical, you
know, they make up for some of their lack of size, so to speak. Shot blockers.  
  
Q. I know a coach never wants to talk about fatigue playing a role, but do
you think there was any difference with Michigan State not having played in
like a week or so and you guys had to play a grueling game last night?  
COACH MCKEOWN: That's a good question. That's a good question. I didn't feel
that way today. I thought we had a good day. I thought we were ready coming
in. I didn't feel like -- and sometimes when you get to play the night before
it gives you a little momentum. You know, you get to shoot. Obviously shooting
here last night didn't help us shoot tonight. I don't know, maybe -- maybe the
wind got in or, you know, Reggie Miller ghost popped up or something. I don't
know. But we shot the ball horrifically, as you said.  
MODERATOR: Any other questions? Thanks, Coach.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 4, 2011

  

### [Jim Foster](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16894)

### [Brittany Johnson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19285)

### [Jantel Lavender](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18055)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Ohio State  71  
Iowa - 61

  
MODERATOR: We can go directly to the player questions. Questions?  
  
Q. Brittany, is this one of the best games you've had, one, and, two, can
you just run me through those last three 3s you had in the game?  
BRITTANY JOHNSON: Yeah, this is one of the best that we've had. We played
together. We played hard. We didn't let up. And we just wanted to win really
bad, so we did whatever it took.  
And I was just, you know, in the zone, I guess. I was focusing really hard. My
teammates had confidence in me. Jantel threw me the ball after the rebound.
She had confidence, and then Taylor and Sam threw me the ball. So I was just
focusing on my shot.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about your defensive approach to shutting down the
Ohio offense a little bit?  
COACH FOSTER: Well, we're just going to be very, very aggressive on the
perimeter, switch, stayed down, not go for ball fakes. And I thought Jantel
was a good match-up for Alexander, just only took me four years to figure that
out.  
  
Q. Jantel, you were up 52-40 and you were really kind of excited, and all of
a sudden they're going on -- they went on a nine-, ten-point run. How were you
able to basically withstand that and would you have been able to do that maybe
a month ago?  
JANTEL LAVENDER: I think we just had to stop getting them at the foul line.
Once they were getting to the foul line, the clock stopped. So we just had to
play good solid defense.  
And Iowa was very capable of getting those shots. They have great perimeter
shooters in Jaime Printy and just basically all their guards. So we weren't
really closing down well and letting them get a full head of steam driving to
the basket. So we just tried to stop them from going to the foul line and
getting stops and just really focusing on executing our offense.  
  
Q. This one is for Brittany. It really seemed like every time Iowa came
down, hit a 3, you came right back, answered with one. And it was in the heat
of the game. If you weren't in the zone, quote/unquote, would that be a shot
that you'd feel comfortable taking? Or did you just feel like you needed to
step up for your team?  
BRITTANY JOHNSON: I think that's a comfortable shot for me, but I just wanted
to step up, help my teammates out, and that's what I did.  
  
Q. Jantel, to that point, Printy hit like a 50-foot 3, and she came right
back and hit one, and then Kelly Krei hits one and she comes back and hits
another one. How much did that mean to everybody on your side?  
JANTEL LAVENDER: We have the utmost confidence in her shot. And it just kind
of went that way. It wasn't like a plan like, you know, they hit a 3, we're
going to hit them back with a 3. It was like the play opened up that way. And
I either got a rebound, passed it to Brittany, or we reversed the ball and hit
her in the corner. But she did a great job focusing tonight, and that's what
we needed to win.  
  
Q. Brittany, did you call bank on that one from the corner, or did that just
happen?  
BRITTANY JOHNSON: It just happened. I was shocked myself.  
  
Q. Jantel, this was a game where one team was going to the free throw line a
lot. Was that frustrating for you guys and how did you manage? If it was, how
did you manage to play through that?  
JANTEL LAVENDER: It definitely was frustrating, because I thought it was very,
very physical, and especially in the post, just when we're getting rebounds,
just post defense. And we could just touch them, and they were going to the
line.  
It was frustrating, but I think we showed poise and we showed activeness by
playing through that, because we really didn't get calls. I mean, only got to
the line ten times this game. It was kind of frustrating.  
  
Q. Jantel, did you feel like Brittany and Sammy and Tayler did a pretty good
job locking them up on the perimeter? It seemed like everybody was really
pushing them out far.  
JANTEL LAVENDER: Yeah, definitely. I think that we pretty much eliminated the
3s that they shot and beat us with at their place. That's what they like to
do. And I think that once we sprinted back and got in the lane and met them
down there before they could shoot the 3, they started to try to penetrate,
and we were kind of playing them for the 3, so we had to adjust to their
penetration after we realized they weren't really getting the 3s off.  
  
Q. Jantel, I don't recall you ever guarding somebody like Kachine Alexander
before, and basically were you surprised they asked you? And then how did you
handle it once?  
JANTEL LAVENDER: I'm up for the challenge. I think that Star Allen did a
really good job two years ago when we were in the tournament against her, and
I kind of watched a little bit of film on her and what she did.  
And I just wanted to do whatever I had to do tonight for my team, and it was
just close down, make sure she doesn't, you know, kill us on the rebounding,
and just play solid defense. And I think I did a good job.  
MODERATOR: Any other questions for the student-athletes? Thank you, ladies,
and congratulations.  
Now open it up for questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Again, they're coming at you really hard. I know the way the games play
out that those things happen, the runs happen in a game. But just what enabled
you to hold on this time and just to answer it and keep it going the other
direction?  
COACH FOSTER: Execution. We took care of the ball. We thought we were a little
careless with the ball forcing too much in the first half. In the second half
I think we had six turnovers and just much better ball movement, six
turnovers, 44 points, that's a good ratio.  
In the first half I thought we stood still and forced; second half I thought
we moved and took care of our business.  
  
Q. Coach, it seemed in the second half with about ten minutes left you were
on the verge of landing a knockout blow, then they come back, hit a 3, just
like that it's a five-point game. What, if anything, did you let your players
know to kind of calm them down a little bit?  
COACH FOSTER: I think they pretty much calmed themselves down. We had a
freshman make a freshman mistake, and she won't make it again. That's how you
-- you learn from things that you do. And she'll be smarter with it the next
time for sure.  
  
Q. Going back to the foul situation, how do you think your kids handle it?
Because, again, the one team was going a lot and you guys hadn't gone --  
COACH FOSTER: I pretty much felt that this was like a road game. I always
think on the road you've got to make field goals. I always think the home team
is going to go to the foul line. And I just felt, you know, we had to make
field goals. We had to make field goals. Because we weren't getting to the
foul line. And what we did, we shot the ball well.  
  
Q. Brittany, again, as a senior, and as a fine 3-point shooter, but how much
has she grown this year in terms of taking that kind of shot without
hesitating?  
COACH FOSTER: Well, heck with the shot, how about the shot block, how about a
full-court layup off a steal. I mean, that's growth. She's always been a great
shooter. I shouldn't say that. She's developed herself into being a great
shooter. A lot of hard work. A lot of hard work. And has a better
understanding of footwork, et cetera. But I thought that the defensive part of
Brittany tonight was every bit as exciting as the 3-point shots.  
  
Q. Coach, you play Michigan State tomorrow, they absolutely demolished
Northwestern today. What does your team need to do to make sure that something
like that doesn't happen and that you can win that game?  
COACH FOSTER: Guard them. And make shots. Ball movement. But we've got to
guard them.  
  
Q. Has there been a time earlier this year where 40 minutes of especially
perimeter defense you might not have seen like that out of your team?  
COACH FOSTER: No, I've seen it.  
  
Q. For 40 minutes?  
COACH FOSTER: Yeah. Yeah. I think our perimeter defense has gotten -- I think
at the Penn State game I thought our perimeter defense was absolutely
terrific. I thought against Purdue at the Nationwide -- I thought our
perimeter defense was absolutely terrific.  
So, yeah, I've seen it. I've seen it coming. I've seen it getting -- I've seen
it -- it's a long way from Oklahoma.  
MODERATOR: Further questions for the coach? Thanks so much, Coach Foster.
Congratulations.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 4, 2011

  

### [Kevin Borseth](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18022)

### [Veronica Hicks](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21789)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Illinois  55  
Michigan - 47

  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athlete, please.  
  
Q. Veronica, can you explain what happened out there today, you guys
struggling offensively?  
VERONICA HICKS: We were getting some good looks, and the people we wanted to
shoot were shooting it and they weren't falling for us. I mean, that's how it
was. Start of the game we got ourselves into a hole. They were making shots
and we weren't.  
  
Q. Is there any chance you overlooked Illinois just playing them a couple of
days ago, maybe looking ahead too much? Is there any chance you overlooked
them?  
VERONICA HICKS: No, I think we knew the pressure that was on this game. And I
felt like this would be the hardest game myself. In this conference to win and
beat somebody three times in a row it's really difficult. Everybody scouts.
They know what to do.  
  
Q. You guys have several times this season come back from behind. What do
you think you weren't able to do to spark that comeback tonight?  
VERONICA HICKS: We sparked a little bit of a comeback. I don't know if we've
ever come back from 20 behind. And that's a large hole to climb yourself out
of. And that's a lot of momentum that has to swing into our direction,
basically the whole second half you've got to put points up. You gotta score.  
  
Q. Did your game plan, your approach change at any point in time? If you
realized maybe the 3s weren't falling for you, you had to go about it a
different way?  
VERONICA HICKS: Yeah, I mean as a senior, I just tried to do whatever I could.
My game plan was just to win, whatever could help the team win, and it would
help if I could have knocked down some shots. But that didn't happen.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Was there anything -- what was the difference between this time you
played them and last Sunday?  
COACH BORSETH: Oh, I think five travels and that post. It just automatically
took Sheffer out of it immediately. Immediately. She just traveled, travel,
travel, tipped it.  
To answer your question about was there anything we tried to do besides shoot
the ball from outside, we tried to go inside. We did. Travel. Travel. Travel.
And that really had an effect on Rachel around the basket.  
We tried Sam in there. Sam had a couple, missed a couple. But shots we did
have we didn't make on the outside.  
  
Q. To end the first half, Illinois went on a 20-4 run. What were you not
able to do offensively to get in there or defensively to stop them?  
COACH BORSETH: Anytime you're not doing well on the offensive end of the
court, the other team's offense does really well. The more you struggle
offensively the better the other team's offense works. That's just how it
works. That was what in my opinion that's what it came down to.  
I told our kids that. You aren't going to get everything back in one shot. So
you needed to work it and try to get as good a shot as you possibly could,
score every time down the court.  
But we had 18 turnovers, and that is a bunch. For us that's a bunch. Sorry.
15. That's a bunch.  
  
Q. Last game for Illinois it was McGee and McCully and this game it was Penn
and Moore. How difficult was it to guard them with so many different players
that could score for them?  
COACH BORSETH: Penn's hard to guard for everybody. She's just very efficient,
very strong, very good around that basket. That's the kid that's really -- and
Moore hits the 3-point shots, obviously. I don't think she scored in the
second half. I don't think she made a basket. Kate did a pretty good job on
her.  
  
Q. What are you telling your team right now? You don't know what's in store
for the tournament, what's in store for postseason stuff like that. How do you
keep your team level headed, I guess?  
COACH BORSETH: What do you want me to say? I don't know how to answer that.
What do you want me to tell them? Do we have a chance to play in the
postseason? We do. What are our chances are? Good. For every play? I don't
know.  
Right now it's getting through this day. The locker room was somber. Our kids
were disappointed with the outcome of the game. Obviously Illinois had
something to do with that. But it's getting through the day, and tomorrow the
sun's going to shine and we're going to pick up the pieces and get an
opportunity to play somewhere down the road and forget about today.  
  
Q. Can you go more in depth how Moore was able to do in the first and the
second?  
COACH BORSETH: No. I don't know how to go in depth. When Thompson got it in
the second half, she's bigger, so she puts a hand on it. In the first half we
didn't have the big hand in her face. There were two of them she hit offensive
rebounds, balls that were rolling around that we didn't grab that were kicked
out to her that she made.  
We did a pretty good job once that ball wasn't rolling around and we did a
pretty good job when Kate got on her. That's about what I remember. But I
don't know how accurate that is. Haven't seen the videotape. It's pretty hard
to tell. But that's what I recall.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 4, 2011

  

### [Lisa Bluder](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16868)

### [Jaime Printy](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20526)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Ohio State  71  
Iowa - 61

  
MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening comment from the coach and we will
follow that up with questions for the players.  
COACH BLUDER: I just want to congratulate Jim and the Ohio State team on the
victory today. I think they're playing like they are the best team in the Big
Ten right now. And it's unfortunate we were paired up against them in the very
first round, but that's what we were dealt, that's what we had, and they were
the better team tonight.  
They defended very, very well. We didn't shoot the ball as well as we're
capable of, but give credit to Ohio State's defense as well. I thought Jaime
had a nice game and did some really good things when we were down to bring a
lot of emotion back into our team when we desperately needed it. So, again,
we're looking forward to post-season play.  
MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach. And now we'll open it up for questions for Jaime.
And you won't have to say her name as she's the only play here. Just ask the
question.  
  
Q. Jaime, how tough was their size on your team? I mean, three guards
against two centers. They had a pretty big edge there?  
JAIME PRINTY: It was definitely tough. I mean, they have two centers and
they're both really good, and they're really good at defense. So, I mean, it
kind of hurt us when we got in the paint and there wasn't really anywhere to
go with it. I mean, they're a great defensive team, though.  
  
Q. Jaime, what made it so hard, then, to -- were they tough to beat up the
dribble as well?  
JAIME PRINTY: Yeah. I mean, they're an athletic team and they have some quick
guards. But, I mean, some parts of the game our offense just wasn't clicking
and they're a good defensive team, so when that happens we struggle.  
  
Q. Could you talk about the match-up between you and Prahalis a little bit?
She was guarding you last time you guys played at Ohio State, she was guarding
you tonight, and just your thoughts on I guess the strategy for trying to
contain you.  
JAIME PRINTY: Sammy is a great player, I mean, offensively and defensively,
and, I mean, last game they denied me a little harder than this game, but I
think we did pretty good playing as a team just giving each other open shots.  
  
Q. Jaime, what's going through your head, down 12 in the second half and
then come back with a surge at 3? What's going through your mind there?  
JAIME PRINTY: It was fun. I mean, games like that, close games are always fun,
and when you go on runs it's fun. But they went on runs and we went on runs
and, I mean, we just came out a little short.  
  
Q. You called them a great defensive team. I don't think very many people
would have called them that after the way you guys beat them at your place. Do
you see them being different defensively than they have been at other points
in the season?  
JAIME PRINTY: I think they picked up their denial a little better and I think
we shot the ball poorly, like coach said, and I think that has a big thing to
do with it as well.  
  
Q. When you had that 11-0 run after it was 52-40, I think 9 of the points
were free throws. Was a point of the emphasize, since a lot of shots weren't
falling, to try and get to the line?  
JAIME PRINTY: Yeah, definitely. I mean, when shots aren't falling that's a big
key is to get to the free throw line and try to get your rhythm back. So we
tried to do that.  
MODERATOR: Any more questions for Jaime?  
Thanks so much for joining us. Hard-fought game. We'll open it up now,
questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Just the beginning of your thoughts. You might have said something
completely different, but was the size one of the key differences in the
game?  
COACH BLUDER: I think it was. I think, you know, you get by your first
defender and they've got a 6'5" kidding waiting there between them and the
basket. It prevented us from getting easy shots tonight. We shot the same from
3-point range as we did 2-point range. We didn't get the easy to-the-rim
baskets that we have gotten in tradition. So I think that did hurt us just
because they had that post player that would hang back and play in there.  
  
Q. Could you talk about when you decided, I guess, change up your offensive
strategy a little bit more and try to attack the basket, get free throws,
things like that?  
COACH BLUDER: I don't remember us changing our offensive strategy, quite
honestly. We stayed with the same tragedy most of the game just trying to run
our offense and get 3s and get to the rim.  
  
Q. Were you guys, because of the size or whatever, were you settling for 3s
a little bit too much in the first half?  
COACH BLUDER: No, you know, I think we took good 3s. You know, I don't think
we were settling for 3s. I feel like we're good at that penetrate and pitch
and hit the 3, so I think that's actually a strength for us, but it wasn't
tonight.  
  
Q. Coach, I know in the short term, but what's the response from here? Where
do you go?  
COACH BLUDER: Where do we go from here? We have two weeks of practice and get
ready for the NCAA tournament. That's what our goal is is just to work hard.
We'll be able to have some time to really work and get ready for that.  
  
Q. They had Jantel on Kachine. Could you just talk about that match-up a
little bit and how you guys coped with that?  
COACH BLUDER: Yeah. I thought Jantel did a great job on Kachine. You know, I
thought she stopped the drive very, very well because Kachine is good at that.
She's good at taking the ball to the hole, but she really took Kachine out of
that, being able to get to the basket. So Jantel impressed me with her
versatility and her ability to defend a very good driver.  
You know, she played off and used her size a little bit, and that was a good
strategy. But I think Jantel did a really nice job defensively.  
  
Q. You weren't really playing for an NCAA berth. I mean, I don't think
anybody thinks that. But your teams really took this hard. Why do you think
they are so down versus even an ordinary loss?  
COACH BLUDER: Because I think we thought about it for a year. You know, it was
the championship last year and, you know, just not being able to come out of
here with a tournament title. I mean, that was a goal for us, and so that's
unfortunate.  
But I think, again, it was just like, you know, it was Ohio State, it was the
Big Ten tournament like it was last year, and a lot of thought went into that
over the past year.  
  
Q. Brittany Johnson was obviously a focus from your game in Columbus. She
nailed a ton of 3s there. You tried to tweak some things defensively, but
she's still able to go 7-14 from the 3-point line. Talk about that.  
COACH BLUDER: She's a good player. When you bank in a 3 from the sideline, you
know life is going pretty well for you at the time.  
She is a very, very good set shooter, and you have got to know where she is
all the time. And she got open for some open 3s. She had some really good open
looks, and Ohio State does such a great job of finding her. But, you know, we
let her, you know, get away from us a couple too many times in the zone. And,
unfortunately, you know, she was able to put them down.  
But she is a really, really good 3-point shooter.  
  
Q. Ohio State has those -- their four starting guards I think -- or three
starting guards are all sort of offensive-minded players coming into college.
It's been a long struggle to kind of get an effort out them defensively, and
your team is one that has taken advantage of them in the past. Do you feel
like they are a different look kind of defensively from Prahalis and Johnson
and Hill?  
COACH BLUDER: I think they're playing better defensively, absolutely. I just
think they seem like they're playing more team defense, they're more --
they'll help more. I think their on-ball pressure is a lot better. But they're
just willing to help each other out, I think, and play a little bit better
team defense than they were the first time that we played them.  
MODERATOR: Thanks so much, Coach.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 4, 2011

  

### [Alex Bentley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20493)

### [Julia Trogele](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20494)

### [Coquese Washington](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18021)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Penn State - 73  
Purdue - 61

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Penn State. Coach Washington, please start with
an opening statement.  
COACH WASHINGTON: I'll just take questions.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with questions for the student-athletes first.  
  
Q. Alex, that run there at the end of the first half in the last minute, I
think you cut it from six or seven to one. Just how important did you think
that was maybe headed into the second half?  
ALEX BENTLEY: That was really important, because Purdue, both times we played
them, they got a bit of a run on us. So I just looked up at the scoreboard and
said that couldn't happen again going into the half.  
  
Q. Julia, can you talk about your mindset when you went into halftime and
you made the second half with 12 points?  
JULIA TROGELE: Mindset, we were down one. But I don't think we kind of saw it
as us being down. I think that at the end of the half we really came together
and pushed it again. I think we were down seven with like a couple -- like a
minute left or something like that, and we closed the lead.  
And I think that for us going in we knew that we were playing our game. We
knew they might be more tired than us because they had played the day before,
so we came out and pushed the ball even more.  
  
Q. Alex, anything special beating a team close to home?  
ALEX BENTLEY: Definitely. I hadn't beat them other than at Penn State. It's
sweet. It's sweeter than beating them in the regular season. I think not
beating them in the regular season it was supposed to happen because we're
here now.  
  
Q. Julia, just talk about your on-ball pressure today, and do you feel like
maybe that forced them into some bad shots, especially with the shot clock
running down?  
JULIA TROGELE: Definitely. I mean, preparing for this game today we said that
what we pretty much needed to do was make them take contested shots. I think
we did a good job with that. We had good help rotation. And it showed.  
They missed a couple of shots, and we came down. We got the rebound. We came
down and were able to run transition which led to our offensive game, is what
we like to do. We like to run.  
  
Q. Julia, there's a sequence there in the second half where two or three of
you hit 3s, and it seemed like you got away from them a little bit. Did you
feel it right there like, okay, we've got a little momentum here, maybe this
is it right here?  
JULIA TROGELE: I mean, this is kind of what's dangerous about us, I think, is
that a lot of people can hit 3s on our team. I think that they came down and
hit a 3 and we came right back and hit the 3 as well.  
So just making sure that we stay on the attack. And that really hurts, you
know, when you have a couple of 3s like that. That's nine points in a row from
the 3-point line. It's a dagger.  
So I think it definitely hurt them in the end.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. The second after the game ends, your point guard Alex comes over and you
said something to her. You pointed at her as if you wanted to make a point or
something. And I'm just dying to know if it's something you could share with
us.  
COACH WASHINGTON: You know what, Alex Bentley is a kid that gives me a lot of
heartburn and a lot of gray hairs, but I wouldn't trade her for anything in
the world.  
And one of the things that I know from her growth as a point guard is
understanding context. And so anytime I have an opportunity to do that for her
and make a point for the next time we're in that situation, then I'm going to
do that.  
And at the end of the game that's one of the things I was talking to her about
is not being emotional, but -- not being overly emotional during the game so
that you can't focus and execute.  
And I could have said that five hours from now. But it won't have the impact
and the immediacy that telling her right after the game does. So I just want
her to continue to grow. I think she's a fantastic talent. I think she has the
ability to be one of the best point guards in the country, and I'm just going
to work tirelessly to get her there.  
If that means having a conversation right before she has to go to media and
before she can enjoy this win, then we'll do that.  
  
Q. How happy are you today, Coach, with the defensive effort?  
COACH WASHINGTON: I'm thrilled with the defensive effort. The media has talked
all season long about our offense and our offensive capabilities. But believe
it or not, the coaching staff, we've talked to our team all along, that if
we're going to be successful at the end of the season, we've got to be better
defensively, because there's going to be nights where the ball doesn't fall.  
We're not clicking on all cylinders offensively, so we have to be able to get
stops. And I think for us, the last time we played Purdue, even though we
didn't win the game, I think maybe it was a light bulb moment for our team,
especially closing out the first half and the second half of the game, that we
can impact the game from the defensive end first.  
I felt like that carried over into the Northwestern game. It certainly carried
over into tonight's defensive effort and our defensive intensity.  
  
Q. We know that there's a cliche about beating a team three times and all
that. But I'm wondering if you can speak to the psychology or maybe
philosophically about you just played them, you just lost to them, you know
them, there's something else other than just playing better that goes into
when you play them again, isn't there?  
COACH WASHINGTON: You know what I think, I think being that we just played
them last week, that loss still was fresh in our minds and it was still fresh
in our mouths, especially the kids'. They didn't like the way that we played.
Felt like we could have played better.  
So I think it definitely was much easier for us to get them mentally ready to
go out and execute today, because the game was so fresh.  
  
Q. What was Julia able to do in the second half that she wasn't able to do
in the first half?  
COACH WASHINGTON: She was just aggressive and attacked. And I thought she did
a fairly good job of taking her spots. And she got a chance the first half to
kind of see the game, see what her openings would be, and then in the second
half she was a lot more aggressive and assertive in picking her spots to
impact the game.  
And, again, we felt like if we could keep it close the first half, then the
second half, hopefully, having that bye would kick in and give us the
advantage.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 3, 2011

  

### [Drey Mingo](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21768)

### [Brittany Rayburn](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19283)

### [Sharon Versyp](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16880)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Purdue  66  
Indiana - 62

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll begin with an opening statement from Coach Versyp, and
we'll follow that with questions from the student-athletes and do the question
and answer segment.  
COACH VERSYP: Everybody knows that it's survive and advance or you do go home,
and we know playing our arch rival Indiana, with them having four seniors,
they obviously didn't want their season to end, and it's always tough to beat
a team three times. But I thought at the very end our defense is what
prevailed. We were able to hit some key shots down low by Drey and free throws
by Brittany to obviously clinch the win.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Brittany, did you feel a sense of urgency down the stretch when the lead
was kind of big for there, 13?  
BRITTANY RAYBURN: Most definitely. I think we all knew that we were not
playing Purdue basketball. We weren't playing very good defense. They were
scoring it well and we weren't scoring. That's what built the lead. I think we
knew we had to step it up or we were going home early.  
  
Q. During that stretch you're down 8 and then got it to 1, that steal and
then the layup you made where you just kind of fought for the ball. Does that
define maybe the last ten minutes of the game for you guys?  
BRITTANY RAYBURN: Most definitely. Like I said, we had to step it up on
defense. They kept running the same play. And I just decided you're not going
to keep running it.  
It's a matter of fighting for the ball. We can't let the ball fly out of
bounds. If I would have let it go, it could have been out on me, could have
been out on her. Can't let the ref make the decision. As long as I kept
fighting for it, it stayed in bounds.  
  
Q. Drey, that play that Brittany made, in a game where you were not getting
the loose balls, just for that play, maybe, was that kind of a spark for you
guys a little bit?  
DREY MINGO: Definitely. Whenever someone gets a 50/50 ball like that, that's a
really good energy spark for our team.  
  
Q. Brittany, obviously you know Indiana did not want to get the ball in your
hands at the end of the game to shoot free throws, but, sure enough, you were
able to get free off the inbounds. Talk to me about what you did to get the
ball in your hands in that situation?  
BRITTANY RAYBURN: Coach set up a play where we had a double screen for me to
go get the ball, and our screeners did an amazing job. They switched off on
the first screen, and so Alex nailed the second person that switched off, and
they switched off again, and it was just a matter of getting open. They did an
awesome job of getting me open.  
  
Q. Brittany, you had a chance to seal the Penn State game a week ago with
free throws and missed. You turned out to win that game, but was that going
through your mind a little bit before you shot these ones?  
BRITTANY RAYBURN: Yes. I believe I turned to turn Coach and said, That's not
going to happen again. This game I knew it was going in. Coach got me the
break with the time-out, and that was really helpful. And I just couldn't do
that again.  
  
Q. Drey, I know the nerves, we're not supposed to ask the players about
nerves because when you're out there playing you don't think, but is there any
point in the second half where you look up and you go this is getting a little
curious, getting a little scary?  
DREY MINGO: No, I have complete confidence and faith in my teammates. I could
see it in their eyes. They wanted it just as bad as I did. So, no, never
nervous.  
  
Q. Both of you, just your thoughts of facing Penn State again. I know that
was a meaningful, important road win last time. But you've beaten them twice
now this year, and I'm sure they know you just as well as you know them.  
DREY MINGO: Definitely playing Penn State again for a third time, just gotta
come out and play Purdue basketball.  
BRITTANY RAYBURN: Yeah, it's hard to beat a good team three times, but it's
doable. And I think just us playing them soon is really good for us because
you turn around so quick. We had them scouted already. We're very aware of
what they have and what they can do. And I think that's going to be helpful
for us.  
  
Q. Drey, was it a little unusual to play on the first day of the tournament,
first time you guys have ever done it here?  
DREY MINGO: No. Not really. I mean, we play, we play. Every time we step on
the floor we have to play Purdue basketball. Doesn't matter what time or what
day.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach Versyp.  
  
Q. Sharon, the steal that Brittany made there mid court, was that kind of
the toughness you wanted to see out of your team in the second half? Because
they were beating you up on the boards pretty bad. But did that play kind of
give you the toughness that you needed to finish down the stretch?  
COACH VERSYP: Yeah, if you would have asked what would be the key play to the
game, that was it. Because it was that extra getting after a ball, getting
that hustle playing and being able to score a layup, and that definitely is
what pretty much turned the tide.  
  
Q. Having faced Jori Davis for four years, can you put it into some
perspective what kind of player she's been down in Bloomington? You've had
some great seniors come through your place, and she's done the same thing in
Bloomington.  
COACH VERSYP: Jori is a great basketball player. She'll be able to play
obviously overseas, and, you know, playing in the professional ranks. But
she's a top scorer in the Big Ten. She's very tough to defend because she's so
physical. She can shoot the three. Comes off screens well. She's had an
amazing career at Indiana. And you always have to put two or three people on
her.  
  
Q. Over the years, Coach, knowing maybe you're a little ticked off and I
kept waiting to be something in the second half, but you seemed to keep your
cool with them most times. Were you just stressing better defense, better
defense, and not overreacting and panicking? Because the score, the margin got
pretty wide.  
COACH VERSYP: You weren't in my huddle.  
  
Q. No, I wasn't.  
COACH VERSYP: Oh, I had my moments, there's no question. But, no, on the
sideline, you know, I'm their leader. I gotta be calm, cool, collected, be
confident because they turn and look at me. If I'm feeling sorry for myself or
complaining and doing all that, we're not going to be successful.  
And that's what they've seen all year. I'm steady, they're steady. We're very
confident. And we knew that we were going to pull this game out at the end.
We've been in these games. And we knew that we were going to be successful at
the end.  
  
Q. It seems like every time all the time-outs toward the end of the stretch
there it was a mini battle going on, who wanted it more. Talk to me about what
the difference was down the stretch, especially in those last two minutes,
that ultimately saw your team become victorious.  
COACH VERSYP: Well, we've continued to talk about that nothing that we have
gone through this year in a game should faze us because of what we went
through with Drey.  
And we talk about you don't fear anything. We feared death and now there's
nothing to fear. And that when we step on that court we are one, and that we
can get through anything and handle that toughness.  
So that's why we believe that we were going to be successful. They looked at
each other. Great character. Great strength and great mental toughness is
what's been able to get us through at Penn State and obviously to win the game
today.  
  
Q. I guess the same type of question I had for Drey. Does it change at all
playing on the first day, or is that kind of a non-factor?  
COACH VERSYP: It's a non-factor. You want to win a Big Ten championship so you
have to play obviously one of those extra games. But it's survive in advance.
It doesn't matter what day you play. I think that's the biggest thing.  
And like we talked about before, just bodes well of -- four teams could have
been 10 and 6, they were 10 and 6, and you never know what's going to happen
and we have a tough conference.  
  
Q. Did you feel like you had to win this game in order to become an NCAA
Tournament eligible?  
COACH VERSYP: I'm sure it helped. You know, everybody asked me that question.
You know, I think our win at Penn State, that was kind of the statement game
because they're a top 30 RPI. We've beaten two or three teams in the top 30,
so that really helped us.  
You know, we have not had a bad loss. And I know IU's RPI was like 155, so
absolutely this helped us springboard to get into the tournament.  
But I'm not an expert at it. Mike Carmin is, so ask him.  
  
Q. How concerned did you get in the second half? And with the deficit where
it was, those were the moments where you expect maybe a leader like Brittany
to step up and take the reins?  
COACH VERSYP: I expected Drey and Brittany. Those two have been playing great
basketball. I told Brittany these are your time to shine. You played the most
as a Purdue Boilermaker on this court. And she's capable of really damaging
another team.  
And I thought Drey's first half was amazing and the second half they double-
and triple-teamed her, and we were able to get Brittany the ball a little
more.  
I think collectively Brittany did it by action. Drey was doing it verbally,
which we missed for a while, and now the last three weeks she's been that -- I
guess that spirit and that character and she's getting in people's faces.  
And I think both of them together really forged -- it was a team effort -- but
those two really helped us.  
  
Q. You were even on rebounds at the half. But I think they outrebounded to
start the second half like something crazy, 17 to 2 or something. Did you feel
down the stretch you were able to step back up again on the glass a little bit
and sort of helped you get back in the game?  
COACH VERSYP: Definitely. That was a big key. We were double-teaming Jori
Davis off of screens. So obviously when you're shifting your defense, you're
not always in the correct position. And, yes, our rebounding was not very
stellar today.  
But getting to the foul line was. And then at the end playing defense we
secured the rebounds at the end where we really needed them. And it's not
always -- it's always the timely rebound, and we were fortunate with that.  
  
Q. Getting back to Jori Davis, what sorts of things do you feel like you
have to do to keep her under control?  
COACH VERSYP: Well, it's very difficult when she comes off screens, if you're
not double-teaming her, she has a very quick first step. She can take you
again to the hole. She can post you up. She can shoot the 3. She can shoot
behind the 3.  
You just have to disrupt her and put a lot of different bodies on her. So Dee
Dee had different length on her, Chantel is built a little bit different, we
just tried to rotate people, and then our post players are trying to get out
and disrupt her turning the corner.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 3, 2011

  

### [Jolette Law](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18032)

### [Lydia McCully](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21771)

### [Centrese McGee](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21772)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Illinois  63  
Wisconsin - 56

  
THE MODERATOR: Let's start with an opening statement.  
COACH LAW: I'm proud of my kids. They played extremely well tonight. They were
focused and my point guard. Lydia McCully ran the show and played a sound
game. And my freshmen didn't play like freshmen. It was a total game effort.  
I'm so proud of them and I love Conseco Fieldhouse. I love this place.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the players.  
  
Q. Lydia, you guys started off the game on a 10-0 run. How important was
that for you guys to start off knowing that you came in with a 12-game losing
streak?  
LYDIA MCCULLY: Coach always preaches first five minutes. It definitely was the
first five minutes for us that got us started and got us energized. When you
come out like that, there's no way to go out but strong.  
  
Q. Lydia, could you talk about how good this feels. It's been a while since
you guys have had this feeling?  
LYDIA MCCULLY: It feels so good. This is something we talked about, even when
we were losing. It's not over until it's over, and right now it's not over,
and so we're going to play through it.  
  
Q. Lydia, your first possession, you're just saying let's go, let's go. What
was the mentality starting out?  
LYDIA MCCULLY: Like I said before, the first five minutes. So I know my team
has been asking a lot of me and me to step it up, because I really haven't
been. So I definitely wanted to give them as much energy as I could.  
  
Q. Centrese, is it as simple as you guys playing with more a sense of
urgency that Coach talked about? Is it that simple? Or was there something
else going on today do you think?  
CENTRESE MCGEE: I think we just wanted to win, and we just had to put in the
energy to get it.  
  
Q. Centrese, can you talk about what was working for you? Took a heck of a
time to have your first double-double. What was Wisconsin doing to allow you
to score and get so many rebounds?  
CENTRESE MCGEE: I'm really good at back cutting. I was trying to find an open
spot, and I'm usually good at rebounding. So I just stuck to my strength.  
  
Q. Lydia, offensively, you didn't get a lot from KP, but you got something
from everybody. Did you guys feel like everybody had to contribute offensively
to get it done?  
LYDIA MCCULLY: Everybody always has to contribute. And I think -- and I said
it before -- we pretty much know everyone wasn't stepping it up. And Karisma
does a great job. She she's very consistent, and because of that she helped
open it up for everyone else today.  
  
Q. Centrese, after the game seemed like you were limping off the court a
little bit. Was anything going on?  
CENTRESE MCGEE: I have a minor tweak in my ankle, but I'm fine.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. You haven't lost a game in your time here at Illinois in the first round
of Big Ten tournament. Coming into the game, was there already a sense of
confidence for you and the team?  
COACH LAW: I'm always confident in every game we play, if it's Assembly Hall
or wherever. I just think when I came in here, it's really definitely after
Monday and my talk with my kids and just seeing where they were and explaining
to them what March means and what March Madness is all about and just getting
the response that I got from them in practice.  
It's been that way, but it was a little more. They've just been energized and
excited all about it. Half of my team don't really know what March Madness is
all about or even the Big Ten Tournament. It's all about because we're so
young.  
It was definitely, you know, good to see them, how they respond, how focused
they were the last couple of days. And definitely when I walk in this place,
you know, it's a special feeling.  
  
Q. There have been a lot of games down the stretch where it didn't go your
way this year. What was the difference today? Why did you get it done down the
stretch today?  
COACH LAW: I just think we play with a sense -- I was preaching with a sense
of urgency, five-minute increments. First five, make sure we control the
boards, make sure we do all the little things. And I just think tonight we
were focused on the little things. I know I put it on the game plan, but I
think collectively tonight we all paid attention to our goals, what we wanted
to do. We knew that Zastrow was going to come in and have a good came. We knew
Karel was going to have a good game.  
But I was more concerned about Lana taking care of the basketball, boxing out,
executing, not just looking at Karisma, everyone stepping up and being
confident to take those shots. And I think we did that tonight.  
And I think when most teams bring on the run, we just look for somebody to
post together. And I think Lydia McCully did a great job of pulling everybody
together and keeping everyone calm.  
  
Q. What you got today from Te-te, was that the role you envision her being
able to do, like consistently?  
COACH LAW: Definitely. She was saying that she stuck with her strengths. I was
going to add, yeah, we worked on layups and finishing with her, I'm banking,
I'm hitting her, you keep your eye on the rim, because it's focus. She was
getting to the rim all season long, but it seemed like a ball, and I watched
film and I watched film with her and I start telling her this is what the
problem is, this is how you have to finish. You're getting to the basket but
you're not full extension. You're not having a full extension.  
We worked on just miking drill and doing finishes, and tonight she looked at
me smiled, and I was like, yeah, because naturally she goes to the boards
extremely well. Like I said, she cuts back door. She has a knack for getting
to the basket and timing and cutting and reading defenses, and most freshmen
don't have that.  
But bottom line all season long all during the Big Ten, she wasn't finishing,
and tonight she finished. She goes to the offensive rebound, and in practice,
no one likes Te-te because she's constantly moving, always getting to the
boards. Even our practice guys have a tough time trying to keep up with her.  
So she played these things. What can you do and what can you do well. And she
came in, like she said, she can cut to the basket, rebound with the best of
them, and she did that tonight.  
  
Q. Going into the half, you guys have a 12-point lead. It's been a while
since you guys have gone into the locker room with a lead like that. What was
said going into the second half?  
COACH LAW: It's a while back. It's like ladies, normally we're playing catch
up, but right now, in my mind, we're going to play like we're down. I had to
talk to them like we were down, time situation, score, don't let up, play with
a sense of urgency, don't get comfortable because last time we went up we
played Wisconsin we were up in the second half, we sort of just got relaxed.  
So I just changed their mindsets and told them right now we're down, we're
down 12 and we've got to take care of the ball. We have to play defense. We
have to execute and we gotta take care of the ball. So they responded.  
  
Q. What was the reference to pancakes and bacon? I heard something about
something that happened this morning.  
COACH LAW: I'll tell everyone. I was having some health issues back in
December. I can't eat bacon anymore. I'm on a low sodium diet. And Mayor
Murphy got wind of that every time for breakfast I love bacon. I love bacon.
And it's been killing me for the last two months that I can't really eat it.  
So she was like you might go do some bacon. So that's the inside joke. They
got wind of it.  
  
Q. After the game, you maybe jokingly talked about fitting that suit in for
tomorrow. Any truth to that?  
COACH LAW: I might take this to the dry cleaners. It's the same that suit we
won, and I'm pumping my fist and looking up to God, and my kids was like you
didn't wear it. What are you going to wear, Coach? You're wearing something
new. I went into my closet, like I remember this suit way back. This is going
to be the first suit that I wore. And it's interesting that it's in the book.
It's the same suit.  
But I'm trying to be a little superstitious. And if you see this suit
tomorrow, yeah, you might see it tomorrow.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Illinois  63  
Wisconsin - 56

  
THE MODERATOR: Opening statement.  
COACH STONE: It's a somber locker room. Very disappointed in our play today.
Give Illinois a lot of credit. They came out and were on fire right away. Made
pretty much all their shots in the first ten possessions. We couldn't get a
stop. And we didn't establish a real good offensive goal in the first half.  
Our team responded well in the second half. Got in a little foul trouble, but
I thought Lin really started to take care of the paint inside and Alyssa
really started to show up. So these two young ladies really did pretty much
everything they could in the second half to get us back in the game, and
within three. Couple costly turnovers here and there.  
But, again, every time we got close enough, Illinois answered. But it's tough
right now. It's a tough loss. This is a team that was optimistic about making
a deep run in this tournament and given a chance at the bigger dance in a
couple of weeks.  
It's an awfully special senior class and I'm convinced we're not quite done
playing yet. But it's hard to visualize much than what just happened in the
game.  
It's a tough loss. We were not as sharp as we need to be by any stretch of the
imagination.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the players.  
  
Q. Alyssa and Lin, obviously a loss is never anything pleasant. What does
this particular game mean to you as you move into your futures?  
ALYSSA KAREL: I think we just weren't ready to come out and play. Came out,
they got a big lead on us, and we didn't respond. So it might have something
to say about our preparation and our mentality coming into the game. We gotta
be ready.  
LIN ZASTROW: You never want to end your season like this, but like Coach Stone
said in the locker room this doesn't define the season. It didn't go the way
we wanted. But hopefully we still have some more games to play and finish out
strong there.  
  
Q. Alyssa, how tough is it when you're in the hole to, I guess, stay
positive and get back in the game?  
ALYSSA KAREL: It's really tough. We've done it before this year where we've
gotten ourselves in a hole. And we keep inching back. And it's really tough to
get yourself out of that. You start the second half down 12. It's not easy.
And we had a few tries and unfortunately couldn't come up with it.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Can you talk about what worked for you tonight and what didn't?  
COACH STONE: Not a lot worked in the first half. Offensively or defensively.
Let's just talk strictly defensively in the first half. Illinois is known to
be a team off the bounce and in the inside and a lot of drives. And they came
out and we start, we double-teamed early. And they found the open person.
Moore, Rukavina, and they found some shooters, and they knocked shots down,
and that's been something they've not been real successful with in the past
but they were this time.  
We came out of the double and we went to -- we call it choking in the down
dribble, and that seemed to work better in terms of keeping the ball out of
the paint.  
But they got some offensive rebound put-backs. We lost our vision defensively
and Centrese McGee cut in front of us on the front side a number of times. And
that affected us on the other -- on the offensive end. We tried to establish
an inside game, and we couldn't pose our will very well in the first half.  
Thought we did a better job in the second half. Look at the points in the
paint, there's a margin in the second half. But it took us a while to figure
that out. Then perimeter shooting from our other guards. We couldn't get
Taylor Wurtz going. Jade Davis found one late. I thought Alyssa Karel did
pretty much everything possible she could to will this team to win. Ashley
Thomas gave us good energy defensively. Cassie Rochel, a freshman, did okay in
the first half but got in some foul trouble. And I thought Anya Covington was
filling in for Tara Steinbauer, did a nice job, got a little winded down the
stretch and in some foul trouble, but did a nice job.  
On ball screens with them, too, we were trying to again force them to take
outside shots, and they knocked those outside shots down. We had to adjust.  
Give Illinois a lot of credit. They came in with knowing that the only way
they're going anywhere is to win the game and get to the championship. And
they've been in a lot of games. You look at their Iowa game as of recent. They
just beat Michigan at home -- or lost to Michigan, 3-point shot at the end of
the game. Or layup actually and a foul.  
So they're a good team. I'll take nothing away from them. They played better.
They had a lot more energy. And they jumped on us early and we couldn't
respond.  
  
Q. Can you talk about especially late in the second half the team started
catching on fire? Did anything in particular lead to that?  
COACH STONE: Well, I think once -- well, first, Ashley Thomas's defensive
energy and ability to rotate Lin and Anya off of Penn. When we scored, they
answered. They never let us take the lead. We were going many games for the
media and we couldn't get over the hump.  
But it wasn't without effort. Our kids, I thought they played really hard in
the second half to try to get back. But that first half, that first eight
minutes of the game was too much to overcome.  
  
Q. And you controlled Penn basically tonight but some of the other Illinois
players stepped it up?  
COACH STONE: I think that's what they've been looking for all year long. I
think GodBold wasn't playing very well, didn't score a lot, but it's just a
tough matchup for us. Lydia McCully had her way in there. She played very well
shooting the ball outside. She had her hands full guarding Lin and did a good
job in the first half. We couldn't get our post players going in the first
half. And Centrese McGee, might have been one of her best games of the year.
Really good freshman player. She's very quick. She's a ball-getter and is very
active on the weak side of the floor, and we kept missing her.  
  
Q. And what's next? Now you have to wait almost two weeks for postseason.  
COACH STONE: That's the tough part, it really is. There's a lot of reflection
time right now and we'll head home. It's an early out. It's a sour taste in
our stomach. There's no question. We're disappointed with today. In many ways
we're embarrassed by our defense, but, again, I want to make sure it's clear I
take nothing away from Illinois. They played well. We just didn't play with
the type of intensity that we needed.  
And, you know, it's a woulda-coulda-shoulda deal, and unfortunately you can't
blame it on that. You gotta get it done within the 40 minutes, and we did not.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

g Minnesota to 25 percent shooting, forcing 17 turnovers?  
COACH MCKEOWN: Jaeschke I thought did a tremendous job on Loberg, who really
hurt us, especially in the game when they beat us at Minnesota.  
And I thought we didn't do a very good job at defending Antoine. We let her
loose at the free-throw line. But Buford, who I think is the one of the best
players in the league, we got to her and made her have to work for everything
and she had a rough night.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the emotion your team was able to put forth at the end
of the game with Jaeschke and Orban getting those huge 3-point plays? What do
you think that did for you guys and how proud were you of your team for being
able to continue the emotion until the very end?  
COACH MCKEOWN: I thought that's the best -- I have to go back in my head, but
one of the best finishes we had all year, the last three minutes, the way we
were shaky and we just finished. And didn't turn it over, made free throws,
got her the ball inside, Brittany got an and one, Amy got an and one.  
I thought we showed a lot of poise in the last three minutes, and that's what
you have to do this time of year.  
  
Q. You mentioned your players are obviously excited. You can see that. How
difficult a challenge is it for you to kind of, you know, let them celebrate
now but remind them that tomorrow you've got another big game coming up?  
COACH MCKEOWN: Well, you know, we talked before the game. Sometimes when you
coach a long time, you try to keep an even keel this time of year because you
don't want players too high or low. But right now, our team, I want them to be
sky high. I want them to have fun, enjoy this and play really loose tomorrow
night.  
I thought tonight we played uptight at times. So I just want them to be loose
and just have fun, enjoy the atmosphere, and I think we'll play a lot better
that way than worried about making mistakes. So we're going to try to stay on
an emotional high, see how it goes.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 3, 2011

  

### [Kendall Hackney](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20482)

### [Amy Jaeschke](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18031)

### [Joe McKeown](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19252)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Northwestern  53  
Minnesota - 44

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll let Coach McKeown give his opening statement and then
we'll open it up for the players, student-athletes.  
COACH MCKEOWN: When you coach a long time, you've been in a lot of
tournaments, you realize you're going to have bad stretches, bad halves.  
And sometimes it's good to get that out of your system if you're fortunate
enough to win the basketball game. And it was ugly for a while, it was sloppy,
but I thought our team did a tremendous job of playing the last three minutes
like a tournament team.  
Took care of everything. We really closed the game out. I was really proud how
we closed the game out well. We had some stretches in between that were shaky,
and Minnesota is one of the most dangerous teams in the Big Ten. So I'm just
glad. You just want to move on.  
You're not worried about who missed a shot or who got in foul trouble tonight.
You just play. And really excited about being able to play tomorrow.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Amy, can you just talk about what the battle was like in the post?
Obviously there were plenty of misses to fight for rebounds on.  
AMY JAESCHKE: Yeah. I think the Minnesota players are very physical down low.
So they make it really hard to play against them offensively, and they really
crash hard for boards and stuff. So it was a tough assignment for us tonight,
but they did a good job.  
  
Q. Amy, can you talk a little bit about the emotion of this game, in
particular towards the end of the game you did a 3-point play and you did a
chest bump over there. And what was going on there and what was running
through your mind?  
AMY JAESCHKE: As a senior class we talk a lot to the younger girls on the team
about things we want to accomplish before we leave the program, and one of
them was to win the first round of the Big Ten tournament. We'd never done it
before.  
So really at that point we were riding on emotions wanting to win that game.
So I think that's where the chest bump came in.  
  
Q. Kendall, for a lot of players, a pretty slow offensive game, but you
managed to have -- obviously getting 22 points tonight. Can you talk about
what enabled you to have success while others were maybe struggling to get
their looks?  
KENDALL HACKNEY: Today I thought we rotated the ball well. And I was open.
Coach always tells us to shoot, just keep shooting, even though I may have
taken some bad shots. But moving on from that, you know, my teammates just got
me back in it and they told me not to stop, keep shooting because they know
I'm not -- I try to be confident in my shot, and so those are all my teammates
just working to get me the ball, and it was a great team effort tonight.  
  
Q. Amy, can you talk about the difference between this year's game and last
year's Big Ten tournament game, because last year you guys fell behind to
Michigan and were behind pretty much the entire contest. This year it's you
guys who really take control of the game. What was it to have the lead and
fight them off the rest of the game?  
AMY JAESCHKE: It was definitely a different feel before the game started.
Everybody was really high energy. And I think that was what was the difference
in the game is; that we came out ready to fight and we were going to fight for
40 minutes. Even though it got ugly at some points, we just had the energy and
we had the drive to win this game.  
  
Q. Amy, you held Loberg 12 for 1 shooting from the floor tonight. Can you
just talk about what you think made you successful in limiting her abilities
to finish her shots?  
AMY JAESCHKE: The first time we played her, she let me out. She had a great
game. So I took it personally last time we played and this time we played of
not to let her get any easy shots or easy -- any open looks. And I think every
single coach has told me at least 17 times not to leave my feet and not to go
for any of her fakes. I think they engrained it in my head and I tried to stay
down as much as I could tonight.  
  
Q. Kendall, I already asked Amy this, but you're fairly new to the program.
Sophomore year. What does it mean to you to get this Big Ten tournament win,
the first time in Northwestern in 11 years?  
KENDALL HACKNEY: It's huge, really for our seniors. They've worked so hard and
they've set a great example for us to follow in this program. So really this
win -- we're not satisfied. We still have three more games left. That's our
goal. And we've just got to keep fighting and we're just playing great team
basketball. And it's a really big win for the program, but we have to keep
going, keep fighting.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, if you're told before the game, you -- a team would shoot 36
percent and you'd have 21 turnovers, do you think that the outcome of that
game would be a win?  
COACH MCKEOWN: Yes.  
  
Q. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about last year's Big Ten
tournament game and what this means in context for you guys to jump out to the
early lead this time around and establish control?  
COACH MCKEOWN: I'd rather not. I want to talk about tomorrow. I don't want to
talk about last year. We've got new players, new people.  
  
Q. In that case, what can you say about Michigan State? You guys came close
last time you were with them in East Lansing for pretty much 35 minutes of the
game, and they kind of slipped away from you --  
COACH MCKEOWN: I'm sorry, can you repeat that.  
  
Q. Against Michigan State, I was wondering if you could talk, last time you
really competed with them pretty strong in East Lansing for the first 35
minutes. What are your impressions going into that game? Your team has clearly
showed they can be competitive against the Spartans.  
COACH MCKEOWN: What we're trying to do is move forward with not being
satisfied with winning a game. And because the more you say that, the more
people hear that, the more people talk to players about that. I think there's
a tendency to become satisfied, and we're trying to overcome that.  
So the biggest thing that I want to talk about is playing tomorrow night
against Michigan State, who is a great team, who is a regular season champion.
I don't know what they're ranked in the country, top 10, top whatever. But
it's a great matchup. It's an exciting time. I think our players really should
be -- it's what you play for.  
So I think this will be a fun game. It will be a fun game to play in. You kind
of have nothing-to-lose type attitude. And just go out and play.  
  

Q. Can you talk about the defensive effort tonight, holdin  |

_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Purdue  66  
Indiana - 62

  
THE MODERATOR: We've been joined by Indiana Coach Jack along with student-
athletes Jori Davis and Whitney Lindsay.  
Opening comment from Coach.  
COACH LEGETTE-JACK: What a great game. It's an in-state rival. I think we left
it out there, both teams. I think the Hoosier Nation should be proud of both
programs.  
We watched a Reggie Miller 30-minute segment on the way up here, and we saw
how the Hoosier Nation really embraced the Hoosiers and how they wanted Steve
Alford to be that second-round draft pick and how devastated they were when he
wasn't selected.  
That just shows you how passionate this state of Indiana is. And hats off to
Purdue who really did an outstanding job tonight.  
But our kids got better, and the record is kind of interesting to me, 9 and
20. I just thought that the kids that I have certainly don't want to lose, but
if I had to trade any of them I'd rather take these 20 losses than lose any of
them.  
These two ladies here and another young lady that joined me before anybody
knew anything about myself or our Indiana program, since they've come here,
this really is an outstanding program and some great kids are coming in the
future.  
And we lost today on the scoreboard, but we absolutely won when we signed
these three seniors, because great character kids that obtain unbelievable
academic standards here at Indiana and graduated a semester early, two of
them. I could not be more proud than I am of these young ladies.  
They're going to be something significant. Just not on this basketball court
anymore, except for this young lady here, she's going to play some more
basketball for us. I'm so proud of being a Hoosier. I never thought I'd say
that, because in '87 I was at Syracuse University when that young man hit that
shot. But I'm a Hoosier and very proud of it.  
  
Q. Jori, you're walking off the court the final time as an IU player. What
sorts of thoughts are going off in your mind? What sorts of things are you
contemplating in the last 20 minutes or so?  
JORI DAVIS: Just that this is my last go-around with the Hoosiers. I'll
definitely be a Hoosier at heart once I leave here, but thinking about this is
my last time being with these girls, my last time representing this
conference, and I am just embracing it, win or lose. I just have to give
thanks to God for letting me be at this point in my life, and now it's on to
my next chapter.  
  
Q. Jori, you got into foul trouble early and then came back in, played most
of the second half with four fouls. Talk to me about what it was like playing
under those circumstances.  
JORI DAVIS: You know, it was a little frustrating. Wanting to go after that
ball a little bit harder. But I just had to try and play smart. I had to give
up a few things that I didn't want to give up and just try to play within the
system, playing with four fouls.  
But other than that, I think I just tried to stay focused and go as hard as I
could, and when I have to back up, let my teammates have my back.  
  
Q. In the context of a life -- what have these four years meant for you? In
what way do you feel like you've developed? You didn't win as many games,
didn't get to as many postseason tournaments as you would have liked, but you
obviously got something out of it.  
JORI DAVIS: I mean, I definitely feel like, you know, these four years have
been great. I've learned so much from just the different people I've been
around, from Coach Jack right here on my left. She's taught me so many
lessons, through hard times and good times, she's always teaching us how to
become better women.  
But I've definitely grown as a woman as a whole. And then, you know, Indiana
is a great place. I mean, the community, the way they come together as one
unit, they're really a community. They're kind of built like a family. Like
everyone around Indiana in the community, they know you, they say hi.
Everyone's nice. And I just really learned how to give back a lot to the
community and just become an overall better person.  
Other than that, on the basketball side, I just have grown over the four
years. You play so many games. You learn a lot from your coaches. You learn
from playing at different stages. And I think overall it was a good choice for
me.  
  
Q. Both ladies, you're up by 8, 10 to go. Do you feel it right there? Can
you feel like you got it?  
WHITNEY LINDSAY: Yeah, I definitely felt the momentum was going in the right
direction on our side. And when Jori had to sit for a little bit, my goal --
like my job was I focused mostly on keeping that pressure on Purdue and
attacking and keeping the energy and keeping the five of us focused and having
Jori's back.  
Off the court and on the court we had to have her back at the end of the game
because she did have four fouls. And when she was on the bench I had to
create, keep creating that energy and that momentum.  
And when she got back in, we had to protect her as well, but we definitely
felt it was right there in our hands.  
JORI DAVIS: Definitely. I told everybody, I think I was on the bench at that
time, it was the fourth quarter. It was the fourth quarter, ten minutes to go,
and we were up by 8. And we had them in our hands right there. We just had to
continue to push.  
And it was our last little bit of the quarter where we kind of lost it. But we
definitely felt it, everyone?  
  
Q. Whitney, you played all 40 minutes of today's game. Talk about the energy
and emotion that kind of flowed through the team throughout the entirety of
it.  
WHITNEY LINDSAY: I think for me, it was just I had no choice but to have that
passion and that energy. This is one shot. This is March. I mean, I think that
was like the biggest motivation for me was the fact that it's March. And you
win or you go home. And I think part of that has been in me for a while. And
it just really came out tonight.  
And I really felt like, you know, I needed to do this for -- to play hard for
my teammates. I really felt like for Jori, you know, for my coaches, for
Indiana as a whole. I mean, we went out there and represented our school very
well tonight.  
  
Q. Whitney, you talked a lot about energy, was there any sense of fatigue
there in the last couple of minutes? Seemed like those last few shots you guys
put up were kind of off the front of the rim, those kind of things?  
WHITNEY LINDSAY: If anything, I think we were hitting it too hard off the -- I
think we were really, really energized even at the end of the game, even on
the bench, the talk, we were very passionate. And I didn't feel the energy let
up one bit.  
If it did for a second, someone was stepping up and making sure that it
wouldn't slip. So I really felt -- I never felt fatigue one time. I think at
times I got frustrated and I just tried to keep myself focused mentally, and
it helped.  
  
Q. Jori, what is the next chapter for you, besides class tomorrow?  
JORI DAVIS: Right, the next chapter is being an adult. No more college life.
No more depending on your parents. I mean, I definitely want to continue
playing this game. It's a no-brainer. I've been blessed with this gift and I'm
going to continue to use it until he tells me it's time to stop.  
So I'm definitely going to play and continue building my resume, my education
and growing as a woman.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Can you put into some perspective what Jori has accomplished in these
four years? Jeremiah is going to get 18,000 people tonight at Assembly Hall.
Unfortunately, her career ends here in front of friends and family. But what
she's accomplished, four years, pretty special?  
COACH LEGETTE-JACK: Absolutely. You're not going to find too many people that
come through your path as gifted and as articulate and as bright and as
charismatic as Jori Davis.  
Just unfortunately all the injuries that surrounded her career with Sasha
being out and Georgie coming back from that knee injury and all these kinds of
barriers stood in front of her, and she saw none of them. She continued to be
the great person and great player and great gift-giver that she is.  
And whoever gets a Jori Davis at that next level is going to be a really happy
person and team, because she's a better player with better talent.  
  
Q. The last few time-outs, maybe not the last few, the last five minutes,
you seemed like you might have been as excited as anybody on your bench, you,
the smile, the energy. I mean, I know part of it is to keep your team up, but
just the smile. You seemed to revel in the fact that this team really came to
play and it was win or lose, this was a thrill ride because they were really
giving everything they had.  
COACH LEGETTE-JACK: I love this game. I love this team. I love this
opportunity. And you know as a coach of a Big Ten team, your first and
foremost thing is to win. And most coaches' mindset, and it's not just mine.  
That's third on our list. The character that exuded out there, the mental
toughness they exuded out there, and we went there four days in a row about
the seven-minute mark. We knew that seven-minute mark has been our burden. And
we've won that battle down the stretch.  
We hurt ourselves in the first five minutes, if you will, of the second half.
So we've gotten better. And as a teacher of young folks, you've got to embrace
it when they succeed, even through the battle. That's what I kept sharing with
them. You've won this segment, you've won this lesson, you've won this
situation here.  
They needed to hear that and they needed to know I sincerely meant that. The
smiles were sincere, the challenge was still in front of us. It didn't seem to
work out. We had had two break-away layups that didn't happen for us. That was
our time.  
And maybe it wasn't supposed to be. I'm not sure. I just know that we put them
in position of success and it just didn't happen for us.  
  
Q. Down the stretch, probably the last person you want on the free-throw
line was Brittany Rayburn. Sure enough, she was able to get there. What did
Purdue do to put her in that situation?  
COACH LEGETTE-JACK: Same thing we did to put Jori in that situation. For some
reason Jori wasn't able to get to there. And so I'm not certain of that. You
break away to get the ball. We tried to prevent her from getting the ball and
they called the foul. It's unfortunate. She's a great free-throw shooter and
lights out. This is a kid that stayed in her backyard and learned her craft
well.  
  
Q. You talked about getting through that seven minute barrier that you guys
struggled with this season. How much of a factor down the stretch was the fact
that you guys are kind of trying to believe you can win? Because you've
struggled --  
COACH LEGETTE-JACK: We don't try to believe we can win; we believe we can win.
We absolutely never went into a competition thinking that we didn't deserve
success and wasn't going to go out there to earn it. I didn't mean to
interrupt you, but don't misunderstand this thing, every battle we went in
this year we absolutely unequivocally thought we could win it.  
  
Q. Maybe not believe you can win, but this team is still learning how to
win, something they have struggled with at times this year. How much of a
factor was that process of learning how to win versus Purdue, which is a team
that's had more experience in that department?  
COACH LEGETTE-JACK: I can't speak on Purdue on that mindset. This is the same
thing I've done for the last five years. We teach the same listen. We've done
the same things. It's different when you have a Kim Roberson and a Whitney
Thomas out there as opposed to not having them out there with that kind of IQ
or innate ability to be successful.  
So it's a lesson that you continue to teach. You teach them all the same
thing. These are my kids, man, and we struggled having them learn the lesson.
I wish I had more time, because sometimes you don't think some of them might
be ready to be able to go out in that world and you want to continue to teach
the lesson with that carrot of basketball in your hand.  
And unfortunately it just didn't seem to work for some of them. And my hope is
that we continue to work behind the scenes to get them to believe that even
though they knock you down 115,000 times, even though you watch the film on
Dr. King and how he just stood for peace and he died for his absolute belief
and it doesn't always work out for but you don't go into the battle not
believing.  
Unfortunately we fell short. But the fact that we kept standing back up makes
me proud.  
  
Q. Not that the other team needs it, but the props to Brittany for the
little 6-0 Brittany run and how that got them back in when it looked like you
had them on the ropes. You expect big-time players to come through. And I
guess she did for them against you today.  
COACH LEGETTE-JACK: I'd like to talk about a Jori Davis, even through a
double-team she found a way to slither through that and make opportunities for
ourselves.  
And I've never seen somebody get grabbed and held and pulled and shoved as
much as I did for this, with this young lady named Jori Davis. But she still
found the way to be the leading scorer in the Big Ten over all the great
players, through the double-team, through the triple-team, she stood up and
continued. And that's the young lady I like to talk about. That's the young
lady that I'm real proud of.  
  
Q. As you mentioned earlier, the losses obviously weren't what you had in
mind for this season. What can you learn from this to help your program going
forward?  
COACH LEGETTE-JACK: We gotta learn how to continue to get better in that last
seven-minute mark. But I'm excited about the future of my seniors. But I'm
really excited about the young folks that's coming to our future here at
Indiana.  
Because of Jori and Whitney and Andrea and Hope, a lot of people are really
excited about Indiana athletics and Indiana women's basketball and we're
getting people knocking on the doors telling us they can help. They're taller
than what we have and their faster and IQs a little different. I think because
of the seniors we have, the lessons stay the same but the talent is going to
be a little bit different.  
I want to thank the Big Ten for all you do. You guys put us on the stage and
you make us have an opportunity to embrace this entire country by putting us
on the network. This big stage is so important. We humbly hope that we
represented you guys in a fine fashion, and we'll keep making Indiana better
because this is the biggest and best conference in the country because of what
our commissioner has done and what all you have done too as well.  
Thank you so much for giving us this opportunity.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 3, 2011

  

### [China Antoine](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20495)

### [Pam Borton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14360)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Northwestern  53  
Minnesota - 44

  
THE MODERATOR: Welcome. First we'll have you, Coach, give an opening statement
and people can ask questions of China.  
COACH BORTON: I thought it was obviously a battle of defenses tonight. And a
lot of turnovers, a lot of missed shots in the paint.  
I think we gave ourselves an opportunity to win with our defense and getting
ourselves back in the game. At least in the first half and cutting it to one.  
I thought our team did a real good job executing down the stretch. We just
couldn't put the ball in the basket. I think we got a lot of nice looks inside
to our post players. But we have three of our better players having tough
nights scoring. It's going to be tough to win.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for China?  
  
Q. You were only one of two players tonight to shoot over 50 percent. What
do you think was enabling you to have success tonight while the others were
having trouble following their looks?  
CHINA ANTOINE: Me being successful? I think our team needed a boost and
momentum and I knew I had to step up as a leader and as a captain and as a
senior, this being possibly one of my last games. And I knew I needed to step
up, and from that point it was easy to score.  
  
Q. Were you surprised at all about how long it took you guys to come out of
the gate? It seemed like in those opening five, ten minutes Northwestern just
kind of pounced on the opportunity quicker than you guys did.  
CHINA ANTOINE: Yeah, I think we had nervous jitters coming out from the
beginning. I think that we were sloppy, then once we calmed ourselves down
relaxed we came out playing like we usually play. Once we got the nerves out,
we started playing better.  
  
Q. That sloppiness, was that something more you guys were doing yourself or
was it something that the Northwestern defense was forcing?  
CHINA ANTOINE: Absolutely. We were rushing. It's something we did ourselves,
we were rushing and throwing sloppy passes and not taking the best shots. We
definitely did that to ourselves, nothing they did to us.  
  
Q. What do you think you guys were able to accomplish on -- I guess what
struggles did you guys have in the interior, Loberg went 1 for 12 and Voigt
went 1 for 10, something like that. How much of a struggle was it for you guys
to establish a post game today?  
CHINA ANTOINE: It's hard to win games without having our posts scoring as
much. They were getting good shots, but they weren't falling tonight. That
made it hard for us to get that inside/out game. But we know that they're
talented, and so we were hoping they were going to make some shots. They did
make a few shots toward the end which kept us in the game.  
They knew what they had to do.  
  
Q. At the other end of the floor, you were posting a lot of turnovers, five
steals yourself. Talk about the defensive effort.  
CHINA ANTOINE: Absolutely, I think our whole team was playing very good
defense. We were intense on defense and we knew that would keep us in the
game, as long as we played good defense. We knew our shots weren't falling,
but if we were just playing good defense, we can keep ourselves in the game,
and eventually we thought our shots would fall.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, China.  
Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. With a game like today, how much do you consider that Northwestern beat
you guys and how much do you guys consider you sort of beat yourself?  
COACH BORTON: You have to give Northwestern credit. They're a very good team.
Amy Jaeschke takes a lot of energy and a lot of attention. And, you know, when
all the other players are knocking shots down there, they're a tough team to
beat. Jaeschke is an All-Big Ten player and she's tough to guard.  
I thought Hackney stepped up and knocked shots down when they needed to go on
the run.  
  
Q. You've played Northwestern now three times this season. I was wondering,
did you notice anything different about this game? Did it seem like there was
a different emotion or different kind of feeling to this one?  
COACH BORTON: I don't think so. I mean, I think both teams came out and played
with a lot of energy.  
I think we kind of felt like when we played at home. I mean, I think we played
with a lot of energy. I think we played a little bit better at home. And I
think when we played Northwestern at their place, I think both teams were
pretty flat. It was a pretty ugly game. And Northwestern came out on top.  
And I think both teams came out and I think played extremely hard and were
playing for something. We wanted to play for another day. And Northwestern is
one that made a few more shots down the stretch than we did.  
  
Q. With the frequency of turnovers tonight, how much did that -- for both
teams how much of that was due to sloppiness, handling the ball, and how much
was just high-energy defense?  
COACH BORTON: I think we've had a problem with turnovers all year. I think we
went through a stretch where we weren't turning the ball over, but I think in
the last few games we've turned the ball over a lot. But a lot of it has to do
with, you know, ourselves.  
We're traveling. It's just a lot of fundamentals of passing and footwork. But,
again, you've got to give Northwestern a lot of credit for putting the
pressure on us to put us in those situations.  
  
Q. I wanted to ask you about the final five minutes of the game. You guys
fought really hard to get back into it, tied the game up on several occasions,
but at the end Northwestern behind, two big 3-point plays from Orban and
Jaeschke pulled away, what did you think of those final few minutes and what
they were able to do to you guys?  
COACH BORTON: I think the final media time-out we were down one point and we
needed to execute on both ends of the floor and just follow the game plan. We
got the shots we wanted to down the stretch in the paint, and they just didn't
fall. And I think a couple of players got loose on us and hit 3s, but Jaeschke
is going to step up and knock a 3 down. She's a senior, great player, an All-
Big Ten player. And Orban is a great player as well. Good players step up and
knock shots down in crucial times.  
  
Q. How tough is it to get running on offense when Loberg, Buford and Voigt
are all having off nights at the same time?  
COACH BORTON: It's going to be tough to win basketball games. It's going to be
tough to win when you don't have a post game that's scoring. And I thought
they had good looks. And it just puts more pressure on your guards. They have
to make shots and you're designing plays to get them to the rim, but you've
got to be able to have an inside/outside game to win basketball games.  
  
Q. If you could just talk a little bit about how good China was tonight in
terms of getting you guys back into that game, hitting shots from all over the
3-point line. How impressive was her performance tonight?  
COACH BORTON: I think her performance was very impressive and it started on
the defensive end. I think she really created a lot of steals and created a
lot of offense for us defensively. And she was open. And I think tonight she
stepped up and knocked shots down and kept us in the game. And I think if we
would have had one more player step up and have a good night, I think we would
have been able to pull this off.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

Utah - 52 (OT)  
TCU - 47

  
THE MODERATOR: We're ready to begin with TCU. Coach, if we could start with
you, just some comments on today's game.  
COACH MITTIE: Well, it was a hard-fought game. Obviously Utah made a couple
more plays than we did. I thought the rebounding hurt us today, where
yesterday we rebounded so well. Today we just struggled. Second half our
rebounding was much better, but we still only get four offensive rebounds. We
didn't really get any second chances. They were able to get 12 offensive
rebounds. That's really the difference in the game for a couple extra
opportunities.  
Credit goes to Utah, though. They played very physical. We seemed to struggle
with that in the early part of the game. I thought we adjusted better as the
game went on. We fought hard. Proud of our group for fighting hard to come
back.  
We take the lead in the early overtime and we just can't make that one more
extra play to push it to a four- or five-point, get a little bit away from
them. That's a credit to Utah's defense. They're very physical and very solid
all the way around.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for our student-athletes.  
  
Q. Utah got off to a 16-2 start. That was a little surprising. Fourth game
in five days. Did that surprise you? Talk about the slow start you had to
overcome.  
HELENA SVERRISDOTTIR: We obviously wanted to get a good start. That didn't
happen. They were really physical.  
We should have known. We knew that they were a physical team. But it kind of
surprised us. They were checking us on every cut.  
But I think, you know, second half we came together. But obviously the start
definitely hurt us today.  
  
Q. Can you talk in broad terms about you making it to the title game for the
first time, how losing this has to be tough as a senior.  
EMILY CARTER: Yeah, it's tough as a senior. We finally made it to the title
game for our senior year, and to lose in it hurts. It hurts pretty bad.  
We fought back. We fought hard. I think we let them get up early. We fought
back till the end, but they just made more plays down the stretch. That's how
the game came out.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll dismiss the student-athletes and continue with questions
for Coach Mittie.  
  
Q. Plouffe scored eight in the overtime. There was a stretch where Utah was
not making their jump shots but when they needed it most, especially Plouffe
in overtime, they were able to get open looks.  
COACH MITTIE: Yeah, she got the one jumper that was kind of the hustle play
that kind of got batted around and all of a sudden ended up in her hands.
That's where she's really good. She's really good in the midrange game. She
kind of had to fight through the middle part of the game where she was missing
some jumpers. Boy, it was big. She stepped up huge, had a huge night.  
  
Q. Rodrigues hit two three-pointers at the shot clock buzzer back to back
down the floor. Stuff like that seemed to be going Utah's way.  
COACH MITTIE: Those were our breakdowns. If you noticed in the second half,
they didn't get that same look when Badon penetrated. That's what we were
supposed to do. Our team did not handle the early part of the game well at
all. They lost discipline. They did things that we had talked about in the
scout. Once we settled into it, we played it pretty well.  
  
Q. Will you speak to the 16-2 start, how much that surprised you, or not?  
COACH MITTIE: Well, this team has struggled with the starts all year. It's
been very inconsistent. I was probably more surprised by yesterday's start. We
haven't had a start like that.  
It's been the Achilles' heel for this basketball team, is that they have dug
themselves some holes. Today we had to use so much energy coming back. I was
glad we got it to 10 at half, felt like we had it at a manageable number.
Points were hard to come by. Our defense and rebounding improved, so we had a
chance to get back into this thing and we did.  
  
Q. I know you don't want to make excuses, but how big of a loss is not
having Crawford and Thompson out there?  
COACH MITTIE: Well, I think you always want to come in as healthy as you can.
We're really as healthy as we can be.  
But, you know, we had the energy to overcome that yesterday with our
rebounding, and today we did not.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much, coach.  
COACH MITTIE: Thank you.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

### [Anthony Levrets](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21838)

### [Michelle Plouffe](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21840)

  
_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

Utah - 52 (OT)  
TCU - 47

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Utah. Coach, if we could start with your
thoughts on today's game.  
COACH LEVRETS: My thoughts, huh? I'm just really, really proud of these kids.
We went through a heck of a year. A lot of adversity, a lot of ups and downs.
You know, the thing that we did all year long was defend. We stopped people
for the entire year. Offensively it took us a little while to get going with
Taryn going down and changing how we played and people's roles. Me being young
and new, our team being young and new, having to change on the fly, it took us
a little while to get there.  
But we're a talented, talented group. We started playing well right at the
right time.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. It seemed in the second half there was a lull where you lost your legs.
Was there a specific incident or something that got your energy back for the
overtime?  
JANITA BADON: I wouldn't say we lost our legs. TCU is a really good team.
They're very talented offensively-wise. But, uhm, I don't know. We knew they
were going to run. But we just knew how we had to respond, and we did that.  
  
Q. When they went to the zone, you really struggled with the zone for a long
period of time. What did you do down the stretch that was so successful in
overtime? How did you beat it in terms of having problems with it earlier in
the game?  
JANITA BADON: We started looking inside. Michelle Plouffe is probably one of
the best shooters in the league. She can shoot from outside and inside. She
just proved that tonight.  
MICHELLE PLOUFFE: Yeah, they played us zone most of the game. We knew they
were going to. We were prepared for that. Obviously sometimes shots aren't
going to fall. But we just kept running our game plan. Yeah, just started
working.  
  
Q. Michelle, overall how would you describe your shooting day today?  
MICHELLE PLOUFFE: I guess once I started missing a few shots I started not
shooting it. My teammates told me and my coaches told me that I needed to
shoot it, and I did. Then I just started making 'em when it mattered.  
I just need to keep my confidence when shots aren't going in.  
  
Q. What did you do against Helena that was so successful?  
MICHELLE PLOUFFE: I think that's just part of our whole defense mentality.
Michelle Harrison did a great job on her. Locked her down. She always makes
some really tough shots. So we just kept discipline on defense and stuck to
the game plan, and it turned out pretty good.  
JANITA BADON: I think it was our team defense. I don't think we've talked ever
in a game as much as we talked today because we knew how dangerous she was on
offense; her and Carter. Yup, it was our team defense.  
  
Q. Before the tournament coach said you were really confident that you could
win the tournament. One thing you said was that he's not going to tell you
otherwise. After struggling so much during the season, losing so many close
games, what was it that made you have so much confidence coming in that you
could win?  
JANITA BADON: I really think your past is what defines you now. And it hurts
to lose, but that was our best growth moments. That's when we came closer.  
So it's like, yeah, we lost on a buzzer beater, but next time we got 'em. As
we played teams in our conference, as we played teams in the pre-season, we
just got better each and every game. Now it's finally paying off. So hard work
does pay off.  
  
Q. Now that the Huntsman Center is going to host the NCAAs, most likely
you'll be playing on your home court. Talk about that and the opportunity to
do that.  
COACH LEVRETS: It's actually automatic. We are at home.  
  
Q. So playing on your home court, talk about that.  
JANITA BADON: That's exciting. You go 4-0 at somebody else's home, then you go
home and actually get to play there with your fans. It's just exciting. Words
can't explain how excited I am.  
MICHELLE PLOUFFE: Yeah, I have no words to explain that (laughter).  
THE MODERATOR: We'll dismiss our student-athletes at this time and continue
with questions for Coach Levrets.  
  
Q. Talk about what a struggle it was to try to score in the second half, and
how you managed to score enough points to win?  
COACH LEVRETS: First of all, TCU is a very good basketball team. Jeff Mittie
is a really, really good coach. We were very fortunate to get out of here with
this win.  
You know, their zone is long. It's really long. We tried to get the ball
inside, but we just weren't successful. As the game went on, we ran some stuff
that we hadn't run for a while that we ran earlier in the year just to get a
little bit of movement so they couldn't match to us. It finally got us the
zone spread enough that we could get some high-post catches.  
When Plouffe gets the ball there, she's going to make it. She struggles
tonight at 8-21. Most people would love to struggle like that, have 24-11.
When the game's on the line, she's proven that she can make plays.  
  
Q. Talk about Plouffe's maturation. She's your go-to player. What has it
been about her all season that's gotten her to this point?  
COACH LEVRETS: Well, you know, before Taryn went down, she was playing really,
really well. In practice, she was unbelievable. Then when T went down, we had
to go play eight games in 16 days with no practice. It was a really, really
difficult time. We moved Plouffe to Taryn's spot and somebody else to the
four. It was a mistake. Looking back on it, I wish I could change it. You
can't change it. We just had to learn. We moved her back to the four and moved
Diana back to the five. She's playing where she's comfortable. Once she got
back there, it took her a while to get back to being comfortable with all the
things she can do at that spot.  
The biggest thing is she's good. She's really, really talented, has a great
demeanor about her and does not get down. She just plays through anything. I
think earlier this year she had her worst night of the year, I think she
didn't score. The next game she had 30. That's just kind of the way that she
is.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much, coach.  
COACH LEVRETS: Thanks.

_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

TCU  61  
New Mexico - 40

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by TCU. Coach, if we could start with some general
thoughts on today's game.  
COACH MITTIE: Well, I thought we got out of the gates the way we wanted to.
The advantage of the rest is obvious, and we took advantage of that. We came
in. I thought we practiced well leading up to this. You know, my guess is New
Mexico got a little bit tired. We wanted to get out. We wanted to hopefully
take their legs a little bit. I thought our group was very active. I thought
our group played well.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Helena, you really looked like you had an extra bounce in your step. Did
the layoff really help you?  
HELENA SVERRISDOTTIR: Yeah, I think so. I think we had some really good
practices. We were able to get rest, but at the same time get ready for
today's game. So, yeah, it definitely helped.  
  
Q. Micah, you had a couple huge baskets in the first half to get TCU going.
How important was it to get off to a fast start?  
MICAH GAROUTTE: Definitely, a fast start was important.  
  
Q. Talk about your offensive game in the first half.  
MICAH GAROUTTE: I just think we were able to move the ball. Coach talked about
getting great shots as opposed to good shots. When you have an open shot, just
take it. I think we really just trusted the offense and were able to execute a
lot of things. That helped us a lot. It's really easy to get good shots
whenever Helena is your point guard.  
  
Q. What did you all do differently, or did you do anything, in terms of
approaching the tournament differently than you have in the past given you've
had trouble here at the Mountain West tournament in the past?  
HELENA SVERRISDOTTIR: I don't think we did anything different. We definitely
learned from the past three years. I've never seen my team this focused.
That's what I loved about today. We were all so into it. All nine players were
ready to play. That's what we need for tomorrow as well.  
MICAH GAROUTTE: Yeah, I don't think we did anything different. I think just
what Helena said, we were all really focused. I think everybody knew that they
were going to have their part in this. I think that made everybody really
ready knowing that they were going to have to get in there, they were going to
have to be focused and really step up their game.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll dismiss the student-athletes and continue with questions
for Coach Mittie.  
  
Q. You mentioned New Mexico looking like they were a little tired. Was that
something you detected early as opposed to late when it was obvious?  
COACH MITTIE: I think when we get out of the gate like we did, that can take
some wind out of your sails early. If it's a grind-it game, they can find
their legs. They played a lot of games leading up to this. In the past, we
haven't taken advantage of that. This was a little different for us.  
They did notice the different prep. I went back and looked when we were --
previously when we had 12-day layoffs for the NCAA tournament, I went back and
looked at some practice schedules, looked at what had worked for us. This was
a long layoff. We had the last bye of the Mountain West, so we hadn't played
since last Wednesday. So this was a long break.  
I went back and tried to string enough practices together but enough rest. We
felt like our practices were better. We probably practiced a little bit less,
but we didn't string together four days in a row. We knew what we needed to do
was string together a couple days here. We practiced, rest, a couple days of
practice, rest, a couple days of practice. That's what we did prior.  
  
Q. Talk about Helena. You cleared it out for her several times. She was able
to take advantage, the size advantage, down in the paint.  
COACH MITTIE: Yeah. Well, she made good reads on that. That's one of the
things that Helena does such a great job within the offense. It might not be a
called play.  
I thought there were two things that were key with her game. They really
locked on Carter. Ice likes the left side of the floor for the drive. With
them locked on Carter, she has that drive and she was able to make some plays.
Then we were also able to iso a side for her and just allow her to work. She
had a good feel for the game today.  
  
Q. What happened with Crawford and Thompson? When did you make the decision
to leave them behind?  
COACH MITTIE: Well, yeah, both were a little bit different in regards to their
injuries. But the decision was probably made Wednesday-ish, probably Wednesday
sometime. It just wasn't going to be productive for them to be here. We hope
they have a chance to have them back for post-season.  
They're both day to day on that. The plane ride, the travel, all that stuff
wasn't going to be productive, so we decided to leave them back in Fort Worth.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.  
COACH MITTIE: Thank you.

_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

Utah  50  
BYU - 49

  
THE MODERATOR: We're ready to begin with BYU. Coach, we'll start with some
general comments on today's game.  
COACH JUDKINS: Well, got to give Utah a lot of credit. They played a great
game. They hit the shots when it counted. Being up five points, that three-
pointer was a big basket for them. Then we had a couple chances with eight
seconds, I thought, to stop them. We gave them too many opportunities.  
Then, of course, we had the ball. If we would have scored the last possession,
it might have been a big difference, but we didn't seem to get it to fall for
us. Didn't really get an easy shot.  
It's hard. These tournaments are tough because you play all season for two and
a half months, and then you get into the tournament, whatever team is hot,
whatever team that hits some shots. Utah right now is playing really well and
doing the things they need to.  
I thought they did a lot better job against us on the boards, where we
dominated in the first game of the year. We didn't do as good today.  
I'm proud of my team. We didn't play our best ball tonight. We still hung in
there. It was a real ugly game. Not a high-scoring game. We just hung in
there. Just needed to make some plays at the end for us to win.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll open it up to questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Haley, y'all talked about at the beginning of the season the goal of the
getting to the NCAA tournament. Still feel realistic at this point?  
HALEY HALL: We don't know. I think that was why we wanted to come down and win
this tournament, so we could secure a place for us. Now we're just kind of in
limbo till Monday till we find out.  
I would say right now we're probably on the bubble of maybe we're in, maybe
we're out. I know it's going to be a long weekend waiting to hear.  
  
Q. Mindy, could you address the physical nature of this game. Looked pretty
rough out there.  
MINDY BONHAM: You know, it was. I think that's kind of our style of play. I
was glad that the refs kind of let it go.  
But, you know, we just need to step up and kind of play to how the refs are
going to allow us to play. So I thought we did a good job tonight just being
physical. They were physical. I thought it was an all-around, good, well-
reffed game. Just came down to the end where we needed to make a couple more
stops there. I thought our team played well and their team played well.  
When a rivalry game comes like that, it's always going to be a good physical
game. You know, we just got to make a couple stops there at the end.  
  
Q. Could you go through the last sequence that happened there.  
HALEY HALL: Well, yeah, I mean, you can't give a team three chances at the end
of a game to win it. I think there were eight seconds left and they had three
different possessions.  
You know, I think Jen did tip that last one and it fell into Michelle
Plouffe's hands. She made the play. Credit to her for making the shot. It
hurts when the buzzer goes off and you know you did all you could in that
defensive possession.  
We feel like if you're going to give a team three chances to win at the end of
a game, they're probably going to capitalize on one of those.  
  
Q. Mindy, based on what Haley said, do you feel this is kind of one you gave
away?  
MINDY BONHAM: You know, I don't think we just gave it away. I thought our
girls played really hard. We play to win every single game. I just think that
it comes down to making smart plays at the end of the game, just staying
aggressive and being smart.  
So, you know, credit to Plouffe. She made an awesome play and scored it. I
don't think we just gave it away. But I think there were opportunities there
where we could have just made a little smarter play.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll dismiss the student-athletes at this time and continue
with questions for Coach Judkins.  
  
Q. You missed your first nine shots coming out. Talk about the way the
tournament is formatted, that you hadn't played for a couple days. Also just
talk about the defensive pressure you applied, forced a lot of turnovers
tonight.  
COACH JUDKINS: Well, we tried to pressure as much as we could. We thought with
them playing three games in four days we could wear them down. It didn't seem
to really bother them. They didn't seem to be as tired as I thought they would
be.  
Once they broke the press, Badon did a nice job a couple times of attacking
it, getting to the foul line. Then when she didn't have it, she did a good job
of pulling it out and making us play their game, which is slow down and so
forth.  
Our team has had a bye. We've had a week off before. This doesn't bother me. I
do think this format is fine, except for one thing: you can't give a team a
day off. If we're going to do this, we should do it where a team gets
penalized, has to play four straight games. To get a day off, rest, be here,
all those things, is a little bit of an advantage.  
But that's not why we lost tonight. We lost tonight because we didn't shoot
the ball. Go 4-17, shoot 30-something percent from the field. They hit every
shot tonight that really counted. What I mean by that is their comeback,
hitting the three, hitting baskets. They hit 'em. Some nights it goes that
way. We've won a lot of games this year with teams missing those or us doing a
great job.  
I have one of my best players go 3-15 and she had good looks tonight. Cori is
a great player. If I could say, Hey, Cori, you get the shots she had today,
I'd take them. They weren't falling for her. She's trying a little bit too
hard.  
I'm proud of these guys. They work hard. There's no excuses. We lost this
game. Utah made the plays that they had to. We're going to hopefully have a
chance to play somewhere in some tournament. These guys will bounce back.  
  
Q. Why would you say that this league should be more than a one-bid league
in the NCAAs? What would you say to get your team or any other team in the
conference into the NCAAs?  
COACH JUDKINS: The reason for that is we've had four different teams get to
the Sweet 16. We've had several years where all our teams have won the first
round of NCAA games. I think we have proven over the years that our conference
is solid.  
Yeah, do we get banged up sometimes in pre-season? People don't want to play
us. Big schools don't want to come and play at our place, so we have to go
play at their arenas, get paid, something like that, which is really not that
fair.  
But this is a tough league. Got great coaches. I think we have proven over the
years that this conference can guard anybody, play against anybody.  
You know that when people won't come play you. You call them up, say, We'll go
one for one, they look at you like you're crazy, big conferences.  
I think we deserve it. Our RPI is not probably as good as it's been in the
past. I think a lot of us this year tried to play a really hard schedule. We
kind of paid for it, losing some of those games.  
I know that there's three or four teams that could do well in the tournament.  
  
Q. That second-to-last inbound play, a couple of 10ths of a second went off.
Did you think of asking the officials if more time could come up?  
COACH JUDKINS: I asked them. They got the monitor. I guess they felt like they
knew the time. Every second counts, there's no question. If Cori turns and
sees the ball, it's ours, we win. You know, they made some big shots.  
A lot of this was my fault. We were up five points. I told my team, Don't give
them a three-pointer. We should have switched that stagger, made Rodrigues
take a shot. We didn't execute down the end when we needed to. That really
falls on me.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much, coach.  
COACH JUDKINS: Thank you.

_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

TCU  61  
New Mexico - 40

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by New Mexico. Coach, we'll start with you with
some comments on today's game.  
COACH FLANAGAN: Congratulations to TCU. They played a really strong game
today.  
We felt like going in that we had to at least limit Sverrisdottir's
effectiveness in catches, which I thought we didn't do. I thought we defended
everybody else pretty well. We had been shooting quite well, at least quite
well for us, in our previous games. Today we just did not shoot well. We
reverted back to part of our season where we weren't shooting well.  
Shots that we were hitting in the first two games we weren't even close today.
So it was disappointing that we didn't play up to our potential. But
congratulations to TCU because they haven't played a game in 10 days. It
looked like they were in the best of condition. So congratulations to them.  
THE MODERATOR: Now we'll take questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Jasmine, you had a great tournament. Can you talk about not having any
nerves or jitters the last four days.  
JASMINE PATTERSON: Well, my first tournament since I'm a freshman. Apparently,
like, I just came out to play, not knowing that it was just important for the
seniors. I just wanted to come out and play basketball, not knowing I was
really in an important conference game. It was just like a regular game. I
wasn't nervous just because of the fact that I thought it was just another
simple game.  
So just, I don't know, another game.  
  
Q. Amanda, obviously you were a little bit concerned about playing your
third game in four days. Was that a little bit of an issue today or not
really?  
AMANDA BEST: I think maybe the day off kind of hurt us because we were on a
roll and stuff. I don't know, maybe we just didn't get into the same routine
that we were in the past two days. Like we didn't have time to take shoot-
around and stuff. Maybe that was a fact.  
I think our shooting wasn't good. If we would have hit those shots, because we
got good looks, we would have been probably in the game, so...  
  
Q. Jasmine, from the very first play of the game, TCU came at you with very
physical play. Talk about the physicality that happened in the game.  
JASMINE PATTERSON: Are you meaning the play of their play?  
  
Q. Their play.  
JASMINE PATTERSON: She just basically posted me up and threw her body into me
from the get-go. Right after that I knew it was going to be a physical game.
Throughout the whole game, we were just getting hit, just taking it. They're
physical. They're more physical than us.  
  
Q. Obviously this is not the way you wanted it to end. Do you feel the
performance you had in the tournament overall gives your season a little bit
better of a finish?  
AMANDA BEST: Yeah, I think it does. I think we came in and we really battled
hard here. Put our whole season behind us when we came in here and started
new. I feel like we fought the entire time. I think that's the things I'm most
proud of with our team.  
JASMINE PATTERSON: With underclassmen, I think we'll all build on it and just
be ready for next season. It shows us that we're able to do and play just as
well as any other team in our conference.  
THE MODERATOR: At this time we'll dismiss our student-athletes and continue
with questions for Coach Flanagan.  
  
Q. Can you talk about your two seniors throughout this tournament,
throughout the season, what they've meant to you.  
COACH FLANAGAN: Well, both of them I thought had a good tournament. Today was
the exception. But they both played, I thought, as well as they played all
year long.  
Amanda had a couple really outstanding games. And Jess was starting to hit her
shots that she hadn't been hitting during mid-season and also was very
aggressive.  
I'm not sure that we ran out of legs a little bit today. But both of those
players were very positive with their influence on our younger players. They
were really good mentors. They were very understanding of the younger players.  
Sometimes when there's only two seniors, it's hard on them because most of our
players are underclassmen. I thought they did a great job there. Both
outstanding students. Amanda is a Rhodes scholar nominee, All-American
academic. Jess is a really outstanding student. Both of them are really
special student-athletes and have been quality people all four years.  
  
Q. Your team has had games like this before this season. Could you tell
early shooting was going to be a problem and you might be in for a long
night?  
COACH FLANAGAN: You know, I kept thinking in the first half that we can, you
know, hit a couple shots. I thought we had transition opportunities all game
long. They got back pretty well on defense. But we were down there to get
transition opportunities. We just weren't converting those.  
Then our outside shooting left us. Sometimes when you got a player or two
missing outside shots, then all of a sudden everybody starts thinking about
their shot. I thought there was too much question in their mind when to shoot,
when not to shoot.  
They played pretty good defense. But I also thought them mixing up zone and
man bothered us a little bit. At times we were running our man offense against
their zone. That confused us a little bit. Then not knocking in shots.  
Had we knocked in shots, it would have been a game. But we just didn't hit
shots. When you shoot 20%, you're not going to win a lot of games.  
And Sverrisdottir, in my opinion, is a very difficult player to defend.
Especially in a big game, she controls the game.  
  
Q. First half you went to a lineup that nobody had really seen. Did you have
a feeling it was time to mix it up?  
COACH FLANAGAN: Everybody was taking shots early in the offense. It seemed to
me that everybody had the panic mode going on. We hadn't been doing that the
other parts of the tournament. So I went to some other players to try to calm
down those players that were not patient.  
When I did that, Tina hit a couple threes, which helped us. Then I was trying
to give everybody a little bit of rest, then get them back in there. But even
when I got them back in with our first team, we did not shoot well, so...  
It didn't work.  
  
Q. TCU seemed to come at your players physically. Can you speak to the
physical nature of the game.  
COACH FLANAGAN: It was a very physical game. Everybody that they start is
6'1", 6'2". It was a very physical game. Besides being physical, they're quite
quick. They're a very experienced team. Sverrisdottir has been a four-year
starter, Carter has been a four-year starter. They have a lot of players that
have played a lot of basketball in the Mountain West. They're a successful
team obviously.  
I thought the experience in them executing their offense gave them the
opportunity to shoot well. They shot almost 50% the first half. Second half I
thought we defended better, but we still couldn't hit our shots.  
The difference definitely was we were trying to keep them in the high 50s, low
60s, and we did that, but we couldn't keep up with them scoring.  
  
Q. Early in the game it seemed your offense was able to create space to find
open shots but they weren't falling in. Why do you think the ball wasn't going
in?  
COACH FLANAGAN: We've had bouts of that this year. We had times where we
didn't shoot particularly well. This was one of those times.  
We have players that are streak shooters that shoot well a period of time,
sometimes the next game they may not shoot well. I have some that shoot well
every third or fourth game.  
We really this year were inconsistent in our scoring.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.  
COACH FLANAGAN: Thank you.

_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

Utah  50  
BYU - 49

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Utah. Coach, if we could start with your
comments on tonight's game.  
COACH LEVRETS: Really, really proud of our team. BYU is an excellent
basketball team with very, very good players. They're very well-coached. But
our team is just resilient. We've been through a lot of stuff this year. I
told them afterwards, when we get down 9 or 10, we lose a player, we have
something happen internally, that's when we become our best.  
We just can't quit. It's because of these kids next to me. Down the stretch,
we were down 9. Janita just willed us to a win. I'm just really, really proud
to be associated with these kids.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll open it up for questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Michelle, can you take us through what happened before you got the ball?
Looked like it was deflected.  
MICHELLE PLOUFFE: I don't really remember a lot of that play. But I just
remember the ball was coming towards me, it was in a spot I knew I could make
a shot from. I didn't really have a choice. I put it up and it went in. So
that's how it happened.  
  
Q. You've been living out of your suitcase for a week here in Vegas. You
didn't look very tired during that game. How were you able to keep rejuvenated
this week every time you come out?  
MICHELLE PLOUFFE: There is no tired when you're in the semifinals, when you're
against a good opponent. You're playing the game. You just got to keep going.
If you get tired, it's all mental so you just got to push through. That's what
we did in the first half and continuing into the second half.  
COACH LEVRETS: The cigarette smoke in the casino helps a lot to keep you
rejuvenated (smiling).  
  
Q. Michelle, that last pass, was that designed in any way to come to you?
Were you surprised by it at all?  
MICHELLE PLOUFFE: Yeah, that was not designed. But I think it just got tipped
off someone's hands and rolled my way.  
  
Q. Janita, could you talk about the closing stretch of the game, what you
did to make it happen. Did you throw that inbounds pass on the last play?  
JANITA BADON: I would first like to thank Plouffe for saving me. I just threw
it in because I saw Michelle stood there and then I think it was Riley tipped
it and the ball went rolling to Plouffe. I was like, Yeah, I meant to do that.
I'll take the credit.  
But, no, I did not mean to pass to it Plouffe.  
Down the stretch, it wasn't nothing that I did. It was everything that we did.
We knew what we came here before. Like you said, we've been living out of our
suitcase for a week and I don't like doing that for no reason.  
THE MODERATOR: At this time we'll dismiss our student-athletes and continue
with continue with questions for Coach Levrets.  
  
Q. As your interim year continues, how would you put this game into the
context of this season?  
COACH LEVRETS: It's not an interim win. It's going to be permanent. I'm pretty
excited about that.  
I don't know. I don't think about that stuff unless I get asked. We have a
group of kids and a group of coaches that have come together at the very
beginning. When we started this with a common goal, you know, Utah, we talked
about winning championships. We got derailed along the way with some injuries.
We had a major injury, but then we also had one after another nagging injuries
that cost us games and practices.  
But these kids are really, really resilient. They don't know how to quit. We
talked about playing our best basketball at the end of the year, and that
would have to be good enough. Right now we're playing our best basketball.  
  
Q. Can you describe what the best option would have been on the last pass.  
COACH LEVRETS: The whole thing is my fault. They bailed me out. They said they
bailed Janita out. I thought with eight seconds left when we called a timeout,
it was on the sideline. I thought we called the timeout above the free-throw
line. I didn't check before because I was certain it was there. We come out of
the timeout with the sideline out-of-bounds play drawn up. It's underneath out
of bounds. We had to scramble to get to it. We got fortunate they tipped it.  
This time of year, you got to play well, but you also have to be lucky. We got
lucky tonight that the ball at the end bounced our way. If that thing goes
three feet one direction or the other, there's no way she's going to get it.
You have to play well, compete, give yourself a chance. But you got to get a
little lucky. We'll take it.  
  
Q. I know you don't know who you're going to play yet, but getting to the
championship game, the prospect of being able to play in the NCAA tournament
at home the next week, talk about that.  
COACH LEVRETS: One game at a time for us. Now it's the last one. We're just
excited to still be playing. I like coaching them. They're fun to coach.
They're a blast to be around. I don't want it to end and they don't want it to
end. Next year will be a new year. What does that bring? Let's keep this one
going as long as we possibly can.  
They've bought into everything that we've wanted them to do. It sure would be
nice to play at home in the NCAA tournament. But whoever we're playing will be
good. So we'll see what happens.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much, coach.  
COACH LEVRETS: Thank you.

_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

New Mexico  67  
Wyoming - 61

  
THE MODERATOR: We're ready to begin with the University of Wyoming. Coach,
we'll start with your general comments on tonight's game.  
COACH LEGERSKI: You have to give New Mexico a great deal of credit. I thought
they capitalized on their opportunities tonight. You take a look at the
numbers with 14 second-chance points for New Mexico, 5 for Wyoming, then 20
points for New Mexico off turnovers and 9 for Wyoming. When I take a look at
the stats there it really became apparent that they ended up making extra
plays.  
Also we started standing around and expecting the two players to my left to
make it all happen, in Hillary and Aubrey. They've been there all year for us.
But as I always mention to the team, they need help. But yet tonight we just
wanted these two seniors to try to carry us. They did the best they could.  
But once again, I give New Mexico credit for capitalizing on every second-
chance opportunity that was made available by them.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll open it up for questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Hillary, it seemed like they kind of got out on you in the second half,
you would chip away. But what did they do early in the second half to get a
run on you and build the lead?  
HILLARY CARLSON: I think they had a lot of momentum (tearing up). They had a
lot of momentum and confidence going into the second half. I think we kind of
made our little runs and, you know, got into, I don't know, six or seven
points. But we just couldn't, you know, make a good enough run to get right up
there with them.  
We would get stops and score, but then they would make another run. It was
just really hard to, you know, match the runs that they made.  
  
Q. Aubrey, there was like a technical foul and a timeout. You guys seemed to
turn it up a notch the last five minutes of the game. What changed?  
AUBREY VANDIVER: Well, we just came out with more energy, I guess. We got out.
We eliminated them on the boards. They didn't get second opportunities during
that run. On the offensive end, we were able to get movement and get some good
looks.  
  
Q. Hillary, it seemed to me in the first two games against these guys you
shot the ball really well. Doesn't seem like that's happened in this building.
Is it something about the place or just luck?  
HILLARY CARLSON: I'm not sure. I know we're usually a really good shooting
team. I don't know if we just weren't focused or we were rushing our shots. I
don't know. They weren't falling for us. New Mexico kind of got on a roll and,
you know, was starting to make theirs in the second half.  
  
Q. Aubrey, when you got to that point, you were down three, you had the
ball, crowd behind you. Did you feel like maybe it was in the cards at that
point?  
AUBREY VANDIVER: Well, I don't know if it was in the cards. We felt like
because we had cut it, if we could just get a basket right there and cut it to
one, we had all the momentum for us. I think at that point we were feeling
pretty confident if we could just continue to push, we had a really good shot.  
To their credit, they pushed back and extended the lead once again.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll dismiss the student-athletes at this time and continue
with questions for Coach Legerski.  
  
Q. Joe, when you got off to the slow start offensively, you're still hanging
in there. Did you think it could be kind of a rough night shooting the ball so
you had to dig and claw? Did you kind of see this game turning into that
way?  
COACH LEGERSKI: You know, we have some tough nights shooting the basketball,
but yet that's who we are. We have to be able to step up.  
You take a look at the numbers. Even 60% from the free-throw line. We just
have to be better than that this time of year. That's the part that's
difficult.  
But for the most part this group stepped up. They made a lot of plays. Yet
tonight, when it was right down to it, I thought we passed up a couple shots
when we were making our run. I think the kids started wanting to really make
sure who had the ball and who was going to shoot the ball rather than just
playing how we were to get back into the basketball game.  
But, you know, it's definitely very difficult just to count on these two
seniors to be able to try to carry the load each and every night.  
As I said, I give New Mexico so much credit. They had four players in double-
digits. They were attacking you. When you look at the numbers, you can see
what kind of game this was tonight. It was very physical. It was a possession-
by-possession basketball game. I thought both teams really did a good job
defensively making it tough, and the numbers prove out that when it comes to
shooting percentages.  
  
Q. Never like to make the game about a call or official. That was a game
changer in the final minute on Aubrey. What did you see on this play?  
COACH LEGERSKI: I assume you're talking about the drive to the basket. It's
not about one call. It never is one way or the other.  
Player's playing hard, somebody going to the basket. It's either going to be a
block or a charge. Didn't go our way. Move on. That's the biggest thing. But I
never worry about a call here, a call there.  
  
Q. UNM attempted three more free throws than you. What were they doing that
drew more fouls?  
COACH LEGERSKI: I thought they were really aggressive. They were aggressive
getting to the basket. They put a lot of pressure on you. They have tremendous
quickness. Between Taylor, Patterson and Best, that puts a tremendous amount
of pressure on you when they can put the ball on the floor and get to the
basket.  
We tried to do the best not to foul, just try to be able to try to stay in
front of people. That was the difficult task tonight with our perimeter game.  
  
Q. How tough is it to see this group with four senior starters have a
similar outcome as it was last year?  
COACH LEGERSKI: Well, you know, it's always interesting. So much is placed
upon the tournament. I take a look at things and try to figure out, would I
rather be 8-22 coming in here or 22-8? We got to find ways.  
One of the things that I talk about is that New Mexico has developed a
tradition to win at the tournament. You do that with good players. They've
been able to do that. So for us, we're still trying to accomplish that. We've
been able to take it in steps, try to get competitive, try to win at home, try
to find ways to win on the road throughout the conference season.  
This is another big step that Wyoming is still trying to find. New Mexico does
an excellent job with that. They win throughout the year and they win in this
tournament.  
  
Q. Where do you go from here? You have some time off till the weekend. We
think you'll make the post-season. Where do you go from this point?  
COACH LEGERSKI: Right now we take some time off. We'll meet back together on
Monday. You know, it's a situation where this team's done enough to put them
in a post-season. For me personally, I'll be out recruiting. So it's a
situation to get out of here right away, just continue to try to improve this
program.  
We're losing some very good players, there's no doubt about that. We need to
keep striving to improve and really take a look at what some other programs in
our league are accomplishing and how they're getting it done and continue to
build.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.  
COACH LEGERSKI: Thank you, everybody.

_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

New Mexico  67  
Wyoming - 61

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by New Mexico. Coach, we'll start with your
general thoughts on tonight's game.  
COACH FLANAGAN: First of all, congratulations to Wyoming. They had a heck of a
season. They have some really difficult players to defend. They run their
offense extremely well.  
I thought probably the keys to our success was we really worked hard on not
allowing Kennedy to get a good three-point look. Second time we played them,
she had seven threes. She didn't score today. We did a good job. I don't know
whether she stopped shooting or we were really defending well. Either way, I
thought that was one of the keys.  
Vandiver is so hard to stop. We rotated people on her. Amanda guarded her for
a while. Porche guarded her for a while. Had another play guard her. She's
just a quality player, very difficult to defend. She can score on the outside
and the inside.  
We tried our best to defend her. She still gets 25. That's why she's
conference MVP. Carlson is tough. I thought Jess did a pretty good job on her.  
The whole game I thought we did a pretty good job of controlling the game up
until about four or five minutes to go, then they made a run, hit some threes,
hit some inside cuts. I was a little nervous there that we were not going to
respond.  
But we had a couple big plays. We're playing well right now. We're playing the
best we've played all season. We had players that played with a lot of poise.
So thankful for that.  
THE MODERATOR: Now we'll take questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. You played great defense all game. What were your thoughts, Porche had
two big blocks on Vandiver, what are your thoughts on those?  
AMANDA BEST: She's hard to guard, like coach said. We tried to battle her all
game. Like he said, she had 26 points on us. Those blocks and the charge at
the end was a very big momentum change. If she would have made those shots, it
could have been a different story, so those were huge.  
  
Q. Amanda, what did she say on the technical foul?  
AMANDA BEST: I don't know. Like I just saw her like yelling at Jasmine. So I
didn't really know. I was like, Ref, check it out. I didn't really know. She
was yelling, though. I don't know.  
  
Q. Jess, what is it about this place? You are 3-0 at this place this year.  
JESSICA KIELPINSKI: Well, I guess they call it Pit West, whatever. It's a home
away from home. I guess when we're here, we just gel together. I don't know,
it's the atmosphere or something. Something clicks when we're here.  
AMANDA BEST: I mean, the place is special. It's a place we played really well.
I think for this team, it's just us coming together at the right time. I think
that we could still play like this if we were at any other gym. We're playing
together, talking on defense, all staying really positive with each other. And
we all believe. When you have those things, I don't think it's really the
court. I think it's just our team.  
  
Q. Did you play like 28 practice games just to get to the tournament?  
AMANDA BEST: It pretty much seems like that, huh? We lost to Wyoming both
times we played them. Tonight, we were focused. We stayed together and stuff.  
Yeah, I guess you could maybe say that. We have a lot of young players on our
team. So it took this much time for us to figure out what we need to do.  
  
Q. Amanda, how much did it help that you had already played a game going
into this one?  
AMANDA BEST: I think it helped a lot and I also think playing against UNLV
also helped a lot, us getting used to the court, the rims and everything. I
feel like it's a disadvantage to have to come in after teams have already
played a couple of games because they're used to the court, the rims. They got
a win there, they have confidence. So I do think it's an advantage.  
  
Q. Jessica, now you have an off day. The starters have played a lot of
minutes. How badly is the off day needed?  
JESSICA KIELPINSKI: It's definitely needed. We need time to recover. We need
to refresh. I think mentally also we just need to, I guess, gather ourselves
and just prepare ourselves for the next game.  
Yeah, I think it's going to be helpful.  
AMANDA BEST: Personally I'd like to play them right now (laughter).  
  
Q. Both teams you've played so far swept you in the regular season. What's
different in the tournament?  
JESSICA KIELPINSKI: I guess, like Amanda said, it kind of took us all season
just to come together, understand each other as players, know that they're
going to help you out on a screen or something. We're gelling right now.
That's the biggest part about it, yeah.  
THE MODERATOR: At this time we'll dismiss our student-athletes and continue
with questions for Coach Flanagan.  
  
Q. How big was Porche on Vandiver and those blocks in the last two minutes
of the game?  
COACH FLANAGAN: Those were big. Also she tipped the ball a couple times. We
had an offensive possession. I think the separation was four points. She got
an offensive board. Two times she tipped it out. One time she grabbed it, one
time she tipped it out. Both of those retained our possession. We had some
time to run some clock.  
Jasmine shot a shot about five seconds off the clock when instead of pulling
it out a little bit. We're still suffering sometimes from not executing things
quite as well as we could. But, you know, that happens to every team. But
Porche did an excellent job.  
Now, we put three or four different people, rotated three or four different
people on her. Porche, I thought, did the best of everybody. I was just
worried that Porche would foul out. But she did a real nice job of staying in
the game.  
  
Q. Wyoming cut the lead to three late in the game. Crowd is on their side.
You call a timeout. What do you tell your team?  
COACH FLANAGAN: I thought it was four, but it was three, huh? I hope I didn't
tell 'em, We're only up by four.  
You know, I'm just trying to calm them down. I think the most important thing
is to have a calm, relaxed team. Then caution them about what they're going to
do. It wasn't too difficult to figure out what they were going to do. They
were going to go inside to Vandiver. What was happening a couple times was we
were helping off on players that weren't real scorers, like Sewell wasn't
really scoring that much. We helped off on her a couple times and left Carlson
open for shots. We had to take care of that business.  
The other thing was to help out as much as possible on Vandiver and try and
prevent the ball from getting into her.  
I thought we played her pretty well and she still gets, what, 25 or 26 points.
That's about as good as we can play her.  
  
Q. You were baffled by this team at times this year. How comfortable were
you coming into the tournament? Did these two games surprise you or did you
expect it?  
COACH FLANAGAN: No, I knew we were going to win. Honestly, I knew we were
going to win today. I really felt comfortable with that.  
Coming to the tournament, I didn't feel that comfortable because I only
brought one sport jacket (smiling). But I got different ties, so I'm okay.  
  
Q. The start of the second half seemed like you got a couple of threes that
changed the momentum of the game.  
COACH FLANAGAN: We got a cushion where we could be comfortable. I thought
Lauren played a good game not only offensively but defensively. She was on
Kennedy for a period of time. I thought she played her very well and hustled.  
Then, you know, in transition, she hit one, might have hit two, then Best hit
one. All of a sudden we're playing relaxed, we're feeling comfortable, we're
thinking in a positive way.  
We were baffled, going back. The first time we played Wyoming, I mean, we
couldn't figure out where the screens were coming from. They were getting
layup after layup, and it wasn't just Vandiver, it was everybody on their team
was getting good shots.  
But we had a young team there. They didn't really understand all the screening
that takes place in the Mountain West. So we've adapted quite well over the
season. But it's taken us a while to really get pretty good at this.  
I think we're defending pretty well right now.  
  
Q. Last night you said you were glad you played a game. Now you played two.
Do you have twice as much of an advantage Friday?  
COACH FLANAGAN: You know, with the way they set up this tournament, I think
it's a disadvantage to the teams that are sitting and waiting. Even if it
isn't, I'm telling our team they're at a disadvantage. We're going to play
that card. This is Vegas. We're playing that card as long as we can play that
card.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit more about Jasmine, how impressed you are with
her performance in her first tournament.  
COACH FLANAGAN: Jasmine, you know, she's a unique kid. I don't know whether
it's true -- I'm sure she has emotions, but I'm never seeing them. She's very
relaxed. She'll make a big play. She doesn't miss situations where you'd think
that a freshman would be nervous. Her breakaway layup on a press breaker, you
know, a lot of kids might miss that layup. Her steal and layup.  
She's a quality player that competes very hard and she's learning. She's gonna
be a heck of a player when she gets her skill up. I keep saying that. But when
she really gets skillful, she's going to be a very difficult player to stop
because she's got a pull-up, she's got a three. She really doesn't dribble
that well. She's so fast, she dribbles by people. Then she defends. She's a
good defender. All of those things are quality.  
She's a nice kid. She's a quality kid, too. I'm really fortunate that I have a
chance to coach her.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.  
COACH FLANAGAN: Thank you.

THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Air Force. Coach, we'll start with your general
comments on tonight's game.  
COACH WILLIAMS: Disappointed in the outcome with us coming on the short end.
But very proud of my Falcons, the way we fought back even when we were down
more than we wanted to be. As it shows, we were ready to put our press back
on, try to get some stops, some turnovers, hit the three ball, make it
interesting trying to cut it to 10.  
They never quit. They just kept playing. They kept believing. We're going to
find a way to score.  
Just coming up on the short end. That's a good quality team in Utah. But very
proud of my Falcons.  
THE MODERATOR: At this time we'll open it up to questions for the student-
athletes.  
  
Q. Raimee, talk about that scoring slump you had. You were tied at halftime,
a long time without scoring after that. Did they do anything differently in
the second half?  
RAIMEE BECK: It was frustrating. We weren't getting any stops. When we're not
getting stops and not scoring, that's what happens.  
Just things were not going our way. They were buckling down on defense. It was
rough there for a few minutes. That's what really hurt us throughout the game.  
Everybody left it out on the court. I'm thankful for that, for my team for
doing that.  
  
Q. Another thing that was a theme in the second half was their size took
over. How tough is that for you as a team?  
RAIMEE BECK: We've always been undersized. We're used to that. We just got to
push back harder. Boxing out, pushing back. You know, we were starting to get
a little tired at the end of the game. Their size is overtaking us a little.  
We never stopped fighting. That's what our mentality was all year, so...  
  
Q. In general, what was your experience like, your last go-around? Sum up
what the last couple days have meant for you.  
RAIMEE BECK: It was a great experience. You know, the team and the coaches,
just getting that first win was a great way to end my year, my career. So I'm
thankful for that, for how much my team went out there and left it all on the
court.  
  
Q. Megan, in the second half, you come out tied, how disappointing was it to
come out and not hit many shots?  
MEGAN MUÑIZ: Yeah, it was rough to go through that drought. We didn't really
notice it. Just those rebounds really killed us. We couldn't score. It was
hard to come back after getting going after like 10 minutes, but we tried.  
  
Q. You're going to miss Raimee a lot, but you have just about everybody
coming back. How excited are you for the future?  
MEGAN MUÑIZ: We're excited. We have one senior, obviously, and one junior.
We're pretty young. We have a lot of kids coming in. We're excited to get
working. We're excited for the future.  
  
Q. Did the younger players think you were peaking at the end of the year?
How much did that help going into next year?  
MEGAN MUÑIZ: Yeah, we got a lot of confidence throughout the year with all the
time we got. We came together as a team. We kind of started peaking at the
end, I'd say, yeah.  
THE MODERATOR: At this time we'll dismiss our student-athletes and continue
with questions for Coach Williams.  
  
Q. Is there anything you can really do when they offensive rebound so
well?  
COACH WILLIAMS: You keep telling them to dig in, dig in and push back. Maybe
you get a call here or there.  
Again, we've been undersized all year. It just kind of broke the straw on the
back when we weren't scoring, then the easy putbacks for them when you are
6'2", 6'3".  
Again, trying to do some things, but we're not scoring, it's going to be a
little bit more difficult. For being that big, my team never quit. That's a
good sign to see.  
But, again, we need to get a little more physical in back-to-back games. Might
take its toll a little bit. We had everything we had, our hands full with
Colorado State yesterday.  
I think just got to dig in and work on boxing out a little bit more.  
  
Q. I know how excited you are about the future. You do need size. Is that on
the way?  
COACH WILLIAMS: We got a recruiting coordinator, a lot of people interested in
serving their country, so it makes for a great combination. We're out there
looking all across the country.  
But quality ball players. We know our style of play doesn't have to be just
big in our league to do some things well. We're finding some good-quality
athletes.  
  
Q. As a coach, did you notice any difference between the first and second
half?  
COACH WILLIAMS: Just missing shots. You're going to go to your go-to players,
Alicia. After the first game, she might be a little bit tired. Dymond, they're
going to do everything they can to frustrate her, take her out of her one on
one. We need Kelsey to step up, Raimee to step up with some threes and relieve
that pressure.  
You have to ride that horse. You have to keep going back to Alicia. We sat her
for a little bit to get her wind back, put her back out on the floor to do
some things in driving.  
But when we go in a drought, it can be ugly. We've been in droughts before.
But then as you see, the spurtability we had at the end, bring up the press.
We only have six, seven minutes, try to take them over, take them out of their
game plan, cut it to ten, then just keep believing, anything can happen.  
Again, the Falcons don't quit. I think that's what you want from your service
academy is some Fighting Falcons for the future.  
The scoring drought, we have to find some other people to step up. Again,
we're young. We'll work on that.  
  
Q. How much is the experience of getting a win here help you going into next
year?  
COACH WILLIAMS: We were going for double-digit wins. That's one of the
Raimee's mini goals. I'd like to win double-digits, coach. The future is
bright. We won't have the deer in the headlights. You have sophomores that can
mentor the freshmen and know what it's like with their academic load and what
they're doing. Yes, we do EIs, study hard on the road when we're trying to win
in the Mountain West tournament.  
Our junior will be a senior, and our sophomore class will step up and be
juniors. We're excited about the addition of the new team coming in and we're
excited about the team leaving. So the future looks great for us.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much, coach.  
COACH WILLIAMS: Thank you.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 9, 2011

  

### [Janita Badon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21839)

### [Anthony Levrets](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21838)

### [Michelle Plouffe](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21840)

  
_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

Utah  70  
Air Force - 55

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by the University of Utah. Coach, just some
general comments on today's game.  
COACH LEVRETS: First of all, a lot of credit to Air Force Academy and Andrea
and her staff and those players of revitalizing that program. They are getting
better all the time. I'm glad we don't have to play them again this year.  
But I'm really proud of our kids, the way we defended in that second half is
what that group of kids is all about. Really proud of them. Happy to still be
playing, that's for sure.  
THE MODERATOR: At this time we'll open it up for questions for the student-
athletes.  
  
Q. You did a much better job rebounding in the second half as opposed to the
first. Was that talked about at halftime?  
MICHELLE PLOUFFE: Just our defense was what was talked about at halftime. They
were shooting almost 50%. That was not okay with us. Part of that was
rebounding, and not letting them get second shots.  
So we came out and defended them pretty good in the second half.  
  
Q. Could you talk about the 18-2 run that opened the second half.  
JANITA BADON: I'd like to think our team specializes in defense. Once we get
the defensive part down, then our offense is easier. So, yeah, it's defense
then offense, but both together.  
MICHELLE PLOUFFE: Yeah, I think it starts on defense. Once we can put some
straps together, we're able to get shots on the other end and knock 'em down,
so...  
  
Q. You have a rematch with BYU. What do you need to do differently Friday?  
JANITA BADON: I just think we need to focus on ourselves rather than the other
team. Just look at film tonight and see what we did wrong and what we can do
better, then just play ball I guess.  
MICHELLE PLOUFFE: Yeah, just play the whole 40 minutes. Last couple times we
played them, there were four-minute gaps that we let them go on a little run.
We've got to play two full 20-minute halves without letting up, so...  
  
Q. Are you feeling you're on a roll then?  
MICHELLE PLOUFFE: I think anytime we play BYU, I don't know, we always come
out and know it's going to be a fight. I think it's definitely going to be
this time. We're just excited for the next game, so...  
JANITA BADON: I think with any team that just won two games in a row, they'll
be on a roll. Hopefully it helps us, 'cause we're a really young team. But no
excuses.  
  
Q. Janita, talk about the rhythm you're in, the feeling you have playing in
the post-season.  
JANITA BADON: I'm the type of player that I don't like to focus on myself. I
just think once our team comes together, nothing I wouldn't do for them. I'm
giving them my all because they're giving me their all.  
  
Q. With BYU, they do have the bigs inside. They seem to be a pretty good
perimeter team. In the past they run Rodrigues around the perimeter as well as
yourself. How do you adjust to that?  
MICHELLE PLOUFFE: I think that will just be game plan and execution on defense
and execution. Also going down and executing on the offensive side as well,
so...  
THE MODERATOR: We'll dismiss our student-athletes at this time and continue
with questions for coach Levrets.  
  
Q. I know each year is different, but you're now 33-0 against Air Force.  
COACH LEVRETS: I had no idea.  
  
Q. Is that indicative of anything?  
COACH LEVRETS: It's indicative of the fact that we play pretty good defense in
the second half. Last year's team for Air Force and our team last year,
completely different. Every time you step on the floor against a team, it's a
different basketball game.  
I don't think it's indicative of anything except of this game and how we
played.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about the rematch with BYU, maybe where your
team is different and what you need to do better.  
COACH LEVRETS: You know, both times against BYU, the first time it was about a
three-point game about six minutes to go. We didn't score, and they did. We
fouled them. They made their free throws. The margin was way bigger.  
The second time, we had the ball with four seconds to go and passed up a three
that would have tied the game if we would have made it. It was a three-point
game.  
They're really good. You don't go 15-1 in this league and not be really good.
They have size. They have athleticism. They shoot the basketball well. They're
led by seniors. They've done an incredible job this year.  
We'll go out and make a couple tweaks. At this time of the year it's not about
adjustments really. You have to make a couple adjustments. It's about going
out and playing, executing what you've done for now for us will be our 33rd
game and making sure and trying to make sure that we're as good at our stuff
as we can possibly be, and that's got to be enough.  
  
Q. Can you talk about what you talked to the team about at halftime.  
COACH LEVRETS: We are one of the youngest teams in the country. When we
started this deal, everybody told me we weren't going to be able to defend. I
said, yes, we are, or else we'll have no chance. Even before I got here, this
program is built on defense. If you guard every single possession, you have a
chance to win games.  
Give Air Force a lot of credit. They were on a roll. They played aggressively
and confidently in the first half, made shots. But we talked about what it
means to have that Utah across your chest. If we're going to win basketball
games, you better guard somebody. That was the message. Apparently they got
it.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.  
COACH LEVRETS: Thank you.

### [Sam Martin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21827)

### [Kim Mestdagh](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19428)

  
_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

Air Force  66  
Colorado State - 63

  
THE MODERATOR: We're ready to begin with CSU. At this time, coach, if you
could give your general comments on today's game.  
COACH HOLT: Well, I thought Air Force played a very good game, very scrappy.
They took us out of our rhythm. We really couldn't get in one.  
I thought we did pretty good coming out in the second half, got some buckets,
went ahead a few times. But I give them a lot of credit. I thought they made
plays when they needed to. Of course, No. 2, she took care of us today. We
just didn't play real good defense, I didn't think. Normally we're a pretty
hustle, scrappy, anticipating the next pass type of team. We were on our heels
today. We looked a little bit shellshocked.  
But, again, I give Air Force a lot of credit. They played a great game.  
THE MODERATOR: At this time we'll open it up to questions for the student-
athletes.  
  
Q. What made Alicia so dominant today? What was she able to do tonight?  
SAM MARTIN: She definitely penetrated really well. She would do a little pull-
back, get us on our heels, take it to the hoop. We didn't have our layers of
defense. We weren't in sync in our defense. She just got by everyone. As a
team we just couldn't guard her today.  
  
Q. Kim, why were you so out of sync defensively? Was there something
particular that Air Force was doing or just an off day?  
KIM MESTDAGH: I really think they were a lot more aggressive this game than
the previous other games. They were making really tough shots. They were just
playing really well.  
We didn't really have an answer for what they did.  
  
Q. Kim, you accomplished so many good things this season. Does this take
away from that some? How do you balance out what happened today versus all the
good you've done this season?  
KIM MESTDAGH: They picked us 8 to finish. We finished 4th. I think that's
already a big accomplishment.  
Of course, getting a little further in the tournament would have been great. I
mean, we had a pretty good season. I think we can be proud of that.  
THE MODERATOR: At this time we'll dismiss the student-athletes and continue
with questions for Coach Holt.  
  
Q. Coach, how much better is Air Force right now than they were a year
ago?  
COACH HOLT: Oh, much improved. You know, they've got a lot of different
weapons and ways to score. You know, I think other than our game at home,
their game at their place was a tough, tough game. Their crowd was difficult
to play against.  
But, you know, I really think they're improved, very much so, since last year.  
  
Q. Same thing I asked Kim. There were so many things, you finished way ahead
of where you were supposed to, you lose one of your best players partway
through the season. How much does this detract from that or does it?  
COACH HOLT: Well, I mean, you come into a tournament and you're a 4th seed. To
lose out like this is extremely disappointing. I think every team that comes
to this tournament has aspirations of winning it. Certainly we did.  
But, like I told the players, this group has been so fun to coach. We have
overcome so much adversity. We had five players this year that were either
redshirt, medical redshirts, one left the team in the middle of the year, and
these kids, we basically played with one post player the whole conference.  
We live by a motto of 'no excuses.' We played like that all year. I know we
grew as a program. It's something certainly we have to build on for next year.  
But I couldn't ask for a greater bunch of kids. I love coming to work every
day.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much, Coach.  
COACH HOLT: Thank you.

_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

Utah  55  
UNLV - 44

  
THE MODERATOR: We're ready to begin with UNLV. Coach, if we could start with
some general comments on today's game.  
COACH OLIVIER: We ended the season with Utah. We knew we had them first in the
tournament. We knew it was going to be a battle. The last game was very, very
physical. It was pretty much a defensive game. We knew that. We talked about
it. They just came out ahead this time.  
I'm just really proud of our student-athletes and our players for, you know,
keeping it together. It's been a hard season. But they never stopped working
hard. They never stopped playing together. Hopefully next year things will be
better.  
THE MODERATOR: At this time we'll open it up for questions for the student-
athletes.  
  
Q. Erica, Badon guarding, what problems did she present for you guys?  
ERICA HELMS: I thought she penetrated our zone well. But down the stretch, we
kind of contained her. She just made plays. She had her teammates step up. She
just kind of penetrated and kicked. Looking to score much, so...  
  
Q. Erica, can you talk about your emotions after your final game as a
senior.  
ERICA HELMS: (Tearing up) It's the last game.  
COACH OLIVIER: I'm going to speak for her for a second so she can gather her
thoughts.  
I'm going to tell you one thing about Erica Helms. She always gives 100%.
She's a fighter. She will do anything for her teammates. She just is very,
very competitive. We're going to miss everything about her.  
It's kind of a team joke, she brings a craziness that our team will miss.
That's supposed to make you smile. She leaves it all on the floor. You can
tell by how she's answering this question. She's going to miss us as much as
we're going to miss her. She has done great things for this program. Scored
over a thousand points the other day. Keeping us doing what we're supposed to
do as one of our leaders. We're going to miss her.  
ERICA HELMS: I just thought as a group we played hard. Everyone didn't give
up. I think I just left it all on the floor the last game.  
  
Q. Jamie, with all the missed free throws the team had today, was there a
concern that you would pay the price? How frustrating was it? I mean,
layups.  
COACH OLIVIER: We shot 83%. That's a good day for us.  
  
Q. Layups.  
JAMIE SMITH: The missed layups, we were just going hard into the basket. Calls
weren't going our way. But we can't ever worry about the refs, it's all about
us finishing.  
I mean, we definitely paid for it with a loss. But I just think their defense
was really good. They probably just like really contained us. We had a lot of
missed layups, but that just shows we were going hard to the basket.  
  
Q. Jamie, the technical in the second half, can you talk about what
happened, what the ref saw?  
JAMIE SMITH: Yeah, I mean, that's just frustration. That comes with
basketball. I think that I just feel that our team was going so hard and we
just weren't getting as many calls. I think, I mean, I'll take the blame for
that. I'm not proud of getting a technical. I mean, it's not a good thing. But
I just was going as hard as I could. The frustration just came with it.  
COACH OLIVIER: And, again, in that instance, I think, again, Jamie was doing a
really good job blocking out. She was playing against a player that was a lot
bigger than her. It was getting really physical in there. That's a good thing.
I mean, we showed a lot of fight. I thought we represented the university in a
great manner. Frustration got the best of us there. But I don't think that
made a difference at all. I thought actually it kind of inspired us, kind of
sparked us, made us fight that much harder. It showed how much we care.  
These two, along with their 11 teammates, they all care so much and they all
want to do so much. If I had to say anything, that sometimes gets in the way
because they're pleasers and they fight so hard. We just have to learn how to
play together as a team a little more - in a good way, not a bad way, in a
good way.  
THE MODERATOR: At this time I'll excuse the student-athletes and we'll
continue with questions for Coach Olivier.  
  
Q. Not only the missed layups, but the 17.5% shooting, do you almost feel
like you gave this game away?  
COACH OLIVIER: No. We talked about it in the locker room obviously. Utah,
they're very, very physical. Our plan was to take it hard to the basket. You
asked about layups missed. That showed we were doing what we were supposed to
do. We wanted to get good, high-percentage shots. Again, Utah is very
physical. They weren't happy with what happened the other day. Neither were
we. We were fighting.  
But it just didn't go our way. We didn't get as many fouls as maybe we thought
we would get inside. We talked about making our free throws this time around.
We beat them last time by not making our free throws. They stuck with the game
plan. We wanted to get easy shots. We got some easy shots. We just didn't
finish.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about the last two minutes of the game. Erica
hit two free throws to tie it up, then the three. Was that the momentum
changer?  
COACH OLIVIER: Well, I mean, yeah, it definitely was. Rodrigues is someone we
talked about. She's a great player. She hits those open shots. Badon does a
really good job of penetrating and dishing to her.  
That definitely put a little damper on our mood. But, you know, again, I
thought we continued to fight. We got the ball inside a couple times. Didn't
get the foul like we were trying to do. We were trying to take, like I said, a
high-percentage shot.  
But we battled. You know, for us to get 21 offensive boards, I thought, again,
we battled. But Utah's a good team. They've been here before. They won the
tournament last year. Badon is a great leader for them. You kind of got to
give it up for what Utah did. I thought they battled and did a very good job
today.  
And we're right in the game. We're shooting 17%. That's amazing. So as much as
I'm giving it up for them, I thought we played some great defense. We really
battled.  
  
Q. You mentioned Badon. Talk about how difficult she was to defend.  
COACH OLIVIER: Yeah. You know, I actually thought our team did a good job of
containing her somewhat. I mean, you're never going to be able to totally
contain her.  
Where she really killed us is her rebounds. She made sure they got second and
third attempts. A point guard gets 17 rebounds. Think about that. It's crazy.  
But, again, she got turned over. She turned it over a couple times. I thought
our defense was aggressive. They obviously were ready for our traps more this
time around.  
She's a great player. You're never going to be able to totally contain someone
like Badon. She's too quick, too explosive. Like Erica said, she makes her
teammates around her better. She gets some clean looks.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Erica's performance. She led the team with 14 points.
She showed a lot of heart in her last game.  
COACH OLIVIER: I just thought that was interesting, too, when you asked her.  
  
Q. I'm sorry about that.  
COACH OLIVIER: No, I thought it was great. Erica is amazing in our eyes. I
mean, Erica, she's amazing. She's a mother right now. She has a focus that's
undeniable. Like you said, her heart is as big as can be. We're going to
really miss her heart. And we're going to miss all four seniors.  
Karla doesn't play a lot, but Karla works her tail off every single day she
comes in practice. We're so proud of Karla. Kalie, too. They're all hard
workers. India came in. I thought she did some great things today. Erica is
probably the one that gets more minutes out of the group. Erica leaves it out
on the floor. She's going to give you everything she possibly has. That's what
she did today and that's why she had so much emotion.  
But these ladies are going to come back and cheer us on. They're a Rebel for
life. We're going to use this season to motivate us for next year and we feel
strongly about that.  
  
Q. Probably wasn't the season you had in mind, but talk about some of the
positives, what can you take into next year?  
COACH OLIVIER: Again, we were always looking for some positives this year. I
think the biggest thing, you know, I have a great staff that works extremely
hard. With that said, the players, they come in every day. They want to get
better. They focus. They work hard. It's not like, you know, downerville. And
it's hard. It's hard when you lose as many games as we did.  
When you look at our season, we had I want to say eight or nine games where we
lost by eight or fewer points. That's a complete different season if all of a
sudden you win some of those games.  
Some of it is, you know, what I need to do, do a better job just down the
stretch, making sure we execute better as a group. Some of it is our
leadership on the floor. As much as I feel like Jamie is a great leader and
does so many positive things, we need basketball leaders to step up, too.  
For us as a group, there's a lot of things we're going to get better at. But
our free throws, it's funny, because when you said free throws, we shot 82%.
Two years ago when we took over this program, we were last in the conference
in free-throw percentage. This year we were 1 or 2. We were 1 or 2 in steals.
We did a lot of good things.  
Now we need to be consistent at what we do and get some wins early so we can
have confidence to be successful in this conference. This conference is a
very, very good conference. Utah is a good basketball team. Their record is
15-16. We're right in there with TCU. BYU is a two-possession game with under
two minutes.  
We feel like we were close, but we just weren't good enough. Hopefully we can
take that on to next year and get better and build from it.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.  
COACH OLIVIER: Thank you.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2011

  

### [Beth Burns](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13834)

  
_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

New Mexico  65  
San Diego State - 57

  
THE MODERATOR: We're ready to begin with San Diego State. Coach, just some
general comments on tonight's game.  
COACH BURNS: Sure. First we'd like to congratulate New Mexico. They're a tough
out. We've had two really competitive games that could have gone either way
throughout the season. Certainly, you know, they got the better of us today.  
I knew it was going to be a really physical game, very competitive game.
Nothing about it really surprised me. We did our best. We worked as hard as we
could. They were just the better team today, for sure.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll open it up for questions for the student-athletes. No
questions. We'll excuse the student-athletes and continue with questions for
Coach Burns.  
  
Q. Obviously Jessika Bradley didn't play tonight. How big of a factor do you
think that was? Why did she not play?  
COACH BURNS: You were at both games? How big of a factor do you think it
played? Senior all-conference player.  
You know what, I'm not a professional basketball coach. I'm a college
basketball coach, helping with a wonderful staff to hopefully raise 18- to
22-year-olds.  
Jessika is a big part of everything we've accomplished. I hate for her that it
has to end on this note. But there's a lot of parents in the room. You got to
do what you got to do, own up to it, and move forward.  
  
Q. We were told there was a violation of team rules. Is that accurate?  
COACH BURNS: Perfect.  
  
Q. Was there a point where you thought you were a little out of rhythm, out
of flow? Were you happy with the fact you seemed to be able to go toe-to-toe
but missing some layups, getting a little gassed at the end?  
COACH BURNS: You know how it is. Your rotations, everything's different, you
got a day, all you can do is your best.  
I think Paris probably maybe mentally, emotionally, it's a lot to handle. I
think that can work against you. It worked against them senior night. Our
senior night, I mean, you couldn't have laid a bigger egg, and kids couldn't
have tried harder. I think J.B. and Paris combined were like 5 of 29. She
tried too hard. She felt great responsibility to get something done. She
short-armed stuff. Credit to New Mexico. Wasn't like she was alone out there.  
We have two big bodies. She's by herself with a big body. She did wear down.
But I think emotion coming into it might have played a part. Who knows.  
Amanda Best has been playing great basketball. What a great representative of
our league, of what college basketball's about. If you could have seen her at
the Air Force game the other night, she's remarkable.  
I knew that as good as Sajoyia Griffin is and helps us, I had to get her out
and put in a bigger defender so we could switch more and try to counter some
things.  
Our offense wasn't as good. I felt if we didn't stay within spitting distance,
we didn't have a chance. It was so hard for us to score. I was just really
trying to prevent separation.  
  
Q. How do you sum up the season? Good, bad? Right, wrong? Pretty, ugly? How
do you sum up the year? Can you emote how you're feeling in terms of some high
hopes, how it all turned out?  
COACH BURNS: This season is unsumupable. Is that a correct phrase? I was an
education major, too (smiling). But this season is unsumupable. You can't
imagine what we have endured. We've had staff changes, people get sick, all
the periphery things. It's just been one of those. That trickles down to your
athletes. I think it affected everybody.  
No excuses. It is what it is. As my good friend Coach Fisher once said, You
know, some years are just like this. I looked at him and I said, Yeah, but
some years are just like yours and I'm looking forward to having one more like
that because that seems like a lot more fun.  
Look, there are 12 women's professional basketball teams. Jené Morris was a
first-round draft pick. Not that it's hard to make an NBA roster. She was a
first-round draft pick that made the team. Quenese Davis has 407 more assists
than anyone who ever played at San Diego State. The beginning of the year a
point guard gets ineligible. We already were thin. Coco did a great job. But
it changed everything that we did.  
If you ask any coach in America, if you're down to your last two picks whether
you take a guard or a big, as talented as your bigs are, all season long we
had young guards and all season long, on the court, that was kind of the story
of the season.  
I'm's disappointed when we're not successful, but I'm not surprised. Yes,
excited as can be that we have two redshirts. The five kids we signed early,
because of the Sweet 16, the best living rooms we've gotten into at this
point. We will be back. Let's not have any funerals for the Aztecs. We will be
back.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.  
COACH BURNS: Thank you, everybody. Good luck.

_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

New Mexico  65  
San Diego State - 57

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by New Mexico. Coach, start with general thoughts
on tonight's game.  
COACH FLANAGAN: Well, first of all, I thought San Diego State really played a
very physical, strong game. Very difficult to defend them. Got a good inside
game. We were quite worried about transition offense. I don't think they got
any hoops off of us transition. Did a nice job there. We didn't run the
prettiest of offense because of their pressure.  
But down the stretch, I thought we played with a lot of poise. I thought our
defense was quite good throughout the evening. As I said, they're very
difficult to defend. Have a lot of athletic kids. Got long and tall kids. So
it was a tough group to defend.  
But I thought we did a great job. And we shot our free throws very well.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll open it up for questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Amanda, what do you think is the biggest difference tonight between what
you did the first two times you played them?  
AMANDA BEST: I think we came out really prepared and we really wanted to win
this game. Everybody was on the same page. I feel like we had so much energy.
Everybody was on, like I said, the same page. When you have everybody focused,
wanting the same common goal, we accomplished it, so...  
  
Q. Jessica, you hit two big threes during the run in the first half. Talk
about that run.  
JESSICA KIELPINSKI: I think that run was really big for us just 'cause we were
all playing -- I think at the beginning we were a little bit flustered. With
the run, I think we kind of gained a little bit of composure. It kind of set
us off that, Hey, we have a chance at this. We're going to run with it, go
with it. I think that fired us up quite a bit.  
  
Q. Are you worried at all about being a little gassed tomorrow? As far as
the bench was a little thin tonight, you were asked to play a lot of minutes.
You don't worry about tomorrow if you don't win today. Yet, are you just a tad
bit concerned about that? You too young to worry about that kind of stuff?  
AMANDA BEST: Jess and I, every game this could be our last game. I know both
of us have some energy. We'll give it our all. We're going to take some ice
baths tonight so we'll be prepared.  
  
Q. Jess, talk about playing their bigs. You were aggressive attacking the
basket. Was that something you focused on?  
JESSICA KIELPINSKI: Yeah, I think I just was able to play my game. Against
like taller posts, I guess it's more -- I guess I'm able to play in my comfort
zone a lot more easily than a quicker guard or something or post.  
I just try to push 'em out, not let 'em post up. I guess that's the biggest
thing. I just hustled and I played like it could be my last game and I left it
all out on the floor.  
  
Q. Amanda, what is it like playing as the No. 7 seed in the tournament this
year?  
AMANDA BEST: I don't really look at seeding. I just look at the opponent we're
going to play. To me, everybody is on the same playing field. It might help
you as far as positioning, you might get a couple games off. I'd rather play
four games than sit around and have to play the last game, so...  
THE MODERATOR: At this time we'll dismiss the student-athletes and open it up
for questions for Coach Flanagan.  
  
Q. Don, the second half wasn't your normal substitution pattern. Was it just
a matter of win or go home and you were going to stay with the people who
brought you?  
COACH FLANAGAN: My idea prior to the game was to rotate players in and out.
That went out the window very early in that game. I was at a point where I
felt comfortable with certain players and uncomfortable with some players. I
like to normally rotate more kids. My intent was to do that.  
With that game being the way it was, I just felt like we'd have a better
advantage if we restricted some of the substitutions. Then as the game
progressed in the second half, I thought nerves would be a factor if I started
substituting too much. Of course, Porche fouled out there. Jordan did a nice
job while she was in, but she was in briefly.  
I would have liked to have played a lot more players, especially since we have
a game tomorrow.  
  
Q. Could you talk a little bit about Jasmine's performance tonight.  
COACH FLANAGAN: Well, Jasmine was having some problems early on getting free.
They did a nice job defending her, bumping her cuts, being real physical with
her, trying to deny the ball to her.  
But Jasmine is a scorer. She has a way of scoring. She has a way of - I don't
know what it is - but she can score in bunches. Once she starts scoring, she
gets that confidence. Really, she's a player that has some limitations skill-
wise 'cause she hasn't really worked on parts of her game, but she's a heck of
a competitor with a great shot. She's pretty fast, too.  
  
Q. Staying on Jasmine for a second, on a lighter note, even before the tip,
I was watching her in the starting lineup. She went to the center and she
didn't know where to go after she shook hands with Coco Davis. She had to wait
till she was told where to go. This is a young team. You looked at that when
that happened and laughed. Can you talk about that, nerves going into this
game.  
COACH FLANAGAN: When you're playing in a tournament situation, you know, we
played a regular season, so you feel like they're probably poised at that
point. But then they get in a tournament situation, it's just like the
beginning of the year again, beginning of a season again.  
Yeah, she did make me laugh. Jas is a great kid. Has a great smile, great
attitude, and is a competitive person. She doesn't really like to be
embarrassed. That's why we laughed a little bit.  
But she's starting to relax a little bit now. Freshmen a lot of times
throughout the year you don't get much from them, you don't get to know them
too well. We're starting to see her personality surface. Of course, the fans
are starting to see her talent surface.  
  
Q. Late in the game it seemed like rather than try to set up your offense
and perhaps take some fouls you did some long passes, really attacked the
basket. Was that by design?  
COACH FLANAGAN: It was probably lucky (smiling). No, just kidding.  
We actually wanted to go at them. It appeared like they got a little tired at
CSU. I don't know if that was true, but the second half was not one of their
great second halves. I felt like we could run them a little bit. We felt like
she would not substitute as much as we were going to, and it turned out to be
exactly the opposite. I didn't substitute much and she substituted pretty
freely.  
That really didn't work. But we continued to run at them. If we run a press
breaker, get it to Jas, we don't give her any rules. We say, Go as fast as you
can to the basket. That's it.  
  
Q. A quick turnaround for tomorrow. What becomes critical against Wyoming?  
COACH FLANAGAN: Well, the one thing we have going for us is that we played a
game in the tournament, we won, and we're confident, and we feel better about
ourselves. Maybe Wyoming, having not played in the tournament, could be a
little bit nervous and have some nerves early.  
I don't expect that to happen because Wyoming has a lot of veteran players. At
the same time, it could happen.  
We're going to play hard no matter what. It is unfortunate that I played so
few players and I played people like Jas 40 minutes. I can't do that tomorrow.
But the most important thing I think that we have to do with them is, last
time we played them, I think they had 48 threes. No, it wasn't quite that
many, but it was a lot (smiling).  
We have to make sure we don't let them get set on the arc. We have to run them
off the arc. I think that's real important, make them be drivers. Then
rebounding is going to be important. Vandiver is the most important player in
the conference and she's difficult to handle. If you play her with a guard,
she powers a guard. If you play her with a post, she goes outside, gets all
the screens, gets an open three. She's a very difficult player to play.  
We're just hoping that we play harder than they do and maybe not give them so
many threes and make them put it on the floor a little bit more. It's not
going to be a complex game plan. We don't have time for that.  
  
Q. Your teams are 21-6 overall in conference tournament play. What is it
about the tournament that makes your teams perform so well?  
COACH FLANAGAN: We had some runs where we were going 3-0 and won the
tournament, I don't know, two or three years in a row. That gave us a great
record right there. But we've always been pretty good at the end of the year.  
I don't know. I like March tournaments for some reason. I think our players
like March tournaments. Usually our players feel like they want to play some
more games at this time of the year. They're not burned out. They're pretty
happy with playing together and getting that camaraderie. They just want to
play hard.  
I try and take all the pressure off of them by not being too demanding at this
time. I'm more relaxed at this time probably because I see the end of the
season coming, too, so I'm a little bit more relaxed.  
But I don't know what it is, but we have been successful at these tournaments.  
  
Q. Other than Jasmine, who else did you see tonight that you like that
played? Also talk about the senior leadership tonight.  
COACH FLANAGAN: Well, I think Jessica played an excellent game. Paris Johnson
is a very difficult player to defend. I thought she was physical with her. I
thought she did a nice job.  
Her stepping out and shooting threes really were big. We wanted to do that a
bit. We felt if we could bring Johnson out, even if we didn't hit the threes,
at least we got her out of the middle and we could drive a little bit.  
Then, of course, I thought Amanda Best played a great game. Although she
turned the ball over too many times, at the same time she was the main person
that could bring the ball up. We were having some problems bringing the ball
up for a while there. Nobody wanted to bring it up. We had to go and make sure
Jess set the ball screen in the backcourt because Johnson didn't want to
switch out on that.  
Amanda did a lot of work. She did a whole bunch of work in that game. Probably
got a ton of rebounds, too. Probably got double figures in rebounds, I would
think she did. She's been doing that. She's a well-conditioned players. So
those three players were the primary players.  
I thought Lauren did a nice job of getting the ball in play on the press.
That's a difficult job when you have somebody in your face. They continue to
put that pressure on you. They're quicker than we are. So she did a good job
of delivering the ball to the right person.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.  
COACH FLANAGAN: Thank you.

_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

Air Force  66  
Colorado State - 63

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by the Air Force Academy. Coach, if we could start
with your general thoughts on today's game.  
COACH WILLIAMS: Oh, it was a phenomenal game. It was going to be a good rival
game with the in-state rival. Our team was fired up and focused. Put it all
together at the right time. It's just one of those things we wanted to show
what we could do for the year, beat Colorado State this time. Third time's a
charm for us.  
THE MODERATOR: At this time we'll take questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Your three-pointer that gave you the lead that turned out to be the
winning points, how confident did you feel on that shot?  
RAIMEE BECK: Well, they started zoning us. They did it about two possessions
before. I was like, you know what, this is perfect for me, a great
opportunity. I love to shoot threes. We swung the ball around about twice.
That third time I was like, I'm going to shoot it, she's giving me enough
room.  
I shot it. I think I made one before. That one I was like, Please, let this
one go in if any of them go in. It went in, so I was pretty happy.  
  
Q. It seems like every time I talk to you it's about some point in your
career. What does it mean to you to win a game here and be a huge part of
it?  
RAIMEE BECK: You know, every time we've come, either it's been in the play-in
game or tournament game and we've lost and it's been pretty frustrating. We're
always looking forward to this point in the year.  
Coming out this year, getting this first win that I've ever had in a
tournament, in the Mountain West Conference, has been amazing. It's precious.
I've told you that before. Getting a win with this program is precious. It's
really going to help this program in the future.  
I think this win is great. I'm looking forward to see what the program does in
the future. Hopefully we'll win again, UNLV or Utah. We'll see.  
  
Q. Alicia, what was it that you were able to do tonight in this game? Last
game you had a huge game, too. Against Colorado State, you scored 10 points in
the first two games. Tonight you seemed to have your way with them. What was
the difference?  
ALICIA LEIPPRANDT: I just kind of got hot tonight. My teammates did a good job
of getting me the ball. Coach gave me the freedom to attack the basket. I'm
not a very good shooter, but I love to attack the basket. She's opened that up
a lot more for me.  
  
Q. Alicia, at some point in the first half did you realize they couldn't
guard you when you penetrated the ball?  
ALICIA LEIPPRANDT: Yeah.  
  
Q. What does that feel like?  
ALICIA LEIPPRANDT: It felt pretty good (smiling). Just playing with the
defense, feeling unstoppable kind of. I don't know. It felt good.  
Like I said, my teammates did a good job of giving me the ball, getting open
when I'm driving. Dymond, I like playing with her, she gets open when I drive.  
  
Q. At what point did you guys really start believing you could win a game
here? I hate to put it that way, but you're 1-11 all time here as a program.
You seemed confident coming in.  
RAIMEE BECK: Well, personally I feel like with Coach A's new philosophy, her
optimistic attitude really helped us. She told us all year, Look forward to
the tournament. Let's get wins during the regular season, but that tournament
is when it really matters.  
Funny story. When we were coming out of the Hard Rock hotel today, Journey's
'Don't Stop Believing' was playing today. I think that's our new song, 'Don't
Stop Believing.'  
THE MODERATOR: At this time we'll dismiss the student-athletes and open it up
for questions for Coach Williams.  
  
Q. Coach, what triggered the decision to put Alicia in the lineup, she
scored 50 points?  
COACH WILLIAMS: I finally got a clue (laughter).  
A lot of things, when we start playing well together, seeing it in practice.
Trying a lot of combinations. I think outside the box, they've heard a lot up
on the hill. The civilians decided to go even smaller in the post and put her
at the 4. We've been playing her out of position all year. Now we finally got
it figured out.  
Her down at the 4 takes a little pressure off her and some freedom to do
things, different sets. Dymond playing well in the two-man game in the post-
up. She can be that creative guard that also can scissor cut off of her or
create her own shot. You have to find a day she is on and off and you have to
limit her turnovers and get her confidence on.  
She's worked on it. A lot of it is talking about different roles, what they
can do. They stuck to the game plan very well. Starting to experiment at TCU
with those bigger players what she would do in the 4. Colorado State last time
when the game was out of hand, getting some freshmen seasoned a little bit
more with the last three or four minutes, so we don't have deer in the
headlights.  
They all responded well. We moved her down to the 4. If we can get smaller and
better, then we'll do it.  
  
Q. Defensively you were able to negate their height. They had stretches
where they got really going and it looked like there was nothing you were
going to do to stop them, all of a sudden you were able to regroup and do some
things. How difficult was that and critical was that to winning this game?  
COACH WILLIAMS: Our staff put together I think one of the great scouting
defensive plans with Coach Robinson having her scout with what we're going to
do with Kim and how we're going to defend her and lock her up, just limit her
touches. That's what usually hurts us. Also Sam. We're used to getting pounded
inside, getting beat with everybody's post. We do a little digging off of some
people if they weren't true scorers, go doubling, keep her off balance a
little bit so she couldn't get rhythm and do some things.  
Yeah, they're going to get some back doors, shoot over us, gather their feet.
That's what you want someone of Sam Martin's caliber to do if you were
coaching them.  
Our kids dug in. Told them they had to get physical, come up with the jump
ball or lose ball, tips and touches. With Raimee getting 15 rebounds, we're
getting in the paint, can run and do some things. It was a great defensive
plan from my assistant coaches. Great job in the turnaround on Monday morning
at 6 a.m. in our practice at home to talk about it with a few of our kids
attending a lab they needed to do.  
When we got here, a lot of shots in Cox and reiterating what our defensive
plan was. They stuck to it. It even trickles down to our bench, how young we
are. Bryanna Mueller, her job was to make sure everyone knew who the doubler
was coming off of, make sure when they come in, you're screaming and hollering
on the defensive end to get us a good start for the first half, then come out
to play with somebody, then the second half we can run our offense at our
bench.  
They dug in. Then Raimee comes up with the big block and things are just
rolling for us.  
  
Q. When Raimee got that block, what was your reaction at that point?  
COACH WILLIAMS: To finish the game was phenomenal. Like, Okay, that's our ball
now. We wanted to close out on three. That's the thing. Been our nemesis all
year. For her to have courage to go up, close out, get the block, waiting and
gasp to see if it goes in. They are such a tremendous three-point shooting
team.  
For her to get the block, for her to rebound, for to make the three, for that
senior to find a way to will her team to win, the look in their eyes, take a
win away from somebody, be in the position, believing and knowing in the
assistant coaches yesterday and today getting even prepared more and more
focused. It's tournament time, anything can happen.  
  
Q. You said all season that you were just setting little goals one at a
time. Are you ready to set bigger ones now?  
COACH WILLIAMS: Well, we did attain this goal of winning our first game here
in the tournament. Yeah, the next goal will be UNLV and Utah. Again, our kids
are in a different position where they're coming back to scout, they're not
just going to watch a game with their parents. They're here for a mission:
scout this game, play for another day.  
We'd loved to be in the semis. It's that focus, it's that belief. Utah is a
tremendous team.  
Again, the mini goal was to come here, win a game, solidify what we've done
all year in case somebody didn't believe or we caught somebody on an off
night.  
It's a tremendous aspect that the kids want to change and do what we ask them
to do and are ready to change. They've done it all year. You say we're going
to be up-tempo now, play man-to-man, we can scramble. It's a testament to how
they do and what we do during the day, then come down and do basketball
practice with us. They're accepting the change, their roles, believing in
them. The mini goal, so now we have to set some new ones. That will be now
two.  
  
Q. Raimee talked about her game-winning shot, them going zone. Did you see
that developing? And how confident were you?  
COACH WILLIAMS: Very confident. Her look and demeanor was even more hungry
tonight. When we ran a couple sets trying to get into a dive play, we call,
can go inside but also the kick-out is there for shooters. We also can run a
four out and one in. You have to play a gambling game. If J is in for defense,
we're going to put her in for offense. Then if Katie comes in for defense or
we sub somebody out, Kelsey is our shooter. Just knowing what sets we can run
with certain people on the court even though it may not be our defensive
tendency at the time.  
Yeah, she had the look. She was ready to shoot it. I told them to spot it.
When she started taking shots early, looking for her shot, we knew her head
was in it, really wanted it, and we're going to go through our senior.  
  
Q. You talked about her having that look. I'm sure you expected a lot out of
her today. I know you were upset with her at the shot clock violation. Did you
just expect her to bounce back from that?  
COACH WILLIAMS: Yeah, you did, because you also had a turnover with a 'gasp'
happened. They came down and scored. You expected her to bounce back. I
thought she would take it. A lot of things were falling in the paint for her,
Megan Muñiz. But again, you can't get down on them. You're on to the next
play. Stay focused.  
At that time my team responds. We're on to the next thing. Get another
defensive stop with two minutes to go.  
Again, it's knowing roles and for us passing it to somebody not really ready
to shoot. They're expecting her to shoot. I'm there for the rebound, do what I
can, reset the defense or offense.  
Again, just a temporary moment to reiterate that you need to shoot the ball.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.  
COACH WILLIAMS: Thank you.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2011

  

### [Janita Badon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21839)

### [Anthony Levrets](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21838)

### [Michelle Plouffe](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21840)

  
_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

Utah  55  
UNLV - 44

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by the University of Utah. Coach, if we could
start with your general thoughts and comments on tonight's game.  
COACH LEVRETS: I thought our kids really battled. We just played this team on
Saturday and had lost to them. This time of year you know every team that you
play, and they know you well. Maybe not quite this well, having just played
somebody on Saturday. We knew it was going to be a dogfight. We made enough
plays at the end. I'm really proud of our kids and the way we competed.  
THE MODERATOR: Now we'll take questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. I understand you have been here since Friday. Did that affect your play
at all, just being here for so long, waiting for this game?  
JANITA BADON: No, 'cause our coaches and the players know how important this,
our last game of our conference, and this tournament, was. So we had a focus.  
I mean, it is Vegas. We are college students (smiling). But we know how to mix
business with pleasure. So have fun, but when it's game time, it's game time.  
  
Q. Janita, 17 rebounds. Did it feel like you had that many? Have you ever,
ever had anything close to that in your career?  
JANITA BADON: I think the most rebounds I have is 10. No, I was just playing.
I saw how hard my teammates were playing and I just wanted to do the same.  
  
Q. Michelle, could you talk about Janita's performance, the way she
distributed the ball, made all you guys play well.  
MICHELLE PLOUFFE: It's just her leadership. She comes out every night and
plays her hardest, puts her body on the line and puts her everything on the
court. She leaves it all on the court. That's just a testament to who she is.  
She just did what she needed to do tonight. We can't ask anything more of her
because she puts it all on the court every night.  
  
Q. That three-pointer you hit with two minutes to go, that was a huge three,
gave you the cushion. Talk about maybe leading up to that shot, the effect of
that shot on the rest of the game.  
IWALANI RODRIGUES: I felt that shot. It was really big. I was happy it went
in. I was glad that Janita, like, she found me. I felt like that was kind of a
hard pass.  
But, I mean, Anthony always tells me I'm a shooter. And there was one point in
time when I made so many. Then you also miss. So I just went back to the
three-point line and started shooting and it fell.  
  
Q. Janita, when she hit that three, what went through your mind? Did you
feel like you had it at that point?  
JANITA BADON: Coach Levrets always tells us a play isn't over until a referee
sounds his whistle or the buzzers end it. So we didn't stop playing. I knew
she was going to make it. When you have confidence in yourself and your team,
your potential is limitless.  
  
Q. How did UNLV stay in the game despite shooting 17%?  
JANITA BADON: They played hard. I mean, I know we played them three times,
just Saturday, and each time they play harder. It's hard playing a team three
times. But, yeah, they just play hard. We tried to match their intensity.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll dismiss the student-athletes at this time and take
questions for coach.  
  
Q. You found a way today. What has to be improved tomorrow against an Air
Force team that's feeling good about itself?  
COACH LEVRETS: We talked about this. Everybody knows you, you know everybody.
There's no easy plays at this time of the year. If this was easy, everybody
would be doing it.  
You got to scrap for every single thing that you get. And for us, I don't
think we've had any games that weren't close. You know, at some point in time
we've had some games that have gotten away from us at the end of games. We've
been in a lot of close games. Hopefully that will serve us well as we continue
to play.  
We made one or two more plays than UNLV did, and hopefully we'll make at least
one more than Air Force tomorrow.  
  
Q. How about the little things that were so important tonight?  
COACH LEVRETS: You've watched us play a few times (smiling).  
The three kids here sitting next to me have put up big numbers. There's a
reason why they're on some sort of all-conference this year. We talk about
everybody has a job to do. It's not necessarily every night scoring points,
but everybody has a job.  
At this point in time if you don't know what your job is, I probably screwed
up. I think they all know what their job is. Everybody did it tonight. We had
a kid come off the bench, Chelsea Bridgewater, give us really good minutes,
not numbers-wise, although she had a few numbers, but it was her energy and
the passion she played with. It gave our team a big lift.  
You never know this time of year what play is going to be the big play.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Michelle's play in the second half?  
COACH LEVRETS: Do your job, was the message. You're defending. We now need you
to rebound. We didn't want Kelli Thompson to get off. She was 0-16 from the
floor. That was Michelle Harrison's matchup. I think the first time we played
them, she was 4-17. She struggled from the floor as well. Michelle has done a
great job with her. She had one extra thing she needed to get done. We did
address it.  
She's a senior. No need to yell and scream at her. Do your job, get a rebound.  
  
Q. Talk about Janita. Have you ever seen a point guard with 17 rebounds
before?  
COACH LEVRETS: Janita, I don't think she remembers, but she's had 13 a couple
times I believe. It's part of our philosophy, everybody blocks out, then our
guards go rebound down. They shot a lot of threes. Our bigs did a pretty good
job of engaging their bigs.  
Our biggest focus tonight was their bigs not get offensive rebounds. She got a
few. Our guards go get 'em. J just had a nose for the basketball, and she went
and got them. I think she's leading the league, or is fourth in the league, in
defensive rebounds on the year. I don't expect her to get 17 of 'em, but she
knows how to rebound.  
  
Q. Talk about that three by Rodrigues?  
COACH LEVRETS: It's huge. Iwa at one point made 13 straight threes, one away
from the NCAA record. Every now and again she gets hesitant shooting the ball.
She's still just a sophomore. Confidence goes a little bit.  
When the game is on the line, I trust her, her teammates trust her. Janita
certainly trusts she's going to make that shot. As soon as I saw J break the
trap and Iwa slide to the corner, I knew J was going to throw it to Iwa, and I
knew she was going to make it.  
We kept getting stops. To hold somebody to 18% from the floor for an entire
game, that's defending. That's been kind of our deal all year long, is we have
to guard well to have a chance to win. We made a shot. But everybody else
defended.  
  
Q. (Question regarding rebounds.)  
COACH LEVRETS: Whether she shoots 18%, there's going to be a lot of missed
shots. The thing you can't have happen is do a great job of defending them and
then not get the rebound and allow them to get an easy putback is a huge, huge
key for us. I think they both go together.  
The biggest thing is at the end of the game, we didn't give them any easy
second shots. They missed a couple, but a lot of that had to do with how we
were defending.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.  
COACH LEVRETS: Thanks.

_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Texas A&M  76  
Notre Dame - 70

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Notre Dame student-athletes Natalie Novosel,
Devereaux Peters, Skylar Diggins and Coach Muffet McGraw.  
COACH MCGRAW: What an incredible season. I'm so proud of the team what they
accomplished this year where we came from in November to get to this point.
It's really remarkable, the progress that we made this year.  
And just so proud of them right now and so thankful for the support from all
the people from South Bend. A lot of green out there in the stands today, and
we really appreciate that support.  
  
Q. Skylar, can you talk about getting past that start, I think it was 18-6,
you had seven turnovers, then from the 13:26 mark no more turnovers the first
half when you got the two-point lead. What changed there for you?  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: We started putting pressure on them like they were putting on
us.  
  
Q. Devereaux, can you talk about your game tonight, just what was there for
you and the challenge of dealing with Adams inside?  
DEVEREAUX PETERS: She's a big post of the she knows what she's doing. She got
low and she got easy buckets. We couldn't guard her.  
  
Q. Skylar, can you just try to put this into words, what you're feeling and
what it's like?  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: I'm just disappointed. Obviously we wanted to win and we
didn't, so...  
  
Q. Devereaux, what do you think ultimately was the difference tonight?  
DEVEREAUX PETERS: We couldn't defend them like we've been doing all year.
White had a great game and Adams had a great game. We couldn't stop them.  
  
Q. Natalie, what was the difference between the first and the second half,
you guys went in with the lead and built on it a little and then all of a
sudden it trickled away?  
NATALIE NOVOSEL: I think we started the second half well and they were able to
counter act with a run on their own. We got back on our heels a little bit,
got in foul trouble.  
And I think they just kept pounding it into the post and we didn't have an
answer.  
  
Q. Did the speed of the -- Skylar, did their speed surprise you guys the
first five minutes of the game? It looked from a standpoint as if you were a
little bit out of sorts out there the first five minutes. Did their speed
surprise you, or what happened there the first five minutes?  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: We just didn't handle the pressure. We turned it over too
much. I don't know if it was nerves or what. But we didn't handle the ball and
didn't execute on offense. They're a great team. They're a good defensive
team. One of the best in the country, and we did a poor job handling it.  
  
Q. Skylar, I saw you leave the court right before the buzzer sounded. Was it
at that point just too much for you to basically --  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: After the buzzer went off, they're celebrating and things like
that. I just wanted to get off for my team and get ready to talk to everybody
and finish it out with the huddle.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about Skylar and how well she played the whole
tournament? What can this do for her heading into the next year as far as
status as a college basketball player?  
COACH MCGRAW: She really stepped up her game, I thought, in the NCAA
Tournament, particularly as the games went on. I thought at the regional,
being MVP, as a sophomore, what a great accomplishment.  
I think she came into this season as somebody that people were aware of.
Obviously she was on the Naismith and the lists that were circulated.  
And I think she really gave herself a big shot of credibility, I guess, I
would say, coming into next year as one of the top players in the Big East and
one of the top players in the country, I think particularly at the guard spot,
and to make the All-American team.  
And just a fabulous end to her season. I think she really, really figured out
how she could score and how she could lead us. And I'm really looking forward
to the next two years with her.  
  
Q. Can you talk about how you got things turned around, to go without a
turnover that last 13 minutes of the first half?  
COACH MCGRAW: Yeah, we really dug ourselves a hole early, and we were very
nervous. I thought we were just a little flustered offensively and completely
out of sync, and so they were making all the shots. And so we were hoping they
couldn't stay on that pace.  
So I think really just what happened, we settled in a little bit defensively.
We rebounded better and we started to run some things, and I thought we got a
couple of good back door looks and just got some good shots.  
And that was what we weren't doing I think the first couple. So I thought
their pressure bothered us at the start of the game.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Danielle Adams and the difficulty in dealing with
her?  
COACH MCGRAW: Well, we did not find an answer for her. We had a plan, and we
just weren't able to stop her. We thought that was going to be a tough matchup
for Becca.  
Devereaux tried to guard her a little bit, but then the foul trouble was a
problem. Natalie tried to guard her and then she got into foul trouble. She
did a really good job of getting us in foul trouble.  
She's just a great player. She's got a big body. We couldn't get around her. I
thought she really hurt us down the stretch.  
I thought we did okay for a while, but then in the last, I don't know, seven
or eight minutes, they just seemed like they were going to go into her and if
she didn't get it she was going to rebound it and put it back in. I was
disappointed that we weren't able to get down there to get the double-team a
little quicker.  
  
Q. This is Devereaux's first full season in an Irish uniform even though
she's a senior. Can you talk about her play tonight and what it means to have
a national championship game like she had?  
COACH MCGRAW: I thought she played very well, again, after the start. I don't
think anybody played well at the beginning.  
But then she really settled into her game, did a nice job on the boards. I
thought she was effective around the basket. She scored well. She rebounded
well. She defended pretty well. Overall, I thought kind of a nice momentum
builder for her going into next year.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the quality of the basketball? It seems that was
almost as -- that the game of basketball won, particularly after the mess we
saw last night.  
COACH MCGRAW: I thought this was going to be an uglier game, and I was right
on our part at the start of it. But I think both teams really did a much
better job as the game went on.  
So I thought both teams played hard defensively, and, yeah, I thought it was
probably not so entertaining from my point of view, but I think from the
fans's point of view it was probably a pretty entertaining game.  
  
Q. Can you talk about White's 3-pointer as the shot clock buzzer went off?
It looked like Skylar was there and had a hand stretched in her face.  
COACH MCGRAW: Yeah, that was a knife right in my heart. That was the game.
That was the game. And the disappointing part about it was with two seconds
left we didn't get the rebound. That was the disappointing part.  
We had two people in there and it ended up a jump ball and that cost us the
game. I thought that was just an amazing play on White's part. And it was an
unbelievable shot. They make two 3s in the game and we have a two-point
deficit and we couldn't get the rebound.  
That was the game, that play right there.  
  
Q. Talk about the run at the end of the first half, if you would. I want to
go back to the first of the game, here you are in your home state. What are
some of the things you talk to your players about and expectations and, like I
said, the run before halftime, no doubt a big momentum for you?  
COACH MCGRAW: Yeah, we started making some shots. And they started missing
some shots. And we got our transition game going a little bit. We got a couple
of drives. And when we were able to shoot the ball, I thought we did it pretty
well. Almost 60 percent in the first half.  
So I thought we just kind of got our legs back and just kind of got our
confidence back a little bit at the end of the half. And we were just so happy
with all the fans that were out here in our home state. And everybody around
town was cheering us on wherever we went.  
It was so great. We were so well received here, and the hospitality was so
amazing.  
  
Q. I know people remember who won, but maybe you can speak for a moment of
how your team came back from a 13-point deficit, seven-point deficit, even
late, five, maybe you years from now will be able to remember that countless
comebacks, but talk about the resiliency your team showed.  
COACH MCGRAW: Well, it's a group of fighters. I knew they weren't going to
give up. And they didn't disappoint me.  
  
Q. Can you talk about right when you had a chance to build on that lead in
the start of the second half and then they ended up closing the gap? What was
happening right in there with them making that move?  
COACH MCGRAW: I thought we took a couple of really bad shots. We probably had
a turnover or so in there. But just really quick shots where we could have got
something a little better.  
I think we got a little anxious at times. And, you know, White hit a couple of
shots and Adams hit a couple of shots.  
And we kind of lost our poise, I thought, maybe for just a minute there. And
that was all it took.  
  
Q. Great players are often really tough on themselves. And I wonder at what
point will you sit down with Skylar and give her a perspective of the whole
year as opposed to just tonight?  
COACH MCGRAW: I think it's going to be a while for her to get that
perspective. I think she's extremely hard on herself. And she will spend the
entire summer, I'm sure, thinking about this game.  
And that's probably a good thing for us. I think that's how we got motivated
last year. You lose that last game, and you just get motivated to come back
and work a little bit harder and make sure it doesn't happen again. So I think
it will be a really good motivator for us. She had a great tournament. But
obviously some things that she would like to change at the end.  
  
Q. Do you think in retrospect you made a mistake at the beginning of the
game by moving Skylar to the wing and letting the other guards bring it up?
Because you really lost your composure there right at the beginning and the
game almost ended before it began.  
COACH MCGRAW: I actually didn't make that decision. They kind of -- they're at
the point -- they make that on their own in the game. When Sky wants to play
on the wing she tells Brittany to bring it up.  
And I think she really wanted to be off the ball a little bit. I thought we
really didn't have any poise the whole first probably eight or nine minutes,
even when she was at the point. I didn't think we executed well.  
  
Q. You're going to be losing a lot to graduation. Could you talk about next
year and Notre Dame women's basketball?  
COACH MCGRAW: The great thing is Becca Bruszewski is our only senior. So we've
got everybody else back. We've got a young team. So we've got a lot of people
with a lot of experience coming back. Becca is a great leader for us. We're
going to miss her, the intangible part of her game.  
She really got things going. Set the tone. So it will be tough to replace her,
but we have some good players coming back.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Texas A&M  76  
Notre Dame - 70

  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us on the dais national champions Texas A&M. Head coach
Gary Blair, student-athletes Danielle Adams, Tyra White and Sydney Colson.  
COACH BLAIR: I want my assistant coach, Coach Schaefer, here.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll begin with an opening statement from Coach Blair and then
we'll take questions for the student-athletes.  
COACH BLAIR: Howdy! I told you all the other day, you respond back to me.
Howdy! Now you're getting it.  
Folks, before we talk about the game, let's talk about Aggies all over the
country, Aggies all over the nation, I got letters from Afghanistan, from
Iraq, and everything today, just telling me how much people were getting up at
4:00 in the morning watching.  
We've got soldiers fighting in a lot of different places right now, but
they're fighting for us to be able to play this little game of basketball and
to enjoy the freedoms that we have.  
Thank you to the NCAA, thank you to the WBCA, and thank you to Indianapolis
for giving us a show. The hospitality was great.  
I mean, when you have a police escort, wherever you want to go, the food was
tremendous, this is what it's all about. This is what first-class -- I was
there in '82 when we won the first one, so was Sue Donohoe. But look at how
the game has grown.  
Look at how you've grown. You're here tonight as media because you want to be
here, not because you draw the unlucky straw.  
You're here because you want to cover women's basketball at the highest level.
Tonight, we gave you that game. We gave you that national championship game
without the so-called powers of the world. The two powers tonight were the two
that earned it, and that's Notre Dame and that's Texas A&M.  
Either one of us deserve this trophy, but we played just a little bit better
in the second half. We shot 68-or-something percent in the second half, about
what Notre Dame shot in the first half.  
But we found a way. I really do not like to coach as hard as I had to tonight
and use the whip a little. But they responded. Danielle Adams responded at
halftime on what was open and to quit shooting the jump shot and to go inside
and get them into foul trouble.  
Sydney Colson responded by playing the game the correct way, like a point
guard should. That's why she'll be in the WNBA, just like Danielle.  
And Tyra White --  
SYDNEY COLSON: Game-winner again.  
COACH BLAIR: Again. Two seconds to play. We had a lob play called for
Danielle. They put three people on her. The second option was Tyra coming off.
And with a jump shot, with a high release like that, she has no fear.  
But, folks, I'm so proud of this team, and I'm so honored, honored to coach
the seniors that I have on this basketball team. They've been very, very
special.  
And before I quit rambling, Muffet has done one heck of a job with that ball
club. One heck of a job. And Skylar Diggins is as good of an All-American. She
might not be Maya Moore, but she might be Maya Moore by the time she gets to
be a senior.  
So the state of Indiana should be proud of her and also Mallory and Novosel.
They gave us fits out there. All right. I'm through rambling.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Danielle, Junior College All-American, National Player of the Year, go
undefeated and lose at the end of the road, it didn't appear that you were
going to let that happen at all tonight. Discuss the emotions on making it
happen this time.  
DANIELLE ADAMS: I had a little voice in my head that said, Don't let this team
down. And my teammates, every time we would get down, we would tell each
other, We're not going to lose this game.  
And, I mean, we fought hard, from day one, from 6 a.m. to practice. I mean, we
worked hard the whole season to prepare for this point. And that's what we
did.  
And I just took the game over. I wasn't going to let my team lose. I mean,
they've been doing everything for me, so I decided to take them on my back and
just let them ride on my back.  
  
Q. Tyra, you picked up a couple of fouls there in the second half -- excuse
me, Danielle, you picked up a couple of fouls early in the second half but
still were able to play physical, score 22 points. How did you do it?  
DANIELLE ADAMS: Is that for me? Oh, I don't know, just composure. Just being
patient. I knew the second half was mine. And I just had to be patient and let
the offense come to me. I scored eight in the first half and I don't know how
many in the second.  
SYDNEY COLSON: 22.  
DANIELLE ADAMS: Thank you, Sydney.  
Just being patient. Not rushing anything. Just dominating inside. And that's
what I did, just dominated. And just got as far as the post down as I could
and got to the rim.  
  
Q. Tyra, talk about the shot, 58 seconds left. Coach for Notre Dame called
it a dagger in her heart. Talk about that a little bit.  
TYRA WHITE: I really didn't know the ball was coming to me. The play was
designed for Danielle. But when I came off I seen they were triple-teaming
her, and I knew Coach was going to pass me the ball, because he's smart like
that, so I just wanted to hit it. Kinda hit my elbow, too, so I didn't really
think it was going to go in, but it did, I'm glad it went in.  
  
Q. Sydney and Tyra, two years with Danielle. I mean, kind of here and gone
almost. Does it seem like it went really fast? I wanted you to capture her
game tonight.  
SYDNEY COLSON: It does. It seems like it went by so quickly. But we relished
in every second of it and enjoyed every minute of it. Danielle has meant a lot
to this program. She's gotten so many accolades that are just individual, but
just like everybody else on this team, she's such an unselfish person.  
She could be a real meany, decide to be arrogant, full of herself, and she's
not. She's one of the most selfless players on our team.  
I've been happy to play with her for these two years. It's been fantastic. And
she's helped to get us where we are right now. And I know Tyra played with her
in high school and against her a lot. So she knew what she was capable of.  
But I didn't realize how much a gem we had on our hands until last year. So
it's been awesome playing with her.  
TYRA WHITE: Just going along with what Sydney said, I mean, I've been knowing
Danielle since we were little. I always knew what she was capable of. So
people are surprised now. Just looks like, Danielle, you shocked the world and
you've just shown people what you're capable of.  
She's a great player. I'm going to miss her next year. We're closer to Maryann
and Snow, so -- but it was fun playing with her.  
  
Q. Danielle, this is a program that's been kind of knocking at the door for
a few years, and over the past few weeks you've just kind of barged into the
elite beating Baylor, beating Stanford, winning the national championship. How
do you feel being such a big contributor to that, and can they stay there
without you?  
DANIELLE ADAMS: God. God has worked through this team so gracefully, and, I
mean, we've been in bible study ever since we started the tournament. And even
during the season.  
So God has worked through this team tremendously. And, I mean, next year, it
won't be any different. Going to work hard from day one and prepare for this
point again. I mean, we hope to get back to the Final Four next year with the
class we have coming in, and Kelsey Bone has been a tremendous asset to this
team this year in practices, pushing me down around low, and she's helped me
out a lot.  
  
Q. Sydney, what do you think this means to the A &M community that's been so
hungry for something like this?  
SYDNEY COLSON: I think it's so huge, just because it's finally like, you know,
we've had track and field win championships, equestrian, and those are big
sports, but a lot of people have been waiting for women's basketball to really
do something big.  
We've won Big 12 tournaments, and that was all exciting and everything. But
analysts, people around the nation, people have been believing in us and
saying that they think we can be contenders for the national championship and
we can make it to the Final Four.  
And in the past two years we had underachieved tremendously. And I think this
team was sick of it. We got together this summer, decided to have voluntary
workouts, getting together, conditioning, working on our one-on-one games, and
I think it prepared us for what we were going to go through this season with
the ups and downs we've had, everybody being resilient, working hard and
believing in one another. We were able to fight and battle through it. And I
think it's huge not only for our team but for the Aggie community.  
I was telling them I wish we could see like some snapshots of what was going
on in College Station, just to see how proud of us they are, because I know
they really are.  
  
Q. Sydney, you got into foul trouble?  
SYDNEY COLSON: Did I?  
  
Q. Can you just talk about how it was to play with all those fouls and the
challenge posed by Skylar?  
SYDNEY COLSON: She's a really great player. She's going to be huge for that
team in the next two years. But in the first half, you know, I made some bad
decisions going for steals that I shouldn't have at inopportune times.  
And I felt really bad sitting on that bench over there and seeing that lead
slip away and I really felt like I was letting my team down, and it hurt me
really badly.  
Made me want to come out in the second half and work hard for them, make the
right reads and make the right passes and everything like that. Just make
better decisions and be solid on defense.  
And I'm so glad that my team has faith in me and they wanted the ball to be in
my hands and expected me to find them at the right times. And Skylar Diggins,
she's a really good defender. And I think it was a really good battle between
her and I and between her and Carter.  
I'm just really proud we were able to go into the locker room at the half
after we lost that lead and take accountability and realize we lost that lead
because of us.  
It wasn't what they were doing. We were not composed. We looked nothing like
we did in the Stanford game when we came back from that lead. We looked like
we were ready to fold. And we had to find a way, and we did.  
  
Q. Danielle, I wanted to ask, before the tournament, before the Final Four,
on the video that was on the A &M website a few days before this thing
started, you more or less predicted that the Aggies would win. Do you remember
those words and sort of what you said, that you looked at the Conseco sign and
said, We're going to do it here, we're going to bring it home?  
DANIELLE ADAMS: Oh, yeah, I remember those words. And I was pretty confident
about it. I knew how hard these girls had worked and how hard I worked and
coaching staff had worked, and I just knew we was going to take it home. We
let it slip up in the Stanford game, but we fought through and came back.  
And tonight we just gave it all we had and left it on the floor. I predicted
it. And these girls have worked hard. So, hey...  
  
Q. Sydney, to finish your career this way, how is it feeling right now?  
SYDNEY COLSON: Unbelievable. Just all this team has gone through, all I've
gone through personally with injuries and everything, and just having my
coaches believe in me, having my teammates have my back, and helping me fight
through the hard times and really helping me stay mentally strong when I was
going through a lot of stuff.  
I appreciate them so much, you know? And I love them like they're my sisters.
And I'm just so proud of -- we got to play the last game of the season
together and we got a win. And it's just awesome.  
Schaefer, I love you. Coach Blair, I love you. I love you all, too. I'm so
proud of the way we came out and battled and we stayed believing in one
another and stayed believing in God and he pulled us through.  
COACH BLAIR: Do you forgive me for yelling at you?  
SYDNEY COLSON: I surely do. I'm over it.  
COACH BLAIR: Thank you, I feel a lot better.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, you mentioned Sydney Colson's future in the WNBA. Do you feel like
she's been sort of underrecognized as a guard, and particularly with respect
to tonight, her contribution on the floor, when she was on the bench for that
period of time, that's when the lead began to erode. You did put her back in
even with the three fouls in the final seconds. And then also both Sydneys'
ability to deliver the ball on the nickel to Adams in the low post in the
second half?  
COACH BLAIR: I think they're a very unselfish team. They found out what was
going to work. We started the game great. Transition, everything was rocking
and rolling. Colson was dissecting.  
And it really wasn't so much Adams. It was just a little bit of everything.
But in the second half, when the two Syds realized they were on fumes. Carter
didn't even realize that she had fouled out, because she lost the ball and
then reached in and made a foul right there.  
But those kids have worked so hard. Sydney is going to go to the WNBA. And
before the season she was not even on the radar. But what she's done the last
month of the season, she was only averaging 24 minutes a ballgame. And that's
not good for a point guard.  
It wasn't because I was playing my other one to get her some minutes, it was
always because of foul troubles or poor play. But she turned it around and she
showed what she's capable of doing.  
I think she would be an excellent back-up point guard in the WNBA until maybe
she gets her stride and everything. Her best basketball is in front of her,
because she's just still learning the game, particularly on the defensive
side.  
And she will learn once she gets up there and plays with those 28- and
32-year-olds, stealing the basketball is not defense. Stopping your man from
scoring is defense and playing team defense.  
And that will happen. She'll get her steals, but at the same time she's just
got to realize those are grown women she's playing with. But this is the type
of kid that the WNBA needs to sell the product.  
This kid's going to be a CEO. She's not going to be no gray-haired coach like
me. She will be a CEO or she will be doing something in the business world
representing women's basketball and just women in general.  
She wants to possibly go into sports casting. And if I was Disney World, I
would hire her right now. And, you know, I blew that line. I want to go to
Disney World with my family and nobody asked me on TV, but that's where I want
to go. Preferably free. Me and Calhoun could take our grandkids and it would
just be a great promotion. Calhoun and me. He doesn't know who the hell I am,
but I know who he is.  
But I want to take my grandkids to Disney World.  
  
Q. Speaking of Calhoun, there was a lot of chatter during the game online
that this game was such a marked contrast from the men's championship last
night. I'm wondering if you could just address what a riveting, tight, well-
played game like this means for the women's game, the big picture?  
COACH BLAIR: I hope Tony Kornheiser watched it because he didn't speak very
highly of ourselves or Notre Dame or the lack of star powers. Danielle Adams,
Skylar Diggins, come on? Okay.  
Now, Muffet and I are not in the Hall of Fame but we're pretty doggone good
coaches. We've got great staffs, and we know what we're doing. But women's
basketball needed this game perhaps more than Texas A&M or Notre Dame needed
it.  
We're going to give the country a chance for them to be able to see you can
win a lot of different ways without the kids scoring 35 points or whatever.  
And not all kids have to go to certain schools. That's what's good about our
game. Our kids are going to school for four years and getting an education and
being successful in life. That's what the game needs right now.  
And I just wish more people would watch the WNBA during the summer, but it's
hard. It's summertime.  
And hopefully it will pick up. But it was a struggle last night for Butler,
because I've coached the Butlers of the world before, La Tech and Stephen F.
Austin. And I admire that coach. I wish I had the calmness that he had on the
bench.  
I'm a raving maniac over there sometimes. But that's just how I coach. That's
who I am. Okay? I hope they like our style. I hope they like our kids. It's a
great presentation right there.  
And let me let Coach Vic Schaefer say a word on your comment there. Coach
Schaefer. We gave the country the secretary of defense in Bob Gates, but we're
giving you the secretary of defense for women's basketball right here in Vic
Schaefer. And he has done a remarkable job, and I'll let Vic comment on the
rest of your question.  
VIC SCHAEFER: That's got to be a first, a coach asking a coach the question.  
I think everybody saw how tough our kids were. We wrote on our board, on our
side on defense, that the two words that would define tonight were
perseverance and toughness.  
And we've written that up there many times, because that's who we are. That's
who our kids are. You all don't know, they live that every day in practice.  
Our practices are much tougher than games. And Notre Dame had a very tough
ballgame on Sunday. We had a very tough ballgame on Sunday.  
So we knew tonight would be a game of perseverance and be a game of toughness.
And I think you saw that tonight in our kids. They made 11 baskets the second
half. I bet they made six in a row to start.  
I told Coach we've got to get a time-out and fix this. He said, We've got a
media coming. I said, Coach, I'm afraid it's going to be over if we wait much
longer because I just felt like our help line was in a really bad spot, and we
weren't doing a very good job.  
And our kids were so accountable as they had been all year long in the huddle.
When you have a junior/senior team and you've got those kids commanding
attention in the huddle from their teammates, holding each other accountable,
it makes your job as a coach pretty easy.  
Those kids take great pride in what they do. And I thought tonight down the
stretch they did a great job. But they were the tougher -- in my opinion, they
just persevered in a real -- both ends. Gosh, we were so good on offense and
shot 60-something percent. But you think about the way they opened the second
half and then you look at the stat line, they shot 36 percent.  
The telling tell, when you watch Texas A&M in the future, look how many
assists the other team has and you can tell if we're doing our job. They had
14 one-on-one baskets tonight. They had ten assists for 10 baskets. So 14 --
in other words, they had to create their own stuff.  
And when people are having to create against our kids, our kids are doing
their job.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Danielle Adams, two years, the impact she's had on
your program and have you ever had a kid that's come in for two years and done
this much?  
COACH BLAIR: I told Coach when we were in the recruiting of Kelsey Bone, and
we lost her on a television at a McDonald's game. We got her back now. And
Coach Schaefer and Coach Harris were working so hard on her. I said, Vic, I
know she's the best scorer in junior college we've ever seen. I saw her the
year before.  
And I went up -- but can she play our system? Can she play our system? Not
just what she had. And Vic kept convincing me that she could. And he said -- I
said we'll worry about that defense later. She took 38 charges for us this
year.  
She's constantly bailing out, a lot of times, Colson on penetration. Tonight
it was Carter getting beat back door. But she's always there.  
She's a team player. She's a we player. It's never about her. It's about her
teammates. She's a special kid. How many of you all in the audience have lost
40 pounds. And she lost it really in about three months.  
VIC SCHAEFER: Twice.  
COACH BLAIR: Because she gained it back after that first year and she had to
lose it again. But she's just a very special young lady and a very humble All-
American.  
  
Q. Coach, you have credited your players, your assistant coaches, but this
is your first championship. And I wanted to ask what this means to you.  
COACH BLAIR: First, I hadn't credited all of them. I've got Johnnie Harris and
Kelly Bond over here. They're two of the best you've ever seen. They both
deserve to be head coaches also, along with Vic. But I'm not letting them go.
I've got a lifetime contract with all of them.  
What it means to me, I go all the way back to what I said out there on the
podium. When I was a high school coach at South Oak Cliff High School, and of
all things, Dennis Rodman goes into the Hall of Fame, gets his letter the same
day we get a national championship where he used to play Ping-Pong with me
because he was only 5'11" and couldn't play a lick in high school, but his two
sisters were All-American.  
So I'll go all the way back to the best job I ever had was my high school job.
And then on to Louisiana Tech and being with Leon Barmore and Mulkey and Sonja
Hogg and Sue Donohoe, that whole gang. They taught me how to win at the
highest level.  
And then we go to Stephen F. Austin, Baker Pattillo hires me, the vice
president and now the president. And coaching a 6'-and-under team to finish
third in the nation one time. We didn't get to the Final Four. But in the
polls.  
And Arkansas gave me my chance at a BCS. All those stops along the way and the
people have helped shape my life. Okay? And Texas A&M gave me the chance to
come home when Bill Byrne hired me.  
And all I can be is thankful, appreciative, to all those people that are out
there. But to Texas A&M right now, we won this thing. We won it for you. We
won it for everybody that now is going to believe in basketball, because our
men are not far behind us. But we're winning in everything there, but it means
everything.  
What also means so much to me is my family and Coach Schaefer's family, Coach
Harris's family that she's got. Coach Bond's dogs. It means everything to us,
because we share it with them. We share everything that we do. To be a spouse
of a coach is a hard job. It might be as hard to be a spouse of a
sportswriter, but to be a spouse of a coach and to know I'm taking my wife
this summer on a vacation I promised her 11 years ago, I gave it to her at
Christmas, a trip to Alaska. But we haven't been yet. But we're going in
August. Eleven years later. That's the life of a coach because you do not get
to do those little things.  
The appreciation that you have to have for your family to put up for us,
because we're not a lot of fun to be around sometimes. They love us, but
sometimes they don't like us, because of our job or the stress or what we
bring back to the table.  
And I'm already past my allotment. I love my staff. I love my family. And this
man right here is one hell of a coach, one hell of a coach.  
VIC SCHAEFER: Thank you, Coach.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us is Muffet McGraw, Skylar Diggins, Devereaux Peters,
Natalie Novosel, Brittany Mallory and Becca Bruszewski. We'll start with an
open format. We'll take questions for everyone up on the dais.  
  
Q. Skylar, I'm going to ask you the question probably everyone in this room
wants to know. Two-part question. How does it feel to have Lil Wayne tweet at
you and what do you think that does for the promotion of women's basketball,
having your name out there by a huge celebrity? Do you think it will help at
all?  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: He's a huge artist, one of the top artists in the country. Me
and my teammates listen to him a lot. That was tight, him tweeting at us and
wishing us luck, to the Fighting Irish. And I'm like, I didn't know we were
married, but, I guess -- no, but this is huge.  
Obviously he has -- him saying that and him just watching the game and
watching us play, I think that says a lot about how big women's basketball is
becoming and it appeals to all audiences.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about the matchups and just the two styles of play
that these teams have?  
COACH MCGRAW: They're a great defensive team. Probably a little bit like West
Virginia in the Big East and then some. They really get up and guard people.  
I thought their pressure is why they won the game last night. They also can
score. They have got great guard play. They've great inside playing.  
Danielle Adams is a difficult matchup for us. We haven't really faced anybody
like her. That's going to be a challenge for our defense. And our guards, they
all have tough matchups. So it's going to be a defensive battle, I think.  
  
Q. Can you talk about coming full circle? Ten years ago you were in the
Final Four in the championship game, beat UConn in the semifinals, and now you
did it again and now you're back in the championship again.  
COACH MCGRAW: Yeah, I'm enjoying the circle. We had our championship reunion
in the fall and the team came in. They presented a ball to this team and said,
you know, We've won our championship; now it's your turn.  
And I don't know that anybody expected it would be this year. I think that we
believed in ourselves, but I'm not sure that a lot of people thought we were
ready.  
So I think it's been interesting, playing Connecticut again, Skylar making
Third-Team All-American and Niele Ivey making Third-Team All-American. There's
a lot of parallels.  
It was a very emotional game, the same as the one was back in 2001.  
  
Q. Skylar, what do you know about Sydney Carter or Colson? Have you seen
them on film? Watched them on television? Does their pressure remind you of
anyone you might have faced this year?  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: I've had the chance to play with Syd Carter. She's actually
one of my good friends from USA Basketball. She was one of my roommates. I've
seen her in the trials. She's a great defender on the ball, great mid-range
jump shot and very good speed. She's going to be up in her face and a pest on
defense. We have to make sure we protect the ball.  
Syd Colson, I've been watching her since before I was in college. She's a
great player too. One of the quickest players, one of the fastest players to
the rim in the country.  
She's going to run the team, she's very heady point guard who knows where her
teammates like to score. She's going to be another good on-the-ball defender.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about A &M's guards, how they play against teams with
taller guards, and do other teams try to take advantage of that?  
COACH MCGRAW: You know, their guards are so quick and up on the ball. Their
full-court pressure really takes you out of what you want to do offensively.  
I haven't seen a lot of teams try to post them up. I think they're physical.
They're strong. They're aggressive. They've got great on-the-ball pressure
which makes it hard to throw it in the post.  
It's going to be a challenging matchup.  
  
Q. Coach, your counterpart from Texas A &M, Gary Blair, he said you guys
screwed it all up for the powerhouses whether, it's UConn or Baylor or
Stanford, all the teams that were expected to be here. But he also joked that
why not like the pretty faces of his and yours in this game. Could you speak
to how this affected your team or mindset about the same old same old not
playing out?  
COACH MCGRAW: I thought it was great throughout the month of March, before the
brackets came out, when the first top four seeds were so obvious to everyone.  
And I thought that was a good thing because we were able to fly under the
radar. I don't think that anybody was talking about us. They were talking
about the top four seeds the whole time.  
So it made it a little bit easier to come in and be the underdog, and to maybe
get the upsets that we've had.  
I know that playing in the state of Indiana has been huge, and we are
expecting big crowds tomorrow. Everybody in South Bend hopefully is on their
way down here for the game, because we had so much green in their last night
we really want this to be a home court game.  
  
Q. Skylar, is this place like a second home for you on the court? I think
you won three titles here, now you won the biggest game of your college career
here, and a big one tomorrow night?  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: Obviously I had some experience on this court, played three
state championships here, and with USA Basketball. So it's just great. Every
time I come here I know that my team has opportunities to do great things and
this is another one of those times.  
And Hoosier basketball, you know, you can't even put into words how important
this sport is to the state. And like Coach said, a lot of fans are going to
come out and support us. A lot of Indy alum are here, and a lot are going to
come down.  
Like I said, when we had a state championship, when we play here, South Bend
is going to be a ghost town. And we want that again for tomorrow. And
hopefully with the home crowd and giving us momentum and being anything like
they were last night, we'll have a very good chance of being a national
champion.  
  
Q. Brittany, Natalie, Devereaux, could you give us a sense what did you do
after the game: How late did you stay up, were you able to sleep?  
BRITTANY MALLORY: I'll go. It was an unbelievable feeling. We all believed in
ourselves that we were going to get this far and it was just a matter of
executing, and we had a great welcoming at the hotel last night when we came
in, with our friends and family and fans.  
And it was a little hard to go to sleep, but we knew we had to settle down and
get ready for Tuesday.  
  
Q. What time did you get to sleep?  
BRITTANY MALLORY: 2:30.  
DEVEREAUX PETERS: It was just great. It feels really surreal. We joked around
this morning it felt like a dream. The world's out of tilt. It's raining
outside. Don't know what's going on, but it's a great feeling to be here.  
  
Q. Becca, you potentially could have a tough matchup if you end up guarding
Adams. What have you seen of her, and what do you think about that matchup?  
BECCA BRUSZEWSKI: She's definitely a dynamic post player. She likes to go
outside more than inside. She likes the jump shot. It's definitely going to be
challenging for us. It's not the typical post player we're used to seeing
where they're fighting for position inside.  
But she's got a great jump shot, and she's really a contester.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about how you've evolved as a teacher, as a coach,
and in particular the job you've done with this team this year to bring them
from a team that a lot of people weren't taking notice of early, now you're in
the title game?  
COACH MCGRAW: I think I've tried to be a little more patient than I normally
am, which is pretty hard for me. But I've been, I think, a lot more relaxed.
And because of them. I think they get me relaxed.  
When I look at them in the pregame and getting ready for the game, it just
kind of takes the weight off my shoulders, because I know they're ready to go.  
Becca's got the team ready every game, their attitude, their intensity, their
focus. I never have to worry about are we going to show up tonight.  
And I think that really -- it makes it more fun. I've really enjoyed coaching
this team. I've enjoyed this journey we've been on.  
And I think it's been, for me, trying to help them more instead of telling
them what they're doing wrong, because all of them are perfectionist-type
people. They know when they're making mistakes. They usually say it before I
can.  
So it's made it easier to talk about this is what we need to do. This is what
might work, let's try this, instead of going over what we've done wrong.
That's how I feel about them.  
  
Q. Coach, how do you deal with the emotional -- actually both teams are
facing -- the emotional letdown of a big win, huge win, two days earlier, now
they have to come back and get on that same roller coaster back up. How are
you approaching that?  
COACH MCGRAW: I think we have some good practice after the Tennessee game.
That was such a huge emotional game. Then we got home at 3:00 in the morning.
And you're just tired. And you really want -- just want to get back out there
and play again rather than practice.  
So I think for us, again, the focus this team's been able to bring every day,
I'm not worried about whether or not they're going to be ready.  
It was similar in 2001, we beat Connecticut and everyone said that should have
been the final. But we still had to play one more game.  
And so I think kind of our motto has been we've got to finish. We've got to
finish this, 40 minutes in every game, and we want to finish it.  
  
Q. Becca and Skylar, this is your first Final Four but for Coach McGraw it's
her third. Can you talk about how her experience, the things she's been
through, has helped both of you? And also maybe if you could share what ways
has Coach McGraw most impacted you guys as players?  
BECCA BRUSZEWSKI: I would just say her patience. Like she said before. I mean,
she definitely has the experience. She's been here before. And just the way
she's approached the games and approached us on and off the court, that it's
just a total different mindset than the first three years when I was here.  
And, again, having Niele Ivey on staff is excellent, because she's been here.
She has the experience, she's also in the locker room to get us fired up
before we go out and play. And she's been there before.  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: Coach's basketball IQ is so high. She's a Hall of Fame coach
for a reason. She knows exactly what we need to do to be prepared. I think she
knows how much needs to go into a team that's looking to play at this level.  
And we definitely are like sponges. We listen to her, and, like she said, our
focus and how we're able to be on each other, we try to help take pressure off
her.  
And with her being so patient, we talk to a couple of the players here from
years ago, and they're like, She's so much easier on y'all than she was on us.
And I'm like, Well, yeah.  
But she's had a lot of patience with us. Obviously we're a young team, and I
think with her being patient with us and talking to us like she does, and with
the help, I mean, Coach Carol Owens and Coach Niele Ivey, who has been there,
you know, we're just able to put together an awesome year.  
  
Q. Brittany, I'm just curious, how many times have you hit the floor this
year? And how did you develop your mentality as far as you play?  
BRITTANY MALLORY: I've hit the floor quite a few times. I'm pretty sure all of
you know that.  
I've just been brought up that way. Playing against my brother in the cul-de-
sac, and pushing me in the basketball net because I was about to win.  
I've always been brought up to be tough, and with my team behind me and
knowing that if I make a mistake they're right there. So if I get beat on the
dribble they're right there. So why not give all you have the full 40 minutes
that you're playing each game.  
  
Q. Coach, at halftime yesterday, Natalie had almost as many points as she
had fouls. What was your message to her at halftime? What was your frame of
mind at halftime in regards to her and how she changed it around?  
COACH MCGRAW: We really didn't even have to talk about it much, because she
knew. And I feel like almost all year long Skylar's been kind of getting us
off in the first half and Natalie takes over in the second half.  
We've had a number of games we've kind of joked about it. One does the first
half, one does the second. So I just expected that she was going to come out
and play well.  
She was determined to come out and play well. So really we didn't need to talk
about it at all.  
  
Q. All of you, can you talk about the job your support staff, the trainers,
the managers, the videographers have done to get you here, especially in the
postseason?  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: They've been amazing. Especially for our strength and
conditioning coach, you know, trying to keep our bodies right, our trainers,
who have put in endless amount of hours working with us, and massage
therapists. I think they've all worked together to make sure our bodies are
right.  
Then you have the people that work behind the scenes who don't get a lot of --
they don't get to be the hero. But I think they're the unsung hero of the
group, just being our support and being someone, people that we can talk to.
You have to thank the managers and everybody.  
It really is a total team thing, and they are included in this team. And we
really appreciate them.  
COACH MCGRAW: I think if there's one person I couldn't be happier for is Chris
Masters. I don't think anybody associated with our program works harder for
us, is more positive towards our team.  
Anytime things start to look a little shaky for me, he comes in with a
positive outlook of some fact that he found that is going to make me smile.
And he's done a magnificent job. We're very lucky to have him.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. Questions for Coach McGraw.  
  
Q. Can you talk about what this year's experience will mean for next year's
team? You're only losing one player. Is there carry-over?  
COACH MCGRAW: I think there's definitely a little carry-over. But you're just
not guaranteed anything. Getting here this year doesn't mean that because we
have everybody back but Becca that we're going to be back here next year.  
And that's something we'll have to guard against after the season. We can't
get complacent. We know how hard we worked to get here. This was an
unbelievable effort by everybody to get here.  
I think we want to enjoy this and worry about next year after the season.  
  
Q. Two-part question. First, this is the second straight year that
Indianapolis is hosting a Final Four, the men last year and the women this
year, and you have a hometown team in Butler playing and now you guys a home
state team playing. How cool is that for Indiana basketball? And, second part,
different tone, Gary Blair said it's great for the game of women's basketball
having you guys and them playing as opposed to UConn or Tennessee or Stanford.
Could you talk about that, how great it is for the sport having you guys?  
COACH MCGRAW: We thought about watching Hoosiers on the way down, and it's
certainly a great thing for the state of Indiana. Indianapolis is a great
sport town. Great place to host. Easy to get around. People love the city.
There's a lot of things to do. People have come out and supported us, the
volunteers have been great, and being three hours away you saw how many Notre
Dame fans we had last night. We hope to get twice as many as that in the next
game.  
So I think everybody's -- I see a lot of people wearing Butler shirts while
they're at our games, and we're cheering for them, too.  
And the second part, I think a lot of people were happy to see a different
face in the final game. I think it's great what Connecticut's done for the Big
East and for women's basketball, and I think it's also great to have some new
teams come in and maybe appeal to a lot more people.  
  
Q. Coach McGraw, I tend to think of you as sort of an acerbic quick wit, and
Gary really doesn't say anything quickly, as a Texan, but he talked about how
much he admires you recruit players that want to be at Notre Dame; he recruits
the kind that want to be at Texas A &M and play that style. Can you maybe talk
about your relationship with him over the years and what you think of the
programs both you guys have built?  
COACH MCGRAW: He's done an amazing job, I think, coming in there, and has had
so much success later in his career after taking Arkansas to the Final Four,
then he went to Texas A&M.  
He has assembled an amazing team. I mean, I think he's somebody that's well
liked by his peers, because he's just such a gregarious guy.  
And he doesn't say anything quickly. I think he really has to have a little
bit of time, if you're going to run into him.  
But he's done an amazing job. I think everybody respects the job he's done in
the Big 12 and the players he's gotten, not always highly recruited by other
people but he gets the right kids for his system.  
That's similar to what we try to do. We want to try to get the right fit.
Something I learned early on: It's not about the talent, it's about the
chemistry for me. I want people that I want to coach; I want people that like
being together. I think when you have good chemistry, you get along, you like
where you are, you like who you're with, I think it's a lot easier to win.  
  
Q. Another thing Gary talked about a little bit this morning was the
challenges and also accomplishments of building a women's basketball program
at a school where football is like a religion. Can you talk about developing
your program juxtaposed with the predominance of football in South Bend?  
COACH MCGRAW: We love that Notre Dame is a huge football school. And
especially now when we're on the upswing it's even more exciting.  
I think they're in the newspaper all the time. Everybody wants to hear about
Notre Dame football. So when you see Notre Dame in the paper, we feel like it
helps us. Recruiting takes place mostly on a football weekend.  
We're in the first row behind the end zone when the team comes in, the first
ones that they see, we're on TV a lot cheering for them.  
Our team loves to go to the games. I think that's a big part of Notre Dame. I
think if you don't like football, you're probably not going to come to Notre
Dame.  
Again, we want people to have that fit for Notre Dame. So that's an important
part of it for us. Brian Kelly will talk to our recruits. He'll do whatever he
can to help us.  
We have a really good relationship with their coaches. And they've been very
helpful in the short time they've been there.  
  
Q. I understand you had more than 30 former players in attendance. Can you
talk a little bit about what that means to you, that players are coming in
from all over the country to be there?  
COACH MCGRAW: That's one of the best parts. I think after we beat Tennessee I
got texts and e-mails from former players and they were working on getting
here for this game, and from so many different eras.  
When you're here as long as I've been here, there were people even before I
got here that played back in the beginning and then all throughout the '97
team and the '80s and the '90s and the championship group and thereafter.  
It's been amazing to see so many people come back and kind of relive those old
stories and talk about things. But they're also proud. That's probably the
biggest thing they've all said: I'm so proud to be a Notre Dame alum.  
  
Q. Let's see. AP took my first question, so we'll go with another question.
Talk about the possibility of a new dynasty beginning with Notre Dame and
Texas A &M and some of the schools that really have flown under the radar.
We've got a lot of graduations coming up on the East Coast and the West Coast.
So if you can talk a little bit about that.   
COACH MCGRAW: Well, we would love to see some new teams come up and be the
ones that everybody's talking about every year. And I think it's what you work
for as a coach to get your team to be one of those programs.  
Certainly when you look at what Connecticut has accomplished over the years,
it's amazing to see the wins they have had, the success they've had. Geno's
done an amazing job as coach.  
And I thought did the best coaching job of his career this year. It's been
great for the Big East to have that always out there. I think we're still
going to see the same teams. I think Tennessee is going to be a good team next
year. Stanford will be a good team. There's always those underdogs that
everybody roots for, and I'm not sure if we're still considered an underdog in
the big picture, but we definitely like the fact that we have a pretty young
team coming back. We've got a great young sophomore point guard who is making
her mark, and we're looking forward to the future.  
  
Q. A little bit off point here. A salary question. You and Gary represent
coaches with long histories who have risen to the top of your profession, have
good contracts, long-term contracts, now with sizable money. Can you talk
about whether that validates the women's game within the greater athletic
picture and perhaps what market forces have enabled you to rise to this level
in your profession?  
COACH MCGRAW: I think it's great that we're approaching some sort of equality
with what the men have. I don't think we're quite there yet. But it's nice to
have that reward for doing the same job that they do and handling the same
pressures that they do.  
I think the downside of that you're seeing coaches getting fired a little bit
quicker. I think the movement in the women's game is not nearly what it is in
the men's game. And I think that's more of a woman's issue, I think people get
comfortable at one place and want to stay there.  
But I think when we all started out, you know, I was making $1,500 coaching at
Saint Joe's in Philly. And we certainly didn't get in this profession for the
money. We got into it because we love what we're doing.  
But it is nice at this point in our career to be rewarded for it.  
  
Q. Muffet, a bit of a left turn. Tara VanDerveer was enshrined in the
Naismith Hall of Fame today, and there are 11 women total in the Naismith Hall
of Fame, and not that many coaches. I wondered what your reaction would be on
the accomplishment.  
COACH MCGRAW: That's an amazing accomplishment to be in the Hall of Fame and
great that they have 11 women. I didn't even know that. I knew she was going
to be enshrined. She certainly deserved it. She's one of the icons in our
game. And we've got a few of them.  
I think we're getting to that point where you look at the numbers that our
coaches are racking up the wins, and it's really -- it's pretty amazing all
the great coaches that we have in the women's game.  
  
Q. Coach Blair said this morning, he's a little concerned next year about
the Final Four being in Denver because there isn't that fan base. Along the
lines of growing the game, there's concerns, I would think, is the game ready
to grow? Probably not going to have the strongest ratings that ESPN would like
Tuesday night just because it's not the UConn-Tennessee matchup or UConn-
Stanford that they would enjoy. Is the game ready to grow to have you guys and
A &M in the finals and have a game which may not draw the best ratings and if
it wasn't in Indianapolis wouldn't have a sold-out arena tomorrow night?  
COACH MCGRAW: I think the women's game has grown, and we're definitely getting
better every year. I think we see that in the first and second rounds
sometimes at a neutral site. We see that in the regionals sometimes. I thought
the committee did a really good job this year of putting -- at least in Dayton
we had Tennessee and Ohio State and Notre Dame. So I think they're trying to
do that. In Dallas you had some teams from Texas.  
You hope when you get to the Final Four level that you have enough interest in
the city because they're bidding on it that they're going to fill the crowd,
but I think it's better when you have the fans, you know, the fans of the
teams able to get there.  
Denver is probably not really close to a lot of places that are going to draw
well. So I think that will be a great test for us. I know we're doing pretty
well here. I know our fans are going to try to come out and fill this place,
so wherever the teams come from next year they'll do the same.  
  
Q. Following up on the whole Naismith announcement, Herb Magee also got
elected. Did you cross paths with him the days he was a player or go to his
camps?  
COACH MCGRAW: I know he spoke at Cathy Rush camp every year I worked there.
He's a great shooter. He gave a shooting lecture every year.  
An amazing, amazing guy. He's really done well. He's been in the game a long
time, given a lot back to the game.  
  
Q. In the Big East, of course, it's almost been like an NCAA Tournament
since the beginning of January. Some of the other big teams that went down did
not really see that kind of diet. Is that helpful when you get to this point
that maybe the change in competition, once you get higher up in the tournament
really isn't all that much from what you've seen as opposed to other teams
that may not have seen as much along the way?  
COACH MCGRAW: I don't think there's any question the Big East is the best
conference in basketball. What we had to go through this year to get where we
are, I know Geno said it in the past, it's tougher to win the Big East than it
is sometimes to win the national tournament.  
I know for us, we came in third in the Big East. We played so many good teams
that were ranked, but it prepared us so well. I think the rigors of the
schedule, night in and night out, really helped us, and when we came up
against Oklahoma and Tennessee, I think we looked back and said, this is just
like what we faced in the Big East, so we were ready for it.  
  
Q. This is a bit of a stickier question, but I have a radio show on WKRS in
Waukegan as well as the SRN gig, and I work with two male co-hosts. And my co-
hosts frequently tell me that nobody's interested in women's basketball and
people are going to run away from it. And I wanted to know what you would say
to them as a coach and as somebody who is passionate about women's basketball
and feels like its place is here and now.  
COACH MCGRAW: Well, I think we sold out again last night, I think our Final
Four has been sold out for -- I don't know how many consecutive years.
Somebody want to help me with that?  
You know, I think we choose good arenas that fit us, the size fits us, and I
think we're growing in leaps and bounds every year. I know our attendance just
continues to grow. Across the country I think attendance is up.  
You look at little kids coming up playing. The game is growing at all levels.
I think the interest has been tremendous. You see it on TV. You turn on,
watching great games, we've got the WNBA.  
I think when you look at how long it took the men's game to get to the point
they're at, and we're a different game. We're a much different game. We're
more like the old NBA back in the day when Walt Frazier was playing and people
enjoyed the beauty of the game.  
I think that's how our game is.  
  
Q. Muffet, when Gary was hired at A &M, did you expect him to have this type
of success? Could you see that coming?  
COACH MCGRAW: Well, I thought he did a really good job at Arkansas. And I
thought he'd be really comfortable down there. It's a great place for him to
build. He really started from scratch and really built it up.  
He got great players to come in. He's got a really good staff. I think that's
so key the people that you work with. So that was no surprise at all to see
how successful they've been the last few years.  
  
Q. Back when you won in 2001, the key component was Ruef who was basically a
"who" person, and obviously the positions are the same. Now you have Skylar,
who is almost similar in background, if not position. When she said I'm
coming, did you feel like this is the step that's going to get us back?  
COACH MCGRAW: I definitely thought she was a must-have recruit. I think she
was the most important recruit we've gotten.  
She had probably the most hype coming in, number one player coming in from
South Bend. You can't let a kid like that get away from home.  
We worked hard for four years. And Niele Ivey was instrumental when I hired
her. And I hired her and I said: You've got one job, that's to get Skylar. She
worked on it for a couple of years. And we couldn't have been happier when she
finally said yes.  
We felt like it was years of work and the future was very bright.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## April 4, 2011

  

### [Gary Blair](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14548)

### [Sydney Carter](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20685)

### [Sydney Colson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19509)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us on the dais is head coach Gary Blair and student-
athletes Sydney Carter, Tyra White, Adaora Elonu, Danielle Adams and Sydney
Colson. And this is an open interview forum so we'll start with questions.  
  
Q. Coach, although any of the players might want to respond to this, I'd be
interested. I think most players come out of high school thinking they know
something about playing hard. Given the way you play, how much of a shock do
you find that is to your incoming kids?  
COACH BLAIR: Sometimes it's tough. Like when you see Colson and Carter,
different styles from how they played in high school, Colson was just a
flamboyant style of play, all offense. Strip you, steal, go the other way,
passing lines, smile. Where Carter had to do a little bit of both, the
defensive end. She had to play the 2 guard and the 1 in high school.  
And it's just a little bit different high school setting for them. We have
some very, very good high school coaches in Texas. And that's why so many
other programs come into our state to recruit, whether it's football or
basketball or baseball, I'm proud of what we have in our state.  
And I don't like to share it, but we get our share of them and then we branch
out to other players. But we go hard, because that's all part of practice.  
Our practices are a lot harder than our games. A lot harder. The difference
is, like last night, in both ball games, the starters were playing 95 percent
of the minutes. On all four teams.  
At this level you just learn how to go hard. You get it finished. You go watch
the next ballgame, you go home. You see everybody in the lobby there. That
took an hour before I could get to Steak n' Shake and you took 13 of us over
there, my family members, and it was like a zoo.  
And we were all sober drinking orange freezes and having steak burgers, and it
was good. But right now we're all on adrenalin. You're not used to getting up
this early because you all work the nights. But, hey, you're on adrenalin now,
let's just have a great Final Four and enjoy the moment.  
But while we're enjoying the moment, this team has got to seize the moment.  
  
Q. The two Sydneys, before last night, what did you know about Notre Dame?
And what do you know about them now?  
SYDNEY CARTER: Well, I've seen them play a couple times on TV. And I just
think they have really good chemistry on their offensive end. I think Skylar
Diggins is a great point guard. And I think she does a really good job of
running her team and finding the shots that she's used to taking in there. And
I think she takes really good shots.  
But I think they have a complete offensive team. And I just think they work
really well together.  
SYDNEY COLSON: Pretty much the same. I've seen them play a few times as well.
Going into their UConn game, we were talking about how they have played them
three times before.  
And this is their fourth time playing them, and they could possibly get an
upset just like us against Baylor. And we were confident that they were going
to go out there and do it, just because, you know, so much is on the line. And
at some point you've got to go out there and get a win before it becomes
embarrassing for your team.  
And they went out and they battled hard. They're a physical team just like us,
so I think it's going to be a really good matchup. Just like us, they have an
all-around good team, and not just like one player who can potentially go off.  
But like Syd said, Skylar does a good job for their team. She's a good point
guard. And it will be -- at least we'll be used to guarding a left-hand point
guard since we had to do it with Baylor four times this season. That may help
us out a little bit because guarding a left-handed guard is unorthodox in our
game. But they're a good all-around team.  
  
Q. Sydney Carter, how do you balance the emotions and just the physical
nature of last night a game, being totally exhausted, but also being totally
excited about getting here, and just the thrill of victory last night, but
then having to go right back knowing that you have to play again tomorrow?  
SYDNEY CARTER: I was actually thinking about this question to myself this
morning, because I was just thinking about how tired I was last night and
everything like that.  
But I gotta say to myself, I'm playing in the national championship game, so
all this tired and I don't know if I can do it has got to go out the window.  
I think once I get to the game my adrenaline will definitely kick back up.
We've got to make sure we're staying focused and confident and making sure
that our practice goes well today and our shootaround goes well tomorrow,
because we're trying to reach our ultimate goal and that's to win the whole
thing.  
And we're one step away from it, and we're definitely not willing to shy down
from it now. So everybody's just got to pull it together and do it one more
time.  
  
Q. Coach, could you share your insights on the matchups and the two team
styles of play?  
COACH BLAIR: I think it's, first, a great matchup. First, I think it's also
good to see two new faces in the Final Four championship game. I think I know
we screwed it up for ESPN, well, Notre Dame screwed it up by beating
Tennessee. You don't have the Pat-Geno show and we screwed it up because now
you don't have the Brittney Griner and the dunk possibility, and everybody
wants to see the dunk.  
But why not just have two pretty faces like me and Muffet there, and it's good
for the game of basketball right now. Don't take anything away from what Pat
and Geno and Tara has accomplished. But right now for our sport to grow, we
need Texas A&M and Notre Dame in this game.  
We need also the fans of Indiana. Whether or not they're Notre Dame fans or
they're University of Indiana or Butler fans, we need them at this ballgame.  
Okay. It will be embarrassing if we don't have a sell-out with a team from
Indiana in the state of Indiana. We're getting as many Aggies up here as we
can get. And we're converting a lot of others.  
And we are trying to convert and we're working hard on that. The styles are
similar. They're more physical with their half court defense. We do it with
speed in fronting the posts and pressuring the ball.  
They do it by old school ball. They know how to play. Their guards have always
got their forearms out. Mallory and Novosel, is that how you say it, they're
just smart. Now Skylar is similar to Colson. They're out there, they're flying
around, and they're very similar to what they like to do. But the post
players, I think size-wise we match up a little bit better than what we did
against Stanford with the size. God, Stanford was just so huge.  
What was happening, Danielle, we had to convince her to use her mid-range game
instead of her low post game, because they were building a campfire around her
there. So she had to get the shots there.  
Notre Dame runs their stuff. And what's good about Notre Dame, it's a five-
person team, not a one-person team, and all five people can score.  
If somebody's not hot, they use her as a screener or defensive player, and
that's the way this team is here.  
So I think you're going to see balance. That's why you have all five starters
up for both teams. They all deserve the questions from y'all. Because they've
got the answers. They have the answers, their style, and one and two kids from
the bench, that's all you'll see.  
Okay. This kid's already gone 80 minutes, and she'll go another -- I think
she's played just about every minute of almost every ballgame in the playoffs,
and she'll go a little bit harder. And I want that one down on the end to get
40 minutes out of her, too, without making this a little bit grayer. Okay?  
But, you know, she made that behind-the-back pass. We've seen it before. We've
seen it completed. And I about went bananas.  
But I knew she would come back in and make the right read at the right time
and the right play, and the pass was harder to make than the shot that Tyra
White made. So give credit to the pass, instead of the shot. The shot was good
because Tyra's the best kid we have at finishing on the driving layup.  
  
Q. Coach, what you were talking about whether this is good for the game? Can
you talk about the balance between name recognition teams and new faces, and
is it time that the game can get beyond just maybe a name and a player that
everyone will recognize, like UConn and Maya Moore?  
COACH BLAIR: Maya Moore has done so much to this game, just like Geno has done
for the game and everything. And how can you not love what Maya Moore brings.
And all of you out there are all disappointed that Maya's not in the finals. I
know it, unless you're from Notre Dame or whatever, because she's such a
beautiful person and a beautiful player.  
I read the U.S.A. this morning, and Christine did a great article on Stanford
and four years they've gone through. But that story was supposed to be the
winning story, but all of a sudden that was her -- I guarantee you that was
her story before the game even started.  
And so y'all have story lines to do whatever your editors or your Lou Grant
tells you to look for, but the 40 minutes of basketball, why does it have to
be decided on who the best player is or who is most well-known coach is?  
Now, look in your other sports. Look in the Tampa Bays that cannot even sell
out in baseball, but, my gosh, they've had great teams.  
Look at my Texas Rangers now, just swept the Red Sox three games in a row.
It's good for sports. It's good for story lines. Instead of having Brittney
Griner or Maya Moore and Geno, but what's wrong with good old Muffet and Gary
and who teams that play tremendous team basketball that do not rely on just
one player?  
  
Q. Both Sydneys, after the second game last night, Connecticut coach Geno
Auriemma said that Notre Dame was impossible to play defense against. I'm sure
his comment was made after the loss and everything. But that sounds like it
sets up perfectly for you guys considering your last two games have been kind
of mission impossibles. Is that the challenge of playing a team that's on a
roll like you guys? Is that something that kind of excites you at this time in
addition to playing for the national championship?  
SYDNEY CARTER: Definitely. I think that, you know, a lot of people -- I don't
want to say they fear our defense, but I think they really respect what we do
on the defensive end. And we take so much pride on the defensive end and
making people feel uncomfortable and making them do things that they don't
want to do.  
So I definitely think that worries them a little bit. And I just think we're
going to come out with the same defensive intensity that we always come out
with. And that's been so successful for us. So I don't see why we would do
anything different.  
And I just hope that we have that adrenaline rushing in us in this upcoming
game and we play harder than we normally play.  
SYDNEY COLSON: Basically the same thing Syd said. Just we're going to have to
come out and keep the same, you know, defensive tenacity that we've had all
throughout the tournament.  
The Stanford game was the first time where we were having to come from behind.
Every other game we had jumped on people from the beginning of the game and
played good defense, maintained our lead, and held our composure throughout
the whole game. It can't be anything different when we're playing for the
national championship.  
We have to go out and Coach Schaefer was telling us, we've gotten to this
point by doing what we've done, and it's worked for us. Don't change anything
that we've done thus far, because this is what's gotten us into this good
situation.  
So we'll have to come out, stay aggressive on defense. It's going to be a
physical game, I think they're just as physical as we are. And I think it's
just going to be an all-out battle, which it should be.  
  
Q. Coach, you might have believed since the beginning of the season you guys
could be in a national championship, but did you ever think it was going to be
against Notre Dame and did you think that anybody ever thought that the
women's national championship would be Notre Dame against Texas A &M?  
COACH BLAIR: Like I said, ESPN didn't envision it. But the thing is we're both
No. 2 seeds. We're both in the top ten all year. So what's the big story? I
mean, we've both done what we were supposed to do all year long. So give
credit.  
And what's the story in the men? No No. 1 seeds are there. And we played well,
we've done balanced scoring. Nneka had 30-something last night and Maya had
30-something. They're both going home. Both these teams have balanced scoring,
even though we have an All-American there but she'll defer to others when they
take her away and they were putting so much attention on her and we had other
kids step up. This kid's 5'6". The other one's 5'8". Look at the guard.  
I think the story today is two teams that do what they do well and they don't
worry about having the 35-point scorers and the great names of the game, the
story is Notre Dame and A&M. And if you all cannot remember some of our names,
that's good. But remember A&M and Notre Dame. Not Muffet and Gary. A&M, Notre
Dame. It's good.  
And if we can pull this thing off, it would be a great football rivalry we
need to get going. We just beat Notre Dame in tennis, I noticed the other day.
Okay. But we did win that game 4-0.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll dismiss the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Coach, I know that the crowd numbers were disappointing, and I know empty
seats are disappointing. Could you comment big picture on what you thought of
the venue, the site. There's been a lot of discussion ongoing about arenas
versus domes for this event and whether growing the sport needs the most seats
possible versus a packed, full arena, which obviously wasn't filled last
night.  
COACH BLAIR: I'm not really sure how they're going to spin why the arena --
they're blaming it on the four teams that were here. We get 800 seats, and you
have to turn around charters and tickets and everything to get them here this
short of a time.  
Notre Dame's the only local team. And I'm not sure how many tickets they've
sold. But it sounded like a lot more than Connecticut up in the stands last
night.  
And people like to pull for the so-called underdog. All the coaches that are
in the stands, the ones that didn't sell their tickets and come to the game.
We have our convention going on.  
And I'm all for the arenas. But I'm all for me being in whatever venue it is.
And if we can go back to where the Hoosiers played in their little gym,
whatever, and I like the arenas. I like to see it in American Airlines Center
in Dallas. I think that's a great venue right there.  
San Antonio was great. Do we keep going into areas just to justify the reason?
I'm very interested to see what's going to happen in Denver next year. That
scares me right there. So I'm hoping -- we've never been there before. It's
not a huge basketball state. And all of a sudden we're going to Denver just
because it's a name right now. I'm not sure that's going to work.  
Believe it or not, when we went to Tampa Bay, there was great crowds there, in
Tampa Bay, which was more of a baseball state or football state.  
And we have to make sure, not who has the best bid, but what is good for the
game to grow, where we should go. When we were here at the dome in 2005, I
think we averaged about 24,000 fans or something like that. But it didn't feel
good for the coaches or the players.  
Okay? I set up and watched both games and when Baylor won, and how many of you
all in the audience right now, raise your hand, can tell me who lost that
game? Okay? There's a few.  
They only remember the winners. Okay. I want to make sure you're going to
remember Texas A&M. And the only way you're going to remember Texas A&M is who
wins this thing.  
Okay. Who wins this thing. And we fought hard to get here. And I want to make
sure it's not just a feel-good story and it's a pat on the back or atta boy
thing when we get back to College Station. I want the whole nine yards.  
And we're going to work hard today in practice to get us to where we need to.
We've got to be smart in practice, because we gave a lot of energy last night.  
So it will not be your normal slam-bam practice. We have to do more of a
mental practice today than a physical practice.  
  
Q. Coach, you're saying how it's good for the game to have the two new teams
here and the new faces. Do you think the game's ready to have that situation?
Is women's basketball ready to have you in the national championship tomorrow
night or is it still at the point where it needs a Maya Moore or Brittney
Griner or a Pat or Geno?  
COACH BLAIR: I think it's needed if you all will write that story. I think you
all have got your choice of how you want to spin it, and it's going to be up
to you.  
Can a good women's basketball game that's going to be played between the ears
and below the rim excite the people out there enough to watch this thing. And
that's what it's all about.  
You look at the NBA, all the chosen stars are all going to the major cities to
play. And right now we're starting to spread it out a little bit more in
women's basketball instead of everyone going to Tennessee, Duke and
Connecticut, Stanford and a couple other schools.  
We're starting to spread it out. Look at the Baylors, and look at the Texas
A&Ms. They're getting it done. And look at the Notre Dames, and look at the
schools that are moving up that you've never heard before, the Gonzagas. It's
good for our game.  
It might not be good for your ratings or your newspaper lines but it's good
for the game. And so sometimes you have to go through the growing pains of
this to get to where we want to be, parity, where people would be excited
where a Butler and a VCU are playing for the national championship on the
men's side. We need that on the women's side as well, as long as it involves
A&M and somebody else.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about -- I saw where earlier this week you
talked about taking the job after they showed commitment to you. Can you talk
about where the Texas A &M program has come from and what's changed in that
program since you started back in 1982?  
COACH BLAIR: In '82 when I was at Louisiana Tech, we just won it in the last
year, in '81, out in Oregon. Last year of AIW.  
And really that was NCAA, too, as well. It was just -- we just had to wait for
another year. The big programs of that time were Tennessee, ourselves, Old
Dominions and the USCs of the world and throw in a couple more that I'm
missing right now. The legend of the games on the front row here, you can ask
him about that, with Mel Greenberg. But the talent was good at the top, but it
was so average in the middle and it was very poor at the bottom.  
And now we've grown where our average, the middle is pretty good. Look at the
attendance. I looked it up last night. Notre Dame has played in 23 games of
over 7500 fans. 23 ball games that they've played already. That's good for the
game.  
Now we've got to get the middle of the pack to start drawing a little bit
better because they don't have the name stars. So they've got to be more
creative. Sort of like what Minor League baseball is doing now. Minor League
baseball is fan friendly and they're putting butts in the seats.  
We need to do that and be more creative in marketing our sport. We need to
spend money to make money, and a lot of programs do not do that. They will not
put enough money into women's basketball.  
Women's basketball grows in so many ways besides the dollar Bill. The revenue.
Every Aggie across the world has seen us in the top 25. Now in the AP poll or
USA Today poll for about six years. That helps the chemistry. That helps the
admission department.  
That helps Aggies all over the country feel good about themselves, the same
thing is happening in Notre Dame and the little Gonzagas.  
That's where we are right now. And hopefully we can keep it going. But men's
basketball, what did they say? 48 million here in this town when they had the
Final Four here, and they'll make 17 to 20 million here for the women's side.
That's where we have to go. So we're still getting a larger chunk than some of
the other sports.  
  
Q. Stepping outside a little bit to the bigger picture, there's some serious
money being committed to coaches' salaries at this level now and long-term
contracts. Could you speak to maybe what the market forces are that have led
to these contracts and do these contracts kind of validate now the women's
game within the bigger picture of an athletic department?  
COACH BLAIR: I think it's true, because you cannot measure it on dollars and
cents. We raised 24 million in nine months to put in our new practice facility
when Gillespie and I first got it going at A&M. It wasn't just all Gillespie.
It was women fans that wanted to donate because of women's basketball. It
wasn't just all from the men's side.  
The salaries, are they justified? You betcha they are. Just like the first
time all you writers back there, when Skip Bayless got his first paycheck and
you all were jealous way back. He's good. If you're good, pay the person.
Okay? Pay the person.  
They need to pay you guys a whole lot more, that's why my journalism minor at
Texas Tech, I decided to coach, because I knew what they were paying y'all.  
And I want everybody to feel good about their sport. Does a CEO deserve 65
million, probably not, but he's still responsible for that company of going to
the next level. And if he's earned it, go ahead.  
We just hired Nikki Caldwell down at LSU. That's a great hire down there.
Kevin McGuff going from Xavier to Washington. Very much needed, very
deserving. I think it's good. We're not even close to comparison to what's
happening on the men's side. But we're still earning our right.  
Look at the coaches that have been up here at the top. We're finally getting
decent paychecks. And it's fun. And I have to have some of those paychecks
myself as well, because I've got 13 relatives here and they're all on my
ticket. So I've got to keep winning.  
  
Q. Do you think it's fair that women are held to a higher EPR standard than
the men, or perhaps that maybe is a good thing?  
COACH BLAIR: The higher what?  
  
Q. EPR.  
COACH BLAIR: Yes. Yes and no. You can go either way on that. That's a Catch-22
thing. There's not a right answer for that. I just think women, coaches or
women administrators, I think they're very good, and I think that's why you're
seeing women in this world continue to grow. I think it's good for our
country.  
I think some day we're going to see a woman president, very quick, or a woman
vice president. And it's needed. I'm all for it. I'm part of the minority. I'm
in the women's sport even though I'm a man coaching, but I'm in the minority
part of our sport. But I'm proud to be in it. I chose women's basketball.
Women's basketball did not choose me.  
I chose it in high school when the girls came over next door to the boys' gym
and asked me if I would take the job while I was waiting around for a baseball
job. I chose it and I've never gone back, and all the way from when I left
making 22,000 in high school to taking Louisiana Tech at 22,000, in 1980.  
And then it's been good since. Andy, I don't know if I answered that one. I
probably butchered that one. But if we want to talk about it a little bit
later, but I appreciate your coverage, what you're doing.  
  
Q. You mentioned the other day that obviously Texas A &M is known as the
football school, and now of course you have two schools playing for the
national title that have predominantly known as football schools. Can you
just, from your end of it, from the years that you've been there, talk about
specifically the difficulties in getting people to pay attention to something
else in a place where football is like religion?   
COACH BLAIR: You know, it's sort of funny, spring football is going on at the
same time. Our baseball team is very, very good. They just changed the start
of the baseball game on Tuesday night to 5:00 because we were going to be on
TV at 7:00. Could you picture that happening?  
I mean, I'm all for the Digger Phleps and Shelby Metcalfs. And some of you
might not remember Shelby, but he was the men's coach for so long at A&M. And
it's good to see those schools be recognized for something besides football.
We're not going to put 80 something thousand in like we do for every football
game, and Notre Dame, that's one of my bucket list things also, I've always
wanted to see a Notre Dame football game in person.  
But eventually I'll get there. But the question is, are these schools --
Stanford, Ohio State, the Tennessees, the Floridas of the world, the Texases
of the world, have all been the complete package over the years. They've been
good in every sport.  
Texas A&M finished sixth in the Sears Cup last year. We're doggone good in a
lot of sports and it all starts from Bill Byrne. He's our athletic director.
I'm his first hire. He came in '03. I came in '03. And he said we're going to
have a total program while we're building football back to the level. So
instead of putting all our resources into one sport, we put them into all
sports and use the tradition of A&M to build up everything else that we had.  
That's what separates A&M from so many other schools is the traditions that we
have. It's not the military as much of the core, it is just we support -- we
support women's sports as well as we do men's sport. Our attendance in
national softball, soccer, I think we're number two in attendance in soccer.
Softball we're in the top 10. Basketball we finished No. 12 behind Notre Dame.  
But we used to be dead last when I took the job. We were averaging about 300
people a game, and those are usually family members.  
And that was it. When I took the job there, we were 12th, out of 12 teams. And
probably 13th, we were probably behind the conference office at that time.  
But it's what we are. It's what we are, and we share. The e-mails I'm getting
from the other coaches, that means more to me than the e-mails that I'm
getting from the fans, because some day it's going to happen to each of those
coaches at A&M.  
They're going to get their chance at this level. But now you've got to figure
a way to make it go.  
I'd like to see what the Rose Garden looks like. I'd like to see what Disney
World looks like. Okay. All those things are very important. But they go to
the winners, not the teams that finish in second.  
  
Q. You said spring football is going on now. Is playing for the national
championship tomorrow night, would this be a bigger story than the ongoing
spring football?  
COACH BLAIR: Not on the hits -- Homer can probably tell you that. The hits
that go on in spring football and recruiting versus a men's basketball story
or equestrian or women's basketball, it's mindboggling. Right now football is
the number one sport in the country as far as that.  
But the best story might be basketball, because of the entertainment value
that we're presenting to people. It's for everyone. People sit down, but let
football do its thing while the rest of us are continuing to grow.  
How many of you have ever covered a soccer game? How many in this room can
tell me what an off-side trap is in soccer? Not too many of you. But we're
growing. Remember when y'all used to make fun of soccer and everything?  
Now we're putting great crowds. It's going to continue to grow, and so is
women's basketball. Football is still out there. I love it. I never miss a
game. Never miss a game.  
I'm the biggest Dallas Cowboy fan in the whole world. Can tell you all the
history, the whole nine yards. But there's time for other sports. But now the
seasons are so long, now we're overlapping.  
When we overlap that's generally when I go on the road to play road games in
November, December, because I do not want to be there when football's still
going on. I'll usually play one game a week but I do not bring in a lot of
buy-in teams because we will not draw well. I'd rather go on the road, get the
RPI points, make my team better by playing in the situations and the venues we
have to go to.  
  
Q. A few years ago you remember, of course, when Baylor and Michigan State
played. Purdue and Notre Dame had been national champs and some of us were
trying to see maybe if there was more equalizing going on in the women's game
and more schools we would expect to see winning the national title. Of course,
as you know, there was a run for UConn and Tennessee. They kind of came back
to the top, bubbled back to the surface in a big way. Is this maybe the time
now with what's happened over the last two weeks where women's basketball is
really seeing the true parity that many have thought might exist almost 40
years after Title 9?  
COACH BLAIR: I think that happens when you see a Skylar Diggins stay home and
go to Notre Dame instead of going to the Connecticut which probably finished
second on that or Tennessee. They're either always second, third, or first.
They're never last.  
I think it's also very good for the game. And to see the Courtney Vandersloots
stay on the West Coast and play at Gonzaga. Right now, why not have these
stars -- we all want to win championships, but sometimes the conference
championship is large because we're here for four years.  
We do not have the one-and-out kids. The one-and-out kids, that's not good for
the game of men's basketball. Men's basketball, gosh, that's a great game.  
And look at the money that it generates everywhere. But I wish they'd change
that rule in the men where they could not leave after one year. At least two.
Three would be mindboggling, but that's not going to happen, because of the
egos and the money that's involved.  
But in the women's game, isn't it great that Brittney Griner is going to be
here for the next two years? But isn't it also great that little 5'6" Sydney
Carter is going to be here for another year, and y'all are going to be doing
research and saying: What's Sydney all about? Where did she come from? DeSoto
High School, same high school as Von Miller who will be drafted hopefully by
my Cowboys in the first round.  
But that's what we need now. We need some of these little stories instead of
the sensationalism stories. You remember back in the early '80s, South
Carolina ended up beating my old school Stephen F. Austin to get to the Final
Four and all you heard about was Pam Parsons and the stories afterwards
because that's all Sports Illustrated wanted and you writers wanted. You
wanted the dunk. You wanted to lower the rim.  
You wanted everything different than the story of the game itself. It's pure.
It's pure. It's good. It is true. We're not getting paid under the table.
We're not doing all this stuff that is going on now in the men's game. We're
not having to do that. And hopefully, if it ever happens, I'm sure the hell
out of it, retired on the golf course, because I want no part of it.  
We police ourselves very well with the coaches and this association. There's
no major scandals in women's basketball and hopefully we can keep it that way.  
I don't know if I've answered your question, but I am a big fan of yours.  
  
Q. Yesterday you were talking about how you were able to chop down
Stanford's trees that you had to go up against. Tomorrow night you face a very
talented Notre Dame back court. Talk to me about how you're going to prepare
your team and your game plan for that.  
COACH BLAIR: They don't make a lot of mistakes. You're looking at teams
shooting 48 percent. They're shooting it in the playoffs as well as they shot
it during the season. So they haven't changed whatsoever. Everything is the
same.  
You go across their stat sheets all year long, they've just been consistent.
Two years ago we were at Notre Dame to play in the first and second round. We
beat somebody, Evansville I believe in the first round, first time ever, and
we were supposed to play Notre Dame.  
Notre Dame got upset by Minnesota. But you could see Notre Dame was going to
get better and better and better. And now look at what they're proving. They
do not get down by losing in a round, they get better by coaching their kids
up.  
And that's what we have to do, because Muffet hasn't had a whole lot of
Skylars. Okay? I've got one coming in next year, Kelsey Bone, number two
ranked kid in the country. She went to South Carolina, I got her on the
rebound, a Houston kid.  
I haven't been getting kids like that. I've been getting the junior college
Danielle Adams or the Tanisha Smiths or the kids we've coached up.  
Tyra White was the only McDonald's All-American sitting up here. The only one
out of the five up here. And I imagine Skylar's the only one on Notre Dame.  
And we coach kids up. That's the strength of what we have. My coaching staff
is damn good. Okay? My luck, who was it, Carol Owens, today, if you hadn't
written in this story, she ruptured her Achilles in practice. She was a great
player at Notre Dame, the whole nine yards.  
I promise you, I will not rupture my Achilles because I quit doing drills
about seven, eight years ago. But those are good stories.  
We want to sell what we have right now. It is going to be a game, a pure game.
Remember -- no, you're too young. You remember back when Connecticut got to
the Final Four for the first time in New Orleans? Nobody knows who the hell
they were.  
You couldn't tell me the five starters, okay, because they were not household
names. But the media is not as good as what it is now. Now people are going to
know who my two Sydneys are, because these two Sydneys take the basketball
away from them. They're going to make it in life.  
Whatever they decide to go into, and hopefully they do not go into coaching --
I don't think either one of them -- because they're going to make it as top
women CEOs somewhere in the country. It's going to be very special.  
And, by the way, that was a good article in the Indianapolis Star yesterday on
the Stephanie White and the four other young ladies that they interviewed what
are they doing now, some are in marketing, some are in anything that has to do
with basketball or sport. And it was good because I read those stories to my
kids. I've read those stories and say there is life after basketball and you
do not have to be a pro basketball player to do it.  
I'm sorry I'm long-winded, but, folks, this is my moment, and I'm going to
seize it.  
  
Q. This is a national media stage. What do you think the misconceptions are
about Texas A &M as a university and as an athletic program?  
COACH BLAIR: I think we need to do a better job of marketing Texas A&M as a
whole instead of marketing just one sport or one band or even the secretary of
defense in Bob Gates. We need to realize what we are.  
It's marketing. Exposure. It's getting people out there to sell it, because
I'm tired of going in to airports and seeing all Texas and Michigan and UCLA
and even Miami stuff over Texas A&M. If we've got 50,000 students we need to
find a way to sell Texas A&M as a whole a lot better instead of whatever sport
is in season.  
That's something I've been on my soapbox for a long time on that. And
everybody says yes, yes, but we've got no direction on how to solve that. And
I think Texas A&M is a school that everybody loves. It's sort of like an Army-
Navy football game; everybody loves that game because of the spirit and the
tradition and red, white and blue.  
But let's enjoy A&M for what it is. It is an all-purpose university that is
tremendous in education. It is tremendous in all the sports that we're doing.
We're in the top 10 in 10 out of our 20 sports right now. Let's give credit to
what is done. Let's give credit to our leaders, from our president on down to
our AD, to all the support staff that works with us.  
Now, I want to sell A&M. I do not want to have to explain A&M to a person from
Connecticut or a person from Gonzaga. I want to be able -- that they're going
to know who we are and what we've accomplished.  
And a lot of that has to do with the media, but a lot of that has to do with
us and marketing.  
  
Q. Given what you and Notre Dame saw night after night January, February, as
opposed to some of the other big names in their conferences this year, how
important is it and what kind of exercise really to get you over this level?  
COACH BLAIR: Well, remember back in the days when we were at Louisiana Tech,
we didn't even have a conference. We would just go play four games on the West
Coast in a week, day off between every one. We'd play Long Beach, USC, UCLA,
Vegas. One week time, get back to class. Then we'd go to the East Coast and we
would play Georgia, Clemson, Maryland and Old Dominion, one other school in
there. Could you picture schools doing that now?  
We did it to save money, but then we also did it to find the competition. Now
we find it -- we're going to a 10-team conference. We're losing two teams that
were near the bottom this year in Colorado and Nebraska.  
So we've been getting seven to eight teams into the same as the Big East. Is
that nine, is that right? In the women?  
Is that good for the game? We do not have a bottom in our conference. Okay?
How can you say Nebraska is at the bottom when they were 31-0 last year until
we beat them in the semifinals? That's what makes us stronger, is the parity,
the coaching, within the Big 12 is very good.  
Nobody leaves the Big 12, Mel, unless they're asked to leave. Nobody. The
other conferences come to us.  
Not just because of the pay, because of the attendance and because of the
recruiting base that we have in that Midwest corridor right there,
particularly in the southwest corridor that we can get kids to come.
Basketball is very important to the ten schools that are left. But we're going
to have to play 18 games next year.  
That's like the NFL. They have to play 18 games. That's stupid. But we're
going to play it and have a conference tournament.  
Now, will we have enough gas left once we get to the playoffs to be able to
continue to play at the level that we're playing right now? Because I cannot
see the teams that finish 9 and 10 in our league are going to hold us back.
They're going to make us better. But it is going to drive us bananas because
right now January and February it's the 60 longest days that you can ever --
and the 60 shortest nights as a coach, and it is tough.  
And it's a grind, grind, grind. Maybe that's why I'm doing a commuter marriage
right now because my wife probably doesn't want to be with me during those two
months right there, because it's all preparation, it's all recruiting. It is
all game planning, and it's dealing with 18- to 22-year-olds and the problems
that they have in life.  
And believe me, they have a few problems. But we adjust. But us 65-year-olds
have a few problems, too, okay. But the most important thing I do, Mel, to get
myself ready, I go to a movie the night before I play or the night after I
play, and I've been sneaking in on that from 58 years old on on that senior
discount, and I go in and get a box of popcorn. I sit by myself over in the
handicap and I lose it for two hours.  
I lose it and get into fantasy world and watch a Julia Roberts or Tom Cruise
or something.  
And that's the only way I can get through it. Other than that, because there's
so much parity right now, there used to be a bottom of the league. And when I
was in the SEC, the SEC was at the top.  
Now it is the Big 12 and probably the Big East at the top. And I can't see
that changing.  
  
Q. Could you talk a little bit about the job your support staff, your
managers, trainers, all them have done during the season and especially in the
tournament?  
COACH BLAIR: Sometimes those are some of the best stories that nobody ever
asked them. I'm glad you asked that question. I've got one young lady, walk-on
who is on scholarship this semester, that owes $64,000 in student loans.  
Okay? That's Catherine Snow, but she wanted to be an Aggie instead of going
and playing Division II or junior college ball where her ability lied. So she
didn't have the rich parents. She had the grades. She's getting there. She's a
great story.  
I've got five managers that -- all five of my managers this year are all
female. They're all excellent kids. They don't come out there to be so-called
men's practice players that serve as managers like some schools cheat on.  
I've got a separate men's basketball practice squad that comes in along with
Kelsey Bone, who is sitting out this year. All those kids, the student
trainer, I love her to death. I can't even tell you her full name, but she
gives me a smile every morning.  
Those kids, my director of basketball ops, Eric Burts, he's got to handle all
of this stuff. He has to handle the money, the logistics, where we're going,
whatever. The Steve Millers, Charlotte Millers and video coordinators,
assistant AD, they have to handle all the little stuff to keep me atune.
Miller tells me every morning: You're going to be here, be here, you gotta
spin that, don't talk too long on that, talk about A&M as a whole.  
I feel like I'm Obama and I've got to have the research to be able to say the
right words sometimes to y'all. And that's what -- last night, it was funny. I
was walking across. Condoleezza Rice was sitting there in her Stanford thing.
And I shake hands with Tara VanDerveer, and I point towards her, giving her a
little salute, being an ex-Marine, and I said: We've got the Secretary of
Defense in Bob Gates. I told Tara. And Bob Gates' wife was at our game. Bob
doesn't get into sports as much as his wife. His wife, Becky, is our number
one fan, and she flew in from Washington just to see the ballgame.  
So it's all the little stories that you see in the women's side that's so
important. But all that support staff, they work so hard. Look at what -- a
lot of times, like when I was at Arkansas, when we would get beat in the
second round, they'd come into the press conference and wanted to see if our
band or our cheerleaders could advance, or our mascot, because we would win
that -- we're winning it here.  
Our Yell Leader won the mascot competition. I hate to call our Yell Leader a
mascot, but that's all we have. Don't have a mascot. We have Reveille who
doesn't travel in basketball. But we want to win that. We want to win
everything we possibly can.  
  
Q. You were talking before about the difference between -- you were saying
before basically there's no No. 1 season on the men's side. Is there a
difference in terms of perception you think that when there's no Tennessees or
UConns in the women's side in terms of an upset is a bad thing in women's
basketball?  
COACH BLAIR: I don't think it's a bad thing. I don't think that either game
was upsets last night. When the 2 beats a 1, come on now, those weren't
upsets.  
I think Notre Dame is playing so well down the stretch right now. I mean,
she's had to go through, Sheri Coale, Pat Summitt and Geno Auriemma. That says
a lot for Notre Dame.  
I've only gone through Vivian Stringer, Andy Landers, Kim Mulkey, who am I
missing now? Tara VanDerveer. I mean, those are our heros.  
If I was collecting baseball cards right now, which I used to, I would have
those cards. And so that gives you a high right there competing against people
of that caliber at this level.  
That is very important to me and still growing myself as a coach, learning
from them, getting back to the film and seeing the mistakes that I made as a
coach or my point guard and how can I relate those to those kids where we can
make a one-day turnaround preparation time.  
We've got to be able to do it. Now it becomes mental. After we get finished
with all you guys and gals, we've got to go and forget our fans. The best
thing they do now, they put a policeman up on the floor where your team stays
now, to keep all the relatives away and the fans.  
We've come a long way. Okay. But you have to have that. We eat breakfast down
at the basement there to just be away from our fans.  
You want to love them. You want to hug them. You appreciate the money that
they spent, but it's time for rest and focus right now.  
  
Q. How much of a breakthrough is this for your program? And also curious,
what was the last movie you got to see?  
COACH BLAIR: Last movie? Last movie. Hold on. I didn't like Jennifer Anison's
last movie. I didn't think it was up to her caliber. Oh, gosh. The best one is
what I flub up. "Kings Speech." Absolutely the best movie I've seen in a
couple of years, and the greatest acting job.  
And it makes you feel as a coach sometimes, when I could get up here and
butcher the English language, that a king can get up there and go through the
troubles that he had to get to the point where he would feel comfortable
addressing the media.  
Okay. Now that to me I could sit back and I could watch that and then I could
think of myself in those situations, where I see somebody like a Bill Clinton
or Obama or any of the politicians that were so good. They can just talk off
the cuff. And I admire people that can do that.  
I grew up in the Paul Harvey days where he was a great reader. But somebody
had to write it out for him. But then I love to see people that have that
great command of the English language right now.  
And if I could go back to school at Texas Tech and I studied under two
University of Missouri professors that told me every day that Missouri was
better than Texas Tech, even though they taught at Texas Tech -- haven't
figured that out yet -- but I want to learn -- and it's not too late at my age
to sit there and learn how to have better communication skills, be able to
walk into a room like a Pat Summitt and can hold a room and make everybody in
that room feel just as important, whether you're a student newspaper reporter
or a junior high coach, to a college coach, to a big CEO.  
She has that ability. So I learn from my peers. I watch you guys. I read your
stories. Some of them are great. And you're never given enough credit for what
you write. The printed word is just so important out there.  
I do not use a computer. I have learned how to use whatever you call it on my
hip there. I've got an iPhone now. I've gone up. Two months ago I got an
iPhone. I just learned how to text about two months ago.  
After the game, I had 193 messages. I hadn't cleared them all because it takes
me too long. I have to go one finger and do all that. I'm still learning. This
is a breakthrough for Gary Blair or Texas A&M right now. Gary Blair's been
here before. I just haven't won it all, except -- it's a breakthrough for
Texas A&M and the Big 12 conference.  
Last year Oklahoma and Baylor both got to the Final Four and neither one of
them won the conference tournament or the conference championship. Nebraska
and A&M won those two. So it shows you how strong our league is, and that's
very important to me is to give credit to our other coaches in our league,
because they're very good.  
As soon as I got to the room, Debbie at Kansas State sent us a big flower
arrangement and everything like that. Those are coaches that even though we
compete so hard against each other, we know how to say, hey, good job. Job
well done.  
  
Q. Going back to the comments you made about the salaries and the marketing
spending money to make money, how realistic do you think it is for an AD to
say, okay, I'm going to spend this money on your program, your budget every
year, your salaries for you and your assistant coaches, to if not make money,
at least get attendance, do those sorts of things to create a larger buzz in
the community, the sorts of things that are in a men's coaching contract, do
you see those things starting to potentially creep in with the more money
that's being spent?  
COACH BLAIR: I think that's right. And I think as coaches, as politicians or
whatever, we need to become more accountable. We need to give back more to the
game and to the community.  
That is my strength. I'm everywhere, whether it's I've been a rotarian for 20
years. I speak at every group. I speak free. I'm not in that big speaking
bureau that they get 10,000 for each speech and all that. I've never been paid
for a speech in my life. I'm not sure if I would take it, though.  
But at the same time I want to go out into the community. Too many coaches
think their job is just winning and losing, and entertaining a few of the big
money people that are supporting your program. You need to go to the other
events.  
Tom Crean was here watching the game last night, sitting over there by the
Stanford section over there. I love to see other head coaches come to other
sports. Can you make that time? Can you divide your family time with your
official duties of being a head coach? Are you doing it because it's expected
or is this part of your personality? And I think that's where we have to grow
our game in marketing.  
No matter how much money they give you, the head coach of that sport and the
assistants and a couple of the top players need to continue to give back in
the community world.  
We do that all the time. At 8:00 tonight, we're winning the award, the Kyale
(phonetic) award for the number one school in the nation that donated back to
the Kyale award. And that's very special.  
We will be there. No matter what our preparation time is, we will be there at
8:00 to receive that award, because we worked very hard at that.  
We sold our jerseys afterwards in an auction. We had to go by the NCAA rules.
You cannot have your name on the back. Danielle Adams' jersey went for
$10,000. Sydney Colson's went for 75. We raised 34,000 there just on 14
jerseys.  
And then what the usual things that we do for the Kyale fun run. Those things
are important. But then that's all part of A&M giving back.  
With the salaries being given to us now, I've got three coaches in my league
that are making over a million dollars. They're worth it to their university.
Okay? Sheri Coale, Gail and Kim Mulkey, they are worth it, particularly Kim at
Baylor, because they're not winning in too many other sports at Baylor, but
Kim Mulkey's got almost a lifetime contract that they can't afford to buy out
if they even wanted her to go somewhere else or she wanted to go.  
Why not? It's good. I have no buyout in my contract. My AD and myself, he
knows this is my last job, and I'm going to go as long as I'm productive. And
if I'm not productive, then I'm going to step aside and hopefully my assistant
coach, Vic Schaefer, will be able to have that job.  
  
Q. Question about Sydney Colson. You talk about a breakthrough for Texas A
&M and maybe other players, but Colson has a chance to finish out her career
against Pohlen who is highly regarded and Skylar Diggins, just what do you
think that means for her as a point guard who you've seen develop who hasn't
gotten the national recognition, typically, who is just kind of now getting
it?  
COACH BLAIR: Before we came over here, we had breakfast. And we watched the
breakdown, offensive breakdown of the game. And Coach Schaefer was going
bananas. We need to show Notre Dame.  
I said, no, we need to show our team success and failure. Sydney Colson needs
to sit there and look at the turnovers that she made and a couple of the bad
decisions, and the good decisions.  
And we go over that. And that's what Sydney has to realize. Now she's in going
against these kids that are not freshmen like Odyssey Sims or some of the
other young ones that were great during the season but not as great during the
playoffs. Seniors are going to lay it out there on the table, because it's
their last hurrah.  
Sydney Colson is not going to be drafted in the first round. Pohlen is not
going to be drafted in the first round. Hopefully they get a chance to
continue to play, but their job, they're the CEO of their basketball teams.
They are accountable. They are responsible. They're an extension of myself,
and we have to be on the same page.  
And I'm only as good as my point guard. And I'm also very partial to Indiana
point guards because I had two of them at Arkansas that called every play for
me for eight years. And so I'm glad to be playing for a national championship
in the state of Indiana, where basketball was born.  
And it is respected more than football is. So I think that's very important
that people around here need to embrace it. If it's more important than
football, where are you, Indianapolis? Where are you, fans? Let's come in from
the little small towns, and let's just enjoy basketball. Pick a team to cheer
for, but let's get out there and just have a great time on Tuesday night.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Texas A&M  63  
Stanford - 62

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Stanford student-athletes Kayla Pedersen,
Melanie Murphy, Nneka Ogwumike, and Coach Tara VanDerveer.  
We'll take an opening statement from Coach VanDerveer and then questions for
the student-athletes.  
COACH VANDERVEER: First, I want to congratulate Texas A&M. They really
battled. We had them down, and we didn't knock them out. Their defense was
extremely disruptive. They worked very hard. But I also want to compliment our
team and how hard they played. And especially I thought Melanie Murphy really
came in and did a great job for us, kept us in the game, made great plays.
Free throws down the stretch. You know, knocking down her perimeter shot.  
And Nneka and Kayla really battled inside. This is really tough for our team.
But I'm really -- I'm very proud of everyone in how hard they worked and all
the things we've accomplished this year.  
So congratulations to Stanford and also good luck to Texas A&M.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. Kayla, why do you think you had them down but couldn't knock them out?  
KAYLA PEDERSEN: Well, I think we really jumped on them at the end. We had a
few good runs. We finally found our offensive flow, and then we got a couple
of calls going their way, a couple of missed charges. And I think they just
got the rhythm.  
I mean, we did our best. We had our plays set up. But it just didn't work out.  
  
Q. Melanie, as hard as you played, that last foul, looked like two people
going for the ball. Was that a tough call to accept?  
MELANIE MURPHY: I guess just being my last foul, obviously I didn't want to
leave the game, and it's the last game of my career. So I guess they called it
how they called it. And fifth foul, you're out of the game.  
  
Q. Kayla, how tough is this, just losing your final game and not being able
to win a national championship?  
KAYLA PEDERSEN: It's hard. I mean, it's an awful feeling. But I was just
telling Nneka that -- I'm going to choke up -- it's not hard -- the hardest
part isn't losing the game, it's just leaving these girls.  
And I just thank God for every opportunity I've had with these girls over the
last weekend, four years, and it's been wonderful. So, I mean, I'm happy to be
with them right now and I'm happy to lose with this team, if we did have to
lose.  
  
Q. Nneka, A &M made no secret they were going to try to pressure the ball
and disrupt as much as they could. Were you surprised at how effective they
were?  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: Not at all. We watched a lot of video. And we saw that
their offense was their defense. They get a lot of steals. They get a lot of
turnovers. And they produce by turning the ball over.  
And I think that we tried our best to really kind of find our way around it.
It became a little bit more disruptive at the end, and I definitely give them
kudos for that defense. It was really hard to get open. And we really tried
our best.  
  
Q. Kayla, you guys seemed to have a lot of trouble in-bounding the ball. I
counted four straight possessions where there was either turnover, you had to
burn a time-out, or in one case the ball off the hands of somebody but not
very firmly in the hands so that led to a problem. What were they doing that
was so different from what you've seen the rest of the year?  
KAYLA PEDERSEN: It wasn't necessarily different. Like their defensive
alignment, they were fronting and facing us and putting somebody at half
court. So off the in-bounder. And we just had a hard time with their pressure.
And I think we burned a lot of time-outs doing that and that really hurt us.  
But they were just fast and they were aggressive. And they kind of had the
momentum going on defense down at that end, and that really hurt us.  
  
Q. Nneka, certainly you've had a fantastic offensive game. What was working
for you and then when you got that late basket, you feeling pretty good about
your chances at that point?  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: Honestly, I just think of the game play-by-play. At the end
of the game, honestly, when it comes down to it, whatever my team needs, I'll
do. And we ran a play that got me open on the block, and so I knew I had to
produce somehow.  
In terms of the game that I played, I wasn't even conscious of what was going
on. All I know is that we were trying our best to extend the lead. It doesn't
matter who put the ball in.  
I think one thing that we kind of relied on towards the end of the game was
not necessarily going to a certain person, but whoever was open should go.  
And I think we really, really relied on each other towards the end but it
didn't really work out. And I definitely think that Texas A&M is a really
excellent team.  
  
Q. Nneka or Kayla, can you address how much having Chiney in foul trouble
most of the game and out of the game at the end hurt your team?  
KAYLA PEDERSEN: It definitely hurt us. She gives us that fire and that
passion, the offensive skill and defensive stops.  
I think all of our fouls, the fouls on Mel, too, and it really hurt us. It
took away a good defensive player and an O-boarder. The people that stepped
in, Mikaela played great. Everybody that came in, they played great  
  
Q. Nneka, can you talk about the seniors and what it's going to mean to lose
them?  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: I mean, I could go all day right now. But I'll cut it
short. This is definitely one of the greatest group of girls I've played with.  
Like Kayla said, losing the game is hard, but losing them is even harder. Not
just as teammates but as friends. We spend every waking moment with each
other, and it's definitely been a really fun journey.  
We talked to the men's volleyball team before we came out to Indianapolis. And
they said that the most important thing isn't the end, isn't what -- either
what you're striving for or what happens. It's the journey there.  
And I wouldn't pick anyone else in the world to spend this journey with, like
Kayla said. I'd lose with this team any day over winning with another team.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, no doubt with a 3.3 seconds to go, what were you looking for in
that last time-out to see if you could pull out a victory here this evening?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Well, obviously we got in a problem after we scored. We
didn't get back and stop the ball, and then when they were able to score -- we
were looking to a pass to Nneka at the free-throw line, and obviously they had
two people back on her.  
And at that point Mikaela Ruef threw it anyway. But that was the play that we
work on, and it didn't run exactly according to plan.  
  
Q. When you were having such problems in-bounding the ball, did you consider
throwing a deep pass, trying to break Nneka or somebody else deep?  
COACH VANDERVEER: We did. But they were with her. You know, Jeanette went long
a couple times, and they were with her. You know, just Nneka went long. And
we've run different alignments, where we were looking to do that, but they had
either one or two -- they were back on them.  
And it was -- it was frustrating not to be able to get the ball in. And then
sometimes we'd get it in and then just mishandle it. Their defensive pressure
was very disruptive.  
But at the same time, you know, I think I was really proud of our team. They
really stayed poised. They worked as hard as they could. And we have a lead
with how much time -- what was the shot? How much time was left when we
scored? You know, we just -- we had it. And then we just really needed one
more stop.  
And I think their speed and just their quickness, and to their credit, they
stayed with things and were able to kind of take the ball right down. We
weren't back as fast as we needed to be, and we didn't get that last play.  
But we definitely struggled with their pressure. They got down in the first
half, and I thought Melanie Murphy was really the key to the game for us. And
Nneka, being able to go inside to Nneka.  
We made Jeanette a shooter. She hit some big shots for us. You know, I would
-- we were going to the basket. When they went -- they kind of -- they got to
the free-throw line really well in the second half. And we just, I think, fell
short.  
  
Q. What is Jeanette's status? What was the injury? And the follow-up is
about Chiney and how much you guys -- what happened with Chiney tonight?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I mean, I think Jeanette, I'm not sure exactly, I think she
turned her ankle.  
She played the whole game. And she was back there and she was in the scrum at
the end. So I don't know exactly what happened.  
Obviously she and Kayla are especially upset after kind of the end of the
game. You know, Chiney struggled. I think that young players, when they kind
of get on this stage -- and you look at their team, they're very experienced
and their experienced players made plays. And Chiney really struggled.  
Nneka, however, was a warrior out there. Made big play after big play. Mel
made big play after big play. I think that the physicality of this game was
something that we always know it happens in the Final Four.  
But you can't -- it was a lot more physical than games leading up to this
game.  
  
Q. Texas A &M got their largest lead pretty early in the first half, and it
seemed like your team couldn't quite break away. What made them so feisty, so
hard to just break away from?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Well, first of all, they are extremely athletic. They play
extremely hard. They get the loose balls. I thought, you know -- I thought we
played very well to get the lead.  
We had to do some things that we don't have to do all season long against
anyone else. And I thought our team really made -- they worked very hard to do
what we asked them to do.  
And then I thought we rebounded well in the second half for the most part. And
I think it came down to one play. It was unfortunate that they had had two
3-point plays when we were up 10. We had them down and we just couldn't knock
them out. And that was when at the same time when Chiney was fouling out, we
needed a little more help.  
  
Q. The first ten minutes of the game, my notes show that you were shooting
between 16 and 23 percent. You managed to turn it around, finish at over 50
percent shooting. Can you explain what changes you made that allowed you to
make that move and get back in action?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Well, we had to do something different offensively. First of
all, I thought Melanie Murphy came in and handled the pressure very well.
Jeanette really struggled with turning it over, not making good decisions.  
And the athleticism that Texas brought in their press was very disruptive. We
started screening and rolling Nneka inside. And people got her the ball, and
we were able to go back door a little more.  
A lot of times in the NCAA Tournament, it's about the matchups, and we knew
this was going to be a very tough matchup for us. And it proved to be too
tough.  
But, again, just the determination, I think the way people just stayed with
things really well, worked really hard, at the end of the game, I'll have to
watch it, maybe Toni should have been in there instead of Lindy, I'm not sure
who got beat in the full court, but their overall team speed and athleticism,
I think, kind of tipped the balance.  
  
Q. On the last layup by A &M with White, could you walk us through what the
breakdown was with that and how big was White for them tonight?  
COACH VANDERVEER: She was really big, especially early. It happened pretty
fast. We scored, and sometimes you have people on the court that you need
offensively to get the ball inside or make plays or know the play or set a
screen.  
And we didn't have any time-outs at that point. Not that I necessarily would
have taken one. But we didn't have Chiney in the game who is faster and
quicker than Mikaela Ruef. We didn't have -- maybe I should have put Toni in
the game. But Lindy is the one that set the screen to get Nneka open.  
And so I just think we just -- we needed just a little more extra effort just
to stop the ball and not allow them to get that point-blank shot.  
  
Q. How did you feel like you did against Adams?  
COACH VANDERVEER: How what?  
  
Q. How did you feel like you guys did against Adams?  
COACH VANDERVEER: She made a lot of free throws down the stretch. She did a
nice job at the free-throw line. I don't know that I agree -- I'll have to
watch the time they thought we took a charge on her.  
I thought people worked hard against her. She's an excellent player, and I
thought we neutralized her. And overall I thought people defensively did a
very good job.  
But we gave them the ball too much. We turned it over too many times, or we
missed some free throws. What, they're 10 for 10. And we needed people to make
some free throws.  
Chiney -- Jeanette is a 90 percent free throw shooter. And so in that kind of
game, one-point game, you need every free throw. You need to take care of the
ball better. We gave the ball back to them 22 times.  
So that was disappointing.  
  
Q. How hard is this just for you? I mean, this is another Final Four loss.
Personally, how do you feel?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I don't look at it that way at all. There's 332 coaches that
wish they were here even if they were to lose in the semifinal game. I'm
really proud of our team, to think that this team -- what we've gone through
and all the growth this team has had. You know, for me personally, it's not
about me. It's about them. They get -- I can have another chance, but this was
-- I feel bad for Kayla and Jeanette.  
They wanted this. They worked hard. They dedicated themselves and committed
themselves to this team and this program. And I can't say enough positive
things about them and what they've brought to Stanford and how proud I am of
them.  
So, I mean, I think coming to the Final Four is an awesome accomplishment.
What they've accomplished -- I'm, again, so proud of them. And they're
warriors, and I love coaching them, and I love them as people.  
And, again, it's not about me at all.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Notre Dame  72  
Connecticut - 63

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Notre Dame head coach Muffet McGraw and
student-athletes Skylar Diggins, Natalie Novosel and Becca Bruszewski. Opening
statement, Coach.  
COACH MCGRAW: I think this is my week for exorcising demons and getting over
the hump of some of the best programs in the game. This is an incredible
victory for our team and our program to beat a quality team with a great
player like Maya Moore.  
But I thought Skylar was just amazing, simply amazing today. Natalie Novosel
had a terrific game. We made big shot after big shot and we answered the runs.
We were resilient and just really did a great job at the defensive end and
rebounded really well in the second half.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. You talked yesterday about having to play the second half, that the
second half would be decisive. And unlike the previous games this year, there
was a 20-point swing in your favor in the second half. Can you sort of talk
about how you remained composed in the second half?  
NATALIE NOVOSEL: This team has grown up since the end of the season, and I
think Tennessee we really put together a 40-minute game. And against UConn we
hadn't done that, and tonight was the night we played hard for 40 minutes. We
were focused and composed.  
  
Q. Becca, you guys have played this team three times already. What did you
do differently tonight that -- was it something you saw on tape or anything
like that?  
BECCA BRUSZEWSKI: I think we were just more on help side. We weren't relying
so much more on Maya and what she could do, because she's a great player. But
we were really rebounding. I was trying to meet Dolson early so she wouldn't
get deep in the paint, because she's a great player. Once she gets inside,
you're pretty much in trouble.  
I think again just boxing out, playing physical and being in the right
positions at the right time.  
  
Q. Skylar, you've had some pretty impressive games in your career. But how
did you feel tonight? And where does this kind of rank? Like Coach said, it
was pretty amazing performance?  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: It's pretty high on my list. It's not the top. Just like Becca
said, what this team's been through all year and how we were able to grow so
much, and the key difference was keeping our composure. In the first half I
don't think we executed the offense too well, and I put that on me. I was
really upset at halftime.  
And we came out and we said we're going to execute. And in the back of our
minds or in the front of our minds were those three losses. So I just wanted
to make sure I stayed poised. And I like to be the voice of calm, even though
sometimes I was pretending. I was really nervous but they thought I was calm.  
As long as they could look to me as, oh, Sky's calm, she's good, and being
that point guard and putting everybody in the position.  
I thought Natalie did a great job scoring. And I thought we had some great
momentum buckets from Brittany, Becca, Dev and Ace as well.  
  
Q. Becca, a question for you. Just describe your mindset in those last
couple of minutes, becoming pretty evident you're going to win this game a
chance to win for the national title your final collegiate game. Can you talk
about that?  
BECCA BRUSZEWSKI: I went in, had been in foul trouble, went in with four
minutes left. Those three minutes flew by because the next thing I looked at
the clock and it was 1:18 and I was screaming at my teammates as they ran down
the floor like we got this, 1:18, fight for it. Especially Brittany Mallory
locking up on Maya Moore. We got this.  
And it was hard for me to stay composed the last minute, because senior year,
just really excited and beat two quality teams in Tennessee and UConn have
great programs. And it's just great.  
  
Q. Natalie, what goes on in your head when Skylar has a game like tonight
and how do you stay focused and finish with 22 points?  
NATALIE NOVOSEL: I think Skylar in the beginning kept us in the game. We
weren't really playing our game. We were letting UConn dictate the game for
us.  
And I think in the second half I was frustrated that I didn't contribute in
the first half. And I just came out being really aggressive. We got them on
their heels a little bit with foul trouble.  
And we were in the double bonus pretty early on, and we were able to take
advantage of that.  
  
Q. Natalie, you're a junior from Lexington. There's a junior from
Indianapolis at Butler. He's a junior. Both of you playing for national
championships, tomorrow tonight for Butler and Tuesday night, no doubt, for
you guys. Just your thoughts on a couple of the kids from Lexington, the
underdogs, playing for a national championship.  
NATALIE NOVOSEL: I remember Shelvin Mack. We were both runner-up for Mr. and
Mrs. Basketball. And I just remember we both felt like we deserved it.  
And so I think it's kind of interesting we kind of wanted it that way. But
he's come up huge making huge games in the national championship run.  
And I think, you know, just being aggressive and playing my game has been the
biggest thing for me.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Muffet, for only the second time this year, a team was able to sort of
get Maya off of her game. Could you sort of talk about what your defense did
to her to -- she shot 14 for 30, and obviously struggled even though she had
that late surge at the end.  
COACH MCGRAW: If that's off her game, then that's pretty amazing. She's an
amazing player. She single-handedly tried to will them back into the game. On
that stretch we were switching on screens, we tried a couple of different
ideas. We couldn't stop her.  
She made, I don't know, seemed like she scored except for that last basket by
Hayes all the points. She didn't shoot it quite as well from the 3-point line.
Tried to put Devereaux Peters on her, a little taller. Didn't seem to be quite
as effective.  
But I think we got everybody else to get out of their game a little bit more
and force Maya to have the pressure of carrying the team.  
  
Q. Muffet, Skylar had what I would say a pretty transcendent game. I imagine
this is what you expected when you recruited her, but could tonight have even
exceeded your own wildest expectations?  
COACH MCGRAW: I think the last two games she definitely has shown what she can
do and what she's capable of doing.  
I think it was great that she was chosen as an All-American, because I think
that was a great reward for her.  
And she played like one tonight. She did it all. She ran the team. She scored.
She made good passes, good decisions. Really single-handedly kept us in the
first half. She was our only offense in the first half. We were trying to
figure out a way to help her, and Natalie stepped up in the second.  
She's an amazing talent, and I would never doubt -- there's probably nothing
she can't do when she puts her mind to it.  
  
Q. Can you talk about what Natalie Novosel gave you in the second half to be
so limited in the first half with the early two fouls?  
COACH MCGRAW: Got into early foul trouble, and that definitely made her
tentative. She didn't want to drive the ball, and that's a big part of her
game. She came out in the second half determined to contribute. I think that
was the biggest thing. She wanted to score. She wanted the ball. We ran a
bunch of stuff for her to get the ball. Her and Skylar both shot it extremely
well.  
  
Q. There's been a lot of talk about the 2001 team, how it compares to this
team. How much did it feel like tonight that 2001 semifinals knocking off
UConn?  
COACH MCGRAW: The same, we weren't down as much. I think that team was down 16
before they came back to win the game.  
This team was down a little bit. But there's been a lot of parallels to that
season. And the championship team sent a card to the hotel with each player
and everybody associated with the team had a quote or something to say to the
girls.  
And, you know, they really appreciated it. There was some really good stuff.
And I think that tradition, carrying on that tradition was good for them.  
  
Q. In the past week because of all the parallels to that 2001 team, the
words like "fate" and "destiny" have been thrown around. After looking at what
this team did today and how they play, can you really still say that's the
reason?  
COACH MCGRAW: You know, I don't know. Because you look at the bracket and I'm
pretty sure nobody in America had Notre Dame playing Texas A&M in the final.
So I think we definitely earned it. I think we worked hard to get here.  
We certainly didn't have anything handed to us. And it was an amazing
accomplishment, I think, for this team. So I would say not as much fate as
hard work.  
  
Q. For the rebounding, especially in the second half, couple of questions
here, if you don't mind, please. The rebounding in the second half and then
Brittany and Natalie both knocking down a couple of 3s with about seven and a
half minutes to go, and right after that your young freshman named Natalie,
one of her field goals was on offensive rebounding. Your young freshman
stepped up.  
COACH MCGRAW: We talked about rebounding at halftime. It was a big key to the
game. We didn't do a good job in the first half. I thought Becca came out and
did a much better job in the second, Natalie Achonwa did a much better job.
The guards got in and rebounded a little bit more, we got some offensive
rebounds, only four in the first half. We held them down to one shot.  
I thought that was key. The back-to-back 3s were huge. And then Natalie hit
the turnaround jumper, got a put-back. And I thought for a freshman in the
Final Four game, played extremely well.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about how your team matches up to Texas A &M, give us
a look of what your thoughts are about that game?  
COACH MCGRAW: In some ways we're mirror images of each other because we've got
great guard play and pretty good defense. And they've got an outstanding
player in Danielle Adams. It's something that I haven't actually spent a lot
of time thinking about, and when I was watching them through the tournament, I
thought, boy, they'd be a really tough team to play.  
And be careful what you wish for, I guess. Now we got 'em.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Texas A&M  63  
Stanford - 62

  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us head coach Gary Blair, student-athletes Sydney
Carter, Danielle Adams, Sydney Colson and Tyra White.  
COACH BLAIR: How about those Aggies? This is what women's basketball needs. It
needs regional final games and semifinal games and final games like this to be
able to sometimes wake up America, to be able to give us credit when credit is
due.  
You saw two very good ball clubs out there, play with their heart out there.
You saw two All-Americans in Nneka and Danielle play as hard as they possibly
could. Sometimes Nneka is very underrated with her defensive efforts, but she
played a great defensive game out there.  
You saw two senior point guards in Pohlen and Colson. One had six turnovers
and I believe their kid did as well. Seven.  
And so you don't realize how hard it is to run a ball club when there's great
defense, when they're taking certain options. And we're a set team. We don't
run a lot of true motion, even though we ran a couple of circle motion plays
that did work for us. And we were able to change and keep changing our
offense.  
54-44. Ten points. We haven't pulled off a win like that. You'll have to ask
the guy in the blue shirt back there, but it's been a long time. But our kids
refuse to give up and they refuse to play a team close and have everybody pat
us on the back.  
They went hard. Two great players at the end made great plays on their end.
Nneka on a great sideline play they came up, got it, and she made a tough
shot. Then we came right back down and jammed it down and Tyra went straight
to the hole. Both plays could have been and ones.  
But at that time the officials decided to let the kids decide, and both teams
made their plays.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Sydney Colson and Tyra, looked like you almost lost the ball in the free-
throw line when they threw it in. Can you take us through your part first then
Tyra finish it up?  
SYDNEY COLSON: She hit it a bit when I was circling, but I knew we needed to
jam the ball and get a score because we were down one. So I pushed it as fast
as I could than.  
Even though I had some turnovers earlier in the game this was crunch time and
I knew I needed to step up and make a play for our team. So Tyra was running
with me like we urge one another to do to run in transition.  
She was there I gave her a bounce pass, and she finished with two people
hanging all over her like monkeys in a gym.  
TYRA WHITE: I just seen her take off and I said I have to catch up really
fast. Then I started sprinting. I figured she was going to pass me the ball.
When she passed it to me, I just heard Coach Blair's voice in my head saying
pin the ball. So that's what I did. I thought the time was up, but it was like
three seconds left.  
  
Q. Sydney Carter, take us when you were down 10 in the second half, what was
going on in the huddle, no panic or what was going on there?  
SYDNEY CARTER: Never. I think that you guys know that we're the type of team
that never gives up, and I think that when I -- two big plays is when I got
the offensive foul and when we were pressing, and I got the ball and I hit it
off Pohlen.  
So I think that my energy definitely kind of sparked that run that we went on,
and I just give credit for my teammates for never giving up and I just think
that's the type of team we are. We have to make sure that ten points is
nothing in college basketball.  
So anybody can make a run at any time, and I think we made ours at the right
time.  
  
Q. Piggybacking off that, Tyra, you had nine points during that stretch.
Just discuss and describe the mood and just the belief inside those huddles.  
TYRA WHITE: We always believe in each other and everything like that. Coach
Blair drew up a play. I was kind of missing my shots. But after today I just
wanted to let it all go. It might be my last game in the Final Four. So you
never know what's going to happen.  
I just wanted to step up for my team and knock down crucial shots. When I had
the open layup, I just wanted to take it. But it was a great pass by Sydney. I
couldn't have did it without her.  
  
Q. Sydney Colson, you talked about the turnovers before, but on that last
play, did you think about taking it to the basket and not dumping it off and
not taking the chance of something going wrong there?  
SYDNEY COLSON: No, Tyra is a much better finisher than I am. She's taller. She
pins the ball better. And I just had to put the past turnovers I had behind
me. I knew what I was doing to get those. I was making not so hard passes, not
snapping the ball or pushing in transition and getting it knocked off my foot.  
I just needed to clear my mind. And Coach Schaefer was telling us before the
game a clear mind makes good plays. I let everything go that happened in the
past, that was negative, and just pushed the ball. And Tyra did an excellent
job for us on the pass, in the last minute or so.  
  
Q. Sydney Carter, your fourth 3-pointer of the evening cuts the score to one
and Sydney hit a couple of free throws, gave you a one-point lead. Your
thoughts on just being in the zone out there at the end of the game and what's
going through your mind?  
SYDNEY CARTER: Honestly, I didn't even know I was going to shoot the ball, but
when I shot it, I think I said a quick prayer, because I was like this better
go in or Coach Blair is going to be upset.  
But I am glad that I was able to step up big for the team and hit that shot.
And I think that gave us a little bit of momentum going into Sydney's couple
of free throws, and we knew that she'd go ahead and hit those free throws to
give us the lead and we knew we had to have a defensive stop. I'm just glad it
went in. Such a relief. Whew.  
COACH BLAIR: I wouldn't have been mad at you because you have another 40
minutes to play. So you're not coming out.  
SYDNEY CARTER: I was tired.  
  
Q. Sydney Colson, for a while there, a couple minutes in the second half
looked like you might not even back on the court to make the plays at the end
of the game. Just talk about that play where you ran into the screen and just
what was going through your mind at that point. And then coming back in the
game.  
SYDNEY COLSON: She set a good screen to clear up their point guard. And I
didn't see it coming. I turned and I hit it. And it just like hurt my neck a
little bit. So I needed to cool off for a little while.  
But luckily it wasn't anything serious. I was able to come back and contribute
what I could to the team. And this wasn't the -- this was by far the worst
game in the tournament I've had but luckily I have some really good teammates
who work hard for me. I work hard for them. And we have one another's back and
people stepped up at key times in the game.  
  
Q. Danielle, real physical game for you. Able to gut out 32 minutes on the
court. But first off, how are you feeling? And what exactly happened? And just
discuss the physicality that they played with tonight.  
DANIELLE ADAMS: I'm all right. Kind of tankless. Hopefully I can fill it up.
Nneka is a great player. All-American. Tremendous. Works hard to get her
position and I had to fight her for it a couple times and couple times it was
fouls.  
But it was two all-Americans going at it. And she did a tremendous job
tonight. And my teammates was there just to help me out and back me up. I
mean, we did a great job coming down the stretch, down ten, and we knew we had
to fight back. I knew I wasn't going to let my team just end at that point,
and they weren't going to end at that point.  
So we fell back and came back and got the lead and Tyra did a great job on the
play. Luckily she made it. If she wouldn't I really didn't want to get the
rebound. I was there, but I was hoping she would have made it.  
  
Q. Danielle, did you hurt your left hand? Were you at 100 percent the whole
time the second half. You took a couple of bad spills as well?  
DANIELLE ADAMS: I didn't hurt my hand. I got busted in the nose on the
rebound. But free throws was great. I just took my time. I mean, that's what
we always do, just use the same rhythm that you always use, don't try to
change it. Your stance on how you do free throws, do everything the same time,
and that's what I did.  
  
Q. Sydney Carter, how do you feel about defeating two No. 1 seeds in a row?
What does that do for the momentum of this ball club going into the
championship game? And the second part of the question is, how do you feel
about Tyra, who has been so steady during this tournament, double figures I
think every game in this tournament, and just talk about both those things.  
SYDNEY CARTER: It definitely feels great. I think it allows us to continue to
keep our confident attitude. And we're just glad that we survived another day.
And Coach Blair always says survive and advance.  
I think we took that attitude in there today. And you know, being down 10, we
never gave up. So I think that says a lot about our team, mentally and
physically.  
And even though our gas tanks are probably on E right now, I think that we'll
be ready. And our ultimate goal is to win the whole thing. So that's what we
have in mind.  
Tyra, she's a really big key for us in all the games that we've played,
because of her size and her shooting ability. And so we always need her to put
up big numbers for us and big minutes. And I think she did a really good job
of that tonight. I applaud her effort pinning the ball in there, taking it in
there those 3s that Stanford had. And she did a really good job pinning the
ball at the end and we needed her effort today at the end of the game, and I'm
proud of you, Tyra.  
And nobody believed in us, but we did it. We're going to the ship. Thank you.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, how proud are you of yourself, personally, for getting to the
national championship game, and your players?  
COACH BLAIR: Self doesn't have much. I've won a lot of games over the years.
But right now I'm all about championships and big games.  
I mean, whatever the number is, we've just gone against four straight Hall of
Fame coaches that are already in the Hall of Fame. Okay?  
With Vivian Stringer, Landers, Kim Mulkey and Tara VanDerveer, and I'm sure
there's a couple more waiting in the game on Tuesday night. I'm proud of my
team, and proud of Texas A&M, because we don't have to apologize who we are.  
We're a very good basketball team that plays tenacious defense, and finds a
way on offense. We're not the prettiest team around, except when we put
dresses on, and we'll outdress anybody. We're a good looking team, as you can
see up here.  
But I'm just really proud of the fight that we have. We're gaining fans. Our
season tickets will double next year.  
Everything is happening for a reason. It's because we don't quit. While you
all were writing, I guarantee you a lot of you already had your story three-
quarters of the way done. And now you're having to change it. Okay?  
All the analysts, every one of them, picked Stanford. And that's good. Because
they're all good friends of mine. And I just want to keep going as hard as we
can, and I tell you another group that I want to recruit, okay? I want to
recruit those Butler fans. Okay? I hope they win the whole doggone thing.  
But I want to recruit the Butler fans, and I want them to come out, because
it's a little bit embarrassing that we've got 3,000 empty seats out there with
a Final Four of this magnitude.  
We were in the dome the last time we were here, and we had 25,000 again. So I
want the fans to come out. It's the best basketball in the world. So get Larry
Bird on the thing, have him talk about it. Let me talk about it. Let Muffet or
Geno talk about it. But let's fill this thing up, and let's do it with some of
the Butler fans, the hometown -- we can't get any more here from Connecticut
or A&M, just on a two-day swing with airplane prices and holes in the ceilings
of airplanes right now.  
But we have the fans from the schools that are already here. Right now we need
the Indianapolis fans to come out and support us.  
  
Q. Take us through that last nine seconds, and as that play was unfolding, I
mean, are you hoping she's going to pass it, or are you hoping she's just
going to take it to the basket?  
COACH BLAIR: No, I wanted her to take it to the rack because they just got
finished on the other end. And I think the officials were going to let it go.
They were going to let kids win it.  
And I was jumping up and down thinking I should have had an and one. But at
the same time Tyra probably thought she needed an and one down on the play on
the other end. But we're prejudice, okay? You had three Final Four officials
that have called a lot of Final Fours, and they were good officiating.  
Neither one of the coaches had much of a problem. We had more problems with
our team getting our team to run what we wanted them to run.  
Because too many times we broke down, and my point guard didn't take over. She
let a couple kids handle the ball that didn't need to be handling the ball,
and that's what happened on turnovers there.  
But while I'm thinking of it, nobody else is going to ask: Pedersen and Murphy
played very, very well for them. We know what Nneka did.  
But Pedersen is a nightmare on matchups. Okay? But Murphy, I think, saved
their game by what she came in and in the second half they just had to run a
spread offense and try to dribble the thing for 15 to 18 seconds, and then
eventually somebody would go one-on-one. And that's not their game, okay?  
We forced that by how much pressure we put on them. But I thought Murphy did a
heck of a job, and I'm glad she was out of the game at the end.  
  
Q. Ballgame at the beginning, we had our third time-out and third TV time-
out. It was 11-10 Stanford. You went on a 9-1 run in the next four and a half
minutes. Then after the following time-out, the last seven and a half minutes,
you got outscored 15 to 4 to finish out the half. You were only down 4. Talk
about what happened in those seven minutes. But one more comment, you
mentioned Butler. Well, Sydney Carter I know she's going to be back with you,
she kind of reminds me of Ronald Nored of Butler; she's the spokesperson.  
COACH BLAIR: Write that in the story. Let's build that up. Our colors -- I
know who else's colors are blue and white. But my eyes are blue. So I want the
Butler fans to pull for us, and Carter does remind you of that play. And I
wish I had the calm demeanor of the Butler coach, but I don't. I'm all over
the page.  
But first half, I wrote down: The key to the first half, after they made their
run, I had Danielle with two fouls. Our kids were doing a decent job, but they
were not rebounding. That's what Danielle does.  
So all my subs came in and got zero rebounds in that whole time. They played
hard, but we made a few mistakes.  
But the key was holding it to four points. Okay? Holding it to four points,
where they could have made the run and got it to 10.  
And we would have been back playing woe is me at halftime. But I felt we had a
chance. We made some changes on our offensive sets, and I thought we ran our
offense pretty well in the second half.  
And we missed some shots, but we missed some shots, a lot of times because
they made us miss because they were so long, and we were shooting over.  
And, finally, at the end of the game, we called a play called "35," guard
initiate, throw the ball to Carter or Maryann, who was in there, and play the
two-game on the backside.  
I think Danielle hit the first shot, and then Tyra hit the next shot. And then
Tyra took it to the basket. Those two 3-point plays back to back, I think that
was the turning point of the game.  
How about Colson's two free throws under pressure? She's not our best free
throw shooter, but I think she knew she was not playing well in the second
half and stepped up and hit two crucial ones and then here comes Nneka, came
back and made two crucial ones on the other end.  
  
Q. Gary, as you know, this is all new to the A &M fan base from the Dallas
region to here as far as all you have gone, what do you think to the A&M fan
base all the way back to the state of Texas?  
COACH BLAIR: I think we're growing as a community. You know me, I'm never
satisfied with how many seats are in. I'm trying to fill up the seats that are
not filled up right now. But we're going to start filling them up.  
But what I want to do with this is try to encourage the Stanfords the
Tennessees and Connecticuts to get on our schedule. Because we're ready to
play risk/reward. And we're willing to go wherever it takes to play these
games, because that's what's going to make us better. Because those teams are
going to be good every year, and I think Texas A&M now is at that level that
we can recruit the right type of student-athletes. We can pack houses.  
We're hosting a subregional next year. But I don't know who was happier, my
wife coming off with tears, Bill Byrne who hired me in the first place, or our
president Bowen Loftin.  
We put a Secretary of Defense, Bob Gates, in the White House; but our
Secretary of Defense, Vic Schaefer, he might be doing a better job right now.
And give that man some credit, because he coached his butt off in this
ballgame.  
  
Q. Just because of her personality, Tyra sometimes gets a little lost in the
shuffle with the Sydneys, with Danielle's productivity, but just talk about,
she's been the steady person for you guys throughout the tournament, makes
plays, delivers the game winner, talk about what she's given you.  
COACH BLAIR: With about six or seven minutes to go, or eight minutes to go in
the game, Kelly Bond, my associate head coach, came up and said: Carter's
spent, she's out of gas. But I couldn't take her out.  
So we had to quit calling as many plays as we were doing. So we started
calling Tyra's plays.  
And Tyra's never going to say anything or whatever. She's a low maintenance
kid, just like Danielle. Some kids are going to demand the ball. But all of a
sudden we started calling her number and she started delivering. Because she's
got the six-foot frame that most of those Stanford kids have that can get the
shot off that we had to have.  
And remember, the big change in the ballgame was when Maryann came in at about
that six-minute mark, our defensive intensity upped and we were able to stop
the penetration from the point guard that Colson was getting hurt on a little,
and we were getting into foul trouble. Baker came in, but when it was time to
win a game, Colson's the one who brought us to the dance and she was coming in
to win the ballgame.  
  
Q. Were you at all concerned about burning your last time-out?  
COACH BLAIR: I was concerned, yes. But at the same time I knew how good
Stanford was. And sometimes when a coach does too much, is they call too many
time-outs at the end of the game instead of letting the emotions flow and let
me get rid of them and let my kids play.  
So sometimes we can overcoach. And sometimes it's time for them to just play
hard and not call a time-out after a transition basket, which I don't think we
had any the whole game. It's just let the kids run, because they were having
trouble getting the ball in. They had to use the time-outs on that, and I
think we got two five-second counts as well.  
Stanford is a good ball club. Give them credit. Four straight Final Fours.
Four straight Final Fours. That's how good they are, and how well coached they
are.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Notre Dame  72  
Connecticut - 63

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Connecticut coach Geno Auriemma and student-
athletes Maya Moore and Kelly Faris. Coach, an opening statement.  
COACH AURIEMMA: You know, it's never -- it's never easy when you don't win
your last game, because that's kind of the thing that you remember going out
on.  
So I know how difficult it is for Maya and for Lorin. And I just wanted to
remind them in the locker room that when they were freshmen, the same thing
happened to them.  
And they end their senior year with the same outcome, but what happened in
between is something that only the really, really, really fortunate can ever
experience. And what Maya and Lorin experienced in the two years between their
loss in the Final Four and the loss tonight is something that -- that's what
I'm going to choose to focus on when I think about those two, especially Maya.
I'm going to think more about the best player in the history of the Big East
and maybe the best student-athlete in the history of college basketball.  
And I'm not going to let her be defined by what happened tonight.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Maya, about six minutes ago you sat down 12, about a four-minute stretch
there you went on about a 13-point run yourself. Just your thoughts that
period of time when trying to cut into the lead?  
MAYA MOORE: I thought we all did a pretty good job of really just trying to
score, trying to find a way to win by just -- I was just trying to attack,
trying to score.  
The ball went in, so my teammates could do a good job of screening for me.
And, you know, I was just focused at that time, just trying to score.  
  
Q. Maya, those who have watched you for four years now know how you love to
compete and how important winning is for you. Will it be tough for you to come
to grips with the fact that your career ended this way, or will you be able to
rationalize how things went in the larger picture?  
MAYA MOORE: There's always positives and negatives out of everything. So like
Coach said, I'm going to have to choose to remember the great things and
really how fortunate I was to be able to be a part of so many record-breaking
seasons, games, whatever it may be.  
It's just tough that this is the current taste in my mouth right now, but
we'll deal with it.  
  
Q. Maya, was there a helpless feeling at times in the second half? Seemed
like no matter what you tried to do or got done. They just kept making
plays.  
MAYA MOORE: Notre Dame came to win. They came to play. Every single person
that they brought in I think came in and did exactly what they could do.  
So it's definitely tough when we're back on our heels a little bit on defense
and they're knocking in shots. Of course it's going to take the wind out of
your sails.  
So that's a defensive mental breakdown on our part. And when you're playing a
great team at this time of the year, if you don't execute and play good
defense, you shouldn't win the game.  
And I thought our defense wasn't as -- especially my defense wasn't as good as
it needed to be to win this game.  
  
Q. Maya, you've had an amazing career. As you look back on it, what was the
pinnacle moment for you, and why?  
MAYA MOORE: I love my whole time here. I can't really pinpoint a moment. A lot
of people would think the national championships, but there's so much that
goes into the national championship. It's just the whole journey. The fact
that I have a whole new family that I didn't have four years ago is probably
the highlight.  
  
Q. Kelly, you played Skylar a few times, have been on teams with her. Talk
about what you wanted to get done, what you saw from her, how she was able to
take the game over when she needed to?  
KELLY FARIS: Yeah, she's a great player. Very smart player. And tonight she
was hitting everything. She came out with the mentality that this wasn't going
to be her last game, and she carried her team tonight.  
And, like I said, she knew when to get in the lane and when to pull up. She's
extremely smart with her body and how to use it and how to get on the line.
And she reads her defender very well.  
So when I was guarding her, I'm disappointed with the way I guarded her. I
don't feel like I stopped her the way I should have.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. I just want to follow up on that last question. That was a pretty
extraordinary performance by Skylar Diggins, the player who really controlled
pretty much the entire floor. From your end, if you can just evaluate her
performance and the fact that it didn't seem like -- maybe nobody could have
had an answer for her tonight.  
COACH AURIEMMA: You know, in the first half you could see that there was going
to be a problem guarding her the whole game.  
But we did a pretty decent job on everybody else. And in the second half, we
allowed her to get everybody else involved, and then it was not just having to
guard Skylar, but it's the plays that she made for other people.  
And you know that's what great players do. They take control of a situation,
and she did. And I think because she played like that, some of the other kids
made shots. They made jump shots that are tough to make, especially in this
environment. And they made them.  
Shot the ball with a lot of confidence. And I think that fueled some emotion
on the defensive end as well. And I said going in, they're an impossible team
to play defense against. And we hold them to 26 in the first half. But then
things just went a little bit awry in the second half.  
  
Q. What do you make of what happened here tonight? There's going to be a lot
of people that are going to look at these two games and wonder what happened.
What do you think happened here tonight?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I think what happened is what happens in all -- not all --
what happens in a lot of NCAA tournaments, the team that plays better that
night wins. Not the team that everybody puts on the board that is supposed to
win.  
That's why I got a kick out of all season long about you don't want to have to
play Baylor and Stanford back to back, you better get the No. 1 seed so that
way you only have to play one of them, not two of them.  
The whole time I'm thinking these people are out of their minds. Like it's a
given.  
I think what people have to understand is nothing's a given. You play really
well and you get a chance to win. You don't play well, you lose. I don't care
whether you're a 1 seed, 2 seed, the best player, not the best player, it
doesn't matter.  
I think what this night proved was there's good teams, and those teams are not
just named Connecticut and Stanford and Baylor.  
  
Q. Coach, there was a 20-point swing in the second half in a 10-minute span.
We accounted for seven points of that from Stefanie Dolson having to go to the
bench with the fourth foul. Could you describe from your perspective just what
happened, where the wheels came off?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, I mean, we don't foul. And in the first half we proved
that. We just don't. And we spent an entire year not fouling.  
Then all of a sudden the first 10 minutes of the second half I guess we just
decided to start fouling. And once we started fouling, then everything kind of
fell apart for us.  
  
Q. The two-point play was a big part of Notre Dame's offense in the second
half. How much do you attribute to their ability to get the ball down low and
just your team's being out of position?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yes, once we got -- once we took Stefanie out we just didn't
have much of a presence physically inside, and they took advantage of that.
They drove the ball into the lane and they forced us to make -- as Kelly said
and Maya said, we made some mistakes defensively, and sometimes teams can't
capitalize on your mistakes. But Notre Dame did tonight. The last three times
we have played them, we may have made similar mistakes but they didn't make
shots.  
So today I think we lost our aggressiveness in the second half. I think in the
second half, I think it was Maya -- Maya said that -- we played tentatively.
We played on our heels.  
We allowed the calls and what was happening to kind of affect the way we
played. We lost -- we really did, we lost our attacking mentality on the
defensive end.  
And you can't do that against Notre Dame.  
  
Q. Coach, do you attribute the fact that you just couldn't get that second
score to Notre Dame's defense, or just people like Tiffany just didn't show up
at all and you just couldn't get that second score to give you some offense?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah, I thought Notre Dame -- you know, Notre Dame's team, I
thought, was really involved in the game. And I thought for us -- I think it
happened in the Stanford game.  
It might be the only other time that it's happened to this extent. I think
some of our players got caught up in the bigness of the game.  
And, you know, Tiffany -- that's kind of been her MO. You know, when she
doesn't get off to a good start, when things aren't clicking for her, she kind
of disappears on us sometimes.  
And that happened tonight. And that's something that we've tried to address
with her, and she understands it. And I'm sure she's probably more
disappointed than anybody else that it happened tonight.  
And Bria played like a fighting little freshman, not really wanting to attack
on the ball screen, not really -- it wasn't until late, late that it looked
like I saw somebody that wanted to make a play, instead of just hoping not to
make a bad play.  
And that's why I said going in, you know, we're a vulnerable team because
you're asking players to do something they've never done before. And Kelly
played almost the same kind of game last year in the Final Four. And she was a
real star of the game. And today, you know, we needed a whole lot more from
her.  
Yeah, one great player can't beat a really good team. Not this time of the
year.  
  
Q. How good do you think both games were tonight for exposure of women's
college basketball?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, I saw some of the first game, and early on it was
apparent that unless Texas A&M lost the game that Stanford was going to be in
for a dogfight. It was going to be hard for them to win because Texas A&M's
style of play and what they do to you.  
So I thought it was a great contrast in that game between two completely
different teams. And I think it played out that way. And, you know, A&M made
some plays at the end to win it, as you're supposed to at this time of the
year. People want to see people make plays to win games, not people fail to
make plays to lose.  
I think that's what's exciting. And in our game, I think something similar
happened. Whoever was watching the game saw Notre Dame kids make big plays and
make big shots, and I think people enjoy watching that.  
You know, whether anybody is disappointed that Stanford and Connecticut aren't
playing Tuesday night, that's irrelevant. The two teams that played the best
today and the two teams that deserve to be playing Tuesday night are the two
teams playing Tuesday night.  
And I hope a lot of people enjoy watching that game. I think it's going to be
a heck of a game.  
  
Q. How do you think that game will turn out?  
COACH AURIEMMA: How do I think the game will turn out? I don't know that much
about Texas A&M. Obviously, we don't follow them and we don't see them as
often. But, you know, it's difficult to put a lot of pressure on Notre Dame,
because their guards are so good and they play so well together.  
And A&M's team thrives on the kind of pressure that they can put on you
defensively, and I think that's why everybody in the coaching fraternity knew
they would give Stanford trouble with their guard play.  
But I don't know that you can do that to Notre Dame. And it will be
interesting to see how it plays out, because you've got two teams with a lot
of confidence right now that have beaten some really good teams up until
Tuesday night.  
And it's not like one team snuck in and the other team, you know, is a heavy
favorite. I think you've got two really good teams that are both playing with
a lot of confidence right now.  
So I'm anxious to see how it plays out. But I'll be rooting for Notre Dame,
obviously, because they're in our league and I know them. And I like a lot of
their kids and their coaching staff. Not to say I don't like Gary. But I
don't. I don't like Gary as much as I like Muffet.  
(Laughter.)  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us now from Stanford, student-athletes Kayla Pedersen,
Jeanette Pohlen and Nnemkadi Ogwumike and Head Coach Tara VanDerveer.  
We'll begin with an opening statement from Coach VanDerveer.  
COACH VANDERVEER: Good morning. We are thrilled to be here. We're very excited
to get to practice on the new floor, and we're really looking forward to our
game with a great opponent playing against Texas A&M.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. For any of you that want to answer this, you've had a chance to go over
stuff in practice now since last time we talked to you. What further do you
know about Texas A &M and what do you think that you need to do specifically
to try to win the game?  
KAYLA PEDERSEN: I think what we need to do is take care of the ball. You know,
I think we need to rebound the basketball and make sure we get a lot of
possessions, and I think that's probably the main thing.  
  
Q. Nneka, you and your sister were really dominant in the regional. Do you
play off each other? And, I don't know, do you kind of conspire to incite each
other like that?  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: I mean, absolutely. In our last game against Gonzaga, a lot
of people were saying we have this kind of unspoken connection where if I were
to miss a shot she would rebound and if she would miss a shot I would rebound.  
But at the same time I share that connection with all my teammates. It may
seem a little stronger, a little more evident given that she's my sister. But
we definitely have each other's back out on the court.  
And I definitely have to say that, yeah, it's real special playing with her.
And it's real exciting and I'd like to play a little bit longer with her this
year.  
  
Q. As a follow-up to that question, Nneka, exactly how nervous is Chiney
today and what have you told her about the Final Four and how do you get her
calmed down or whatever in preparation for this?  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: I wouldn't say she's nervous at all. She's more anxious.
She really just wants to work hard and focus and concentrate on what we have
at hand, and I've just been helping her throughout. Obviously it's her first
Final Four as a player, rather than a spectator.  
And she's definitely basking in the moment. She's really enjoying herself. But
at the same time she's also focusing, because she's had to kind of hold a
large responsibility so early on and so young in this season, and I think
she's doing a really good job of containing herself and understanding what we
need from her right now while also enjoying Indianapolis.  
  
Q. Jeanette and Kayla, this is the fourth time you guys have been here. Can
you both address what you think experience means in this game, going against a
team that's not been here before?  
JEANETTE POHLEN: I think -- I mean, at this point in the season experience
helps definitely. Just, I mean, being in the Final Four kind of knowing what
to expect helps.  
But, you know, I think all four of the teams that are here have just as good a
chance of winning. It's kind of up in the air. Yeah, you have people that
might know a little bit better what's going on as far as like just the overall
picture. But there's two games left, and I think people are just going to lay
it out all on the floor.  
I don't think it's going to be too much of an issue. I think overall we have a
lot of experience on the team, which definitely helps.  
But that's just kind of how our team's been all year. I don't know if that
gives us an advantage, but just in general I think it's helped to get here.  
KAYLA PEDERSEN: I agree with Jeanette. I think experience takes you only so
far. I don't think it will be the main factor in the outcome of these games,
but it definitely helps. It makes you more comfortable with your surroundings.
But at the same time all the teams have played in big games here.  
Great crowds in front a lot of people. So I think just that experience will
kind of take a little bit of pressure off and make it more comfortable. But I
don't necessarily think it will determine the outcome.  
  
Q. Nneka, I wonder your impressions of Danielle Adams, how much of a load
she'll be in the post?  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: She's obviously shown everyone how great she is. She's very
good at what she does. She's definitely going to be a big defensive matchup
for us. But I'm excited.  
She's very talented, and she's very crafty, and I'm just really excited to be
able to play against a player like her. And she has a really great support
system. She has a lot of guards and forwards that really help her do what she
does.  
And I'm just really excited to be able to play against a great player like
her, and hopefully we can contain her.  
  
Q. Nneka, Gary Blair said he recruited you very hard coming out of Texas. I
know some other Big 12 schools were in on you. Could you just talk about the
process and what it finally came down to, why you picked Stanford and maybe
who some of the other schools you were considering at the end?  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: Well, as it may be for a lot of other student-athletes,
leaving home is a really hard thing, especially from Texas, because I love
Texas.  
And he definitely did recruit me very hard. He was great in the recruiting
process, as were all the other coaches. But ultimately what it came down to
was the mix of academics and athletics. I mean, obviously if you go to a
university, you can get academics anywhere, but Stanford really stood out in
that aspect. And it really just came down to what place I felt most
comfortable and where I would fit in the most.  
I'm not trying to downplay any other school, because all the universities are
great. I'm really grateful that I was able to get recruited by Coach Blair.
He's a great person.  
  
Q. Jeanette, Texas A &M's guards really play a lot of ball pressure. When
you have just been looking at film, how do you counter that and what do you
see when you look at the two Sydneys on film in terms of that 30, 40 minutes
of pressure?  
JEANETTE POHLEN: I mean, watching them on film, they definitely get a lot of
points off turnovers and in transition, but we played a good amount of teams
this year that have pressured us.  
I think it will be important for everyone to get open, especially our posts,
to kind of just relieve some pressure.  
But I think first and foremost we have to be aware of how they're playing us
and really work to get open, I think. That will be first and foremost.  
  
Q. Jeanette and Kayla, as your fourth time doing this, is there any
different feeling or -- since the last time? What are your feelings on how
this time maybe is a little different?  
JEANETTE POHLEN: I don't know, I guess maybe because this is our last chance,
a little bit more anxious, you know, knowing that we might not have -- we're
not going to have any games after this season, kind of puts a little bit --
puts it a little bit into perspective.  
You know, it's been a great career here. And I think leaving with a national
championship would be kind of the icing on the cake.  
But for me, and I think a lot of people on our team, we're just very focused.
Maybe a little bit more relaxed. I know Kayla and I have talked about it's
such a privilege to be here, and we're very grateful to have been able to make
it this far for four years.  
But we definitely haven't gotten the job done each time we've been here. So
we're very focused, I think.  
KAYLA PEDERSEN: As Jeanette said, it's more of like -- we're more focused. I
think we're more concentrated on what we need to do, how to get the job done.  
But at the same time, this is probably the most relaxed I've felt out of all
my Final Fours. I'm just trying to enjoy every moment, trying to have fun with
my teammates.  
Leave everything on the floor. Whatever happens, happens, just as long as all
of us just lay it all out there for each other.  
  
Q. I would like to know if you guys have ever done any community service,
and, if so, how has this helped you as an athlete.  
KAYLA PEDERSEN: Yeah, our team -- we try to do a community service event every
month. We've been to soup kitchens. We've visited schools. We've spoken to a
lot of students and played basketball with them at recess.  
It's definitely developed us as student-athletes, because just getting to
interact with these kids, trying to inspire them to stay active and stay in
school really pushes us.  
It really makes us motivated to want to play for them and try to be great role
models.  
  
Q. Were you ever bullied? And if so, how did you overcome it?  
KAYLA PEDERSEN: I wouldn't call it bullying. I was always an awkward-looking
person because I was pretty tall. I was pretty nerdy when I was a kid. But I
embraced it. And it never affected me.  
I just kind of focused on what's important, and it's just being me. And I
found that I was good at basketball and I kept doing it. And I was able to
accentuate my height on the court and use it to the best of my abilities.  
So I guess you could say I was kind of a blessing in disguise. I mean, that's
pretty much my story.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Kayla said this is the most relaxed she's been at a Final Four. How
relaxed are you?  
COACH VANDERVEER: You know, I think that we're very excited. I feel good. I'm
working as hard as I can to get to know Texas A&M, their personnel, their
schemes.  
And I think the fact that you've been through kind of some of the -- whether
it's interviews, all the different things that you've done, there's a certain
routine. And you don't feel as maybe just stressed about things.  
If you're five minutes late, maybe the first year you were worried. But I feel
that our team has worked very hard, and we know we're playing a great
opponent, but we're very confident.  
  
Q. Geno has bristled a little bit throughout the first few rounds of the
tournament about the attendance, the attendance at the venues that they
played, including Gampel. It seems your experience and your team has been a
little bit different playing out west. I was wondering what is it you think
makes for the most compelling draws in the tournament, in the women's
tournament?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Our experience has been really positive with attendance. We
had -- as far as I can remember -- and this is just eyeballing it, but we had
the most ever for our first and second round game at Stanford.  
And I think a lot of it is game time, game days, and obviously having a local
team, bringing in new and different competition. We played -- Davis was a
local team, which was great to bring in Davis, and then St. John's. We drew
very well for that.  
When we played in Spokane, the crowds were exceptional. I think that Gonzaga
being in that tournament was a big part of it. But when we played there, even
three years ago, they're a hotbed of women's basketball. I think we should go
-- play where people come and watch and support women's basketball.  
Just look at the attendance of different venues throughout the country and
play there.  
  
Q. Do you think sometimes when people anticipate that the games will not be
close, that that -- especially given the fact that they're all on TV, that
that is an incentive to not go, whereas, for instance, the Texas A &M/Baylor
game was highly anticipated and drew quite well in Dallas?  
COACH VANDERVEER: All right. Well, I think in the situation with -- I mean,
they had teams that could drive. You had your fans that could drive to the
games. And I don't know that -- I mean, as our game progresses, it's less and
less predictable.  
But I think also part of the situation may be with, for us as an example we
didn't play our Pac-10 tournament right at Stanford. Some of it is the
saturation point, where you have so many games. How many games can people go
to? They do have other lives.  
And I think that with the NCAA Tournament, it's really looking at places that
draw really well and bring the games to them instead of making people go to
where we want to put the games.  
But obviously having big draw games is really key.  
  
Q. Wanted to ask you about your seniors, the young ladies that have been in
so many Final Fours leading up to this point and the sense of urgency that
they may feel. I think Jeanette made mention she didn't feel like they had got
the job done yet. Can you talk about that feeling and how you think those kids
are handling that?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Well, I mean, I think it's a great accomplishment for any
team to go to any Final Four. And, you know, when you get here, obviously
playing well is the key. And our team has played very well in the Final Four
getting to the championship two out of three years.  
But I think there is a sense that, you know, when you're here you want to win
it. And our team -- our seniors, they really want to win it very badly, not
having won it, having been here and been so close.  
But I think that that is a good thing. They're playing very motivated, playing
hungry. They're very excited.  
But I don't want them to put pressure on themselves, nor do I put pressure on
myself or any of the other people on the team. I want them to enjoy the
process, to be here in this city that really knows how to host, just a
wonderful environment.  
The court -- it's so exciting to look at the court, and for them to really
come out and play with a lot of spirit and a lot of enthusiasm and not feel
like, oh, we have to do this.  
What we have to do is just do what we've been doing all season long, and that
will be enough.  
  
Q. You said you were trying to learn as fast as you could or as much as you
could about Texas A &M. Can you talk about what you've learned and how much of
maybe, I don't know if it's 180 degrees, but you had to make a switch because
the Brittney Griner Baylor team has been looming in the background for
everyone who had aspirations to get to this and now you don't have to deal
with that?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Baylor is a great team. And they're obviously a Final Four-
caliber team, as I think Tennessee is, as DePaul could be. This is a game of
musical chairs where there's four seats and there's a lot of capable teams
that could be here.  
I didn't assume that Baylor was going to make it. When I saw the bracket, I
was like, whoa, this is a challenge.  
And I've watched a lot of Texas A&M games along the line and watched Baylor
games, a lot more of the Baylor, Texas A&M games. So I feel like I had
familiarity with both teams, but once we had to really get working on it, I
studied their team. And they have a great team; they have great players.  
I've learned a lot. I love a lot of the things they do. And we are going to be
very challenged to come out and be successful tomorrow night.  
  
Q. I know this question focuses on the other game, but as someone who has
been a thoughtful observer of women's basketball, in your opinion how good a
coaching job has Geno Auriemma done with what's now essentially a six-player
rotation?  
COACH VANDERVEER: You know, I think that -- I think you have less margin for
error in the fact that about maybe about things you can't control. Sprained
ankle.  
We had one time appendectomy. And so sometimes you have to have some luck or
be very fortunate. And I don't know that -- it doesn't really matter the six
players. I mean, they play six great players. And most teams, like for us in
the tight tournament games, you're not playing -- we've won with six players.  
So I don't think that's the issue. I think the issue is obviously you don't
want people getting into foul trouble. You have to keep them healthy. But I
think Geno's done a great job with this team. It's less talented than last
year's team. But he has arguably one of the very best players to ever play
women's basketball in Maya Moore, and that counts for a lot.  
  
Q. You talked about how badly Kayla and Jeanette want to win this. What
about for you? This is going to be, well, four in a row. Seven since you last
won a championship. How badly do you want to come away with a national
championship?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I think that you can talk about what you want. But it's more
the actions, what you're willing to do for it. And I feel that for me
personally I've worked harder with this team in terms of the time putting in
maybe than any other team I've coached at Stanford, just in that having come
so close and it was exceedingly painful to have a -- to be there two out of
the three years.  
We didn't play very well in the year in between. But to be in the championship
game, to be knocking at the door and to be denied. So I feel like I've done
everything that I can do. And so I can't talk about it. I've got to back it up
with my actions.  
And I feel our team is doing the same thing. But I feel like our coaching
staff, myself and Amy, Bobbie and Kate, have dedicated themselves this year to
really studying what not only our team's doing but our opponents and working
extra with our team to give our team the best chance of being successful.  
  
Q. When you see Colson and Carter on film, what troubles you the most about
them? And maybe in particular the defensive pressure that they put on the
ball?  
COACH VANDERVEER: You know, I think there's a lot of things actually that
really impress me about them. I mean, it's obvious that they're very athletic.
They work hard defensively. But they also -- they take the ball out of the
basket. They knock down outside shots.  
But I think a lot of it is the things you have to be very impressed with their
game against Baylor where maybe some teams you get beat, you get beat, you get
beat and they just said we're not taking it anymore. I think it's more with
intangibles.  
A lot of players -- there's a lot of teams that have very athletic, talented,
quick guards. But it's the fact that they play well together. They play within
themselves. They're very well coached. And they're driven.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about Danielle Adams, and she didn't have a
great game against Baylor, but just what you think of her as a player and what
challenges she poses?  
COACH VANDERVEER: She's an interesting player in that maybe like if you went
to the gym and you were kind of shooting around, you might not say, well, this
is who I want on my team right off the bat.  
She's maybe not the most athletic-looking player. She's not that big for a
post player. But I saw her last night at du Salute dinner and I went up and
congratulated to her for being All-American. And I said, Now, be nice to our
Stanford players tomorrow. She smiled.  
She seems like a really nice, nice young lady. She's old school in a way that
I think she is a great basketball player. She has great hands, great feet.
Versatile. She scores inside. She's extremely powerful, scores outside with
her 3.  
She likes to think she's a guard in a 6'2" body. And I just -- she has a great
demeanor on the court. And she complements their other players very well, with
White, the three perimeter players, and Elonu. But she to me seems like would
be, just a really great player to play with in that she gets it done, kind of
rebounds it at every end of the floor.  
I think she struggles maybe just against Baylor with their size or with kind
of their schemes, it was just a little bit different. But we know she has to
be the focus of our defense.  
  
Q. I didn't see Jeanette on the State Farm All-American team this morning. I
wonder if you think that was a bit of an injustice?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Well, I think that the team that was selected was an
outstanding team. And I think there are several players that are All-American
caliber, but there's just not enough chairs, in the same way there are more
than four Final Four-caliber teams.  
Jeanette is an All-American-caliber player, as Kayla is. But as someone like
Danielle Robinson or just Victoria Dunlap, there are a lot of players there
just weren't room for. I believe she's All-American caliber, as I believe
Kayla is, too.  
But they know that the most important thing is the Tuesday night prize. And
we're very excited that Nneka was named to the State Farm WBCA All-American
team. And the committee did an excellent job in selecting their team.  
And I truly believe that different players, Courtney Vandersloot was a great
selection to that team. So I don't feel -- and I don't think Jeanette feels
slighted in any way.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## April 2, 2011

  

### [Becca Bruszewski](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20839)

### [Brittany Mallory](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21815)

### [Muffet McGraw](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14071)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us from Notre Dame are student-athletes Brittany
Mallory and Becca Bruszewski and Coach Muffet McGraw. We'll open with a
statement from Coach McGraw then we'll take questions from the student-
athletes.  
COACH MCGRAW: I'm really proud of my team and how well they've played in the
NCAA Tournament. We've come a long way since November. We've really improved
every game.  
And I think I look at our leaders here, our captains, who have controlled the
team attitude and the intensity that they bring to practice every day, and I
think that's why we're here.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. I have a question about the perceived home field advantage you have here,
just, A, do you think it actually exists? And then also like talk about the
conveniences of having it kind of in your own backyard, like you can take a
bus versus a plane, any level of comfort that you have, that kind of thing.  
BECCA BRUSZEWSKI: I think we would hope it would be a home court advantage
just in the essence of the fact we could have a lot of fans here. It's not a
far trip. We would want as much support as possible. And when you have a lot
of people out there rooting for you, it helps when another team goes on a run
or you're on a run yourself.  
  
Q. Becca and Brittany, those of us who cover the Big East have watched Coach
McGraw bring really good teams across the country every year to play in the
Big East tournament in Connecticut's backyard. Is there even a small level of
satisfaction that they have to come to Indiana for once to win a game?  
BRITTANY MALLORY: A little bit. It's a neutral site. It's going to be a tough
game like they've been all year, so we're ready for the challenge and
hopefully a lot of our fans come out.  
  
Q. Becca, Coach McGraw said earlier in the week someone asked if this team
had her personality, and she said no, it had yours. How would you describe
that? How would you characterize your effect on the team, do you think?  
BECCA BRUSZEWSKI: I would just say probably business on the court and the
complete opposite off the court. That sums it up, basically.  
  
Q. Becca and Brittany, you've played them tough over the years, but it's
been tough for you to win those games. Why do you think it is? What's been the
difference even in the tight games that they've been able to win?  
BRITTANY MALLORY: We've been talking about this the last couple of weeks, we
need to play a full 40 minutes. If you look back at those three games and even
in the past we haven't really completed a game where we've played the best and
like hard the whole time.  
So we're ready to play the full 40 minutes, and that's how we've been playing
the last couple of games. So we're ready to go.  
BECCA BRUSZEWSKI: Again, I would just say the full 40 minutes and just a full
40 minutes of focus.  
A lot of times they go on runs and we get maybe a little antsy, excited, but
just staying focused for the full 40 minutes.  
  
Q. Becca, you guys are one of the top shooting teams in the country, but in
the three games against Connecticut you've been around 33 percent. What's the
challenge of their defense and how do you deal with that?  
BECCA BRUSZEWSKI: They're really good at getting in the passing lanes and
trying to pressure you in the shots.  
So, again, it's just us really relying on screens, really running, focusing on
our offense and trying to get the shots off.  
  
Q. Becca, did your team need the example set by Texas A &M against Baylor
this week to reinforce the concept that you could beat Connecticut after
losing to them three times?  
BECCA BRUSZEWSKI: I don't think we needed it. But, I mean, we all kind of know
what we have to do and we always have the mindset we're going to go into a
game and win it.  
But seeing that just -- it proves a lot. And it proves the team can push
through perseverance, especially being 0-3 and coming up and win in a big-time
game when you need to.  
  
Q. Becca, talk a little bit about the knee injury you suffered, kind of
working through that, and just how much goes into getting prepared for UConn
one more time and hopefully avoiding the last game, getting another game in?  
BECCA BRUSZEWSKI: The knee injury was just a little tweaked. Definitely got a
brace. Working well. So far felt fine practice-wise, playing-wise, so I'm
going to play regardless. And now that I have a brace it helps a lot. So it's
really good.  
  
Q. For either of you, Skylar Diggins hometown girl from up around the school
area, and what's it mean having her as a teammate and bringing her back to her
home state to play?  
BRITTANY MALLORY: It's great. She's been a great leader for us this year.
She's really matured from her first year to her sophomore year.  
So being able to play in the Final Four in Indianapolis, which is pretty close
to South Bend, is great for all of us, and especially for her. Because she's
from there, she can have a lot of friends and family come.  
  
Q. Becca, obviously a home state girl yourself. Talk about the experience of
coming down here to Indianapolis to play for hopefully a national
championship.  
BECCA BRUSZEWSKI: It's great. I ended my high school career playing Indiana
All-Stars here. So it's great that I get to come back for my college career.  
  
Q. Becca or Brittany, what's a healthy Devereaux Peters mean for your
team?  
BRITTANY MALLORY: I can't even think of a word to describe her. You know, when
she's healthy and when she's focused and playing smart, she's a really hard
person to guard and she's one of the players that we're glad she's on our team
and not on the other team. And she brings a lot to the table for us. And she's
been playing great.  
  
Q. Becca, can you talk about Stefanie Dolson and the challenge she presents
and how much you have improved with the post defense over the course of the
season?  
BECCA BRUSZEWSKI: She's a great player. She likes to get people real down deep
in the paint.  
So, again, I think it's just trying to match her intensity and physicality and
trying to body her up.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Muffet, how do you -- Gary Blair said earlier today that last thing he
told the team before they got off the bus in Dallas was don't get off the bus
if you don't think you can beat Baylor. What kind of inspirational comments
did you have for your bus ride? And, secondly, are we making this up about you
having to come to Hartford every year and having to deal with that crowd and
that team on their home floor? Do you have any sense of, I don't know,
retribution or "it's about time" view about this?  
COACH MCGRAW: I enjoy coming to Hartford because the crowds we get are the
best in college basketball for postseason tournament. And we have the best
attendance. We have great fans from all the schools.  
And it's fun to be there and to have good crowds for the other games that
UConn's not playing in. It's great for us to be in Indiana. I don't perceive
it as a home court advantage exactly. But it definitely is easier for our fans
to get here.  
And just playing in the state of Indiana, I think, it was kind of a motivating
factor for some of the girls throughout the season. So we're really happy to
be playing close to home.  
  
Q. Muffet, usually when we get to this point, the Final Four, the coaches
are all pretty accomplished, and I think the four of you are some of the most
accomplished in the history of the game. Can you just talk about some of the
contrasts Geno and Tara and then you and Gary?  
COACH MCGRAW: Well, I'd say Geno and Tara, probably night and day. I don't
think there's a lot of similarities except for their obvious success and their
wins.  
They both have racked up quite a few wins. I think Tara is a little more
reserved and probably a little bit more politically correct than Geno is. Geno
is going to tell it like it is. He's a Philly guy. We appreciate that in
Philly.  
Gary Blair I'd say is the loquacious one of the group. He probably had you in
here a lot longer than his allotted time this afternoon. But he's definitely
someone that's got the respect of his peers, as well as the other two do.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about the matchup against Connecticut's defense and
also how do you keep your players from dealing with the pressure of we have to
score because they're scoring, we don't want to -- to make a 12-foot shot even
tougher than it has to be?  
COACH MCGRAW: They don't get enough credit for their defense. They play really
good defense. I think we've had a couple of questions about our offense
struggling against them, and probably every team has, because they do. They
play such good defense.  
I think then you're open and you probably rush your shot a little bit more. I
felt we got the same shots that we get for the most part. But we didn't make
nearly as many, because I think we were just a little bit rushing a little
bit. Somebody's coming over, you're wondering where Moore is, is she going to
block it.  
So I think for us we have to stay loose. That's one thing this team does
really well. They're a very loose bunch.  
And the pressure's squarely on Connecticut. So I think that the Big East title
is not what we're playing for right now.  
I think there was always pressure, we want to win the league. We want to win
the tournament. And I think we got this far by being loose and just playing
our game.  
And I think that maybe that happened after the Big East tournament. And now we
can relax and play our game and hopefully those shots are going to drop for
us. But they are a great defensive team.  
  
Q. You walked into my path about Philly. Do you recall when you were
coaching Archbishop Carroll meeting Geno for the first time? And what you were
impressions were?  
COACH MCGRAW: I met him through Jim Foster. He was the assistant at Saint
Joe's and I followed him in that same position. So we were both good friends
with Jim Foster.  
And I thought he was a funny guy. I liked him. We go back a long way and share
a lot of memories with the same people.  
So I have great respect for him, but he's definitely somebody that he's fun to
be around because he's -- he can tell a good story. And he's also grown into
just a great coach.  
I think when you saw him back then he was in the early stages but you knew he
had the confidence to become a great coach.  
  
Q. Muffet, he asked about this is your time, the vibe, or what you might
say. Just kind of curious, because it would be human nature to have doubt, for
three times mixing with them. But if you win this one, this one obviously
means more than the other three?  
COACH MCGRAW: I think with this team, I think they draw confidence from each
other, and I think I draw confidence from them, when I look at how confident
they are going into the Oklahoma game going into the Tennessee game, you know
we didn't talk at all about what we had to do, what was important beating
Tennessee. We just talked about what we normally do for the game plan.  
And I think with this, it's going to be the same. We looked at the three
games. We took the good things out of it, said here's what we've got to do
well, here's what we need to work on.  
And I think jokingly the fourth time is a charm because Texas A&M did it. I
don't think that's really going to come into play for us in the pregame talk
in the locker room. I think we're just going to talk about the task at hand
and really focus on that.  
And I know we're ready. We have nothing to lose. And I think that's kind of
where we're coming from.  
  
Q. Just as a follow to what you were saying about playing against UConn. You
said your team needs to play loose, but do you have to slow -- does it have to
slow down a little bit so you won't be rushing shots? And if so, what can you
do to get your players to do that?  
COACH MCGRAW: You know, I don't think we want to slow down. It's not our game.
I think we need to keep attacking and in transition and playing the game we
like to play and try to score a lot of points. I think that's where we're most
comfortable.  
I thought in the Big East at times we played too fast, as you mentioned. And
we shot too quickly, and I think in that regard, I think we do need to be a
little more selective of our shots. But overall I don't think we want to slow
the pace of the game down.  
  
Q. My colleagues and friends here want to know, wanted me to ask you where
"Muffet" came from. When you got that name?  
COACH MCGRAW: I got that name when I was probably four years old. My uncle
gave it to me and it just kind of stuck. Fascinating story.  
  
Q. Are you used to having a team that loose, and how have you had to adjust
to them a little bit because of their personality?  
COACH MCGRAW: I really have adjusted well to them. I just try to stay out of
their way. I really try to stay away from them as much as possible game day,
pregame. They're loose, they're singing, they're dancing, and I want them to
have their own personality.  
I don't want to try to impose my will on them. So I've really let them pretty
much dictate how things are going to be. And if it gets loud, that's great,
because that's when they're most comfortable. So it's been a real change for
me, from the teams in the past that we've had that have come this far.  
They were all so business-like. It was a lot different. But these guys, they
enjoy every moment, and I really -- I admire them for that.  
  
Q. Could you talk about your staff? Jonathan Tsipis, your associate head
coach, Carol Owens, who gave one up for the team, took one for the team, and
then you've got Niele Ivey in the bunch, part of the '97 Final Four team, the
2001 champions, and again this year.  
COACH MCGRAW: It's so great to have people on the bench that have been here
before. Carol Owens comes in in her first year and helps take us back where we
were in '97. 2001 she was on both of those staffs. And Niele Ivey of course as
a player on those two teams, to come back as a coach has been rewarding. She's
worked so hard to help us get us here. And Jonathan Tsipis, he's an incredibly
talented coach, does a great job with the scouting reports.  
It's great to have everybody associated with the program to have a chance to
be in the Final Four because so many coaches have never had that opportunity.  
  
Q. Realistically, the Indiana ties, playing in Indianapolis, having Skylar
and Becca, of course, is it a factor, or is it just something for us to write
about conveniently, hey, we've got some Indiana ties in the Final Four?  
COACH MCGRAW: I've definitely had a lot of questions about that, and the media
does seem to be incredibly focused on that fact that we're playing in Indiana.  
And it's a great thing for us, no question about it. We're comfortable. We're
comfortable here. Skylar's played here in the all stars. Becca's played here
in the All-Stars. It's someplace we know.  
They've probably been to games here. So I think definitely it's better than
being somewhere outside the state that we've never been before.  
  
Q. You elegantly described the other three coaches when I asked that
question. I was including you. So if you wouldn't mind, describe yourself as a
coach.  
COACH MCGRAW: I think I'm intense. I think I'm competitive. I can be almost as
sarcastic as Geno at times, but I've been working on it to try not be as
sarcastic.  
But I think still growing as a coach. I think you learn more and more every
year, and I think this year has been fun for me because I've enjoyed the
journey a lot more because I've been able to not try to be so in control.
Trying to lose a little bit of the control and give it to the team. And it's
worked out pretty well for us.  
So I think I'm still a work in progress.  
  
Q. Talk a little bit about Becca and what her style of play and just her
personality does for the team.  
COACH MCGRAW: She really -- she gets us going in the locker room. She's always
there. She has the right thing to say at halftime or after the game. She's
tough, mentally tough.  
I mean, she takes a beating every day at practice, and she never sits out. She
doesn't miss a minute. In the Big East final, she hurt her ribs, she couldn't
breathe and she passed word down the bench I'll go back in if you need me.  
The next day she came out and almost on the first play of the game took a
charge. She's so incredibly tough, I think the team draws a lot of strength
from her. She sets the tone, absolutely sets the tone for our team.  
Her physical presence, she's not going to back down from anyone. And she's
incredibly competitive. So she really is -- she's done a great job as our
leader this year.  
  
Q. With the men's tournament going on and the women's going on, of course
you guys from Indiana, Butler playing out in Houston, they're from
Indianapolis, and you're from northern Indiana, just comment on the two
schools representing the men's and the women's.  
COACH MCGRAW: It's so great to have Butler back in the Final Four for the
second time. Gosh, Brad has done such a great job with that team to be in two
Final Fours, and this year not as expected, certainly, as probably last year
was. We're all cheering for Butler, everybody in the state of Indiana I know
is cheering for Butler.  
We're really proud of what they've accomplished. I think we do look at them as
a little bit of a Cinderella story and here we are in the Final Four at the
same time.  
So we're hoping they're cheering for us, too.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## April 2, 2011

  

### [Geno Auriemma](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14072)

### [Lorin Dixon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22170)

### [Maya Moore](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19726)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Connecticut student-athletes Lorin Dixon and
Maya Moore and Coach Geno Auriemma. We'll start with an opening statement from
Coach Auriemma.  
COACH AURIEMMA: What can you say? Other than you get to this point, and I know
everybody's anxious for Sunday night to get here so we can play.  
One of the most challenging things about being in the Final Four, not that you
would trade it for anything, but by the time game day rolls around, you're
exhausted from doing all the other things you have to do.  
So we're looking forward to getting some rest tonight, and tomorrow's going to
be a big day for us and for Maya and Lorin, especially, and I know they're
anxious for it, and so am I.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Maya, certainly the career you've had has been incredible, and now people
are really kind of revving up the discussion of you being one of the best
players of all time. What do you think of that kind of conversation and where
would you rank?  
MAYA MOORE: Well, I don't get to hear it a whole lot. So I don't really have
an opinion about it, really. I think our coaching staff and just as a program
as a whole does a really good job of making sure that we're always staying
hungry, always aware of the shortcomings in our team and as players
individually so we're always working on something, always striving to be
better at something in practice, and our coaches do a good job also making
sure that when game time comes we're confident and we're ready to go and we
know we're prepared.  
So that's been my mindset for the last few years. And it's great that other
people think highly of me and my team. So that's generally how we've
approached it.  
  
Q. Maya, you guys played Georgetown a week ago, and it was a familiar foe.
Now you're playing Notre Dame for the fourth time. Is it kind of like if you
were playing a little brother or sister or big brother, sister, you know each
other well like in the backyard, that sort of thing?  
MAYA MOORE: We're definitely very familiar with each other, and I think that
can make it tougher, just because both teams know what each other likes to do.
So we're going to do a good job of trying to take that away from each other.
So it's really going to come down to the little things, and whatever team has
prepared the best and has the better will to win. In this situation it really
does come down to who has the bigger will to win.  
  
Q. Maya, give me your take as a competitor on Skylar Diggins, what makes her
good, what worries you the most when you're playing against her.  
MAYA MOORE: She's one of those players that can get in the lane. She's a play-
maker. She can shoot the 3. She can drive. She can kick.  
There's really not a lot of holes in her offensive game. So that makes her
dangerous, because she can do so many things. If you try to take one thing
away she can counter with another.  
So that's probably what concerns us the most. I think the best thing for us
would be to just try to make everything that she gets just really tough.
You're not necessarily going to shut a player like that out. But you want to
make her work and make her fight for everything that she gets, whether it's an
assist, whether it's a shot. We want to make everything for her difficult.  
  
Q. Maya and Lorin, there's a lot of players that don't get to go to the
Final Four once in their career; here you are for the fourth time. Can you
talk about what that's meant to you?  
LORIN DIXON: It means a lot. Just coming here freshman year, being able to
experience the Final Four then, you know, going every year after that. Like
you said, a lot of players don't get a chance to experience this. So for me
and Maya to have been here for four years is pretty remarkable, pretty
incredible, and it's something we'll remember for the rest of our lives.  
MAYA MOORE: I think that not only have we been to the Final Four, we've won
national championships. So we really, really value that experience.  
I think that's one of the advantages we have, is just we may not have the most
players, but we do have experience in winning national championships.  
So we're going to take that sense of urgency the way we prepare, the way we
focus, the way we approach everything, based off of that experience.  
  
Q. Maya and Lorin, does the team have the sense that the nation might not be
too upset if Connecticut gets beat? And does that motivate you? And, secondly,
there is a potential tomorrow, maybe for the first time in your careers, that
you'll be playing in a packed arena. 19,000 people may be cheering against you
because you're in Indiana and the neutral fans may want Notre Dame to win. How
does that color tomorrow's game for both of you?  
MAYA MOORE: I think that something that popped in my head is something that
Coach Auriemma tells us: If you want to be a championship team, you have to be
able to win on the road. So that makes -- whether your fans outnumber their
fans or not, you know, we should be able to win.  
We've won on the road. In the Big East it's obviously one of the toughest
conferences, and we played some tough road games. And we were able to figure
out a way to win on the road. So we're going to take that experience with us,
and know it's going to be the same basketball game. We just have to focus and
play the way we always have.  
  
Q. Lorin or Maya, why do you guys think that the coaching staff has had
success with this group?  
MAYA MOORE: You said why?  
  
Q. Why. A lot of people think that Geno and his staff have done a
particularly really good job with this group. And I want to get a player's
opinion. What do you think it's been?  
MAYA MOORE: It's been -- this has been, I think, the toughest year. Just some
of the things that we made look easy the last few years have just been a
struggle at times.  
And just having inexperience with our freshmen, having the upperclassmen, even
us, struggle a little bit with leadership at times, because we've had great
leadership ever since -- you know, sophomore year, junior year, like Renee,
and we had Tina leading the way inside. And it was more up to us, me, Moore,
and Tiffany. Caroline is not with us either.  
So it was a big challenge to see how to lead when you don't have that
experience that we were used to. So our coaches really pushed us to own it. I
mean, we even have these -- that's one of our team mottos, is just to own it.  
I think they did a great job of just how hard they pushed us physically, too,
so that we were able to be in the position that we are and able to play.  
But as far as how Coach Auriemma coached is not different than any other year.
He's always going to push us, challenge us, push us harder than we think we
can go, attention to detail. Never satisfied with -- he's always going to be
pushing.  
So I don't think that was any different. But I think it took a little longer
to hit our stride than it has in the past years.  
  
Q. Maya, how does it feel winning your third national title for -- to finish
off your senior year?  
MAYA MOORE: Well, that would be a dream come true. That's always the goal. You
know, when you're a senior you want your last game to be on a win, and winning
a national championship.  
So as great as it is to make it to the Final Four, I'm not satisfied. I know
Lorin isn't satisfied. Until we can win a national championship, and that
starts tomorrow.  
  
Q. Just to follow up, Maya, to what you were just saying about your coach,
obviously you've been with him for four years and maybe it seems like a
lifetime at this point. But can you describe (laughter) -- sorry about that.
Can you describe in your estimation, just following up what you were saying,
what kind of coach is he? What makes him tick? Does he know how to push the
right buttons to make Maya Moore go, or does he game plan so you guys walk on
the court and you're just absolutely prepared and you can power and win all
these games that you're winning?  
MAYA MOORE: That's something that I think sets him apart, is how in tune to
the team he is and to each player. It's funny, it takes you -- when you come
in as a freshman, it takes you a little while to know that usually when he
asks you a question he already knows the answer. But it takes about a year and
a half for you to get that, because he knows what you're thinking, he knows
exactly what you were doing. And it's a great teaching tool. I think that at
the core of who he is, motivation and teaching are two things that I think
he's a master at.  
And I think we both have similar personalities as far as wanting to get every
little detail right. And that's one of the things I love about him is he
challenges you mentally to expand how you think, how you attack, how you
approach things to do that one little extra thing. And it's great, because I
love that.  
I love to learn the game. I feel like -- I feel like I didn't know anything
about basketball after playing with him, because he's taught me so much about
how to play.  
And I know why things happen now. More in high school you kind of just run
around and shoot and hope it goes in. But playing for him you know why certain
things happen, how it happens, whose fault it was.  
It's just -- I feel so much more prepared every time I step on the court,
because mentally I feel like no one has trained me better or trained our team
better to play the game. And he challenges us to compete all the time, whether
you're the last player coming off the bench or whether you were a National
Player of the Year, he's going to challenge you to compete your tail off every
practice, too.  
So there's a lot that goes into it. But I've learned so much.  
Coach, you're just embarrassed because I'm talking about you.  
  
Q. Renee Montgomery has said how important her number was to her, how much
she valued wearing 20 and what it meant to her identity and the whole thing.
You had the opportunity to pass your number to, ironically enough, the next
Naismith winner or the next WBCA winner. Has she asked you if she could wear
it, and how do you feel about that? I don't know if you're superstitious.
Would you be honored to have Kalana wear23? Or what's the situation with
that?  
MAYA MOORE: I'm kind of messing with her a little bit. I'm not giving her a
straight answer. I think she wants it. She's talked about wanting to wear it.
But it's to be determined. I haven't decided yet.  
But she's great. She's done such a great job representing for herself, her
family and for us as a future Husky. So I'm excited to see her. Once Coach
gets ahold of her, I'm excited to see that whole class next year.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Could you just talk about Skylar Diggins a little bit and expand on what
does she do well and what worries you as a coach when you play against her?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Coaches love to talk about the difference in players being
probably the most significant when they go from freshman year to sophomore
year.  
And I remember when Notre Dame came to our place last year. She was a
freshman. She was completely overwhelmed by the whole atmosphere, the whole
situation and wasn't able to lead her team.  
And now you fast-forward to the three times that we've played them this year,
and she owns their offense. She runs the show for them about as well as I've
seen any guard direct Muffet's offense.  
And when you have somebody that can score like she can and is unselfish, and
now is confident, that makes for a tough matchup for anybody on our team.  
And she's playing with a lot of confidence right now. But it's like every
other player, it took a year. And now here they are.  
So it's no stretch to say that they lost a lot of players to graduation last
year. But Skylar's growth has contributed probably more than anything to them
being here.  
  
Q. Coach, you said early in the season that there are times when you play a
team, they already lost before the game starts because they look at the jersey
and see UConn and the game's over. You're playing a team for the fourth time
who played you tight this year. What goes through your mind? The scouting
report, obviously you've seen them enough, the players probably know
everything you're going to say about them already, what goes through your mind
what goes through your mind playing a team for the fourth time of the
season?  
COACH AURIEMMA: It depends. If the other team is lousy, it's not a problem.
You would like to play them 12 times. But playing a really good team for the
fourth time, that's not something that ideally you would want to be doing at
this time of the year.  
But I'm sure somebody is probably asking Muffet what's it like to lose to them
three times and now you've got to try to beat them in the semifinals of the
national championship.  
So it depends what locker room you're standing in if you have a different
perspective on this game. You know, we think, because we've played them three
times and been successful, then there's no reason why we shouldn't be
successful the fourth time.  
They're probably thinking, you know, we've learned all there is to learn and
this is the time when we're going to get them.  
Scouting reports and all that stuff, pretty much out the window at this point
in the season. I don't know that there's anything that they're going to do
that's going to be significantly different. Maybe a couple of touches here and
there that might be different. Same with us.  
I don't think Notre Dame is going to see anything from us tomorrow that they
haven't already seen in one of those three games. It might be a little
different wrinkle here and there.  
But it's just going to be about making plays. Is Skylar Diggins going to make
enough plays. Is Maya Moore going to make enough shots. Is Stefanie going to
make enough plays in the lane and is Devereaux Peters going to block enough
shots and be an impact.  
From the coaching standpoint, it's really not much we can do at this point.
It's probably like taking horses to the Kentucky Derby, the gate opens and
they start running, and let's see who wins.  
  
Q. You are one of two coaches in this tournament that have seniors on their
team that have finished every career season with a Final Four appearance. What
keeps these programs so dominant, and why aren't there those underdogs in the
Final Four? And what's going to take the tournament to have there be underdogs
and what's going to keep your programs dominant?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, because players get -- because they stay until they're
seniors, I think the schools that recruit the best freshmen end up having the
best seniors. Generally. Not always.  
So you have to -- you kind of have to spread the players around, which is
starting to happen a little bit. It's not going to change as quickly as some
people want, because there's just probably not enough great players to go
around, but you're starting to see a difference in the last 10 years of
different types of programs getting better and better.  
The NCAA Tournament for women, the way it's set up right now, the best teams
are always going to be playing at the end. There's not going to be any upsets,
very few, I should say.  
And that's good and bad. Bad for those teams that want to be one of the
Cinderellas. Good sometimes for the fans, because you're only going to see the
best teams with the best players playing on the biggest stage.  
  
Q. Seems like for over a decade Muffet's had to drag her team across the
country to play Big East tournaments in Hartford and Storrs. And it's always
sort of put up a brave face, hasn't been too successful. Do you think she's a
little happy that you have to take your team across and play this game in her
home state?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I don't know. I've always said that when we've had the best
team we've won the Big East tournament. Didn't matter whether it was in Storrs
or in Rutgers or whether it was at Georgetown or Seton Hall. When we had the
best team, we won it. When we didn't have the best team, we didn't win it.  
I think Notre Dame's program is such that I don't know that they measure
themselves any more in Big East championships or that sort of stuff.  
I think getting to a Final Four and winning a national championship is
probably where they're at. Being at home or being somewhat of a home game
tomorrow -- I don't know, my guys don't seem to be bothered by it.  
I haven't heard anybody say anything about it. I don't think that's going to
be enough to get Notre Dame over the top if they don't play well. And if they
play well, it doesn't matter where the game was being played, they would win.  
So I don't know if the crowd's going to have that much of an impact tomorrow.  
  
Q. Notre Dame's in the top 5 for field-goal shooting percentage. But against
your team they're at about 33 percent for the three games combined. Can you
talk about your defense, just what gives you the advantage in the matchup?  
COACH AURIEMMA: They're one of the harder teams to play against because of
that. They do shoot the ball well and they shoot it from a lot of different
positions.  
It's not just certain players that you've got to worry about. But we've got
pretty good defenders at the positions that they like to shoot it from them.
So the matchups are pretty good for us.  
But not great. Don't get me wrong. We have a great defender on our team, Kelly
Faris. And I wish tomorrow if she could guard Skylar Diggins and Natalie
Novosel every possession, I would tell you we're going to kill them. But it's
impossible for one player to guard everybody.  
So something's going to give. And I think our defense is such that over a
period of 40 minutes, the intensity level and the focus on what we're trying
to do stays pretty constant.  
So even though teams may have stretches where they shoot the ball well against
us, when you add it up over 40 minutes, I think it takes its toll. And some
teams, you know they'll play good defense for 10 minutes, 15 minutes, 20
minutes. But I've got a group right now that they're pretty good at keeping it
for 40 minutes.  
And the final thing is I think our offense helps our defense. Because when
we're putting points on the board almost every possession or every other
possession, the pressure on the other team to have to score gets greater and
greater and greater, and then that makes that same 17-footer a lot tougher to
make when you know you have to make it or you're down 12.  
So if the score was always a one- or two-point game, I think those shots would
be easier to make, but because we get people and we get them down, I just
think it's a little more difficult.  
I don't expect tomorrow's game to be a high-scoring offensive game, even
though both are terrific offensive teams. Final Four usually doesn't lend
itself to that, for whatever reason. I know we just want to get more than 12.  
  
Q. Maya's never really, I don't think, had to sort of take over an entire
game for 40 minutes and try to win it. When you get to this point would you
ever tell her, hey, from the beginning win it for us, or would that put too
much pressure on her or throw your offense out of whack? Would you ever tell
her, hey, just take it over from the beginning and win it for us?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I think she tries to do that every game. When you watch her
play, you just say -- she'll come down and take shots that just drive me
crazy.  
You don't want to change anything you're doing at this time and say we're
going to go against everything we've done and just try to rely on one person
to win it for us.  
But I think there are things you can do to maximize that one individual. There
are things you can do within the course of your offense to get that player
more shots than they normally would.  
And if we had Renee Montgomery I would tell you that Maya would get 40
tomorrow. But we don't. So even if we tried to get her that many points, it
would be difficult, because Bria doesn't always know where Maya is, whereas
Renee did. Or Caroline did. And Bria doesn't have that.  
We were practicing today and we were doing some things, and Stefanie was here
and Maya was here, and you know that with one more second, just wait, Stefanie
is going to set a screen and Maya's going to get a jump shot. And before that
second came, Bria throws the ball to a wide-open Lorin Dixon who catches it
and goes "duh." So I asked Bria, Do you know what we're trying to get here in
this possession?  
So those things happen a lot during the course of the game. And when Renee was
here, that never happened. Never. So if we can get Bria tomorrow to just
recognize and see things, Maya will probably get a lot more shots than she's
been getting.  
  
Q. Before Baylor lost to A &M, Kim Mulkey talked about her concern with
freshmen playing like freshmen. Do you have those same fears when you get up
in the morning that just one day they're going to act like the inexperienced
players that they are?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah. Yeah. For sure. I think any coach that's relying on
freshmen and doesn't feel that way is probably not being honest.  
I come to practice every day and I just watch Bria and Stefanie and see what
their body language is, how they're feeling, emotionally where are they. And
no matter how much you try to prepare them for it and work on certain things
and talk to them or what their teammates say to them, when the opening tip
goes up at 9:30-something tomorrow night, you're going to have two kids out
there that are going to be a little bit jittery.  
And if they're not, then we're not going to win. So part of that is going to
be normal and encouraged. But whether or not it stays throughout the game, you
always worry about that. You always worry about that.  
And not so much for Stefanie. I said this before. Not so much with Stefanie.
But you've got to have great guard play in the NCAA Tournament.  
And when you're looking at a freshman point guard, they don't know how to be
great yet. I don't care how talented they are. I don't care what kind of
regular season they had, they don't know how to be great.  
So we'll see tomorrow. We'll see.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Texas A&M student-athletes Sydney Carter,
Danielle Adams and Sydney Colson, and Coach Gary Blair. We'll begin with an
opening statement from Coach Blair.  
COACH BLAIR: Texas A&M, we say howdy. You're supposed to say howdy back. And
most of y'all are just getting up, I understand. Sportswriters work in the
afternoon and at night.  
So we appreciate -- the media coverage has been great. I look back to 1992
when I was at Louisiana Tech and the first NCAA Final Four was at Norfolk,
Virginia. This was about the total number of media that covered the whole
tournament. Look at us today. It's been very special to see the growth of
women's basketball, seeing the media coverage.  
There was excellence on the court back in 1980 and '81 and '82, but I think
we've taken the game to the next level, with the help of the media, with the
help of television, and with the help of some pretty doggone good coaching
along the way.  
This team has earned its way here. We've done it the hard way. Our strength of
schedule is No. 3 or 4 in the country. We play in the Big 12, which we
consider the best conference in the country. And I know everybody has
arguments for their own, but top to bottom, what we've done in our RPI over
the last five or six years has justified how good our league is top to bottom.  
I think we're going to present a little bit different style than the other
three teams that are playing. All of us have good offensive players that can
create their own shots.  
We can all run the floor. We can all play defense. But we try to play pressure
defense 94 feet, sometimes we'll back it off to the half court. But when you
come down, we want it to be hard for you to run your offense.  
We're not going to play hope-you-miss defense. We're going to hopefully play
make-you-miss. And that's a little bit of the difference. We're not in a hurry
to get to the offensive end; we're in a hurry to stop you on the defensive end
and let's get down the court and play.  
I'm proud of the young ladies here, the two Sydneys, they've sort of been the
face of Texas A&M for the last three or four years, both on and off the court,
in the classrooms, everywhere. These kids are more recognized around College
Station than this old man ever will be.  
Danielle Adams we've only had for really about 18 months, because she was a
Junior College All-American. She's done what it's taken to be able to play our
style of ball. And she could have gone to other schools that played more of a
half court game. But this style of ball that we're playing, I think it's going
to get her ready for the next level.  
And she's one of the most versatile players I've ever had the opportunity to
coach. Questions?  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Both Sydneys, just jumping off to what Gary said about the pressure
defense, in watching Stanford, which many people perceive the vulnerability is
the guard, what do you think you guys will be able to do to exploit them?  
SYDNEY CARTER: Speaking on my end, I think both me and Sydney are really good
on making the point guard on the opposing team uncomfortable and making them
try to run a high-low offense, making sure that they're not making any of
those entry passes. So if Sydney is on the ball, I'm definitely denying the
wings, and vice versa.  
I think we'll be pretty successful in making them uncomfortable, making them
run something they don't really want to run, because it's just the style of
defense we play. So hopefully we can do that.  
SYDNEY COLSON: Pretty much what Syd said, we like to get up and pressure
people. That's a big part of where we get our energy from and where we get a
lot of momentum from, on the defensive end.  
So when Syd and I are clicking and playing a point guard hard or taking away
passes on the wing and making the point guard do something that they don't
want to do, we know we're doing our job and we're getting steals and getting
out in transition. That's what we really enjoy doing, and it's easy points. So
that's why we work so hard on defense, just to try to convert on the other
end.  
  
Q. Both Sydneys, your situation last week against Baylor is precisely the
one Notre Dame faces against Connecticut. And I'm wondering how does an
athlete put aside the frustration of losing continually to a team to find the
resource to come back and beat them on the big stage.  
SYDNEY COLSON: A big part for us was just coming together and having the goal
in mind to go out there and play hard and get a win. You have to believe,
first of all, because I think that when you lose three games in a row, it can
definitely take a toll on a team and make you think that you're not capable.  
I think that in our case we realized that they were all one-possession games
that we were losing by. It was just the fact that we would go for spurts
without scoring in some games. We would stop doing what we were doing on
defense and what had been working for the whole game. So we knew it was a
matter of possessions that was really stopping us from winning and getting
over that hump to get the win.  
So we came out and we played 40 minutes hard from beginning to finish, and the
regional final and we came out victorious.  
I think you just have to have the mindset that you're able to win.  
SYDNEY CARTER: I definitely think that you use those last couple losses as
fuel. You use them as learning expenses and not dwell on past losses you had
against that team.  
But I think it also helps that you have something so big on the line. Notre
Dame and UConn playing for a spot in the national championship game. And I
think that puts a little sense of urgency into each team to kind of battle it
out again and see who comes out as the aggressor and see who comes out and
tries to outsmart or out-tough the other team.  
So I think it definitely helps that there's something on the line that's big
and that is everybody's ultimate goal and to use it as a learning experience
and go from there. And you gotta have that confidence and that focus and that
attitude to go in there and say y'all beat us this time but there's more on
the line so we're going to get it done this time.  
  
Q. Danielle, the Stanford team likes to pound the ball down low to the
Ogwumike sisters. How will you and your teammates try to counter that and what
do you think of them as players?  
DANIELLE ADAMS: Well, we played against tough post players in the Big 12.
Brittney Griner, the girl from Oklahoma. I've played against many great post
players. It's nothing changed, just doing great on my technique and being
aggressive.  
  
Q. Sydney Colson, just wanted to ask: I watched the video on the A &M
Athletics website of you guys coming into Indianapolis the other day. The team
seemed to be very upbeat. Loose. Confident. Is that a correct assessment? And
just how do you feel about the mood of the team right now?  
SYDNEY COLSON: You know, after our win we were really excited. But we brought
it back down to reality when we got to College Station and focusing on the
next opponent. That's what you have to do.  
Of course you're happy to be at this point. This is a first time for us, in
Texas A&M history, that we've made it to the Final Four. But we kind of put
the excitement to the side. We don't want to make it seem like we weren't
expecting to be here, because from the beginning of our season we were
confident that we were capable of making it to this point. We knew it was a
matter of time and it was really up to us working hard throughout the year,
not giving in when adversity hit. And I'm proud that we did that.  
We were strong mentally and physically throughout this entire season, and
we're happy to be at the point that we're at right now.  
  
Q. Sydney Carter, what's your mindset when you -- a lot of times you will
guard the opponent's best perimeter player. And a lot of times that player is
much taller than you. So what's your mindset when you have to guard someone
who is 6', 6'1 "?  
SYDNEY CARTER: I just go into that game, especially if they're taller -- like
you said, most of the time they are. I try to go into that mindset that I've
got to play taller and I've got to be smarter than that person.  
And I'm pretty defensive-minded. I've got to make sure I'm playing with that
passion and that intensity that Coach Schaefer coaches me with and make sure
it definitely has to rub off on me because that's what I'm in the game to do.
I'm in there to guard the best player.  
So I have to make sure that I'm doing my part playing post defense 30 feet
from the basket, helping the post players out and making sure that, you know,
I'm doing my part on the defensive end so that my man's not getting those easy
looks maybe that they're used to getting.  
So I guess I come in there with the mindset that I have to be the aggressor on
the defensive end. Especially if they're an aggressive offensive player, I've
got to outdo them on the defensive end. I just have to make sure I bring that
physicalness to every single game.  
  
Q. Both Sydneys, could you talk about what it is to play with Danielle on
and off the court?  
SYDNEY COLSON: She doesn't bring anything. She's really a detriment to our
team. I'm just kidding (laughter).  
You all have seen her play. She just makes the game fun and easy for us. In
the past A&M hasn't always had post players that were really efficient scorers
or scored a lot of points in games. And Danielle brought that to our team.  
She's been a tremendous asset. She can step out and shoot the 3. She has a
mid-range game. She can bang it down low and get and ones and excellent
rebounder.  
She brings physicality to our team and she's an excellent second line of
defense.  
If people get by us on the defensive end, she's there to take the charge a lot
of the time. And she's just a really heady player, and she knows the game of
basketball well.  
So it's been fun playing with her. But we're not done.  
SYDNEY CARTER: I'd definitely say she's one of the best post passers I've
played with. She's one of the best finishers, and she's so unselfish. And like
Syd said, she makes it really easy for us to play with her out there on the
perimeter.  
It's so easy to just pass it in there and just say, Danielle, go finish,
because most of the time she's pretty accurate with finishing.  
But, like I said, she's really unselfish. If she sees that two people are
guarding her, she knows that one person is open and she's yelling at us to
pass it to that person.  
I like the fact she's an All-American, but I think what helps with that is
that she is unselfish. And she just makes it really easy for us. She's a great
helper on the defensive end, and that really helps us out a lot, that she
plays team defense as well. So I think she's just an all-around team player.  
DANIELLE ADAMS: Thank you guys.  
SYDNEY CARTER: I love you. (Laughter).  
  
Q. What is your most successful achievement in your basketball career?  
SYDNEY COLSON: I think making it to this point has been a moment that I won't
forget, obviously, just because this is the first time it's happened for us.
And the team that I was on my freshman year we made it to the Elite Eight, but
I didn't really play a lot that year. I got minutes every now and then, but it
was awesome to watch the girls that were juniors and seniors on that team.  
They showed us how to lead, and they showed us how to work hard and how to
work for a goal that you really believe that you could achieve.  
DANIELLE ADAMS: Mine is just playing with these girls, and just getting to the
point, getting to this point with them. And just being able to have fun on and
off the court. Sydney Colson, the jokester. And then there's Carter.  
But just getting here with them and being able to help my team get here at
this point and just being an asset to this team.  
SYDNEY CARTER: I'd have to say just choosing to come to A&M as a whole. I
think that I've got to experience so much with the girls that I've played
with.  
And just as much success as we've had. And I started out not even wanting to
play at all when Coach Blair came and gave me a home visit and he sold
basketball to me instead of the actual school. So I think that really helped
me out.  
But just coming here has just been -- I've been so blessed to have this
opportunity with the people that I've had and everything that I've gotten to
experience with travel and the success we've had as a basketball team. So I
definitely don't know where I'd be without the experiences I've had.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. What do you as a coach tell your team in a locker room for a game like
you played against Baylor last week? How do you approach their mindset, make
them believe that they could overcome the three defeats and win that game?  
COACH BLAIR: The first thing I told them is when we got off the bus right
there at American Airlines Center, I stood up and told them: Do not get off of
this bus unless you expect to win. Want tos and could haves and should haves,
that's not going to cut it at this level.  
If you really expect to win, I mean, that is just something that you have to
have the mindset. Sydney Carter was the first one that jumped up.  
And I just believe these kids -- I've been here before. I've always been the
Cinderella, the trendy team, or back at Louisiana Tech, we were the best team
for that era right there, from '80 to '85, '86. And it's a different mindset.  
But I think when I look at the Hall of Fame coaches that I'm going against,
with Tara and Geno and Muffet, they've all accomplished that.  
It is not for Gary Blair to accomplish it, because I think I've had a pretty
good career. But to be measured, Texas A&M, which used to be just called a
football school, y'all realize that in 20 sports we're in the top 10 right
now? Top 10 in those sports.  
And used to be you would hear about football or you would hear about our band.
But now all of a sudden we're a complete university. Sort of like what the
Ohio States and Stanfords are doing out there and some other schools.
Florida's winning in all sports.  
And I'm proud of that from the university, because we're probably going to win
another track championship or two.  
The equestrian will win Big 12 this weekend today. And our baseball team, our
golf team, that's what's so fun.  
The e-mails that I've gotten or the calls from my coaching colleagues across
the nation, that's great. But the ones I've gotten from the people at the
university has been special. Texas A&M. I hope I answered your question.  
Let me throw something on this one while I'm thinking of it. Did you hear
Danielle? This morning at 9:00 she just got the biggest award that can ever be
given out, State Farm All-American, and she talked about playing with her
teammates.  
That was her number one accomplishment. Playing with her teammates and just
having fun. That's what that kid's all about. You saw ten of the greatest
players, the greatest players in the game today. And again she deflected that
to her teammates that she's with now.  
And she came off the bench last year. That's how dumb I was. She came off the
bench last year because we wanted that offense off the bench. And Carter came
off the bench last year. So that's two pretty good players right there.  
  
Q. I'd like to ask you two questions knowing that it might take up the rest
of your time up there, but do you feel like you guys have put the Baylor win
behind you and not carrying it over here, particularly? And also the two
Stanford sisters, are they as tough to stop as they are to pronounce their
names?  
COACH BLAIR: Sure. Just think about it. Every time I flew out recruiting, I
drove by their high school, which is 45 minutes. And we recruited them hard.
We lost them, fair and square, to Stanford, a great academic school, a great
basketball school.  
And we lost them. But I thought about them every day since I've been at A&M,
because that's where I would fly out of Houston. And every day I would look at
that school and say, hey, but we're winning with the kids that chose us.  
And after I would pass Cy-Fair High School I would stop at Five Guys
restaurant and get a big ol' cheeseburger and it didn't matter by then.  
But what those two sisters bring is so much energy. I think that's the
difference back when Stanford was winning in '90 and '92, whatever the two
years they were doing it, it was with great precision, with Azzi and great
point guard, and later on in the 2000s with Wiggins and everything, but
they've never had anything like those two sisters.  
And they're very special. They're great students. They're great young ladies,
and they just kill you on the boards. They just constantly move without the
ball. And that's what a basketball coach looks for, is somebody that can do
something when they do not have the ball.  
And that's what makes them very efficient. Now, what are we going to do with
them? Try first to keep them off the boards. We've got enough other problems
with Pohlen and Pedersen and the rest of them.  
They're a complete team. This will be the most complete team that we've played
this year, and we've played Duke also. And we've played Rutgers and Georgia
and all of them, and Baylor.  
But this is a complete team that has no weaknesses, all the way from the
coaching staff on down. The only thing we've got better than them, I like my
Yell Leaders a lot better than that tree that walks around like that.  
But it's going to be a great game.  
  
Q. Regarding Danielle's development, both you and she have talked about her
remarkable weight loss. How has she done it? And what has it meant to her
development as a player?  
COACH BLAIR: I think the quickness -- in junior college, junior college is
about transition and about creating offense off the bounce. It's not about
defense.  
It's about doing the things, and it's about getting yourself academically
sound so you can be able to compete in the classroom, not just on the court.  
And that's hard. Nobody ever thinks about that. Those kids are coming from
junior college now have to go against those kids that have got the 26 to 32
ACTs. And now all of a sudden emotionally can they compete in the classroom,
are they going to fit in. Are they going to be able to -- our style.  
We just got finished going to the Elite Eight without her. And so she said,
Hey, I want to come make a difference at A&M. But I want you to make a
difference with your style of play, how we play defense.  
We put her all over the court on offense. I've run so many plays. I'm one of
those maverick coaches, I'm not going to have a pretty triangle offense. I'm
not going to run the flex. I'm not going to run a pure motion. I run a whole
lot of stuff.  
I sit up at night with a legal pad like you've got and watch those West Coast
games from about 11:00 to 1:00 a.m., writing down different things that will
fit in our offense.  
So I'm a set coach, and we have a lot of options off of it. And that's just
how we play. Now, people are going to play zone. I've got to be a little more
predictable with our 1-3-1 offense or triple post offense. Whatever it takes
to score.  
But we want to attack. If we get passive against the zone and you see us out
there and we've got four people outside the 3-point line, we're in trouble. We
have got to get inside and make things happen.  
And that's what Colson can do for us.  
  
Q. During the course of a long career, I'm sure you've developed
relationships with many interesting and successful people, both in the women's
game and men's game. Can you talk about some of the people who had an impact
on you career, professionally, and just some of the special relationships
you've come across over the years?  
COACH BLAIR: Leon Barmore, for one. That's a start. I was with him five years
at Louisiana Tech, now I'm competing against him. He's got the best job in
America now.  
He works six months a year. He doesn't have to recruit. All he does is come in
and help Kim. And the day they win or lose he's back in Rustin playing golf.
That's a great job. Just think if we could all have that type.  
Go back to Sue Donohoe, she was our manager at Louisiana Tech. She's running
this whole damn tournament. She runs women's basketball. She was my assistant
coach at Stephen F. Austin. Then she came to Arkansas with me for a year
before she went into administration.  
To be able to see women choose the correct side of athletics -- some women are
better suited to go into the administration part, and they're so much better
than men in a lot of those areas, because they pay attention to details.  
And then to see the women that stay in the coaching, studying under Pat
Summitt, I was a high school coach when I first met her, and just be able -- I
studied by far the intensity she has.  
When Geno and I both got head jobs the same year in 1985, he was in Virginia
and I was at Louisiana Tech. And look at the different stops that we've made
along the way. And he's been able to just take Connecticut to that next, next
level. He's an icon up there. He's as important to that state as Jim Calhoun
is. And a guy that you never heard of, Bob Schneider, coached at West Texas
State and Canyon High School.  
Those are the people that shaped my life, and you just want to be thankful and
appreciative, because it doesn't happen. It doesn't happen all the time.  
It's just a good ride. I'm enjoying it. I'm not looking to retire. I'm not
looking to be as old as Joe Paterno and keep coaching too, but I'll give it a
hell of a ride until then, and then I'll be on that golf course and I will
beat Barmore on the golf course, I think.  
  
Q. Gary, sometimes, when you get to this point, it can be matchups can make
the difference. And it appears that you guys just have the kind of team, the
kind of style that is a great matchup against Stanford. Can you just talk
about the matchup? And I know you've addressed part of this, but were you glad
in a way that you got Stanford, like, hey, this is something that we can
exploit?  
COACH BLAIR: You know, it's sort of funny -- when I was at Arkansas, I was
always on the bubble. I was a bubble team. I could figure out the bracket as
well as the committee could.  
And I got 62 out of 64 this year. That's a down year for me. Usually it's 63.
I've never gotten 64 yet. They just don't listen to me.  
But I like the bracket. I thought we possibly could go west again. Okay? To
tell you the truth, I was worried about Tennessee, because I thought at the
time Tennessee was playing tremendous basketball going in. It didn't bother me
going to the Dallas Region, because I wanted to be able to bring our fans --
and we're still trying to grow the sport at A&M. They've got spring football
still going on there at the same time we've got this going on. And they're
getting a lot of hits on that.  
I have to grow my sports and get the crowd to come to Final Fours and to
regionals, and to do that I needed to be in Dallas. And I guarantee you, our
season tickets will go sky high next year. Not just because we're here, but
we're educating fans that there is another sport. You do not always have to
wait for football or men's basketball.  
Stanford, I just admire their execution. I saw them when they were bad when
they played DePaul, without Pedersen, and they were not really playing Chiney
as much. I know what the sisters can do. And I know what Pohlen has done as a
point guard.  
A lot of times we were able to handle the situation -- with Baylor we had a
senior point guard going against a great freshman point guard. And so
sometimes that's the difference. Seniors win for you. Seniors take it to that
next level.  
And while I'm thinking of it, sir, your Giants beat my Rangers, but I grew up
a Giants fan. I'm a Willie Mays fan, and if you can get me an autographed ball
or his rookie card there, you and I will have dinner and I'll be your fan for
life. But Willie Mays and Whitey Ford. Whitey Ford was my other one. So that's
want I really need. And then get Larry Bird to come to the ballgame tomorrow
night. Hey, what a great time I would have.  
  
Q. Can I get you something from Connecticut?  
COACH BLAIR: Geno's paycheck. His restaurants. His summer camps, everything
(laughter). I mean, what does Geno not have?  
  
Q. I don't know. I haven't been able to figure it out.  
COACH BLAIR: I'm just another pretty face up here. And Geno's got it all.  
  
Q. Speaking of him --  
COACH BLAIR: And as Geno says, he's got Maya Moore.  
  
Q. We thought for a while this year that Connecticut was going to play Texas
A &M next year in St. Thomas, but I guess that's not going to happen. Have you
and Geno had any discussions about putting together a series in the future and
can you tell us about that?  
COACH BLAIR: We've tried to get series going with Stanford. We'd love to play
Tennessee. We'd love to play Connecticut. We are trying to work on the Jimmy V
game which they're hosting next year.  
And ESPN's working hard. But we have got to get a Big Ten team to change or
else we cannot go to the game. Last year we got a change a date where we could
play Duke in the Jimmy V. But I'm going to go Connecticut as long as Geno
comes back and plays at our place, and they will. And they're playing Baylor
this year, and it will be a great series because we're not going away.
Danielle Adams graduates, Sydney graduates. We've got great replacements
coming in. I think that's what happens when you get to this level. You don't
become just the one-and-out team.  
That's why I'm loving coaching right now, because we've got a great transfer
coming in in Kelsey Bone, we've got a great freshman point guard coming in.
And when you've got a Sydney Carter playing defense for you every day and just
make practice fun, that's what you want to do.  
Geno's had it for a long time, and he's going to continue to have it, because
I think players today, they want to go to school to win championships. When
you look at the men, they're renting players. They're renting players.  
The one and outs, they're there for one year. That's what the beauty of the
women's game is. Thank heavens there's not enough money in the women's game or
some smart-ass lawyer is going to come in and say, Well, Tiger could play at
18; the women should be able to play, the Brittney Griners and the Maya
Moores.  
But there's not enough money for the lawyers to take over and say it's worth
their while. Our kids are playing four years, they're graduating. I think I
heard a stat that 83 percent of the women's basketball players nationwide are
getting their degrees. That's pretty doggone good. And there's probably some
of you out in the audience that played women's basketball that are now holding
very good jobs.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_DALLAS, TEXAS_  
  

Texas A&M  58  
Baylor - 46

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Baylor head coach Kim Mulkey and student-
athletes Melissa Jones and Brittney Griner.  
We'll take questions from the floor.  
  
Q. Brittney, kind of a rough shooting game out there for you and the team.
In your perspective, from your perspective, was it something A &M was doing
defensively or were the shots just not falling?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: Just my shots wasn't falling. It wasn't anything A&M did.
Just poor shooting.  
  
Q. M.J., when you all cut it to seven, there was about four minutes to go.
Were you thinking it's time -- I mean, that you all still had time to come
back?  
MELISSA JONES: Absolutely. I mean, we've come back from deficits more than
that before. It just came down to A&M playing better than we did. We just
didn't come prepared. We didn't make shots. We just weren't ready to play. We
just didn't -- we just didn't play well at all. And you gotta give credit
where credit's due and A&M deserved it tonight.  
  
Q. M.J., first of all, congratulations on a fine career with Baylor. But 20
turnovers tonight, and their guards, could you talk about Sides and what you
had to go up against because you met this team four times and you knew what
they were going to do?  
MELISSA JONES: You're talking about some of the best guards in the nation. A&M
is a great team. Nobody wants to go up against them. They're just tremendous
athletes. They play well together. They're a team. And they know how to get
excited when it's necessary, and they come up with big steals and just are
just smart players. And you gotta respect them.  
  
Q. M.J., what's the mood like in the locker room right now, and what did
Coach say to you all?  
MELISSA JONES: Basically it's just hard to deal with this because we just
didn't play well. It's just one thing to, you know, just walk out knowing that
you gave it everything you had. But we didn't tonight and that's what's so
stressful and so frustrating is that we didn't give our best effort. And I
mean not taking away from A&M at all, because they played their hearts out
tonight.  
But we just -- we, on the other hand, didn't.  
  
Q. Brittney, can you talk about what M.J. gave you all tonight, right down
to the end. I mean she's busting it all over the court and just looked like a
senior that didn't want to lose?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: I'm going to miss M.J.. we're all going to miss her. She
never gave up. On the court she just kept telling us, you know just keep our
heads up and keep fighting.  
You saw she was driving. She drove into the lane and just went flying. I wish
I had some more years with her.  
  
Q. M.J., can you talk about you and Brittney as captains, during the run
where you brought it back within 7, just all the emotion you were putting into
it at that point?  
MELISSA JONES: We just know never to give up doesn't matter how much you're
down. We were still in it the whole game we were still in it. Just up until
towards the end, we just didn't take advantage of it. We just needed the whole
team to hop on board, and we just had spurts from everybody but not entire
game. And you're not going to win a ballgame when that happens.  
  
Q. Brittney, despite the loss, tough end to this season, can you talk about
the future of the program, you're still young, a lot of young players?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: We're young. A lot of learning to do. I mean, the future's
bright for us. We just gotta get in the gym, get everybody on the same page,
get everybody mentally tough and that's about it. Just mentally tough. Just
getting in the gym.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, did you feel that experience was the factor, where you had
freshmen and sophomores on the court against mostly juniors and seniors for
the most part?  
COACH MULKEY: I want you to ask Gary Blair that question, okay? . The
difference in the ballgame was guard play. Difference in the ballgame was
guard play, our inability in the first half to capitalize on their foul
trouble. Brittney had great looks, couldn't finish. We missed way too many
free throws. And, yeah, to answer your question, you know, when you reach this
point, you gotta have some upperclassmen that are comfortable, can run your
offense and can execute and we'll get better. We've had a great year.  
And 34 and whatever we are, 3 at the most wins in the history of our program,
No. 1 seed is another first. But we've elevated our program to a level where
we want to be disappointed. You want to see kids cry.  
Like M.J. said, take nothing away from A&M. But we didn't play well, and it
wasn't anything that A&M I thought did. I mean, you're still right there,
shooting 26 percent, down 11 or 12 at the half. You're still right there, and
we just couldn't score. And we've got to go back and we've got to ask
ourselves why. Why could we not score tonight?  
And we will go back to the gym and teach them.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about the challenge that it presented you to have to
beat A &M four times this season?  
COACH MULKEY: Well, I've already harped on that enough. A&M and Baylor are
going to be two of the top four or five teams in the country. If we're going
to go on geography go on and let us know for the next three years we're going
to be in the same situation, unless we're both No. 1 seeds or we're both No. 2
seeds. Nobody likes to play anybody four times, nobody. It's no fun. I said it
yesterday. I'll say it tomorrow. I'll say it next week. It's just not fun.
This is supposed to be March Madness, the excitement of it. When you've earned
a 1 and 2 seed, it is not fun.  
  
Q. Kim, is the hardest part that you didn't play well and then can you talk
about how much you hurt tonight for M.J.?  
COACH MULKEY: The hardest part is losing, but then you evaluate if you lost to
an A&M team that shot lights out and they were unstoppable and they were just
awesome tonight, you almost can handle that a little bit better.  
But I'm more concerned in trying to figure out why did we play so bad. Melissa
Jones, your heart goes out for her. You hurt for all your kids after a loss
but your heart goes out to seniors. Your heart goes out to seniors that have
the personality and the will to win that that young lady has, and she didn't
want to come out here. And truthfully I didn't want her to have to come out
here, but she did.  
And you saw a very vulnerable kid, and you saw a kid that tried to answer your
tough questions. And that's Melissa Jones.  
  
Q. Coach, you mentioned the guard play. Odyssey tonight, two points, and
just trying to make the right moves to get the ball inside. Can you talk about
that and Hayden's performance as well?  
COACH MULKEY: Odyssey was 0 for 6 and Kimetria Hayden was 1 for 5. Their
guards really weren't any better. You had two of them that were three for 11
and four for 11. Carter was seven for 15. I thought she was a difference
really in the ballgame, and especially the first half. So you know those kids
are juniors and a senior. Ours are freshman and a sophomore. They'll work and
get better. And hopefully they'll remember how it feels in that locker room. I
know they remembered how it felt last year when we beat Duke to get to the
Final Four and that was a happy locker room. And this year it's not so happy.
But you want them to remember it all.  
  
Q. You mentioned the looks that Brittney got and obviously you guys kept
going to her. Are you thinking during that stretch, she's going to start
making some of these?  
COACH MULKEY: Sure. You just keep going to her. And we did. And we tried all
night to keep going to her, and we'll do it again. If we had another ten
minutes to play we'd keep doing it.  
  
Q. What lessons can your younger players take from this tournament
considering the teams they've played and A &M and Green Bay and West Virginia
all with seniors who really showed what it looks like when a senior doesn't
want to lose their last game?  
COACH MULKEY: We'll take a lot, not just from the NCAA Tournament, but we'll
take a lot from the non-conference opponents. We played Tennessee. We played
Notre Dame. We played Connecticut. We played all the top teams out there. And
we will get better. You can only get better if you play the best.  
And as I've said all along, I'm really amazed that we are 34 and whatever we
are with the youth that we have, because at some point your youth surfaces.  
And some of the things that we've been able to get away with through the
course of those games this year you're not going to get away with when you
play a team four times. And, again, I want to congratulate A&M and I hope that
they go to the Final Four and win the whole thing so that they will represent
the Big 12 well. But, again, I'm concerned about why we played so poorly,
because I don't think it was really what A&M did. And I usually give credit.
But we were missing point-blank shots. I mean, Griner's right there at the
rim. So anyway, the nature of sports.  
  
Q. Kim, you don't like losing either. I know this has got to be tough on
you. How long does something like this stick with you?  
COACH MULKEY: Well, the older I get, the faster I can get rid of it, Jerry,
because if you don't, you're going to drop dead in this business. But 11 years
ago losses lived with me for a long, long time.  
I don't know. I don't know if I'll be over it anytime soon. But the season's
over. And I'm going to go home and I'm going to enjoy MacKenzie and I'm going
to go watch Kramer play baseball and have a banquet at the end of the year and
have the end of the season meetings with each of them and go back to the
drawing board and do what we do every year, go recruiting, and keep making
them better.

_DALLAS, TEXAS_  
  

Texas A&M  58  
Baylor - 46

  
MODERATOR: We're joined by Texas A&M Coach Gary Blair, Sydney Colson, Sydney
Carter and Danielle Adams.  
COACH BLAIR: I'd like to thank the media, all of Dallas and the Big 12 and the
basketball fans that some of them that might have been their first women's
basketball game, but I think they'll be back because of the level of play by
both teams tonight. It's very special but this tournament was very well run.
I'd like to thank my conference for running it and Dallas for giving us the
hospitality and Mark Cuban for loaning it out a little bit. His wife probably
made him since she's an Aggie.  
But this was just a very special game. Remember, we didn't ask to play Baylor.
We asked to be recognized for what we accomplished during the year. They chose
to put us in the same region, two very good games both of us could have been
in the Final Four and we both should have been in the Final Four but sometimes
that's the way it goes and you have to realize we were not making excuses when
we were put in this region. We embraced it. I said from day one, we embraced
it, and if you're going to beat Baylor you'll have to beat them to win the
national championship or you'll have to beat them to get to the Final Four.
They put us here. We accepted the challenge. We went in there and played hard.
Baylor is a great team.  
They've got the best player in America in Brittney Griner, one of the best
freshmen in Odyssey Sims and Melissa Jones, she's the heart and soul of that
basketball team. And the day she graduates they will miss her more than
Brittney Griner when she graduates, because Melissa Jones is what women's
basketball is all about. A kid paying the price that will play hurt and play
smart and what an ambassador she is to her program. But I would like to
congratulate Kim, everything that she has done for her program.  
She'll be back in next year. Don't worry about my girl Kim. They're that good
and they've got more ammunition coming in.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
Sydney Colson, Sydney Carter and Danielle Adams are joining us.  
  
Q. Gary, could you talk about the contributions of the all Sydney back court
and what they gave you tonight?  
COACH BLAIR: So special. We ran a lot of set plays because what we were going
to run we were getting in foul trouble, and we didn't want to go to Danielle
too much early and let her force shots. We wanted her to just get into the
flow of the game and she was playing fine out there, because we were shooting
in transition we were creating turnovers and steals and we were going down and
a lot of that is just my guards.  
They make good decisions, and I think that was the difference in the Georgia
game and this decision. This team is not about one person. When Danielle Adams
only played and scored six points I believe in the ballgame, she was the
happiest person for her teammates, and that's why a lot of kids want to play
at Texas A&M because of our system and how we use kids, and we'll run the
offense through anybody that's hot.  
So if it's little Sydney Carter at 5'6", she's going to get the majority of
the plays. If it's Tyra White, six foot tall that had 29 at Baylor, we'll run
it through there. If it's Danielle Adams, we'll run it there and Colson will
direct the show.  
  
Q. Danielle, can you just describe your feelings at the end of the game and
did you ever imagine you could score six points and your team would beat
Baylor by double digits?  
DANIELLE ADAMS: I was the happiest person in the world, like Coach said. Six
points, I mean, my teammates had my back and Carter did a tremendous job. I
mean, outstanding job shooting the ball. And her and Colson and Odyssey did a
great job, and I did my best on Griner.  
But me scoring six points, I mean, I got what I got. But my teammates were
there to back me up, and I'm proud of them.  
  
Q. Sydney Colson, a lot of people are already saying your fastbreak steal of
Odyssey, fastbreak and one and made free throw, that made it 11, that was the
nail in if coffin, a lot of people saying that was the greatest play in A &M
women's basketball history. Discuss.   
SYDNEY COLSON: I think TK's shot against Oklahoma was the best one when we won
at home. I needed to give myself more confidence after I double dribbled on
one fastbreak and turned it over on another I needed to do something to redeem
myself, I guess.  
But at that point we just knew that we needed to go down and get some
defensive stops, not let them get good shots up, and we knew the game was ours
at that point. But we didn't want to act like it was a huge deal.  
We came out and fought hard and the end result, the score at the end of the
game showed how hard we worked and showed that we really came out focused
tonight, and we put that 0-3 past behind us and just came out and played
together.  
  
Q. Sydney, the very determining factor was the guard play in this game. Did
you feel that all of the guards on your team were going to be able to pretty
much dominate the guard play for Baylor as much as you did?  
SYDNEY CARTER: Well, I think that on the offensive end, for our guards, I
think that, of course, I'm so small so I definitely have to work for a lot of
my shots.  
But thank God they were falling today. But I think on the defensive end, for
us, Tyra was big today. She helped out on Griner a lot. And that really helped
us out, and we were just making sure that once Griner did get it in if she did
put it on the floor the guards were there to dig it out and get those steals
as we did in the game.  
So I think guard play for us was crucial in this game. Definitely playing
against a team like Baylor with having Griner inside and being such a big
presence you're going to have to have outside shots to fall. So I'm glad they
were falling for me today.  
  
Q. Sydney Colson, was it part of the game plan to get Carter going early, or
did it just work out that way with the way she was hitting her shots?  
SYDNEY COLSON: That's always part of the game plan, she's a pure shooter when
she gets going feeling her shot, coach and I we consistently want to keep
running plays for her because she's really feeling it.  
And she's in a rhythm. So that's what we kept doing, and she was knocking them
down. And we didn't want to take anything away from her. We don't want to go
away from her when she's hot and feeling it. She did an outstanding job, 15
points in the first half, I think. And in the second half, against Oklahoma in
the Big 12 Tournament. I couldn't be more proud of the way we came out playing
tonight just playing as a team not being selfish giving people the ball when
they were open and needed the shot. I'm proud we were resilient today and all
year. And I'm just excited we're going to the Final Four now. It's huge for
our program.  
  
Q. Sydney Colson, one of the more poignant moments at the end when you
pointed to the former players on the second row. What was that like for you
looking back on that?  
SYDNEY COLSON: That was huge. Just because I'm one of the few players who was
here when we played with like that key group of girls that took us to the
Elite Eight when we played against Tennessee and lost three years ago. I knew
they were really proud of us at that point.  
All of them told us before the game that they were going to be back to support
us and just having them there to see what they helped to build in this
program. It was a huge deal. We give a lot of thanks to them. And they were
shedding tears in the stand more than us on the court. So they're some cry
babies but we love them to death always there to support us and they had our
backs from the get-go. They're the people who always believed in us.  
  
Q. The two Sydneys, talk about what the feeling was in the locker room
before the game and when did you have that feeling, was it before the game or
during the game when you knew this game would be different against Baylor than
the ones that had preceded it?  
SYDNEY CARTER: I think once we beat Georgia Sunday, I think the feeling began
then. I think that we automatically told ourselves that this was our game and
they're we're definitely going to come into this game confident and expecting
to win. I believe Coach Schaefer said before we got off the bus or Coach Blair
said before we got off the bus if you don't expect to win don't get off. And
everybody immediately got up.  
There was definitely a confidence and just an all around toughness going
through the locker room before the game and I think we had the attitude and we
needed to come out being the aggressor and I think we did that today.  
SYDNEY COLSON: I knew a little while ago, we're a team who is constantly
having bible study we're always in the word. I've had a lot of people it was
funny before this game they were people sending me texts and messages on
Facebook, sending me scriptures that they really thought would apply to our
team. And these past three games that we lost just telling us to be resilient,
give thanks to God. Leave it in his hand and go out and all you can do is play
for him. I think that's what we did tonight. And I think it showed out there
that, I think he showed out there in us and that's all we're going to do from
now on.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, I've heard you when you first started eight years ago, you invited
people to come to the games. Let's talk about this moment, what it means to
you right now to win and represent the Big 12 and now go to the Final Four?  
COACH BLAIR: Everywhere I've been, I've been a builder from, South Oak Cliff,
starting that program going to Louisiana Tech and helping to sustain it, to
Stephen F. Austin to here. I've been to places where the administration has
backed women's basketball and that does not happen at a lot of schools.  
I've been very lucky. I've hired very well. I've brought in the best assistant
coaches and we recruit the right type of kids that are going to fit into our
program.  
You just heard the best ambassadors for our program right there. Because it's
an honor to coach seniors at A&M, because they understand what the Aggie code
is all about. They understand the discipline and the sacrifice that you have
to have to play at A&M to go to school at A&M and to believe in what we're
doing. To me it's an honor. We've worked hard.  
The staff's been together a long time. I hope they all get a chance to be a
head coach, but if not I will always have a place for them.  
  
Q. After you cut down the nets, you walked down the ladder and you were
escorted off the floor by A'Quonesia Franklin, Danielle Gant, two of the all-
time building blocks of this program what did it mean to you to share that
moment with them and it probably feels to them like they're going to the Final
Four?  
COACH BLAIR: I brought them back into the dressing room, snuck them past the
guards, and brought Jamila Ganter and Dametria Buchanan back in there, and I
saw Marinka's mom in the stands earlier and it was just a great feeling,
because they're the ones that have recruited these players. They're the ones
that believed in the system and turned down offers from so-called better
schools that had name recognition to come here. That first recruiting class of
A'Quonesia and Reado and Marinka, that was the class that turned it and now
we're just following it. What I said in 1998, coming off the bus, was exactly
the same thing I said this time, which Carter was saying. Do not get off this
bus unless you expect to win.  
Unless you expect to win. Coach Schaefer reminded me before we got off and I
got up and said the same thing. This team expected to win but we expected to
win the other three games against Baylor, too. We played very hard in all
three of them. Baylor was just better all three times. But tonight it was
Texas A&M.  
  
Q. Coach, you are in the Final Four, do you have a sense of your
expectations in the Final Four?  
COACH BLAIR: At Arkansas, I'm tired of being in the trivia contest, we were
the lowest seed or the highest seed to ever get in, the ninth seed, and that's
always asked at the trivia questions.  
We're coming in as a 2 seed. A very good 2 seed who could have been a 1 seed.
We're going in with a lot of ammunition. I know we're playing a great Stanford
team that's been to four straight NCAAs. I think she's won three national
championships. We honor what she's done, but I hope she will honor what we're
doing this year because it's about this year, not all about all the other
accomplishments.  
When we go to the Final Four, what we're going to have to do is put our cell
phones away and quit saying hello and good by to all our family and well
wishers and how many tickets do you have. We've got to go and prepare to win.
We're not going on a sightseeing trip. We're not going to go look at all the
statues and all that stuff, we're going to win a national championship. We're
honored to get to the Final Four, but it will not be worth it if we do not win
it.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the zone defense that you guys switched to in the
second half and how you all were able to deny Griner the ball?  
COACH BLAIR: Coach Schaefer at the locker room we were up by 11 going bananas,
like when we get into a huddle it's like going -- it's like The View. I just
happen to be the boss of The View and so I'm Whoopie and I have the final say.  
But I'm getting it from all angles. And they're saying this might work. This
might work. This might work. Why didn't this work? All that. I said we're up
by 11. I think my plays are working pretty good.  
Coach Schaefer made the choice to go to zone early in the second half. It's a
zone that we have just put in. One day preparation on this particular zone and
it worked. It was a gimmicky thing with Tyra White coming down in front and
Griner down there and Danielle behind. And I thought Baylor tried too much to
try to get it in to Griner instead of letting some of their other players take
the ball to the elbow and get the shot off like Jones did at the end. Those
lanes were open. But we're known for our man-to-man, but we already had seven
fouls trying to guard her in the first half. But they missed some free throws
that hurt them, but the zone I thought was the difference in the second half.
So, again, give Vic all the credit in the world. He said we're going to play
it two possessions and change. And I think we played it about 45 possessions
the second half.  
  
Q. 20 turnovers for them and also a game against Georgia, Danielle was just
hitting 3s and outside perimeter shooting. This time she was a defensive
specialist. Can you talk about that a little bit?  
COACH BLAIR: You go with who is hot. When you look at balanced scoring look at
what Tyra White and Adaora Elonu did in this ballgame, and they're not even up
here.  
We wanted Adaora to hit those mid range jumpers. She missed a wide open layup
I know. If you had Brittney Griner running at you, you probably would miss it
too. But we missed about four of those wide-open layups but Danielle will do
whatever it takes on this team. That's how she has a We person. She just got
named today First Team All-American by you writers, the AP, and I appreciate
that. Our First All-American ever that was on the first, second or third team
T we've had a lot of honorable mentions and most of them were in the stands
tonight. The Danielle Adams, the Lisa Brandt and A'Quonesia Franklin and I'm
sure I'm missing Takia Starks was the only one that was not there. But that
was very special. But Danielle Adams is An All-American but she's an all-
American person. She will play defense and take charges and she will be
drafted on draft day and she will be a very good team player for whoever she
goes to.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_DALLAS, TEXAS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Baylor student-athletes Jordan Madden, Destiny
Williams, Odyssey Sims, Melissa Jones, Brittney Griner, and Coach Kim Mulkey.  
We'll take questions for either student-athletes or Coach.  
  
Q. Brittney and Melissa, obviously a team you're very familiar with, a team
that's fought you guys very hard this year. I know they remember being 12-0,
being up by 11 in Waco. Just talk about the aspects of trying to beat a team
for the fourth time in the same season, and obviously just so much more on the
line than just a Big 12 championship now.  
BRITTNEY GRINER: Definitely more on the line now. Playing A&M for the fourth
time, just looking back at film, looking back at mistakes where we had error,
and just fixing them. We know A&M's a great team. They're going to make runs,
and we just gotta withstand them, just making runs on our own.  
MELISSA JONES: You just have to have a lot of respect for A&M. Every time
we've played them it's just been within several close points. And every game
has been a battle. And that's what we'll expect again this time around.  
  
Q. Odyssey, A &M has very good guards that really get after you defensively.
Does that make you want to kind of raise your level of play, because you've
had some pretty good games against the Aggies this year?  
ODYSSEY SIMS: Just give credit to their defense. They're getting in the
passing lanes. They do a good job of ball pressure, and it's something that I
can't change, as far as offensively I can't change up my game and play up-
tempo. And that's going to create turnovers because that's not how I play. I
just have to keep my composure and keep playing my game.  
  
Q. Destiny, you guys have been very successful against Danielle Adams,
holding her to half her regular season scoring average. You've drawn that
assignment along with Brooklyn a lot of the times, getting some help. Talk
about what your philosophy is against Danielle, where you've been successful
and what you have to do tomorrow?  
DESTINY WILLIAMS: I think me and Brook hold Danielle the majority of the game,
but we also get help from other teammates. Like at some parts of the game,
B.G. holds her, and then she drives, and then we have guards try and stop her,
try to set the ball or something.  
Yeah, me and Brooke may hold her throughout the majority of the game, but it's
Baylor's team defense who keeps her scoring a lot of the time. And we just
have to keep her off the boards. She got a lot of points off -- from us -- I
mean, from Texas A&M, basically get put-backs. And just gotta be with her no
matter where she is.  
  
Q. M.J., you just talked a minute ago about what a great team A &M is, and
obviously you guys know that from having played them three times this year.
But along with that, is there -- because you're so familiar with them, is
there maybe a comfort level for you guys, just maybe knowing what works well
against them, how to attack them?  
MELISSA JONES: I don't think you can ever get comfortable with playing A&M.
But playing in the same conference, Big 12, you get to see them twice already
in the South. And then same in the conference tournament.  
For both teams you pick up on what Baylor does or what A&M does. So you become
very familiar with that. That goes to show how important and how big of a game
this is going to be and how much of a battle it will be.  
  
Q. Destiny, at the risk of misreading the mindset of the Baylor Nation out
there right now, I think there might be some fans who are a little concerned,
worried that, hey, one lapse, we beat these guys four times, we beat these
guys three times, one lapse could be really costly for us. What would you say
to the Baylor fans that are a little nervous about that?  
DESTINY WILLIAMS: Well, I think it's going to be a good game. I don't think
it's going to be an easy win for us, and we just gotta play Baylor basketball
and the best team wins.  
  
Q. Brittney, last year as a freshman you got to go to the Final Four and got
the whole experience of getting into the tournament. How different has the
experience been this year knowing what to expect and knowing what you're
trying to get to?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: That's just knowing. Basically it's nothing different. We
know what to expect. We know how the intensity is going to be, and with the
freshmen we had last year we all got experience playing time. So it's not new.
Our eyes aren't like deer in the headlight. So we're more calm and able to
play our game and run our offense and defense.  
So just experience and knowing what to expect is different this year.  
  
Q. Melissa, I know you guys watched an awful lot of the A &M game against
Georgia. Did that look like the same A&M team you faced three times or did it
look like maybe they had raised their level maybe another notch in the NCAA
Tournament? And a follow-up question, when you look at the way they shot
3-pointers, that hadn't exactly been their bread and butter, is that something
-- especially the way Green Bay shot 3-points, is that something you have to
be cognizant of against A&M?  
MELISSA JONES: Starting off yesterday A&M came ready to play. When it comes to
NCAA Tournament time, you have to expect everybody to have their best from
both teams that are playing in the game. And A&M was on top of it and taking
advantage of every situation they could. And the 3-ball, they're hitting a lot
of shots that normally they maybe wouldn't be taking. But when they have that
kind of confidence when the game's going for them, that's huge. And of course
it's something we've got to look at and know that they have weapons all over
the floor, and we've got to be aware of it.  
  
Q. Jordan, can you talk about what last year's run to the Final Four did for
you, just in terms of confidence and maybe how you feed off of that this year,
and A &M's ball pressure particularly on the wings? I know they kind of kept
it out of your hands particularly at A&M.   
JORDAN MADDEN: Last year at the Final Four it was our first time ever going,
the freshmen last year, it was like a good experience for us to go.  
And then, like, Texas A&M, like, their defense is really, you know, good. On
the wing side they pressure the ball on the wings, not try to get it in our
hands so we can feed it down to the post. So it's actually really good.  
  
Q. Brittney, I know you don't have the primary assignment on Danielle Adams,
but Gary Blair was talking about you're always a factor when she gets the ball
especially in the low post because she knows you're there. How much are you
shading over, trying to provide that help and be the presence so she knows
you're there?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: Just being big. If she catches down low, I might take a half
a step down, just have my arms up so she knows I'm there.  
It's a team effort guarding Adams. Destiny do a good job on her. And sometimes
I'm on her. It's just going to be a team effort all around on the post to
guard them. They have great post players.  
  
Q. Odyssey and Destiny, these players sitting around you obviously got to
experience the Final Four last year. And this is your first chance at it. Does
that give you guys some confidence knowing that they have been to this stage
and maybe know a little bit what to expect?  
ODYSSEY SIMS: Yes. Because they've already experienced it, so it just gives us
something to feed off going into the tournament. Just as far as like they've
already been through it. They know what to expect. They know how the
atmosphere is going to be.  
So us not experiencing it, they give us like motivation and it does give us
confidence just to keep our composure, knocking it down and just keeping our
head.  
  
Q. Brittney, does A &M's defense do anything different against you and what
do you expect from them after seeing them for three games?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: I don't think there's doing anything different. They're going
to guard you. It's going to be a physical game. It's not anything different
that they do. They just don't go away. They're going to guard you the whole
time and they're going to make you work to get the ball.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Kim, obviously the question is when you get prepared for a team that you
know so well, you've already beat them three times, talk about the challenge
of trying to do it a fourth time, when there is so much familiarity with you
and Gary and both teams.  
COACH MULKEY: Well, the challenge is what are either of us going to do
differently. He's not going to change what got him here. I'm not going to
change what got us here.  
The players aren't going to change. You might tweak an inbounds or tweak a way
you're going to guard Griner or throw a zone out there. You're going to do
what you do best. And we're just going to show them film. We're going to keep
teaching and getting better.  
And regardless of what happens tomorrow, it's not going to take away from the
fact that this program, again, has done things for the first time. We've won
34 basketball games. That's never been done at Baylor. We have got a No. 1
seed. That's never been done at Baylor. We won the Big 12 regular season and
the tournament championship. That's only been done once at Baylor.  
Does this one gain or have a little bit more weight because it's a Final Four?
I guess, yes, you could look at it that way. But it's not going to erase if we
get beat anything that this team has done.  
I've said it from day one, that's a freshman point guard down there. That's a
sophomore post player. That's a sophomore wing. That's a sophomore post, and
Gary can say it until he's blue in the face, it doesn't matter if; if you can
play, you can play.  
Your talent is only going to take you so far until you experience things in
life. It's like raising a child. And what this bunch has done with their
youth, it's probably not fair the expectations that are placed on them, and a
lot of it is because you have Griner.  
But those other players have had to play a lot of tough basketball games this
year. And we will be better because of the fact that we've played a lot of
good ones. The Tennessees, the Connecticuts, the Oklahomas, the A&Ms, the
Texas, the Notre Dames, the list goes on.  
  
Q. Kim, at the same time y'all have been to a Final Four. Is there any
built-in advantage, particularly in the experience that your players have in
getting there?  
COACH MULKEY: I don't think so. I don't think there's an advantage. I think
they are hungry to go back there and do a little bit better than they did. But
A&M is hungry to get there. They've never been there.  
So you have that hunger on both sides.  
  
Q. At the Big 12 tournament, fall back behind early in the game, 12-0,
obviously come back and win. After the game we asked you you feel like that
might prepare you well for the NCAA Tournament.  
COACH MULKEY: I didn't know at that time that we would be in the same region
with them.  
  
Q. That's my question. Could you have imagined the scenario where it would
have prepared you for A &M again?  
COACH MULKEY: No. It was a shock to me that they would do that to us. It was a
shock. And Gary knows it was a shock to him. When we shook hands at the Big 12
Tournament, we were like we can get there, we're telling each other we'll see
you in the Final Four. That's basically the conversations that were taking
place between me and him and the players.  
And I said it last night, and I'll say it again, there's no need to get angry
at the committee. The committee is given a set of parameters and agendas, and
that's hard to do. They have agendas and they have explanations for why they
do things. I guess maybe the only thing that personally I would like to see as
a coach is I would like to let us know ahead of time that geography isn't
going to be a factor so we're not caught off guard.  
Some years we use geography. Some years we don't. We use geography in the
first round where you can't have a first round opponent in your conference,
but yet when you get down to it we want butts in the seats.  
It's just hard to all embrace that, in my opinion, a top 2 seed is playing not
the four No. 1 seed, probably about the third No. 1 seed from the same
conference. And it's not fun. It's not fun for y'all. It's not fun for our
fans.  
Is it good for women's basketball? I don't know that it is. I'm not sure that
Baylor needed A&M here to sell tickets. And I'm not sure if A&M was here
without Baylor they would need Baylor here to sell tickets.  
I don't buy putting rear ends in the stands. So it is what it is. And we're
going to always have agendas in women's basketball. But I just hate it because
both teams are good enough to be in the Final Four, more so than, in my
opinion, the other regions.  
  
Q. Could you just talk about the luxury of having somebody like Destiny and
Brooklyn off the bench that you can kind of throw a tag team at Danielle that
you didn't have that last season where you could do that sort of thing?  
COACH MULKEY: Well, those kids were in our program last year, spent the whole
year guarding Brittney Griner and learning the system and every day in
practice. And they're both McDonald's All-Americans coming out of high school.
Not that that matters; I've seen some that had McDonald's in front of their
name and wondered how they ever got on there.  
But they're good. Destiny Williams is quietly good. She can shoot the ball.
She's defended Danielle the most. Brooklyn does her work in more of an
exciting way. You see the blocked shots. You see the leaping ability. You see
the rebounds.  
And they both are starters in my eyes. I just can't start but five, and I
start Destiny and get a feel during the game on when I need to insert
Brooklyn.  
  
Q. We know what an intense game it's going to be tomorrow. Gary was in here
earlier saying it's going to be the best college women's basketball game ever
in Dallas, maybe in Texas. But the question I have for you, we know what a
dogfight your team had last night against Green Bay and they had a little bit
of an easier game, does that play into it at all?  
COACH MULKEY: No. Not at all. It's the NCAA playoffs. You need to, first of
all, give Green Bay credit, guys. They're like the Butler on the men's side.
They play that style. And Butler's now in their second Final Four. Green Bay,
their system and their style just is good. It's hard to defend. And I don't
think that anything that happened yesterday will be a factor in the game
tomorrow.  
  
Q. There's always going to be a lot of talk about Brittney and Danielle and
all this stuff. But seems in this tournament the 3-pointers end up being the
dagger for a team one way or another, start a run, end a run. Can 3s be a
pretty big factor in the game tomorrow on both sides?  
COACH MULKEY: I think big shots maybe could be a factor. You've got to
remember, how many of those 3s did A&M make yesterday against a zone?  
There's no secret with me. If I play a zone, you're going to say she lied to
us. So I might lie to you. But I would hope that if we play a zone, we're not
giving A&M as many open looks. They had some serious open looks yesterday. And
they did what you're supposed to do at this level. You're supposed to knock
those shots down.  
But I think big shots from other people could be the difference in the game. I
think rebounding could be the difference in the game.  
  
Q. Just looking back through the box scores, Kim, and Brittney hasn't left
the court against A &M in the three games, she's played all 120 minutes, I
notice that in the West Virginia game, Green Bay game, two fouls, you had the
luxury of sitting her. Would that change at all against A&M in the first half
if she picks up two? Do you feel like you need her on the court?  
COACH MULKEY: There's a reason you're a sportswriter. Since when is it a
luxury to sit Griner? Let me think.  
I had the horror of sitting -- no. Brittney really doesn't get in foul
trouble. I could probably play her with two fouls in the first half and feel
very comfortable. But when you're in the game and you have the lead, there's
no need. But if you're way behind and you're catching up or the momentum's
swinging, you leave her out there.  
She hasn't really gotten into foul trouble against A&M. And you've got to
remember styles of play. West Virginia's style of play and Green Bay's style
of play is much different than A&M.  
They're coming in there flying at you with guards and trying to just basically
duck their head and get into her body with no prayer of making a shot,
throwing up prayers, I guess I would say.  
A&M has post game. They're going to play their basketball. And so I don't
anticipate it to be any different than the last three games, guys. It's going
to go down to the wire. And kids are going to have to make plays to win.  
  
Q. Kim, Gary talked about some things that Green Bay did last night. Have
you watched that film, and were there things that concerned you about that?
Because he said we might try to use some of the things that work for them.  
COACH MULKEY: And you believe him? Unless he's going to change what got --
Gary, I love that man.  
I don't know how to answer that. No. I thought we guarded them pretty good.
Give those guys credit. They moved the ball around. They're very difficult to
guard. They brought Griner out. But who is Gary going to bring Griner -- if he
brings Danielle into the post, we're just going to switch 'em. We're just
going to counter with whatever he does.  
If he brings Elonu to shoot the 3, I don't know how many 3s Elonu's going to
make out there. She's kind of at the foul line area. Why change what you've
done well? It's been three outstanding ballgames. It hasn't been two teams
that one's dominated. It's just been two outstanding teams, and down the
stretch we made more plays. I just don't see him changing a whole lot.  
  
Q. I haven't seen all of the previous three games that you played against A
&M, but I just wanted to get your view on all three games have been similar in
that I guess nobody's hit 70 yet. And I just wanted to talk to you a little
bit about the pace of the game that these two teams play together and whether
you think it will be like that tomorrow. Is that to your advantage?   
COACH MULKEY: I don't think either team really has an advantage. It could come
down to bench play, truthful, who produces off the bench. Because I think the
best description I could give in football, it's smash-mouth football. And
tomorrow it will just be basically smash-mouth basketball.  
And they have post players. They have perimeter players. Both teams play
outstanding defense. And it's just going to be a battle.  
  
Q. You talked about obviously what all this team's accomplished and how much
it's grown up and how much it's still growing up. But what did this team show
you in those two games against A &M, the one in Waco where they were up -- A&M
was up by 11 in the second half and your girls came back, and the Big 12
championship coming back from a 12-0 deficit right from the start?  
COACH MULKEY: Their will to win. I think they feed off of me and my intensity.
And sometimes when we're not very good at executing a half court offense
because of our youth and because of pressure defense, sometimes you just will
yourself to a win, find out a way to get a loose ball, get that extra rebound,
get to the foul line.  
And I think we have a competitiveness about us. I watched Gary's team play
yesterday. You're looking at a senior in Danielle. You're looking at a senior
in Colson, and you're looking at three juniors. That's a poised basketball
team. That's an experienced team.  
And sometimes when you have the youth I have and you're not doing too good and
things aren't going your way, you gotta kind of just have a little personality
and just have a will to win and a toughness about you and just gut it out and
grind it out, and I think we've done that in a lot of games until we reach
that experience factor of being a little bit smoother in tougher times.  
  
Q. Chuck Carlson, just a sportswriter.  
COACH MULKEY: A luxurious one, luxury. Luxury. Luxury of sitting Griner. How
about the misery?  
Okay, Chuck. Don't you have a heart attack on me now. This man's my man here.
He's still writing when he's sick.  
  
Q. I'll try to avoid a heart attack until the final horn. That should be
interesting on the ASAP transcript as well. But, anyway, can you talk about
Brittney and the evolution of her offensive game from last year to this year,
whether it's more polished or more versatility or more confidence, but it does
seem like she's definitely added to her skill set there on the offensive
end.  
COACH MULKEY: First thing is her strength, just a year older. Her body is
never just going to add a lot of weight. She's just been in the system now of
weightlifting and taking care of her body.  
She's just stronger. She really is. She's just stronger. A year ago she
couldn't handle the double and triple teams without having a turnover, lots of
turnovers, and now she keeps her base wide and strong and picks you apart.  
Truthfully, a lot of what we do with Brittney, and it's probably not something
that's written about, is Brittney can shoot the 3. She can take you off the
dribble. She picked up her second foul last night because she got excited on
the baseline there, and she just saw a one-on-one opportunity to act like a
guard.  
And truthfully she can, but I wouldn't be a very good coach if I allowed her
to do a lot of that during the game, but in practice and in her individual
workouts, she loves to shoot the 3. She loves to take players off the dribble.
She loves to shoot the step-back move.  
And yet we have developed her really into more of a back-to-the-basket post
player than she's probably ever had to do. And she can turn around and just
shoot it right there off the glass with her back to the basket, and she loves
the game.  
I mean, she just comes up to the office early and talks to the coaches and
watches film and cracks up or makes a joke about a bad thing she did or
something she wants to do. She's just fun to coach. She makes it enjoyable to
go to work and coach her because she just doesn't have an ego about her.  
She wants to please you, and in a lot of respects, as a player -- and I've
played at the highest level -- I wouldn't want to be Brittney Griner, I
wouldn't want to see that kind of defense every day and that pushing and
shoving and banging, because I'm not sure I could keep my composure with
everything that she has to see.  
But she handles it beautifully.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_DALLAS, TEXAS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Good afternoon, everybody. We're joined by Texas A&M student-
athletes Danielle Adams, Tyra White, Sydney Colson, Adaora Elonu and Sydney
Carter and head coach Gary Blair. Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Both Sydneys, does playing a team for the fourth time this season, how
much of an advantage is it in terms of your knowledge of what to expect and is
there any disadvantages other than the fact that you guys would like to win
this time? Are there any specific advantages to playing them for the fourth
time this year?  
SYDNEY COLSON: I think so. Each game we've played I think we've done things
better each time we've played them and it showed in the final score, just in
how we've come out in the games and how we've defended, and I think that what
we've learned most is that we have to play 40 minutes through. We've got to
play from start to finish, and continue to do things that are working for us,
and I think that will help us to get a victory for sure.  
And of course the disadvantage is that just we haven't won a game yet. They've
been close, but we haven't found what we needed to do to get over that hump,
and I think we know what we need to do now.  
SYDNEY CARTER: I definitely think it's a learning experience. I think that we
definitely caught on to some of the things that we need to work on in the next
couple of games.  
Like you said, the advantage is definitely you know what they're going to run
and how they want to get into offense and you know what kind of defense
they're going to put on us. And of course the disadvantage is the vice versa
effect of that. They're going to know what we're going to want to do and how
we're going to want to do it and stuff like that.  
So I just think that we have the knowledge aspect of the game and how we're
going to play it kind of down pat on both ends. So it's going to be who is
going to be smarter and tougher in this game.  
  
Q. Danielle, obviously the numbers say that Baylor's done as good a job
defensing you as any team this year. What specifically about Baylor makes it
difficult for you in terms of what they throw at you and how are you going to
have to change things up to tomorrow?  
DANIELLE ADAMS: I mean, it's not really their defense. It's just me taking
good shots. I haven't taken one good shot when I played against them. So, I
mean, it makes it look like they're playing great defense, but it's just my
shot selection.  
  
Q. Danielle and Tyra, obviously there's -- kind of following up with the
first question -- a lot of familiarity with Baylor and Texas A &M. Since that
Big 12 championship game when you guys jumped up to a 12-0 lead and obviously
things were going well, how much have you been looking forward to this game
and obviously with so much on the line now?  
DANIELLE ADAMS: We've looked for this opportunity since we lost to them in the
Big 12 championship. I mean, we was hoping we was going to get this matchup
again just so we can get over that hump. I mean, the first three times we
played them we weren't quite there, and we played them close games all three
times.  
But we know we can beat them. And we know what we can do. We've just gotta
make good shot selection and make better decisions.  
TYRA WHITE: Just going off what Danielle said, we've been looking forward to
this game since the Big 12 Tournament, but we didn't want to overlook anybody,
but now is our time that we have to just do what we need to do, execute down
the stretch and just do the things we need to do to get the victory.  
  
Q. Adaora, the 4 player is huge in this game against them. With the way they
guard, first two games not so good, really good in the Big 12 championship
game with ten points and five boards, how important is it for you to hit the
elbow jumper at the free-throw line and to do some things to spread them out a
little bit?  
ADAORA ELONU: I think it's important as far as whoever Brittney is guarding,
which is the 4 player. I think we have to be cognizant and knock down our
shots since it is pretty much open, since she's helping our offense, staying
in the lane.  
I think the 4 position is important because we have to knock down the shot and
keep her honest. And as long as anyone in that spot is doing it, I think we'll
be very successful.  
  
Q. Sydney Colson, can you talk about -- Danielle was talking about her shot
selection and maybe she hasn't had as many points against Baylor, is it
something maybe you can do to help her really have a good game?  
SYDNEY COLSON: Some of the things we thought were successful were some of the
plays we were running and when the guards are getting to the rim and if
Brittney is helping off or whoever happens to be down there, if they help off
-- Syd did it one time, kicking to Karla underneath, if they don't have good
rotation down, then the other post player is going to get a lot of good looks.  
But as far as -- Danielle knows that she's capable of having a really good
game against them. Her stats haven't shown it. But, I mean, she's done other
things in the game that have helped us. And I think as long as she gets in
there and she gets in there and she's physical with them and takes good shots
and knocks down her 3s in transition, everything like that, I think if she
just plays her game doesn't focus on it much, then we'll be fine.  
  
Q. Both Sydneys, you've struggled on 3 against them this year, but you had a
good game yesterday against Georgia, and then you watched Green Bay having a
great game shooting 3s against Baylor. What can you do to do better 3s? Did
you take something out of the game yesterday that Green Bay did?  
SYDNEY COLSON: I think just their shot selection and being patient really
helped them out. I think that if we take the 3s that are there for us in our
offense, then we'll be fine. As long as we're not forcing shots, 3s or 2s
whatever it is, take good shots, rebound the ball well, I think that will
benefit us a lot.  
And I think that our offense is really successful as long as we execute it
properly. And just in zone, if they happen to play zone or something, if we
just swing the ball and people are getting shots on the reversals, then we're
liable to hit those shots and those are always good looks for us.  
I think as long as we take good shots within the offense and don't force stuff
and don't try to go in there and get fouls against Griner that you may not get
called, I mean, I think that we'll be fine.  
SYDNEY CARTER: I also agree with the shot selection. I think in the Big 12
Tournament I got forced into a couple of bad shots at the end of the game. So
I just think that all plays into the decision-making on our end of the court
on the offensive end.  
So I just think those two go hand in hand when it comes to them. We've
definitely got to hit shots. In the first half of the Big 12 Tournament we
were hitting almost everything we looked at before we went cold kind of
towards the end of it.  
So definitely hitting shots is crucial against Baylor because you're going to
get so many outside looks with Griner being such a big presence inside. So
hitting shots is definitely important in order for us to be successful.  
  
Q. Sydney and Tyra, could you talk about how you each match up with Sims and
what you've taken from the other games that might work?  
SYDNEY CARTER: Well, I've guarded her two of the -- I kind of match up against
her a couple times the last -- the championship game and the Big 12
Tournament, but I guarded her in the first two games, and I just -- she's a
great player. I can't take anything away from her.  
She's really good on the offensive end and I think she does a really good job
of drawing fouls. And she just makes it tough for me to kind of switch my
mindset from guarding a right-hand offensive player since she's left-handed,
so I've got to switch my mindset.  
But I'm looking to give my best defensive effort tomorrow and we'll see how
that goes.  
TYRA WHITE: I mean, I really don't match up with them, but I figure our point
guards will be ready for it.  
  
Q. Sydney Colson, Coach Mulkey has said, she told us last night that she
wanted to see -- ideally she wanted to see both Baylor and A &M have a chance
to make the Final Four this year, and that's why she was disheartened to see
both teams placed in the same region. Could you comment on her feelings on
that front and do you agree with that?  
SYDNEY COLSON: Yeah. Just because I think that we are two of the top teams in
the nation, and it's unfortunate we have to play one another. But there were
good teams in other regions that have to face up again. I think people were
mostly mad because it's the fourth time we're having to play, and maybe people
wanted to see both of us in the Final Four.  
But I think whichever team comes out of this and ends up going to the Final
Four, you know, it says a lot about the Big 12 for us to be the last two teams
in the Big 12 men's and women's, just speaks a lot about our teams and the
success that we have and how hard we worked.  
Whoever goes, I know it's going to be a good representative for the Big 12.
But it's unfortunate that we have to meet up at this point.  
  
Q. Sydney Carter, what it means to play in your hometown, basically, to play
this magnitude of a game in your hometown. If I could, Coach, follow-up to
that is do you find players from their hometown do they press more, are they
more relaxed?  
SYDNEY CARTER: Well, it definitely feels great to play in my hometown, but
just to have a game of this magnitude is -- it makes it even more exciting and
it gives me more of a drive and more of a sense of urgency to want to be
successful and come out here and be a part of history, because we've never
made it to a Final Four.  
So doing that in my own hometown and having everybody that I love around me
and to witness history before their eyes, just as I would, it just feels
great. And I feel honored to have this opportunity and hopefully I can make it
happen.  
COACH BLAIR: To be able to come back to Dallas is a privilege. We blew it four
years ago when we had that opportunity in LA to come back here and play North
Carolina, and that would have really helped negate, I'm sure. But we didn't
live up to it. We were the higher seed. We held serve. We did what we were
supposed to.  
I would love -- they've all got basketball coaches. I would love for my old
basketball coach to come see me, because I was on the scout team most of the
time behind Joey Dooley at Bryan Adams, where I was on the bench, a long
bench, pretty good baseball. But it's just good to come back to this town.
This is a sports town, this is a college town, a high school town, and a pro
sports town.  
And I was up late watching the Mavericks last night, and I get excited anytime
I come into the city limits because this is my town and Sydney's town and
Maryann Baker's town and Kristen Grant's town and -- who did I leave out? --
Skylar Collins' town. It's special.  
But I really want the Aggies to come out. I saw a lot of green and gold in the
stands, and that's to give a lot of credit to Baylor and their fans who bought
the tickets before the tournament was even here.  
Now we need the Aggies to realize we're here now and to come on out.  
  
Q. Danielle, you mentioned that it was more a case of your shot selection
against Baylor in the first three games. I was wondering, though, how do you
balance that with the fact that obviously you're the leading scorer, a lot of
the offense goes through you? How do you balance maybe shot selection and
letting the game come to you versus the need to produce out there?  
DANIELLE ADAMS: Just not rushing my shot. Just being patient and just looking
to see what I have, and not just doing the turnaround fade-aways or anything
like that, just being patient and let my game come to me and just getting a
rhythm and a flow.  
  
Q. Gary, speaking of Dallas sports history, this kind of reminds me of 1990
when Texas and Arkansas played in the regional final over at Union. I know you
were at Stephen F. Austin, but do you remember particularly that game and do
you see any parallels with this even though they had only played for the third
time and you guys are going for the fourth time?  
COACH BLAIR: Did Arkansas win that one? Well, that's where I coached at, so
hopefully the same thing will happen. Nolan was great back then, and it's just
part of it. The Big East does it all the time. And nobody says anything about
it. And Charles Barkley calls it the "Big Least" and all that kind of stuff.  
It's good basketball. That's what's good about the country now. Way back when
you were talking about it, all Billy Packer could talk about was the ACC and
Dick Vitale. There's basketball all across the country now. But isn't it
surprising in the state of Texas, which is supposedly the "whoo" football
state, we have the Mavericks, the Rockets and the Spurs, and we get national
champions in women's basketball, and we're still waiting for the Aggies to get
there and junior college. It's the best high school basketball in the state,
and we're still writing about spring football.  
Okay. This is basketball time, and the last two teams that are standing are
women, whether we like it or not. Embrace it. Write about us. These are the
stories right here. And you've got some great stories here in the press
conference right after this. You've got great stories there. But it's not all
about Brittney Griner and Danielle Adams, it's about A&M and Baylor, and the
other young ladies that are on the team.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. Coach wanted to make a comment or two.  
COACH BLAIR: I'm glad you're here. I know it's around lunchtime and a good
sportswriter knows when there's a buffet.  
This is big time. Last night Kim and I had the opportunity to be on the Dale
Hansen Show. That was very similar to when in 1977 I won state championship
and Brad Sham asked me to come on his radio show. Never knew him. That was the
best of the best for a young high school coach.  
But it was special. But you've got something special here. We had 11,000 here
last night. Great crowd. I hope they have to remove the black curtains that go
around. And I hope we can sell more seats. But we need your help, okay? I know
that's not your job. But we need the stories, we need the interviews, and we
need you to write about the game itself.  
A lot of the sportscasters all across the country, the Kornheisers and the Jim
Romes and everybody like that, they knock women's basketball. Embrace women's
basketball for what it is.  
We're not trying to be the men's game; we're trying to be the best women's
game we can be. If some of you all want to see a great women's player, look
back to your left with the white shirt back there. That's Ann Drysdale, and
she was one of the best of the best. And that's what this sport is all about.  
We stand alone. We do not need to ride the piggybacks of the men's game. We
are what we are, and we like it and we're growing. Questions?  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Gary, from a coaching standpoint, we always hear how hard it is to beat a
good team three times in one season. From that perspective would you rather be
the team trying to beat a team for the fourth time or being that 0-3 team
trying to break through for the fourth time?  
COACH BLAIR: Shoot, what would some of the big-timers do with that question? I
can just hear Bobby Knight. But I like my chances, because I think Robert said
a while ago: We struggled against Baylor for three times. We didn't struggle
against Baylor, we had three damn good ballgames. 3-pointers.  
Baylor is able to extend their defense a little bit further because of Griner
in the middle can take care of home base. And then all of a sudden they can
extend and play pressure defense and Destiny Williams does a very good job on
Danielle.  
We have to move without the ball. We just saw Green Bay shoot 28 of them last
night, made a good percentage. I'm not sure what it was. But they did a very
good job of ball movement and player movement and getting the ball inside and
then kicking it back outside. Maybe we need to do a little bit more of that
ourselves. Hopefully we can pick up a little bit of chapter for what Green Bay
did, but I thought they had a very good game plan, very good sets.  
They did everything right in the game except for about that five- to eight-
minute stretch middle of the second half when Baylor looked like the best team
that's ever played the game. So they looked that good during that five and
eight-minute stretch.  
  
Q. Obviously Danielle, you look at her numbers, she's had some of the tough
scoring games against Baylor when you look at it. Talk about what you can see
in her. What's happened in these games against her? Or is it just something
maybe she's pressing, and what do you expect out of her tomorrow night?  
COACH BLAIR: I think a lot of it is Danielle has rushed her shots, even though
she's 90 percent of the time she's been guarded by Destiny Williams or
Brooklyn Pope. But Griner is nearby.  
Just like in the men's game, when you would have Chamberlain or Alcindor over,
they would influence the game, because in the corner of your eye you see them
coming. And sometimes that's good. When she comes, that takes her away from
the defensive boards. So that's where our other kids have got to do a better
job of getting in.  
Danielle needs to have a little bit of everything to just not settle for the
3-point shot. Okay. She was 2 out of 9. That's her worst percentage, I think,
of the year so far. Go inside. Go inside the lane, get yourself to the free-
throw line where Griner can't do a damn thing about that.  
So if we can get the calls every now and then. But at the same time be
selective on your shots. We've got other scoring options. Okay. Just like the
same way with -- Griner had 40 last night, and the others they did not need as
much. Sims dropped in 14 or 16 or something like that. But on certain nights
you're going to need balanced scoring.  
To win we have to have balanced scoring. We do not need Danielle Adams to
shoot 28 times against Baylor. We need Elonu to light it up just like the kid
in the second half did and knocked down a couple of 3s with some nice screens
inside to get her some open looks.  
We need to have that balance as well, but remember defense creates offense for
us. And if we can force some turnovers and get into transition, I like our
choices, either shooting 3s off the breaks or trying to jam it in and draw
fouls or knock down easy shots.  
But our defense has got to force turnovers. Baylor has no fear. They will send
four to the boards because Odyssey can get back and defend pretty well on her
own. So they're very good offensive rebounding team as well.  
  
Q. Gary, talk about the game last night with Green Bay, and where they were
successful. And you talked about maybe bringing that in. Are you going to
tweak things? Will you take something? Or is it just too late to just add so
much, it's about execution?  
COACH BLAIR: A lot of it is execution. It's passion, it's how you start a
ballgame. With Baylor, we started off 12-0 in the Big 12 championship game.
Against Baylor in the second game in Waco, I think that's the one we should
have won. We were up 11 in the second half.  
And it's a game of streaks. Sometimes you just gotta pat Griner on the rear
and say nice shot. Because there isn't anything you can do about it. You just
try to keep her from her spots. You're not worried about the dunk or anything
like that. You're worried about her spots, and when she jumps in to you and
draws the foul, when you're holding your hands up she just forces her way in
to you.  
Sometimes it's called, sometimes it's not called. And so you try to limit that
side. That's her favorite shot over there. And what you hope that she shoots a
lot of skyhooks and fade-aways and everything like that. And if she makes one,
that's two, but don't give her the and-one.  
We will tweak up a few things. Our inbound plays last night were very good. We
threw in a lot of lob plays. Obviously those lob plays will not work against
Baylor. We'll tweak a little, but you'll be the last to know, though.  
  
Q. Coach, obviously like you mentioned, three great games with Baylor
already. And you guys have come up just a little short in each game. Is there
a psychological hurdle you have to clear as well when you've played a team
that close and not won?  
COACH BLAIR: I hope when we get to 37 minutes it's a tie ballgame again and
it's just like Aggies do in football when we go to the fourth quarter, they
hold up four fingers. We need to hold up three fingers and say play the last
three minutes like you played the last 37. Don't play not to lose, play to
win. Make plays down the stretch. Okay? Make plays down the stretch. That's
what separates the teams that are going to the Final Four and the teams that
play the what-if game.  
I don't want to be on the third bar stool at the Wright at Indianapolis
playing what if I had done this, that, that call or whatever. Done that too
many times.  
And the team that gets there and the team that doesn't get there, they should
not use this region as an example. Whoever gets there has earned it. Whoever
doesn't get there, you had your chance. And we're not here to get to the Final
Four, we're here to win the Final Four. But first you have to get there.  
And whoever gets there, I promise you has got a great chance of winning. Look
at what's left. You've got eight great teams that are left. Don't be surprised
about Gonzaga now. They're another Wisconsin Green Bay but with an even better
point guard out there with Vandersloot. Don't give up on them against
Stanford.  
  
Q. Wanted to ask, you guys have played great in this tournament, won by 40,
20, 40 in your first three games. And I wanted to ask, do you think that's
because of the disappointment that you felt after the last Baylor game, or do
you feel like your players just feel like it's time to play?  
COACH BLAIR: We're just playing well. There's no way I could have drawn up
those numbers that we won by. At halftime yesterday I was the most
flabbergasted guy around. I could not believe. That's why I was coaching so
hard on the last two possessions we had trying to get it over the hump.  
And I still remember that television commercial that they had when the
football player came in in the half and he's just berating his team and the
guy looks up and he says, Coach, we're up by three touchdowns. See, when
you're finished, you're finished as a team when you think that that happens.  
You've got to continue. That first five minutes we opened up, they hit a
basket, we hit two back-to-back 3s. We ran two set plays to perfection. That's
teaching and that's coaching, and that's players playing. And that's what we
have to do.  
We're here to win the whole thing. Baylor's in our way right now, we're in
Baylor's way. You're going to have a great game tomorrow night. And you're
going to be -- it's going to be fun. It's going to be entertaining. And it
will be the best basketball game, women's game that's ever been played in
Dallas, the best game -- go back in your history book -- that's ever been
played in the city of Dallas or maybe in Texas.  
But it's going to be something special.  
  
Q. I was hoping you could compare the last time you were in the Elite Eight
playing, also playing the nation's top player, and does it help any having
played Griner before?  
COACH BLAIR: I think it helps a lot. I felt sorry for Green Bay. Never seen
her before. You could only see it on film. And until you experience it, until
you walk up with her, shake hands with her after the ballgame, and to see her
size and be able to just see the warm-ups she does out there, it's an
experience that you have to play yourself.  
We've gone five times against them now. I've lost all five. But I'm keep
knocking on that door and I'm getting closer and closer. And if it doesn't
happen this year, it's going to happen next year and we're going to keep
going.  
Kim is going to be very, very good the next two to three years, and so are we.
So this is what it's all about right now playing at the highest level. I'm
proud of my conference. I'm proud of Baylor, I'm proud of A&M for making this
now sort of the mecca of women's basketball right here in the state of Texas.  
  
Q. How big a role do you think 3-pointers might play? It seems like in a
tournament game, particularly with so much on the line, they're kind of the --
that shot can be the dagger either way, and both teams have players that are
pretty proficient at that. Do you think that can end up being a factor that
might be getting overlooked right now?  
COACH BLAIR: Listening to Andy's comments last night. He said that's the
furthest thing from his mind is hitting the 3-pointers and Colson hitting
them.  
I don't think he's watched Colson enough. I mean, she's got no fear. I mean,
she's like Odyssey for Baylor, the kid's a freshman, no fear. That's the way
Colson -- sometimes my hair gets grayer on some of her decision-makings, but
when it goes up on ball reversal I feel very good about our chances, because
when she makes one, it just excites the floor. Everybody gets up.  
Danielle hits a trailing 3 or Carter comes off a flare screen or something, or
Tyra can create her own shot, whether she's guarded or not, but when Colson
hits one, knowing now you've got to stop her penetration. If you come out on
her, she's going by you. That's the strength of her game. And I think 3s will
come into play.  
Who we've got to stop is not Griner as much as stopping Odyssey and Melissa
Jones from making all the hustle plays, which she does better than any player
in America, is Melissa Jones making the little glue plays that you have to
have when you form a team of five players, not just one player.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_DALLAS, TEXAS_  
  

Texas A&M  79  
Georgia - 38

  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by our student-athletes Jasmine James and
Porsha Phillips. Coach Andy Landers is now joining us. Coach, your comments
about this afternoon's game.  
COACH LANDERS: It just wasn't pretty. And if you're Georgia, it wasn't any
fun.  
But you have to give Texas A&M just a lot of credit. They did what they do.
They come out, they get in your face defensively. And they did that very well
tonight, disrupted very well, created early turnovers, I think four in the
first four minutes. Same kind of pressure probably mentally affected a couple
of layups in the first four minutes. And that's that piece. Defensively they
were excellent.  
Offensively, the 3s, they were just really, really good. I mean, this is a
team that hits five, six, really doesn't really shoot a lot of 3s, and tonight
knocked down ten, and did it early and separated themselves early, which I
think affected us mentally and led to even more breakdowns on the defensive
end.  
But very, very good Texas A&M team that played just great tonight, and you
have to give them all the credit in the world for doing that.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach. Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Jasmine, like Coach mentioned, just what were they doing to swarm and
take away the passing lanes so effectively on defense?  
JASMINE JAMES: They just did a really good job of pressuring the ball, and
because of that was able to slow down some of the passes that we were trying
to make that we typically have no problem making.  
They did a pretty good job scouting us. It seemed like they had a pretty good
handle on everything that it was that we were doing, so they had no problem
cheating the passing lanes and being able to get up there.  
  
Q. Porsha, could you talk about that first few minutes, did you feel there
was quickness, the defense you're unable to match up, and did you feel you
were really ready to play today?  
PORSHA PHILLIPS: I think we came to play today. Like Jasmine said, Texas A&M
is a great team. They pressured the ball. They defended us pretty well.  
We just didn't execute our offense tonight.  
  
Q. What was it with their defense that caused so much problems for you
shooting-wise? Because it started out and it was a 22-2 lead that they had.  
JASMINE JAMES: Pretty much no shot went up that wasn't contested. They did a
good job, really good job of even when you get past one person there was
somebody else there always for help. I guess when you know that's there, you
kind of are aware when you're going up for the shot thinking about when
somebody else is going to come for help or something.  
I think they did a really good job of pressuring us and disrupting us on the
defensive end and not letting us knock down or be able to get the shots we're
typically able to get.  
  
Q. Porsha, could you talk about your defensive effort early? Were you trying
to take away Adams, was that your number one deal, possibly give them the 3,
or could you talk a little bit about your defense early?  
PORSHA PHILLIPS: Danielle Adams, who is the key to their team, and of course
we tried to stop her from the inside, but it's hard to stop her from the
inside. And they've got great 3-point shooters. So I was trying to do both.  
  
Q. Jasmine and Porsha, obviously you play a very tough schedule. You see
some of the best basketball in the country in the Southeastern Conference. Any
teams you can compare Texas A &M to that you might have faced this year?  
PORSHA PHILLIPS: Probably similar to Kentucky, you know, the outside game, the
3-point shooters, the guards, and the inside game.  
JASMINE JAMES: I would say they're definitely a lot like Kentucky as far as
the defense went. Like they did a really good job, like I said, of pressuring
the ball the whole game, and that's a lot like Kentucky.  
  
Q. Porsha, despite the loss, you had a really great season rebounding-wise.
Just what are a few things you've done just to become such a great rebounder
at UGA?  
PORSHA PHILLIPS: I think rebounding is very important. Rebounding wins ball
games, and I just enjoy rebounding. If you really enjoy it, you'll do it well.
So I just like to rebound.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, just wanted to ask you, A &M has had three pretty lopsided
victories in this tournament. They were a 2 seed coming in. How do you think
-- or should we put them in the championship conversation right now? Are they
that good? Can you assess?  
COACH LANDERS: Well, certainly they're good enough to play for a national
championship. I felt that before we played them. And I feel it now.  
They have terrific athleticism. They're very well coached. There's quick teams
in the country. There's other quick teams in the country, but there may not be
another quick team in the country that applies their quickness and athleticism
as A&M does, which is constant. Quickness is no good if you don't use it. And
they keep theirs -- they keep that faucet or spigot open all the time.  
There's no wasted ability with those guys using their quickness and
athleticism, whether it's transitioning and running the floor offensively,
whether it's sprinting to the basket after a missed shot. And that's
especially true when they defend you.  
They violate just about every rule defensively, you know, every principle.
Bobby Knight would not like their principles. Man-to-man defense; they turn
their back on the ball. But they're so quick that they can do it. It's the
right thing for them to do.  
Their coaches have really done a nice job with them. You don't see a lot of
flat triangles floating around out there, which is textbook man-to-man
defense. You just see people facing up with their man, daring them to breathe.  
And then when they do, they're so quick. They're out of position, but they're
so quick that once they identify the need to help, they can still get there
from out of position.  
But to answer your question -- I'm sorry I rambled. But I really do like the
way they play. I mean, they play hard. That's a coach's dream. They play hard.
But they're talented. They're talented inside. They're talented outside.  
The last thing I expected today was 10 of 20 from 3. Now, that's -- the last
thing I expected today was Colson, the very last thing I expected, was Colson
going 3 for 4. That really put us on our heels early in the game.  
So I told our kids as we prepared for this, I think they're one of the five
best teams in the country. I've seen Tennessee play in games where I don't
think anybody can beat them. But then I watched them yesterday and they can.  
I've seen Connecticut play on nights when I didn't think anybody could beat
them. I watched them today and people can.  
So I think the challenge for Texas A&M is bring your A game every time you
line up, and you got a shot at it.  
  
Q. Coach, Adams did not score in their 13-0 run. Did you feel you did a good
job on her possibly and opened up other avenues on that zone defense?  
COACH LANDERS: You know, defensively they did a better job. I mean, I'm not
passing the buck here. Our zone defense has been really good to us all year
long. They did a nice job of skipping the ball and finding the shooter and
getting it up quick.  
And then you just sense that once they hit a couple that their confidence was
good and they're probably going to -- you know, and then the question becomes
for me: Get out of it? Stay in it? Once we got out of it, Hassell gets two
fouls like that. So it was a tough call. You choose your poison with these
guys.  
  
Q. You talked about Colson. Carter seemed to really set the tone defensively
on the flip side of that. Could you talk about what Carter did defensively?  
COACH LANDERS: Honestly, no. Because they were all so good. I mean, you may
have seen something. I'm trying to watch everything, and you may have seen
something that drew you to her. She may have been outstanding. I don't know.
But I thought their entire team defensively -- I don't think they had a star.
I think they're all stars.  
  
Q. Since you have such a young team, just how optimistic are you of the
future of your team despite tonight's loss?  
COACH LANDERS: We have work to do. I like the players that we have. I think we
need more. I think we need more help. We need more depth. We need to be a
little bit quicker. We've got to get more aggressive.  
You develop that. And one of the things that I think Gary would probably tell
you -- I'm just taking a guess at this, he's got a full bench down through
there. And I just got a feeling that those kids on that bench are pretty good
competitors for those top six or seven players to compete as hard as they do.  
They've got good teammates to go against. And that's probably what we lack.
We're not as deep, and so consequently our starters don't get pushed the way
they need to get pushed.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_DALLAS, TEXAS_  
  

Baylor  86  
Green Bay - 76

  
THE MODERATOR: Joined by Baylor coach Kim Mulkey, student-athletes Odyssey
Sims and Brittney Griner. Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Odyssey, they cut the lead to three with about 13 minutes left. You came
up with a bunch of great defensive plays. Can you just kind of tell us what
you were doing there on defense and kind of how you sparked the team there?  
ODYSSEY SIMS: Just keeping our intensity. Not beating ourselves up. Knowing
that we were giving up 3s, layups, and we didn't have good help side, on the
time-out we kind of gathered ourselves. And it starts with me on defense. So I
did the best I could, just defend, keep my man in front, and just get some
easy steals for my team.  
  
Q. Brittney, kind of following up on that question, to kind of take control
of the game, you guys went on a 17-3 run. What did you guys do during that
run? And actually you and Odyssey had all the points. Did you want to take
some of that on your shoulders during that stretch?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: I feel like we both kind of took it on our shoulders. We were
just feeding off of each other. So she got me the ball, and, like Coach said,
you coast around, go up there, find an open player. And we did a good job and
we fed off of each other.  
  
Q. Brittney, how hard was it to play a team like Green Bay where any of the
five players at any given time can shoot the 3? Seems like you guys haven't
played a team with quite that much balance all year.  
BRITTNEY GRINER: It was hard. Green Bay is a great team. Just had to try my
best and work with my teammates on switching when they came to set screens on
me and just try to keep me as close to the basket as we could. When I got out,
just keep my arms up. Long reach and I really didn't have to come too, too far
out so I could kind of stay back. And when they drove, my teammates on the
help side, they helped me out a lot.  
  
Q. Brittney, it was said by more than one person after the game, a quiet 40
points. Did you realize you had that many points, or had you even looked at
the stat sheet?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: No, I didn't. I didn't know I had 40. Really wasn't keeping
up with that. I was just out there trying to help my team get a victory.  
  
Q. Brittney, you picked up an early second foul in the first half and they
were able to kind of come from the dominance to neutralize the game a little
bit. Did you feel that they were deliberately trying to get you into early
foul trouble? And what adjustments did you make in the second half to make
sure that that wasn't going to happen?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: Just like everything, you know, it would be my game plan to
take it to her, take it at her and try to get her out, and I picked up my
second foul. I couldn't help my teammates out on the bench. So I just had to
play smarter. And the second half that's what I did, I tried to play smarter
instead of jumping on every -- they are a little bit shorter, I just stayed on
the floor and put my hands up. And it worked for me.  
  
Q. Odyssey, Brittney, Texas A &M fourth time, what does it mean this time?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: You know, it's good for our conference, two Big 12 teams.
Just go out there and play really, just works out.  
ODYSSEY SIMS: What she said. It's always nice to play another team when it
comes to the NCAA Tournament. But it looks good for the Big 12 to get us out
there, just gotta play, and we can't underestimate them. They're a great team,
and they'll come out and they're going to play with energy. We just gotta
match it.  
  
Q. Brittney, as you said, you didn't realize you had 40 points. Coming off a
30-point game the other night, talk about the zone you're in. Obviously you've
been playing well all year, but seems like these last few games you've stepped
it up and you're playing at your top now.  
BRITTNEY GRINER: March Madness. Like I said, I don't think about it too much
how much I scored. When I'm feeling it in a game, it's just something that
comes over you. If I'm feeling it, I'm just going to keep going until I can't,
until somebody else starts in, and then I'm going to get the ball to them. So
just feeling it, you know.  
  
Q. Can you talk about how difficult that team was to defend with all their
shooters and a bunch of good passers too?  
ODYSSEY SIMS: Green Bay is a very good team. Scouting report, what we're
dealing with, we're dealing with shooters. And it's very hard to defend, to
keep our man in front and on help side, because when we help out, then they're
going to dump it and it's a 3. So we try to do a good job of limiting their
3-point shots and just playing good defense.  
  
Q. Odyssey, you hit a 35-foot bank shot to end the half. First of all, do
you practice that shot? And, secondly, in that situation, do you have an eye
on the clock or are you counting in your head?  
ODYSSEY SIMS: No, it's not something I practice. I mean, I play around in
practice, I guess everyone would consider that. But I knew that it was like
five seconds left when I got the ball and I was just trying to go and get an
open shot and I threw it up and it went in.  
  
Q. Brittney, again, the idea that the score was a lot more lopsided but you
were in for a dogfight for quite a while in this game, talk about that. Being
in another one like this, doing what you guys have to do, it's going to look
like a lot more than it was, but we know how close it was for a while and how
much of a fight it was.  
BRITTNEY GRINER: Again, I give credit to Green Bay not going away. Nobody
wants their season to be over right now, so nobody is going to just give up,
and so, you know, they just kept going at it and going at it. And we just had
to keep going. Teams make runs and you've got to withstand it and make a run
for yourself.  
  
Q. Odyssey, as a point guard, at least in your head, are you kind of keeping
track of what she's doing? And was there more of -- as far as points that
Brittney's getting. And was there more of an emphasis even more tonight than
usual to get it in to her and feed her?  
ODYSSEY SIMS: It's just very important, just because her presence inside to
get her the ball, and, like Coach said, we have to establish the inside game
first, and that's something that we try to do as much as possible. Just even
with two or three defenders, we still have to get our touches because our job
is defense and creates open opportunities for other players on the team.  
And there's just something that we work on in practice and something that
Coach tells us all the time. And when B.G. gets going early, it's impossible
to slow her down.  
  
Q. Brittney, obviously last year you came with a shot block, came with
rebounding. Could you talk about how your offensive game has evolved, though,
maybe in the last year since you arrived on campus?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: I mean, this year from last year I was kind of jamming, just
worked on my shot and worked on my shooting and range.  
So when we got back here this year, you know, I would be able to do more,
bring more to the floor, further help out my team. So just putting shooting
onto -- and range to my game.  
  
Q. Brittney, where does this game rank in terms of intensity you guys have
had coming out of the gates? Seemed like you guys were really, really intense
to start this game.  
BRITTNEY GRINER: I'd say, first, each game you've got to up the intensity,
because you're that much closer to the championship. But, yet, you can go home
at any time and you're done until next year.  
So I say that the intensity for this game was higher than all the rest of the
games. Important time right now. So next game we're just going to have to up
it up more, and it feeds the intensity of the next team.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, in the second half it looked like Green Bay was not only getting
closer, looked like they were gaining the momentum. How important was it for
Odyssey Sims to step up the way she did with the 3s and the steals?  
COACH MULKEY: I think sometimes we fail to give credit to the opponent. Green
Bay has two pretty good seniors on their team. One of them has the ball in her
hands quite a bit. Odyssey Sims is a freshman and we ask a lot of her. While
she's one of the more talented -- in fact, I think she's the best freshman in
the country -- she's still a freshman. She doesn't feel good. She's got a
little respiratory problem going on, and I just thought she gutted it out.  
And when she made those steals, it gave us a little bit of a momentum there.
The crowd got back into it. But it wasn't like Odyssey was playing bad. I know
she has eight turnovers, but you gotta go back and credit Green Bay for some
of that. Odyssey just hanging in there and figuring out and learning how to
compete at this level. And we're asking her to do a lot of things. She doesn't
come out of the game very much. She doesn't have a senior mentor out there
every day in practice. So kind of proud of the kid.  
  
Q. Kim, it seemed like Brittney played a very controlled game tonight, even
with the two fouls in the first half. I know last year there were times where
you said maybe she rushed a little too much. I mean, did you see that tonight
where she was just in control doing her thing?  
COACH MULKEY: I think the word is probably poised, and you become a more
poised player from experience. And I harp on this, but truthfully, when you
look out on that floor, guys, I have one senior. And for a bunch of sophomores
and one freshman to get the majority of the minutes, that poise comes every
time they get an opportunity to get on the floor and play.  
And when you play a team like Green Bay, they can expose you a lot because we
are big. They're not. So they take you away from the basket. They have post
players coming out to guard the 3. They penetrate, kick and dish. They set
screens. They do a lot of flops. They take charges. All those things that you
wish you had on your team, those kids do whatever's necessary to compete.  
And they've lost one basketball game. They're ranked 11th and 13th in the
country. That is a good basketball team. And the thing that's so impressive to
me as a coach is they didn't quit. They made it a 10-point game. So they have
to feel good about themselves in the sense that it was really on the verge of
being a 20-point game and they never quit playing, and I respect that very
much.  
  
Q. You've already talked about Odyssey. But does she just anticipate well as
far as getting those steals? It seems like she just really has a knack for
getting in those lanes.  
COACH MULKEY: She just has quick hands. She has quick hands. She's strong.
She's listed as 5'5". But if you look at her body that's a strong 5'5". She's
very quick.  
She just has done that her whole life. I've watched her in high school. I've
watched her in summer ball do that. And she takes great pride in her own on-
the-ball pressure. Now she's getting better off the ball and getting over
screens and things like that.  
But if you just allow Odyssey Sims to guard you with the ball in your hands,
she's pretty darned good.  
  
Q. Kim, we've talked about it many times, Brittney -- we're running out of
adjectives to describe what she does and how she plays, but how do you put a
game like this in perspective? When it ends, I looked up; I didn't realize she
had 40 points.  
COACH MULKEY: Because you take her for granted. People don't need to take her
for granted. I say it, I say it, and I say it: You're never going to see
another Brittney Griner. I don't think I'll ever see another one in my
lifetime. We'll see the great players. We'll see the elite players.  
But I said this in the press conference the other day: I could tell Brittney
at any time through the course of that game, You go up and goaltend. I don't
know that any coach can tell a player that. They don't have those kind of
players on their team unless it's on the men's side.  
  
Q. Kim, can you talk -- it gets lost a little bit, but the play that
Brooklyn gave you right there at the end of the half where I think she scored
like six points to kind of keep that lead.  
COACH MULKEY: I thought the difference in the game for us was our bench play.
I thought Terran Condrey, I thought Brooklyn Pope, I thought Nae-Nae Hayden
were very valuable tonight, scored -- I think Brooklyn it was either three for
five or four for six. She was four for six. And those were big buckets.  
She had the blocked shot in the open floor. Brooklyn, as I move her and
Destiny in and out of the game, you just don't lose a whole lot. With Destiny
you get more of a finisher; with Brooklyn you get more of a rebounder and more
of a shot blocker. And they both are so valuable because they complement
Griner so well.  
  
Q. I noticed you came out a little bit to watch a little bit of the A &M
game. What are your thoughts going into A&M?  
COACH MULKEY: You got time? I don't like playing them again, because I think
it takes away the opportunity for two Big 12 teams to have made it to the
Final Four.  
I enjoyed the fact that Oklahoma was there last year and we were there. And I
don't want this to come out negative. So please understand what I'm saying. I
wouldn't want to be on the committee. I wouldn't want to referee. But somebody
has to do it.  
And when that committee sits down, and I don't have the answer to help -- if I
had the answers I would share them with you -- we have so many agendas in
women's basketball that we have to discuss. And I don't know that those
agendas will ever go away, and that is geography, putting rear ends in seats.  
So you're going to probably have these types of setups in the future. You've
had them in the past. Coaches want to have good coverage when a TV looks at an
NCAA game.  
But I'm not sure if you've worked so hard through the course of the year to
gain a 1 and a 2 seed, I just don't think any of us, not A&M, and not Baylor,
not the fans -- I guess it's a newness and a freshness that you're looking for
in the NCAA playoffs, because we do have rules pertaining -- and correct me if
I'm wrong, I know there's some people here that can correct me, but you do
have some rules in your first rounds where geography -- you can't play
somebody in your conference.  
So there's so many agendas that they're trying to take care of. I don't know
how they do it. The crowd and all that will be awesome. But, truly, it's going
to be sad for either team. It's going to be sad for whoever loses, because we
lose an opportunity, in my opinion, to have two teams that should be in the
Final Four this year.  
  
Q. There's a play in the second half where M.J. goes diving to the court and
hits pretty hard. Did your heart skip a beat at all?  
COACH MULKEY: No. I was just griping because I didn't think she fouled. It had
nothing to do with her injury or anything like that.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_DALLAS, TEXAS_  
  

Texas A&M  79  
Georgia - 38

  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by Coach Gary Blair of the Texas Aggies,
Sydney Colson, Tyra White and Danielle Adams. Coach, comments on tonight's
win.  
COACH BLAIR: We had no idea we could shoot the ball that well from the 3 to
start the game. But this player over here has struggled a little from the 3
the latter part of the year and all of a sudden she hit those 3 bombs.  
She's very good when the ball is reversed to her. And when she feels it, you
just get out of the way, let her do her thing, don't try to overcoach. And
then Pratcher came in for her and did an outstanding job for us as well.  
So great point guard play. We only had two turnovers in the first half, ended
with nine. You win ball games that way.  
I'd like to give so much credit to our defense, because normally we're forcing
teams 20 turnovers a ballgame. But I think our kids learn you can make stops.
You don't have to have charges. You don't have to have blocked shots. You
don't have to have steals. You can just play that Aggie defense, and I think
that was the key tonight.  
Coach Schaefer had them hooked up. I guarantee you, I've got to go check his
blood pressure. I'm a diabetic, but I guarantee you his blood pressure was up.
He was excited.  
And the kids played defense with a passion that he coaches it with. And I
think it's just a credit to these kids right here. I know Danielle didn't have
her normal percentage that she normally has. But the kids knew we had to go in
the game and have balanced scoring. And that's what we did.  
But the key to the game was the defense in the first half. The 3-point plays
were icing on the cake. My bench, 7 out of 11 for Pratcher, Baker, Gilbert,
and Bellock. All four of those kids played extremely well. I was able to rest
kids and not risk Carter and Colson to get their third foul. I was even able
to rest Danielle a little in the first half just because we trust our bench
and they did a great job.  
Questions?  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Sydney, what was the key to the fast start, and particularly you on the
offensive end, and how huge was that?  
SYDNEY COLSON: Just looking at the way that they ran their zone in film, we
just saw a lot of things that would work. Coach Blair and Coach Bond were
telling us plays that would be effective if we were to dribble one way,
reverse the ball and skip it to the other side.  
They had a girl in their I formation, the bottom one was chasing back and
forth, so we knew if we skipped it then the person would be open for a shot or
our post player would be pinning if they try to run out at you. So really we
just executed what they told us to on offense.  
Our shots were falling. People were offensive rebounding and getting shots
back up, and we got a few layups off of them still. It always helps us
whenever we're able to get some stops and get out and run a little bit.  
But I'm really pleased with the way we executed on offense, and hopefully we
can continue to do that.  
  
Q. Danielle and Sydney, Coach Blair worked all week to make sure you all
weren't looking past Georgia. Could you talk about proving that you were
clearly focused on this game?  
DANIELLE ADAMS: It was just our focus in practice. Coach Blair and everybody,
all the coaching staff just made that point, just to focus on Georgia and not
look towards the next game.  
But we just executed out there tonight. Our defense was great. Colson hit some
great shots. Tyra hit some great shots. We were all hooked up, like Coach
Blair said, and we just played together and as a team.  
SYDNEY COLSON: I think just respecting them and what they do. We saw a lot of
their film. We knew a lot of their players. They're very athletic and capable
of going off. So we wanted to come out and give them their due respect for
sure because they're a really good team.  
And we just came out. People guarded people well. They didn't have anybody in
double-digit scoring.  
I'm really proud of the effort we gave on defense today, and I think that
spurred our offense, for sure.  
  
Q. Danielle, we were talking to Coach Landers. I asked him A &M's three
blowout victories in the tournament should put the Aggies into the
championship conversation. And his answer essentially was yes, if they bring
their A game every day, he says you guys have a shot at it. Your comment?  
DANIELLE ADAMS: I appreciate the comment. Pretty sure the whole team does. But
that's a great comment. I mean, we just have to keep our focus and just keep
coming out every game. And each practice is executing and just getting better
each practice and each game, and just doing the little things right and just
being ready and just coming out and playing A&M basketball.  
  
Q. Danielle, can you talk about making it to the Elite Eight and what kind
of accomplishment that is for you and the team?  
DANIELLE ADAMS: It's great. I mean, I've never been to an Elite Eight. This is
my first one, and I'm pretty sure these girls are happy to get back to the
Elite Eight. So it's all a dream come true to us. We just have to keep our
focus and just keep pushing towards the next game and just focus on each team.  
And, I mean, we just gotta do what we do best and just play that aggressive
defense that we played tonight and just keep executing each game.  
  
Q. This is for Tyra and Sydney that have been here since the -- all four
years, so since the last Elite Eight run, kind of fallen short as a 2 seed the
last couple of years, what does it mean to take care of the business to get to
the winner of the game that's going on right now?  
TYRA WHITE: I think it's a real big accomplishment for us. My freshman year I
wasn't able to play in the Elite Eight. Just to get back there be with my
team, and then basically have an inside presence. When we got back there last
time, I think the only thing that really stopped us was having an inside
presence like we have in Danielle.  
But I think the only thing really stopping us now is ourselves. We're
executing more, running the floor. Our defense was tremendous today. So I
think if we go in with the game set, the sky's the limit for us.  
SYDNEY COLSON: I concur wholeheartedly.  
  
Q. Tyra, is this the most complete game as a team that you guys have played
this year? And what do you do now going forward to Tuesday?  
TYRA WHITE: Yeah, I think it's the most complete game on the defensive end. I
think kind of struggled on offense. But that was the key coming into this game
was defense, because they play just like us.  
So, I mean, just going into the next game we just want to watch film, study
some more, do what we did coming in for today's game, and just execute on both
ends just like we did today. When you keep a team scoring 38 points, I think
it leaves everybody happy at the end of the day.  
  
Q. Tyra, let's get back to starting those 3s. You hit the first one and
actually got a lucky bounce. Could you talk about was it hard to get the ball
into Adams? When you took that 3, did you think it was in without the
bounce?  
TYRA WHITE: Yes (laughter). It wasn't lucky. Shooters -- it's never hard
getting into, you just want to get her when she wants the ball, that way it
makes it easier for her and makes it easier for us getting it into the inside.
But it's never hard because she's pretty there. When we see her, both
shoulders, we get it to her; if we don't, we kind of get yelled at. So we just
pretty much want to give it to her.  
SYDNEY COLSON: That shot was going in anyway.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. From the time the brackets were announced and all the anticipation to
make it to the regional final, how much of a relief do you feel right now?  
COACH BLAIR: A lot of relief, because instead of griping about being in this
region, we embraced it. And obviously you'd like to be away from Baylor in one
way, but -- because I think we have two teams that could represent the Big 12
in the Final Four. I think we're both that good. But at the same time, we
embrace coming here because of how much travel and a chance to build up Aggie
Nation, and that is just something that we have to do.  
And a lot of coaches, they get in the same bracket or they have to find --
they find something wrong with the committee, and I think it rubbed off on our
team. When they saw that I was happy, they were happy.  
And I know our fans were happy about coming here, because if -- if we play
Baylor, we need to pack this lower bowl and everything like that.  
And I know they'll have a sell-out at Spokane. They might have one in Dayton
and Philadelphia, and I think it's good for basketball now because you've got
the top teams there. And I just want to play in Dallas, represent ourselves,
bring these four kids back home. I think it's very special they get a chance
to play in front of their high school friends and coaches and relatives.  
  
Q. Not going to be one of the big story lines, but what did Pratcher give
you coming off the bench, Coach?  
COACH BLAIR: Huge. Colson got her second foul like she normally did. First one
was a reach and the second was coming over the back.  
I don't blow up anymore. I just expect it. It's coming. But now we've got an
alternative. I could have played her to her third foul, but Pratcher came in.
From the moment she came in, she broke their press, made the right pass, then
hit a couple of big outside shots, particularly the one that Maryann Baker --
shot clock when she threw it across and Pratcher just put it up. That he was a
tough shot. And the kid has no fear. She doesn't speak a whole lot. But she
knows how to play.  
  
Q. Can you compare this team to the 2008 Elite Eight team?  
COACH BLAIR: We're getting better and better defensively. As you can tell by
our stats in the NCAA Tournament, the team in '08 was a defensive team first,
a transition team, but we had no inside game.  
We had Micheaux and Reado, and we would have to steal the ball from Reado to
go down, and she was the best we ever had at denying the high post. And
Micheaux was probably the best defensive 5 that we've ever had. But we were
not scoring there, so we went out and got offense. That's the difference, we
were a whole lot better offensive team.  
But we just held a very good team to 38 points. I mean, we were hoping -- we
said the first team to get to 60 would win. We almost got there in the first
half.  
  
Q. The question I asked earlier to Danielle, the Georgia coach was
acknowledging that A &M should be in the championship conversation now because
based on the way you've played in your first three tournament games, and just
to get your comment on that?  
COACH BLAIR: I think we've been in that conversation the whole year. The top
six teams in the country have not changed: Duke, Connecticut, us, Stanford,
Tennessee. Are we all still in it right now? Nothing's changed. Everybody has
held serve.  
Now, there's two of us. Duke has got to play Connecticut. And we have to play
Baylor. They're the top six teams. But don't rule out little Gonzaga. They've
got the motion, they've got the home crowd, they'll play in front of a sell-
out up there. I think it's good. I hope Gonzaga wins. I think it would be
great for the game. But, more importantly, I hope A&M wins; it'll be more
great for my game.  
Let me say something that nobody's asked me: Danielle's defense on Phillips.
She had four points at half. She ends up with seven. But nobody ever looks.
They just look at how many points she scores or how many charges she takes.
She's a very, very underrated defensive player.  
That was the key to the game. They had a balanced scoring effect all year
long. But when you take Phillips out and make it hard on her, and it's a
little bit harder because we put so much pressure on their perimeter players
that they didn't handle the rock as well as I'm sure Andy would have liked,
and they didn't have the creativity that he's had in the past with the Saudia
Roundtrees and all those kids that have played for them.  
But Georgia's a young team. They're going to be right back. I've still got a
long way to go before I'll ever get to be 500 with that guy, because that
guy's very special and he's a great coach.  
  
Q. You talked so much this week about focusing on Georgia, playing the song
and everything. When you all jumped out to such a large lead, did you realize
you had really gotten through to your team?  
COACH BLAIR: I kept looking up at halftime, and I was telling the little NCAA
lady, I can't believe it. I was telling the officials, I don't know what
happened. I've never had an NCAA game like this against this quality of a
team.  
And we kept saying we have to have that last basket. We were coaching as hard
to get that last basket before half as we were when we got the lead.  
Because you never underestimate people what they can do on comebacks. And I
think it just got to a point we never had to -- Andy was so far behind, he
just didn't go into a pressing type of ballgame, which I think that's to our
advantage because of Colson.  
  
Q. Even in the second half when you all were up by 30, the defense didn't
seem to let up at all. Can you talk about just what that means for Coach
Schaefer and his intensity throughout the game?  
COACH BLAIR: You mean Coach Schaefer was intense (laughter)?  
I'm glad the officials let him coach. We've got a unique situation. There's
not too many head coaches that will share the spotlight. If we win this thing,
I hope you're all smart enough to ask for Coach Schaefer to come up here and
sit up here with me, and I hope there's a few ADs out there that are smart
enough to hire the right person, not just the person. Because he's been that
good for 14 years. He keeps getting better and better. And there's more and
more teams that keep firing coaches that keep getting worse and worse.
Sometimes you need to give these top assistants in the game their opportunity.
I've got a bunch on my staff that are ready right now, so does the Big 12.
They've got a number of them.  
The intensity that we play the game with just come to practice. We never let
up. We never let up. And that's the way Coach Landers coaches as well. He
never lets up. Okay. And the only thing I can beat Landers on for sure anytime
is the golf course. But he's beaten me so many times, he's got half of his
cattle named after me. He's got a bunch of cattle out there; he names them
after me. Names some of them after his great players, too. I mean, what a
tribute.  
While I'm thinking of it, I know I need to get out of here, but just hold on.
I just appreciate coming back to Dallas. When you see a Richard Justice there
who used to be at the Dallas Times Herald. He was my second beat writer. Jim
Dent was my first beat writer. John Eisenberg from the Baltimore Sun was
probably my third beat writer. David Holland, who used to be Dallas Morning
News, was in there somewhere being interviewed in '77 after we won state,
South Oak Cliff, the men and the women, by Frank Luksa.  
Richard, you're something, but back then Frank Luksa was everything. He was
the Jim Murray back here.  
I mean, I appreciate the job that you all do. Okay? The printed word is the
most important thing that we have right now. We got all those fancy cameras
back there, and we got all these machines there. But there's nothing better
than in the morning picking up a newspaper and reading your stories. And,
please, keep changing my quotes where I sound like I graduated in four years
instead of six.  
I appreciate you all. Thank you.

### [Odyssey Sims](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21920)

  
_DALLAS, TEXAS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Baylor Coach Kim Mulkey. We'll go directly to
questions.  
  
Q. Kim, we've talked about Odyssey and how well she's adjusted this year in
the starting role. Talk about the NCAA Tournament experience for her. She is
coming off a season of seven turnovers against West Virginia, but just talk
about how she's handled herself and how better prepared you think she'll be
this week and maybe also overcoming the excitement of playing close to home.  
COACH MULKEY: She's not the only one playing close to home. You've got Pope
from Fort Worth and then you've got Nae-Nae who played at Dallas Lincoln, and
I'm probably missing somebody else in that bunch. But I don't think being at
home is going to be a factor at all in the game other than there may be more
family and friends in the stands.  
I thought she did very well in the first two games. The seven turnovers, I
don't dwell on that. I think it's just the nature of the position that she
plays. But I thought for the most part she handled herself the same way she's
handled herself all year.  
  
Q. Kim, talking with Nae-Nae the other day, she said in this backup role
she's in now she can kind of watch the game, get a little bit of a feel for it
before she goes in. For her, do you think that might be good? Because, as
you've said, at times she can be a little out of control.  
COACH MULKEY: Well, Nae-Nae brings us a certain amount of energy to the floor
by the way she plays. When she runs, she runs hard. When she dribbles, she
dribbles hard.  
And she plays two positions for us. She did that last year as well. So I can
look at her from the perspective, do I need to sub her right here for Odyssey,
do I need to sub her for Jordan Madden or Melissa Jones.  
And that was really probably more than anything the reason I decided to bring
her off the bench. I didn't want to have two point guards on the floor at the
same time. When they both get fatigued, who do I turn to? And I just think
that she's playing her best basketball right now.  
If you look at Nae-Nae Hayden's 3-point shooting, a lot of people want to
leave her open. I wouldn't let her get her feet set, because she's really
shooting the ball well from the 3. She can take you off the dribble and she,
just like Odyssey, is playing at home and I think it will be fun for her.  
  
Q. Green Bay's been a little under the radar playing in the Horizon League,
but still 4-0 against the Big Ten, 3-1 against teams in the tournament. What
has stood out about them as you've broken down film this week?  
COACH MULKEY: They're not under the radar if you're in women's basketball.
They've never been under the radar. I've been aware of their team for several
years.  
The thing that stands out to me is they're an older team again. They're very
confident. They take you off the dribble. They will shoot the 3. They play all
over the floor.  
And they've beaten some pretty good teams. And I don't care who you play. I
don't care what league you're in. If you've only lost one basketball game,
you're darn good. And it's going to be a battle, as it should be.  
  
Q. I'm doing a little bit of story not only on the game and your team but on
Brittney. Just talk to me how she's changing the game of basketball for
college athletics and just what she means to you.  
COACH MULKEY: Brittney Griner plays above the rim. She's one of those players
that I could tell her when the game starts tomorrow, go goaltend the first
shot they take.  
How many girls will I ever coach in my lifetime that I can tell that to? How
many have I ever played with? And I've played with some of the greatest both
in the Olympics and international ball. How many can you honestly say that to?  
She's a once-in-a-lifetime player. I don't know that we'll see the likes of
Brittney Griner again, because girls are just not made that way.  
And at the same time, when you have a player that has all the accolades thrown
her way and all the adjectives that are used, sometimes those players are hard
to coach, and you really are like, gosh, if they're not a player you enjoy
every day, you really wait for the day that they leave the program. Brittney
is one of those that when she's done at Baylor it's going to be a sad day
because she's one of the more coachable players.  
She's constantly -- you'll watch her play, she's looking for my approval.
She's making eye contact. She doesn't want to disappoint you.  
She's the first one in practice and the last one to leave. She's the one
player that will come by the office prior to people getting to practice
because she's bored. She's ready to get practice going.  
And I don't know that any of us will ever see a player like that again. I
think that she is -- you're going to see big players again. You're going to
see 6'8"s again. You see them now. But she's a player that will be talked
about many, many years from now. And I don't know that anybody can compare
players to her, because I don't know that we'll ever see one that can do what
she does.  
  
Q. You mentioned the other night you thought your team kind of had a
business approach, the way the things were after they advanced to the Sweet
16. Compare and contrast how this year's team is acting to the team last year.
They weren't expected to make a Final Four last year; this year you are.  
COACH MULKEY: I just think they're handling themselves in kind of a quiet,
confident way. They observe, they watch, they listen to all the comments. I
still want them to have a personality of excitement, but not silliness. And I
thought last year, because we had so many freshmen, they didn't know how to
separate being silly and excited, confident and business-like.  
And you just keep teaching them that, and I think the experiences on the floor
keep teaching them that.  
And all those freshmen are a year older, and hopefully the excitement and the
experience we had in making it to the Final Four will have helped them. And I
don't know that. You're in another Sweet 16 and you're playing a great team in
Green Bay, and they're going to be just as excited as we were last year. But
now maybe having been there before will help us just a little bit, but I don't
know that.  
  
Q. I wanted to ask you about the development of Jordan Madden from last
season to this season and her starting the second half of this season in the
Big 12 Tournament and how she's helped the team defensively up to this
point.  
COACH MULKEY: Jordan had been coming off the bench. And when we decided to
make the change with Nae-Nae, I thought Jordan Madden's length could help us
develop her into somewhat of a defensive stopper.  
She has the ability that when she gets beat off the dribble she can catch up
either by alternate shot because of her length on the perimeter or her
quickness. Nae-Nae and Terran and Odyssey, all those guys have the quickness,
but sometimes they don't have the length to really alter a shot.  
I think the biggest development, and it continues to be somewhat of a
development for Jordan, is she is such a fun, happy, easy-going, enjoy-life
type of kid that she can't separate, focus in seriousness for an hour and a
half to two hours on the floor. And that has been the biggest teaching point
with her is to make her understand there's a time to play and there's a time
to work.  
And I think, like all of the freshmen, they've had to learn how to take
constructive criticism in coaching. And I think she's really getting better. I
thought when she got here she'd pout over anything you corrected her on.  
Now she understands this lady's for me and I need to listen to her, and she's
just growing. I think it's just maturity.  
  
Q. People can watch film on Brittney and try to game plan against them. But
can they truly comprehend what it's like to go up against her until they
actually hit the floor and see what she's all about? Is Green Bay ready for
Brittney Griner?  
COACH MULKEY: I can't answer that. I'm not on that floor playing. If I was a
player, I could tell you better.  
I just know that you could probably get a better answer from people who have
played us. And as far as Green Bay being ready, I would think that they're
ready. If you're in a Sweet 16, every team's ready. And I really don't know
how to help you with that.  
  
Q. Kim, you talked about it the other day, but they shoot 3s from every
position on the floor. Talk about that. And when it does bring Brittney
outside, does that put more on the other players to try to crash the boards?  
COACH MULKEY: Green Bay is going to do things that we've seen this year. So
they can take all five players and bring them outside the paint. You guys have
watched us play every game, and you know that that's part of a lot of strategy
that people do. I think the difference is Green Bay does that anyway. It's not
like they're doing something they don't normally do.  
So we're not going to see anything different from Green Bay that we haven't
seen. Brittney's not going to all of a sudden see something any different than
she's already seen.  
So we just gotta go play. Are we going to see a double-, triple-team? I don't
know. Are we going to see a zone? I don't know? Are we going to see them bring
her? I don't know. But she's seen all of that and we work on all of that.  
Green Bay is good enough that they're going to do what they do best. Whatever
has gotten them to this point, that's what they're going to do. And that's
what good teams do. And I don't anticipate them to change a whole lot.  
  
Q. Matt Bollant said last week and leading up to this appearance that his
defense is probably the perfect defense to play a very tall post player, the
way they play post defense. What is it about their -- the way they play that
defense that makes them so effective and that I guess might work against your
player?  
COACH MULKEY: You're going to have to ask him that. I don't know his defense
like he does. I know what I see on film. But I can't dissect you and tell you
why he thinks his zone defense is any different or any better than the zone
defenses we see in our league. I don't know. I can't answer that.  
  
Q. You've talked about your team's youth and talent and exuberance. How does
Melissa Jones' veteran presence and leadership work into that?  
COACH MULKEY: Melissa Jones's presence on the floor just makes us a more
confident basketball team. She's a senior. She's our glue. She's our captain.
She's playing with vision in one eye. She almost has a triple-double in the
first half in the Big 12 Tournament.  
She just is an extension of me on the floor without the ball in her hands. The
point guard is usually an extension of you. But because Odyssey's a freshman,
Melissa has really been that coach on the floor.  
Melissa can play any position on the floor for us. We can play her at the
post. We can play her at the point. We can play her at the off guard. She's
just a competitor. And if every coach had the opportunity to coach a Melissa
Jones, those are the kids you would recruit at every position, because she
makes you a winner.  
  
Q. Excuse me for taking you back maybe a few years here, but struck by the
fact there's definitely a Louisiana Tech influence in this Regional, whether
it's you bringing Coach Barmore back as your assistant, Gary Blair was
together with you two there, and even Andy Landers talked about coaching
against Louisiana Tech today. Just wondering what do you remember from that
time and maybe that whole dynamic of Coach Barmore, Gary Blair as the
assistant, and yourself at LA Tech?  
COACH MULKEY: You'll have to let me talk a little bit here, because 19 years
of my life were spent at Louisiana Tech. I'm a Louisiana girl. And I've said
it many times. I don't care where my career takes me, Louisiana is home and it
always will be. My children were born there. My mother still lives there. I'll
have a slew of Louisiana friends sitting behind our bench.  
If you just look at the coaches, let's just say the head coaches at our level
that learned from Leon Barmore: Gary Blair, Kristy Curry, Kurt Budke, the list
goes on.  
There's no secret why those coaches are winning and are successful. You can't
be around a guy that loves the game and teaches the game in great detail and
not pick up something from him and then develop that and mix your own
personality in there.  
And it was such an honor for me to have a position open where I could ask him
to come out of retirement. He was bored. He retired too early. You can only
play golf so much. And in the winter months, I said, Why don't you come to
Baylor? You don't have to recruit. You don't even have to go to the games,
just come and when you want to practice and let me bend your ear. And he's got
a cush job. And I'm just as excited that he's a part of our program as he is
being a part of our program.  
Now, I was a player at Louisiana Tech in the early '80s when Gary was an
assistant and Coach Barmore was actually an assistant. And I could tell some
Gary Blair stories, but I won't. And he's just funny. You've got to remember,
Gary came from South Oak Cliff and he came to Louisiana Tech with Debra
Rodman.  
Now, do I need to tell you the Rodman family? Her brother is Dennis. So I tell
this story in the most complimentary and fun way, is that Dennis learned
everything from his sister Debra. Debra was one of the most enjoyable athletes
to play with because I knew if I got beat she had my back and blocked shots.
She's one of the most vicious rebounders I ever played with.  
And there's just a long line of coaches that came from Louisiana Tech because
at a time when no other big school was putting money into the women's
basketball programs, Louisiana Tech's president, F. Jay Taylor, did.  
And I guess one of the best compliments Pat Summitt ever made to me and to
Coach Barmore was in the early '80s Tennessee didn't beat Louisiana Tech. She
wanted to emulate that program. I will never forget that. And now we all know
what Tennessee means to all of us in this business.  
  
Q. You often have a size advantage in a game that's pretty significant
against Green Bay. Do you look to exploit the paint a little more, crash the
boards?  
COACH MULKEY: I don't think that we look to do that just because it's Green
Bay and we have a size advantage. We do that anyway.  
We do that if we don't have a size advantage. I'm not a very good coach if I
allow the perimeter players to ignore Griner for a very long period of time.
But it has nothing to do with Green Bay.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.  
We're now joined by our three student-athletes, Odyssey Sims, Melissa Jones
and Brittney Griner. Questions?  
  
Q. Brittney and Melissa, I want you to talk about Odyssey a little bit.
Brittney, obviously before you can score the ball most of the time Odyssey has
already touched. I want you to talk about the connection that you two have
built this year and just when you see her coming down the court. And, Melissa,
talk about for a freshman you have been through it four years, having the
experience you've had, talk about what you've seen in her development as a
freshman and how far she's come this season.  
BRITTNEY GRINER: Me and O, we have experience with playing with each other
before she came, so we kind of had a little bond before that.  
When I see her coming up the floor, I just try to see which way she's going,
and sometimes we lock eyes and just give me that look or I'll give her a look
like going to do something right here special.  
She's improved so much from the beginning, from summer. She stepped up a lot
in games in A&M games. She carried us. In the Oklahoma game she carried us.
She's doing a really good job with handling everything as a freshman point
guard. And just really proud of her.  
MELISSA JONES: Just what Brittney said, just how talented Odyssey really is,
my experience as a freshman was a lot different in the sense of, you know,
mine was up and down, up and down, learning experiences -- not to say she's
not learning, but how confident we all are having Odyssey as our point guard,
we don't even look at her as a freshman. She's already seemed to be so
experienced. She just has so much composure and just gets -- is leading our
team on the floor and holds us all together.  
  
Q. B.G., you've talked about how you enjoy going up against bigger posts.
Green Bay obviously is a little bit smaller team than what y'all are
accustomed to seeing in the Big 12. Do you attack that any differently when
it's a little bit smaller team?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: Well, I mean, guarding them-wise, they're a little bit
shorter, so you just -- not really, I don't think. Just basically go out and
play my game, really.  
We're not going to change up anything, because that's when you mess up stuff.
So just keep going out like I do every game. Hardly see taller posts, so it's
kind of like normal now.  
  
Q. Odyssey, a lot of college freshmen talk about their first season, and
maybe because of the length of the season, hitting a little wall toward the
end of the season or just running into a little fatigue because they haven't
played that many games in high school. Have you run into anything like that?
How are you feeling right now?  
ODYSSEY SIMS: I haven't ran into any wall or anything. Just taking it one game
at a time, just spreading as far as like our last game was Tuesday. The
hardest thing is just to stay focused, because everybody wants to play and we
don't play until tomorrow, so we still have a day to get ready and prepare. So
that's the biggest thing in practice is just staying focused, just counting
down the days and get ready to play at game time.  
  
Q. Odyssey and Melissa, you guys probably have been asked this a thousand
times, but talk about the lady to your left in Brittney and what she means to
the team and just how special of a talent she is.  
ODYSSEY SIMS: B.G., she's something special. She's 6'8". That's not something
you see all the time. And just her impact as far as what she brings to the
game.  
It's not her scoring not her blocking shots, just her presence alone, it means
so much, just because she's in the paint. She can block shots, alter shots,
and get rebounds. And on the other hand, offensive end, she can score when we
need her to, post up and drive the finish to her.  
And that's something that most teams don't have, and that's something that we
have and that we're able to -- not take advantage of, but something that we're
able to work with and be proud about that. And I'm glad to have her on my
team.  
MELISSA JONES: When people talk about Baylor women's basketball, the first
thing you hear is Brittney Griner. That's how it should be because of her
presence and how she's not only changing Baylor's program, but women's
basketball in general.  
But what I like most about Brittney doesn't really happen on the court. It's
like who she is as a person off the court and how you can just have a good
time with her and just have fun and goof around with her. So I really enjoy
that.  
  
Q. M.J., last year you were a little -- particularly at this level, you all
were more the hunter going after the higher-seeded teams, now you're the
hunted. Is there a different mindset? Or with Kim is every game the same
anyway?  
MELISSA JONES: We have to expect that any game we're going to play you're
going to get the best shot from every team. So we just have to prepare knowing
that every game we play has to be at the best of our ability as well, because
on any given night, if we play a bad game we can be beat. So we just have to
-- like Odyssey was saying, we have to stay focused and we have to maintain
just keeping each other together and just preparing it one game at a time.  
  
Q. Odyssey, a couple of weeks ago your high school team finally got that
state championship. A minute ago you were talking about focus. How is it
playing this close to home and how does it feel being this close to home? Do
you feel any different, or do you put that aside and say this is another
game?  
ODYSSEY SIMS: The first thing that comes to my mind is not really worried
about like coming home. I'm here -- we're here to play basketball. We're not
here to see family, to talk to my friends, socialize, all that other stuff.
That other stuff comes after the season when it's all said and done.  
Right now we have other stuff to deal with, and that's playing basketball. So
that's not even -- that doesn't even cross my mind. I've just got to stay
focused.  
  
Q. Brittney, kind of in the same vein as the question to Melissa but also
the fact that you've had to deal personally with expectations pretty much your
whole career. But now as a team, after the Final Four last year, it's almost
like this year would be a disappointment if you don't get back to the Final
Four. How has the team coped with that and what's the mindset when so much is
expected of a team?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: Personally, and I know as a team, we really -- the
expectations of everybody we kind of really just block out. We have our team
expectations and what Coach expects us to do and accomplish. And that's mainly
what we focus on. The difference from last year and this year, like you said,
a little bit of the hunted this time.  
But like M.J. said, we know we're going to get everybody's best shot. All we
can do is go out and play as hard as we can, just like last year when we were
pursuing the bigger-seeded schools, just playing hard. So this were year just
gotta keep doing what we did, just keep playing hard every game.  
  
Q. Brittney, want to ask you, too, about being close to home. Waco is not
far from Dallas and Houston is not far at all either. Talk about that. But
first let me ask you about being the focal point of Baylor women's basketball.
How you handle that?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: I mean, I really don't consider myself that. I really don't
consider myself as that. I couldn't do what I'm doing without my teammates,
without Melissa, without O and -- I can't bring the ball up myself and give me
a good pass in the post.  
So everything is just the team when it comes to me. I don't know what to
really say about being the focal point of Baylor. I don't feel like I am.
Can't do anything without coaches and my team.  
Being close to home, I mean, Dallas was where my AU team was. I know I have
people who come out to the games, but these guys come out and play, we can
celebrate after everything's said and done.  
  
Q. Brittney, you haven't fouled out of a game. You lead the nation in
blocked shots. Can you talk a little bit about the discipline it requires for
you to be that aggressive blocking shots, and you know teams want to get you
in foul trouble and yet not being in that situation?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: Just being smart, playing smart. I want to get a block, but
if I can't block it, you can just be a presence there and try to alter it,
make them think about I'm 6'8" coming at you with a long wing span. So they're
going to think about it.  
Just being aggressive, but have finesse to it, too. You can't be just all
aggressive and -- you'll end up getting those fouls. It's a little bit of
finesse in it, too. So just keeping that in mind on the defensive end.  
  
Q. M.J., can you give us maybe the daily progress report on your eye and any
update?  
MELISSA JONES: It's about the same. It's still blurry and kind of have like a
mirage still sense to it and just kind of goes back and forth from seeing that
and just being blurred.  
  
Q. Melissa and Odyssey, can you all talk about, of course, they can shoot
3-pointers from every position but the importance of getting out and defending
them beyond that line?  
MELISSA JONES: Green Bay is a very talented basketball team. And anything that
they might lack with size, as you were talking about earlier, they have
hustle. And just their mentality of keep going in every possession is
something you have to look at coming when we're going to play them.  
So we really have a handful with just trying to defend and trying to defend
every aspect of the floor, because they can shoot and they can drive. They're
very athletic and we have our hands full.  
ODYSSEY SIMS: What she said, they're a very talented team. They only lost one
game this season. That's something that we have to look at, too. They're
pretty good. They didn't get here for no reason. And just the biggest thing we
have to do is just close out and move our feet, because they're a very
athletic team. And one thing that Coach stresses is the guards haven't stopped
dribble penetration. So we're just going to try to do a better job of keeping
our girl in front and not sending them all to Brittney so she doesn't have to
help and pick up early fouls early.  
  
Q. M.J., you talked about Brittney as a person; that's what you appreciate
most. And those of us know her even a little bit know she's a very happy-go-
lucky, Skittles-eating kid. What's the craziest or goofiest thing you've seen
her do?  
MELISSA JONES: Man, we might be here all day. I don't know. One of my favorite
memories is when we went out to one of our coaches' house, their pool, we were
doing flips off the bridge into the water, even though she can't really swim.
So she was kind of a little nervous. We were like, Brittney, just stand up,
you're in shallow enough water. So that was pretty entertaining (laughter).  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.

_DALLAS, TEXAS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Matt Bollant has joined us. Coach, your thoughts about
the tournament.  
COACH BOLLANT: Excited to be here. Our players have worked very hard and
accomplished something that's never been done in the history of the Green Bay
program. To be a mid major and knock off the Big Ten teams that we did, it
says a lot about the fight and who our players are. And it's been a really fun
ride and we're hoping it's going to go on for a while.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Obviously the question that everybody asks about Baylor is preparing for
Brittney Griner, which is a unique challenge in itself, and I heard there were
a couple of unique things going on this week in practice. I want to do it as
kind of a two-part. Talk about preparing for her but also when you look before
Brittney gets the ball they have a freshman point guard, Odyssey Sims, that's
pretty good and she's done a pretty good job. So talk about the two of them.  
COACH BOLLANT: It starts with Sims and your ability to contest her. One of the
things that -- they're so athletic when they get by off the dribble and you
have to help Griner just scoops things up, so they get layups and they get
offensive rebounds. It's one of the worst things you can give up against an
athletic team is penetration, because it just leads to layups and it leads to
offensive rebounding.  
But Griner's presence, for us, we focused on just trying to keep her, limit
her the best we can. I think the system we do is hopefully the right system
for it. We talked a lot this week about be who you are. I know a lot of teams
change throughout the year and do a lot of different things. But for us we
want our players to be confident, so we haven't changed much this week. We
thought be who you are and do the things that we do.  
  
Q. In terms of being who you are, as far as the defense that you'll throw at
Baylor, is it predominantly zone and will you look to double, triple Brittney
in the post?  
COACH BOLLANT: Yeah, we've played two defenses throughout the year, a man and
a half court trap, and we'll continue to do that as well. So we'll mix things
up and see what works, and that's one of the things that's helped us
throughout the year.  
We did a lot against Michigan State, is be able to change the pace and mix
things up in different possessions and defending the shot clock and things
like that.  
But the flow of the game will determine a little bit what we do and how we
guard.  
  
Q. Can you talk about, like you said, first time ever to the Sweet 16, how
to guard against not just being excited being here?  
COACH BOLLANT: The first thing we did when we practiced, the first time we
took off Wednesday and our travel day coming back, and Thursday, the first
thing we did is, hey, we expected to be in this game.  
When we left the locker room at Iowa State last year, we knew we were a
possession away and felt like we let an opportunity slip.  
And we came in this year with the expectation of playing this game. If you're
expecting to play in this game, then you're not just happy to be there, you
want to play well and you want to have a shot to win.  
And obviously we understand the enormous challenge that we have at hand. At
the same time, our players are 34-1. When Green Bay steps on the court and
every one of our games this year, when we stepped on the court they believed
we should win.  
And they've done that. I mean, in the last three years I think we've won 90,
91 games, so for three years when we stepped on the court, they believe we
should win. And that's one of the reasons why we didn't change a lot this
week, is we thought, hey, what we've done has been good enough and we don't
want to send the wrong message to our players that we have to do something
drastically different when what you've done has been pretty special all year.  
  
Q. Is Kayla going to get the main assignment against Brittney, or is it
going to be a whole combination of girls who go up against her?  
COACH BOLLANT: It will probably be Julie to start, and she's our 5 and
probably best physical presence. But, yeah, certainly we're going to have to
switch things off and do different things to give different people a look, and
we'd also switch some screens, so it will be some different people guarding
her at different times as well.  
  
Q. I guess a common opponent for you is Michigan State, a team you guys just
finished beating and a team they beat pretty good back in November. Did you
look at anything in those two games?  
COACH BOLLANT: I haven't watched Michigan State. I taped it and I'll watch it.
I've watched about ten tapes. That was so long ago that I wanted to see all
the more current ones first, because teams change throughout the year. They do
different things.  
But that's something I will go back and watch and see what they did against
them and how it worked. I certainly know Michigan State's personnel, so I
understand their athleticism. And that's one of the things it's hard to tell
on tape, is how athletic the teams are playing against and what they're like.
I certainly know the Big 12 is the best conference in the country, so it gives
you somewhat of a feel. But that will help, watching a little bit of that
tape. And I plan to do that tonight.  
  
Q. Can you talk about how difficult you are to defend? Because I know Kim
talked about that y'all can shoot the 3 at any position on the floor and move
and dribble drive, that kind of thing. Talk about how difficult you are to
defend.  
COACH BOLLANT: Yeah, I think that's one of the things that -- I think we pass
the ball extremely well. I think that makes a difference in how you guard us.
Julie Wojta led us in -- our 5, led us in assists. And certainly she'll step
out and face the basket, be able to shoot the 3 and go off the dribble as
well.  
So that's kind of a unique challenge. In watching them play, Griner didn't
have to guard too many 5s that were stepping out, facing the basket, shooting
the 3 and going off the dribble. And so hopefully that will present a little
bit of a problem. And that's something that as we play bigger teams that we
try to take advantage of.  
And then we'll post our guards. And against a lot of teams, posting the guards
is pretty effective. I'm not sure -- they've got big, athletic guards, so it's
going to be a challenge to maybe get quite as many touches. But Celeste
Hoewisch has posted up all year against bigger guards and been really
effective.  
I think our ability to pass the ball, I think we play with a lot of
discipline, we're willing to make four, five, six passes to make you have to
guard. So hopefully those things.  
One of the things we say is let's make them have to guard and make them have
to guard a lot of action. It's easy to guard one or two screens, one or two
passes; make them have to guard four, five, six, seven and see how they do
with that.  
  
Q. I notice also in the stats that you guys have a lot of steals. I mean, is
that a key against Baylor, too, is just being active, getting in the passing
lanes and that kind of thing?  
COACH BOLLANT: Yeah, it certainly is. We pride ourselves in playing as hard as
any team in the country. I've had probably more coaches this year before the
game say, Coach, I don't think I've ever seen a team play harder on film than
your team.  
And certainly people will look at that think, well, it's the quality of the
play of the Horizon League, but Michigan State had 15 turnovers in the first
half against us, so it's not just the Horizon League that turned it over,
certainly Baylor is a whole 'nother animal as far as their guards and Sims and
how talented they are.  
When we play hard and play aggressively, then usually good things happen for
us defensively.  
  
Q. About six weeks ago there was another team from Green Bay that was here
that most people considered an underdog. Have you mentioned that at all to
your team? How much motivation -- I know it's solely unrelated, but --  
COACH BOLLANT: It's fun to be -- we talk a lot about Title Town and just the
championships and that there's not only one championship team in Green Bay.  
We won 13 conference championships and been to the NCAA -- I think this is our
12th time in the NCAA Tournament. So it's been quite a run for the Phoenix
program.  
And the Phoenix program has been really good for a long time. We just haven't
been to the Sweet 16. So this is kind of the next step for us and it's
exciting to put us on the map.  
And certainly the Packers -- we have a lot of players from Wisconsin. They're
die-hard Packer fans and they don't miss a game and they've grown up since
they were five years old, they've been following the Packers and going to the
games and all that. That's kind of neat. We've gotten to know a little bit of
the staff and players here and there, so it makes it fun to be in Green Bay.  
  
Q. Your team is obviously very confident. They believe in themselves. But is
there any worry at all when they get on the floor against Brittney and that
presence out there that there could be an intimidation factor that they're
just really not prepared for no matter how much you watch film?  
COACH BOLLANT: Yeah, you know, you can talk about her blocking a shot and
doing that, but it's just hard to simulate that and say how that's going to
affect who you are.  
One of the things I said is, hey, they block a shot and it goes out of bounds,
we get to run inbounds. So we score more on inbounds plays than just about any
team in the country. We've got 20 different inbounds plays versus man.  
They're going to see a lot of different things. Don't get rattled. If they
block the ball and it goes out of bounds, good. We're about to run an inbounds
play and probably going to get a great shot.  
So I try to use that psychology. But until you're on the court and until she
blocks your shot, you don't know how they're going to react. But hopefully
they're going to tell themselves the right thing. We've tried through the
year, all year, to talk about moving on to the next play, not letting one play
affect the next. But a blocked shot is a little bit different in that
scenario, and hopefully they'll be able to handle that. She's certainly going
to block a lot of shots because she's very capable.  
  
Q. Baylor just being a little bit down the road and they draw pretty well,
do you approach this game kind of as a road game knowing that they're going to
have a pretty good following here?  
COACH BOLLANT: Yeah, yeah, I think we do. It's part of where we're at. We were
really thankful to -- first time in the history of the program we've gone to a
court been able to play two neutral court games. So that was really the hope
going in.  
Last year we lost a hard-fought game at Iowa State in front of 8,000, 9,000
fans. I think as a neutral court, I'm not sure we lose that game. So having a
neutral court was good.  
One of the things we hope for is a lot of Texas A&M fans to come out, because
I know they'll be cheering for us so they don't have to play them a fourth
time.  
So I'd encourage the Texas A&M fans to get out here and support Green Bay. I'm
friends with Coach Blair and he sent me a text, so I'm sure there's a lot of
A&M people hoping for an upset from Green Bay.  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by two of the student-athletes from Green Bay,
Celeste Hoewisch and Kayla Tetschlag. Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Celeste, your coach was just up here a minute ago talking about you guys
have to be you. And obviously what you are is, I mean, 34-1. You've won 25 in
a row. How much confidence do you guys have right now, just with the success
you've had?  
CELESTE HOEWISCH: I think we're very confident with ourselves and what's got
us to this point. We're obviously going to have to play a good game. There's
no doubt about it. We're going to have to play very good basketball.  
But we just can't get caught up in No. 1 seed and get intimidated by that. We
just have to go out there, play aggressive and play Green Bay basketball.  
  
Q. Kayla, the obvious question is Brittney Griner stands in the middle of
that Baylor team. Talk about preparing for her. Can you really prepare? I've
heard you were shooting over green foam the other day, just whatever it would
take. Talk about preparing for it and will you be ready for it until you get
on the court.  
KAYLA TETSCHLAG: All year we've been undersized. Both of our post players are
six foot. We went against Penn State in Cancun over Thanksgiving and it wasn't
a problem, just because we have that fight to us and we have that heart. And
sometimes I think that just makes more of a difference.  
Yes, we understand she's the tallest player we've ever played against. But,
again, like Celeste said, we can't get caught up in that.  
So we've been doing our best to simulate it in practice, but when it comes
down to it, it's just going to be about the heart and how hard we fight.  
  
Q. Couple of months ago there was another team from Green Bay that came down
here that was considered the underdog and ended up walking away Super Bowl
champions. I know it's a little unrelated, but talk about that a little bit.
Just do you feed off that a little bit, Green Bay coming down here and trying
to do something?  
CELESTE HOEWISCH: You're the first person to say that (laughter). I'm just
kidding. No, we've heard that a lot. I think it's cool to be compared, Title
Town, that whole thing, winning tradition. I think we embrace it as a team.  
We're very proud of the Packers and we're very proud of this team. And I think
the same thing, like how the community embraces the Packer team. It's very
similar to how our community is with our team. Hopefully we can have the same
type of magic and get it done.  
KAYLA TETSCHLAG: We're okay with being compared to them. I think I see a lot
of similarities in their team and ours, just because, like you said, they were
seen as the underdog, but they came in here with a lot of fight and with a lot
of heart and got it done.  
So being in the city where it all happened, I think that's a great thing for
us.  
  
Q. Kayla, you've had some creative shot-making moments in your career. How
important will that be against a good shot blocker like Brittney? And she has
not fouled out of a game this year. How do you try and get her into foul
trouble?  
KAYLA TETSCHLAG: The biggest thing our coaches have been telling us is to go
up into her. Don't block the shot for her, is a quote we've been hearing from
our coaches. So don't turn yourself in different ways and make it easy for her
to block that shot. Just continue to do as best you can.  
We have been working on it in practice stepping on the perimeter a little bit
for our post players and just continuing to see the rim and not seeing the
long arm in front of you.  
So we're going to continue to do our best with that.  
  
Q. Celeste, so much focus is on Brittney Griner. Talk about some of those
perimeter players and how you can't lose focus on those too.  
CELESTE HOEWISCH: Definitely, I think that's one of the biggest things I think
we saw in film, is that they've got some other great parts around there.
Odyssey Sims is a great point guard and can really create for the team.  
So I think ball pressure is going to be key for us and keeping those guards in
front, because Brittney Griner is going to be a hard enough task as it is. We
don't want anybody else going off and creating and penetrating. So I think
keeping their guards in front is going to be a challenge for us.  
  
Q. Kayla, you guys are also far away from home. Obviously Baylor and A &M
will have very large contingents of crowds here. I don't know how many Green
Bay fans will be here. But do you kind of embrace that sort of underdog
mentality?  
KAYLA TETSCHLAG: Yeah, well, I think we have a good crowd that traveled with
us. We tend to travel pretty well, which is exciting.  
But as Coach says in his pregame speeches, for away games we're all we have,
and that sometimes makes us stick together even more and trust each other and
communicate even better because we don't have that huge crowd behind us.  
It's not going to be like a huge number like a home game, but I think we'll
have a pretty good crowd, and we'll just have to stick together that much
more.  
  
Q. Celeste, and maybe Kayla, too, Coach talked about it, this is the first
time y'all have ever made a Sweet 16 appearance. How do you keep yourself from
being content for just being here?  
CELESTE HOEWISCH: I don't think that's a problem for this team. I think this
team has been hungry all year. We want to achieve great things. I don't think
anybody's satisfied. I think everybody's still hungry and wants to keep this
thing going.  
We want to stay playing together for as long as possible, because we love each
other so much. We're a family. And we don't want this to end.  
KAYLA TETSCHLAG: Yeah, I feel the same way. After the last game I was thanking
all the underclassmen for just giving me one more game in this uniform. I
think they've shown that they don't want to stop playing with us by playing as
hard as they play. So looking forward to it.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.

_DALLAS, TEXAS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Landers has now joined us from the University of Georgia.
Opening comments, Coach.  
COACH LANDERS: Thank you. Obviously, like the other three teams, I'm sure, our
basketball team is excited to be here and about the opportunities and the
challenges that go with playing a very, very good Texas A&M team.  
We feel like we've played reasonably well lately and by and large played
reasonably well throughout the season, with the exception probably of the last
week of the regular season.  
We're excited to be here, think we have a good basketball team and one that
looks forward to playing Texas A&M.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. Coach talked about your relationship. Obviously you go --  
COACH LANDERS: Way back.  
  
Q. Way back. You had a pretty good record against him when he was at
Arkansas, and going into tomorrow, anything you can take from knowing him so
long?  
COACH LANDERS: Well, as far as to work in our advantage in this basketball
game, not a thing. Different time, different place, different circumstances,
different teams.  
I think Gary, without question, has the best basketball team that he will have
had that we will play against. This team is a better basketball team than any
of those that he had at Arkansas.  
So the things -- and, quite honestly, if he told you he remembered the things
that we did against each other back then, he was lying, because neither one of
us can remember that far back. We can't remember what we had for breakfast.  
  
Q. Could you talk about Danielle Adams and the problems she presents and
what you might do to try to combat that?  
COACH LANDERS: Well, I'll talk about the problems that she presents. I'm not
going to talk about what we're going to do to combat that; got a feeling you
got a fairly good relationship with Gary being from College Station. I hope
you don't, but you probably do.  
But, you know, she's a very talented player. She reminds me of a player we had
not too long ago named Tasha Humphrey. Tasha was a big, strong kid with an
uncanny ability to score inside, much because of her size and her strength,
but also because of her sense of where the basket was and how to get the ball
in it.  
Now, where they differ from a lot of low post players, Adams and Humphrey, is
that both of those two also like to float out on that perimeter and put the 3
ball up.  
And, you know, that's where it gets a little bit tricky. We've played other
people. I mean, the kid we played from Florida State last week, 6'4", 6'5",
big-bodied kid with great offensive skills down low but she didn't leave the
block. The three bigs from Tennessee, very good down low, but they didn't
leave the blocks.  
That's where it gets tricky. You've got to pick this kid up. You're talking to
your defensive players, your 5 man in particular, about getting back, get
back, get back, because Texas A&M wants to run on you.  
And then maybe for the first time all year you're telling her, oh, by the way,
now get back up to the 3-point line and catch this kid before she catches the
basketball or puts the shot up. So that's where it's tricky.  
  
Q. Coach Blair said he's copied a lot of things from you. He wasn't sure if
you did the same. Is there anything --  
COACH LANDERS: No, I copied nothing from him. But someone asked me earlier --
there's Sue Donohoe back there; she can attest to this. She was Gary's
assistant at one time -- if I was at all surprised at Gary's success, and I
told them no, he's copied about everything we've done.  
Let me -- I'm having fun this morning, okay? There are -- I actually see
similarities in the two teams, and some of the things, not entire sets
offensively, not the entire defensive philosophy. But I see us doing things
that Texas A&M does, and I see Texas A&M doing things that we've done through
the years.  
And I don't think it's that those pieces are necessarily about the two
coaches. I think that it's more about a better way. If Gary and I were both
very honest, we'd tell you that we're a little bit slow and it's taking us a
little longer to get to the best way to do some things, but finally I think
we've figured some of those things out, and we have those things, our teams
have those things in common.  
  
Q. At what point in your time in Athens did you realize that you would be
sinking in your coaching roots there at Georgia?  
COACH LANDERS: I don't know -- I don't know that that was ever a thought
process. You know, when I took the University of Georgia job 32 years ago, I
thought it could be a special place for women's basketball. It, at the time,
may have been one of the worst major basketball programs in the country. And I
mean that not just because of one or two things; a number of things had
transpired the year before I got there.  
And, quite honestly, they just weren't very good from a competitive
standpoint. But I felt like it could be one of the best basketball programs
and one of the really neat spots to coach women's basketball. And I got there
and rolled up my sleeves and went to work.  
And everything that has happened since is really a little bit of a blur, all
of it. You know, there's never been a reflection time or a pondering point
when I've sat down and said I'm going to stay here for a long time or, boy,
we're doing good.  
You gotta remember, I took that job when women's basketball wasn't cool, and
every day since women's basketball has changed. And so it's been enough of a
job just to keep up and keep changing and keep improving with the times, which
has really been a neat thing for me.  
I've never been bored. We've never taken a position where, boy, we're doing
great. And we had some years back to back to back to back where we did great.
We've just kept our sleeves rolled up for 32 years, and it's still a work in
progress.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the matchup between the guards and the A &M guards and
what that's going to be like?  
COACH LANDERS: I think those are pretty good matchups. I think overall Texas
A&M has a little more quickness than we do, but if we were playing one-on-one,
that would be a real concern. But we're not. We're playing five-on-five.  
So oftentimes you can negate advantage/disadvantage that a team or player may
have with quickness because you are playing five-on-five. So I see those
matchups on the perimeter being very good. I see the matchups at the 4
position being very good.  
I see advantage/disadvantage both ways at the 5 position. And I think at the
end of the day the five kids that play the best together and have the most
success, obviously, with what their team's trying to do is probably going to
drive the outcome of this. I don't think it's going to be the back court or
the front court or the 5 spot.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.  
We're joined by Anne Marie Armstrong, Meredith Mitchell and Jasmine James.
Questions?  
  
Q. Jasmine, can you talk about the matchup between y'all's guards and the
two Sydneys from Texas A &M?  
JASMINE JAMES: I feel like it's going to be a great matchup. We're both pretty
-- have very good speed, as well as very good in transition. I feel like it's
a very good matchup as far as height, speed, and just overall. So I feel like
it will be a very interesting game.  
  
Q. Anne Marie, can you talk about -- the team has been in a shooting slump
of sorts. Do you guys feel you need to break out as far as the shooting
goes?  
ANNE MARIE ARMSTRONG: I haven't really noticed that to be honest. I think we
just need to show up, be focused. A lot of shots may not fall, but in the big
thing for us in this game is going to be rebounding. We need to crash the
offensive glass whether we're making or missing shots to show up to get on the
boards.  
  
Q. Anne Marie, along those lines, how do you combat Danielle Adams for A &M?
  
ANNE MARIE ARMSTRONG: She's a great player. Great size, great shooting
ability. I think as a team she's one of our main focuses of stop in our zone.
We've got to keep her off the block as well as keep her from shooting open 3s
and getting open looks.  
  
Q. Jasmine, coming off a big upset, you come up here, Baylor, and everybody
is talking about Baylor and A &M, this is Big 12 territory. What's the
mindset? Do you feel like you're the underdogs? Do you feel you're on house
money? What's the team's mindset coming into the Sweet 16?  
JASMINE JAMES: We don't really worry about that much. We just have to come in
and focus on the opponent. It's not a matter of what the rankings are or what
the seedings are, we just have to focus on who it is we're playing.  
So we're just going to go into this game Sunday and just play hard and go out
there and put everything we have out there. If we have a win -- if we win it
and it's an upset in some people's eyes, then that is what it is.  
  
Q. Meredith, A &M's calling card is defensive pressure. I was curious if
that's what was translated when you were watching tape and also how you plan
to handle that.   
MEREDITH MITCHELL: A&M, they bring a lot of effort on the defensive end. They
bring a lot of intensity. As long as we try to do our best to take care of the
ball, we'll do fine against them. We've faced teams who have great pressure
defense as well, but we should be fine.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.

_DALLAS, TEXAS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, welcome. Congratulations on your season, and your
thoughts about this tournament.  
COACH BLAIR: Glad to be back home. I think we've earned our way here by the
schedule that we played this year. I think our strength of schedule's in the
top 5, which it's been for the last three years. And we've been a road team.
And a lot of people have asked, are you excited about being at Dallas?  
We're doing this for a lot of reasons. We've traveled all over the country,
every coast, everywhere from Duke to New York, to California, to Cancun.  
We wanted to stay closer to home, and that was the number one thing. It didn't
matter if Baylor was there or Texas was there. It didn't matter. We wanted to
be in the Dallas region, to be able to bring kids back home and make it a
little bit easier for our fans to be able to come.  
So we're excited to be here. To get to the Final Four you're going to have to
be two very, very good teams anyway, so it doesn't matter. Anybody that's left
in this thing right now, they're all capable of getting to Final Four.  
As you've seen in the men's thing, every time you think you've got it figured
out, you do not have it figured out. And that's the way it should be in the
women's game as well. Even though there's been six of us that have stayed at
the top the whole year and that has not changed one iota from day one to now,
I think there's 16 teams that have a chance to get to the Final Four and I
think we're one of them.  
I'll open it up for questions. By the way, I took my team to Brooklyn's last
night. It's a Jazz restaurant club over here that one of my former players,
Pam Green, has another restaurant down the street. She played back when it was
six-on-six ball, and she was our Sydney Carter type. She was a guard on that
team that won state. The last game ever played on six-on-six ball was 1978,
where we won state.  
And a lot of my South Oak Cliff girls all came over, and, gosh, did I feel
old. Most of them are a little bit over 50 now and they all have two or three
kids, they all are very successful, and it really made me feel good to come
back and see my kids. Because that was the best job I ever had, was Dallas
South Oak Cliff High School, because it gave me the confidence to do what I'm
doing now and it started inner-city Dallas playing basketball back in '73,
'74, where we started extramurals, and then it went on to UIL in '75, '76.  
But it's good to be back home. I'll open it up for questions.  
  
Q. Gary, could you just talk about your all-Sydney back court and kind of
the idea you have two point guards back there playing alongside each other.
It's not really the fine shooting guard point guard role for you, and how that
evolved and how that worked for you.  
COACH BLAIR: It just works out. We recruited Carter as a combo guard from
DeSoto High School that could play both ways. She's been our best defensive
player, has been for a couple of years, and she can relieve Colson at the
point guard.  
But she's not really what I really like as a true point guard. And I'm hoping
next year with the freshmen coming in and with Pratcher being a sophomore that
they can handle the point guard position.  
I do not want to take anything away from Carter thinking about how to stop the
other team's best player on the perimeter. And she has that excitement
anywhere from 6'1" on down to 5'6", which she is. And she will always be on
the other team's best perimeter player.  
Colson is your creator, instant offense. She's very, very good in the
transition game. The transition game works as long as your defense works. You
do not want to go down there and play "hope they miss" defense; you want to go
down there and play "make them miss" defense, MTM.  
And then get into the lanes and let's go with the ball, and she's very good at
creating offense that way.  
But the two Sydneys, I don't know if I'll ever have another pair like them
again. I'm just very fortunate that they're not the same year, so I will
always have the transition of replacing one, then the other.  
Somebody asked me the other day, Which one can you not afford to lose? And I
can't afford to lose either one because you win with point guard play, but you
win with Sydney Carter, never takes a play off in practice or in games ever.
She's there every possession.  
And that's something that you cannot usually find in women's ball or men's
ball, a kid that never takes a play off. And that's what Carter does for us.  
  
Q. With everything that Danielle's done this season, is there anything that
you're looking for in this tournament to maybe take it up a notch? Is there
anything you've talked to her about?  
COACH BLAIR: It's not the points; it's she draws so much attention to her. And
what we've got to do is Georgia's going to double or they're going to play
some jump defense. They're very good with their zone defenses that they play,
and they play a couple of different ones.  
Danielle has to find the balance between inside and outside scoring, and not
just sit there and say I'm going to shoot the 3 ball all the time or shoot it
on transition. Have your mid-range game, get to the free-throw line like she's
been doing -- she's 14 out of 14 in two games so far -- and give us that
balance.  
Georgia does not have a lot of depth, particularly at the post position. I
think that's probably why Andy's played more zone than he normally does this
year.  
Well, you've got to attack Danielle and not settle with a jump shot. The jump
shot's not going to get anybody into foul trouble, but her power moves will.
And then when they start doubling down there, she's got to find the extra
girl, the cutter to the basket, and then we've got to do a better job of
making those driving layups, either on the half court or on -- they're very --
Georgia is very long and athletic.  
The SEC is known for defense. I played in it ten years. It's known for defense
first. Whether it's football or basketball. They contest bodies up in the air.
They're very good. They play pressure ball.  
And you better be ready to be able to attack on offense, because if you play
soft at all, you're going to be a one and out going the other way.  
And that's what we cannot afford to do. We've got to be able to break them
down off of the bounce and get to the hole a lot, because their defense is so
fast and it recovers so well.  
So I imagine Danielle, we'll place her all over the floor. We'll place her at
trailer. We'll play her at the high post when we run our 1-3-1 zone offense,
and then we run a lot of stuff down there for her low.  
But I keep inventing plays for her. And she's fun. Because I've been here five
straight years sitting up here without an inside presence. And now with
Danielle, you can draw up a lot of things. And generally the ball's in her
hands. She usually makes me look pretty good.  
  
Q. You and Andy obviously have a long relationship. Is there anything you
can draw from knowing him so long and going up against him that will help you
here?  
COACH BLAIR: Well, the number one thing, we used to go to Sandestin all the
time for the SEC meetings. My daughter used to baby-sit his kids. Well, right
behind you is my grandson back there. That's Logan. Logan, raise your hand
back there.  
Now, my kids are a little bit older now. His kids are now 24 and 21. I want to
see if Andy can now baby-sit my grandkids. And then we'll keep -- we keep
playing this game out, and we'll just keep on going.  
I mean, it's a moment in time. Landers is one of the -- might be the best
coach in the country that has not won a national championship yet. He's been
there five times. He should have won it in '85. He'll probably tell you a
couple more teams, too, but in '85 by far he had the best team. And he lost it
when Teresa Edwards fouled out with about 9 or 10 to go.  
What can I learn also by Andy? I've got to change a play of mine. I've got a
play I call Georgia that I stole from him. And then we're working out at SMU
this morning, and I said here's a play that he beat me on a last-second shot
on a 3-point shot. Here's one that he beat me playing in Athens. Vic wasn't
with me then or Kelly, and I said this is how it works, and it still works.  
So I've copied a lot of stuff from him. I don't know if he's copied a lot of
stuff from me. But when we all started, he was the best recruiter in the
country for a head coach. There was nobody that outworked Andy Landers during
the summer. He was the first coach to have a cell phone. Okay. I was probably
the last.  
But he was the absolutely first person to have that cell phone. And he used to
just wear it out. And he was that good of a recruiter. And he learned from
coaches by how they handled themselves. Just played Vivian Stringer, classy
lady. Andy Landers, look who is on the other side, Matt and Kim. You learn by
playing great people. Then great people turn into great coaches. That's what
Landers is.  
  
Q. How do you handle Phillips and what's your thoughts guarding her going
into the game?  
COACH BLAIR: I think she's a lot more athletic than what we faced at Rutgers,
with Oliver and Lee. And they attack you a lot more. In one way you want to
say what's the difference between Rutgers and them? They run more stuff and
they attack the basket more. Rutgers was trying to run -- they went to a
smaller lineup and they were trying to run a five-out offense, which fit in
with us very well.  
But in the SEC there's always a dominant post player. And Phillips is very
good. She's 10 1/2 rebounds a ballgame. What we've got to do is make sure
Danielle can stay out of foul trouble guarding her or Adaora, whoever we put
on her. And I think Phillips is very good.  
But they've got a team you cannot worry about Phillips; you've got five kids
averaging between 12 1/2 and 7 1/2, and you say, well, that's not a -- one
gigantic score. You worry about Georgia as a whole instead of trying to stop
one individual like at Rutgers. We went in trying to stop April Sykes. We held
her to 14 in the first half, 21 overall. But we shut down the rest of them.  
And with Georgia, they're all capable of scoring. But Phillips, that will
probably be our main concern. But Hassell is very good on the other side as
well. Then when they bring in 6'3" off the bench, we have matchup problems
there. She'll be playing the 3 position. And they're just very long.  
We're going to have to take care of the basketball particularly on the half
court better, just because of their speed. They run a little I formation, 2-3
zone. So the girl that comes out goes out for the first pass then she takes
the second pas on the other side. Now, that's hard to do.  
Our men's practice team even had a hard time doing it, getting from one side
to the other, but they've got a kid that can do it. And then it leaves their
three inside people at home.  
  
Q. How do you feel like your back court matches up against theirs?  
COACH BLAIR: I think it's very similar. We're probably a little bit smaller,
not much. We're 5'8", 5'6". And then both of us are good in transition. We
have to run, because, like with Andy, when he's averaging 12 through 7, he's
not trying to get it all off the half court offense. He's trying to get some
off of transition. Transition starts with your defense. That's where we're
very good, and that's where he's very good.  
I think he's only averaging or giving up 58 points a game. That's similar to
what we're doing, but he's only averaging 61 to 64, something in that, because
that's the style of ball that he plays. He is going to run so much stuff that
their screens are good. They really nail you on all of that stuff that they
run.  
And what we're going to have to do is be aware -- we're going to have to get
through screens. Okay. Not be switching screens all the time. We're going to
have to find a way to get over screens instead of them setting a good legal
screen, which they do.  
And then the thing that worries me most about Georgia is how they're going to
hit the offensive boards. And I lived in the SEC for 10 years. And when I was
at Arkansas, that was the number one thing that hurt us more than anything was
the offensive boards that the SEC can bring. It wasn't the first shot. It was
always the second and third shot, particularly when you play a Tennessee or a
Georgia.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.  
We're joined by our student-athletes Danielle Adams, Tyra White and Sydney
Carter. Questions?  
  
Q. Danielle, can you talk about what the Sydneys have meant to you and how
they help you on the floor and what you're able to do?  
DANIELLE ADAMS: They're amazing. Carter is the defensive monster. She gets in
them. And Colson is our energy player. When she gets into transition, you've
got to find a way to run with her somehow.  
But these two are great. They're both great on and off the court. Both
hilarious off the court. But they've been a great thing, I mean, a great part
of this team. I enjoy playing with them, and I'm going to miss playing with
them.  
  
Q. Sydney, two-part question. One, just talk about the dynamic in the back
court there, because you're kind of a combo guard and Colson is kind of a true
point guard, talk about how that works. And the second part, just the
recruiting process, obviously a lot has been made of the DeSoto pipeline in
football. Were you aware of that when you were going through the recruiting
process? Do you know any of those guys?  
SYDNEY CARTER: First question, well, I just think that it helps us out a lot
that we both have played the point guard position, because I just moved to the
2 this year.  
But I think it makes her job a little bit easier knowing that I always get
open for her anytime we need to get into an offense or anything like that,
because I know what it's like for her to be pressured up there while she's
dribbling the ball. And another thing it gives us an advantage, because we
have two ball handlers up there.  
And so I think it's just an added addition that, you know, I'm able to shoot
the ball as well as I do. So I just think that it makes it a lot easier, makes
us a lot faster even though we're small but puts some quickness and ball
handling out there and some shooting as well.  
And recruiting, of course, I knew all those guys. I graduated with two, and
the other two before, one of them is dating my sister and the other one was a
real good friend of mine. So I knew them all. Von Miller. He's a part of the
family now.  
  
Q. Danielle, can you talk about coming from junior college and all the
things you went through and now you're here at the Sweet 16 and kind of what
that means to you after your kind of winding past to get here?  
DANIELLE ADAMS: I mean, it was tough. I mean, I went to junior college right
out of high school. I mean, it was a lot of great players in junior college,
but it wasn't nothing like Division I. So when I came here, it was kind of
hard for me. But my teammates are there to just push me every day in practice
and in the extra conditioning, they push me, and I just allow myself to be
pushed because I knew I could be the great player that I am now.  
And just to be here in the Sweet 16 is an honor to me. I've never been here
before. This is my first time. So, I mean, just to be here with this group is
amazing, and it's just an honor, and hopefully we can get further and further.  
  
Q. Danielle first and then Tyra, Coach talked about the lack of a post
presence and how you maybe need to find more balance in the inside/outside
scoring. Could you talk about that and how I guess you've overcome it
throughout the season?  
DANIELLE ADAMS: I mean, well, I'm a post player that can take it inside or
out. And many post players can't do that. So I think I have an advantage. But,
I mean, I do the outside route more than I do the inside.  
But I try to do the inside route more. That's what Coach Blair wants, and
that's what I'm most successful at. So going inside is just what it's going to
be throughout the tournament.  
TYRA WHITE: I think Danielle brings a great presence to us. She can take it
inside/outside, like she said. Through my four years since I've been here we
never really had a post that was really a scoring threat so we always looked
to our wings. So I think with Danielle it helps -- I know it helps me out
tremendous, a lot, just getting me open to score without having so much
pressure on me.  
  
Q. Sydney, what do you think about Georgia's back court, and could you just
kind of size up the matchup, the two Sydneys versus the Georgia back court?  
SYDNEY CARTER: Well, I just think quick is about to meet quick in this game.
You know, they have -- I think the point guard, just watching a little bit on
her, I think I'm going to have a tough matchup, because she can kind of pull
up off the dime. And I think that she does a really good job of running her
team, and I think their guards do a great job of attacking, and I just think
that they kind of play the same style we play.  
And it's kind of -- it's going to be a battle. It's going to be hit to hit.
And, like I said, quick's going to meet quick, and I think it's going to be a
matter of who is tougher than who.  
  
Q. Sydney and Tyra, just talk about how much you've heard Coach Blair this
past week talk about Georgia and keeping Georgia on your mind and not looking
ahead to a potential championship meeting with perhaps Baylor for the fourth
time and how you guys are focusing on that?  
SYDNEY CARTER: I think he definitely started saying that right after we beat
Rutgers. We've definitely been hearing it a lot. But I just think that our
team, it's not too hard for us to do because we all have the same goal in mind
and we all have the same focus to make sure we're not looking ahead.  
And of course everybody wants to get to that game, but we understand from our
maturity that we have to get through one game before we get to that other, and
so do they. So I don't think it's a hard task for us to do to forget about
what game is after this one.  
And we're just doing our best to make sure we're not underachieving and that
we're respecting the team that we have to play, and that's just kind of the
approach we're taking for it.  
TYRA WHITE: We don't want to underestimate Georgia. Coach Blair talks about it
every day, like Sydney said he started talking about it after we played
Rutgers. We all want to get to that game again, but unfortunately we have to
take it game by game. And like my sophomore year we overlooked trying to get
to another opponent and we didn't really get there. So we learned from it,
matured and we just want to take it game by game.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.

_LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA_  
  

STANFORD - 64  
UCLA - 55

  
THE MODERATOR: All right, we've got the Stanford Cardinals. Coach, an opening
statement, and then questions.  
COACH VANDERVEER: There was a gentleman yesterday that asked, do we need a
close game? I worried about that. This was a great game. I just want to first
of all congratulate UCLA for a great season. They had us on the ropes and, you
know, we had to really battle to come back. I'm really proud of our team's
second half.  
I think that our first half we weren't in any kind of rhythm offensively. We
weren't aggressive enough defensively. We weren't doing a good enough job
really in any phase of the game. We were definitely out of sync.  
At halftime we just talked about what we needed to do, and we have veteran
players with Jeanette and Kayla, and Nnemkadi, and they led the way. And we
had some freshmen like Toni and Chiney step up and play for us. I really think
this game will help us a lot, and I hope it helps UCLA too.  
  
Q. Tara, can you talk about Toni's run of ten straight points there? It
seemed to turn things in your direction pretty solidly?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Yeah, I mean, Toni stepped up really big for us. She's
played really well against UCLA last time. I really had confidence that she
could come out with our team in the second half and recognizing what was open.
Toni helped us defensively, her speed, getting out, and getting those lay-ups,
getting to the free-throw line and making those threes. The one three kind of
bounced all around and dropped in for her.  
But she's a big-time player, and she was aggressive. This was a great game for
Toni and for other players on our team.  
  
Q. Did you have a chance to send a few text messages while you were waiting
for that three-point shot to decide to go in? And Coach VanDerveer, how did
you change the defensive structure for the second half?  
TONI KOKENIS: That definitely bounced around like five or six times. It felt
like forever, and I was waiting for it to roll out. But it was kind of nice to
get a friendly roll every now and then.  
COACH VANDERVEER: I think in the second half it helped me to see our offense
in front of us to see what was open a little bit more. We got in different and
better alignments for our team. But I really think it was our defense. I think
people stepped up and got more aggressive.  
We were not handling their pick-and-roll very well in the first half. In fact,
we were handling it horribly. But we started switching more and got our hands
on the ball. You know, this game was kind of an A-typical game for us for some
people for us. It was not a great game for Jeanette, but other people stepped
up. I was really happy to see that.  
  
Q. Could you talk about that run by Toni when she had ten straight points or
something like that? What was it like from your vantage point?  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: I was on defense whenever she'd get a steal or making a cut
on offense whenever she'd get some sort of pass. She had those two threes in
the corner and was being really aggressive on the ball, which produced those,
I guess I want to say maybe four plays. I was really excited, because Toni's
quick and she focuses and listens to what Coach always tells her to do. She
really knows how to help us when she's out on the court.  
I was really proud of her. We definitely needed that run, because they were
taking away a lot of the things that we're good at. They were packing it
inside and she opened things up for us, as well as Jeanette and Kayla. And I
was really excited to see how much she was bringing to the court.  
  
Q. And one other thing, when you talk about packing it inside, they're
obviously a very quick team. But how frustrating was it for you personally
down low when you had all those people around you?  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: It wasn't really frustrating for me at all except in the
fact that we were really trying to figure out what we needed to do on offense.
One thing about our team is we're very versatile. When one thing doesn't work,
we look for another thing. But at the same time we try to get everything that
we're good at to work at the same time.  
Once we started to get the ball inside the way we did that was by O-boarding.
And we did a good job of O-boarding in the second half. It was definitely
frustrating because I felt like there were two people on me at all times, but
at the same time our guards opened things up on the perimeter, and things kind
of spread out from there.  
  
Q. When you were having that scoring run, did you have enough time to think?
Was it just more on instinct? Did nerves creep in at any point?  
TONI KOKENIS: Not really. It was on instinct and just giving whatever I could
to the team and being aggressive. It all started on defense. Great plays by my
teammates who tipped the ball out, and I was just in the right place at the
right time and was able to finish.  
Then just we passed the ball really well on offense, and I got some open shots
and was able to knock them down.  
  
Q. Can you talk about being down at the half like that? I think it was
double digits at one point. What were you thinking because you haven't been in
that spot for a few months?  
KAYLA PEDERSEN: Yeah, I think it's very unusual that we are in that spot. I
don't think that any of us panicked though going into the half. We knew we
were down, we knew we had dug ourselves a hole. It was more of a challenge how
are we going to get out of it, how are we going to fight back, you know? In
the fact half you saw a team that will always continue to fight no matter what
the score is.  
That just increased our aggression. We got a lot of steals. We got our hands
on the ball. We got loose balls. I just think that that fight in us really
brought us through.  
  
Q. In the first half did you feel like your team was impatient and just
settling for threes and not finding a way to get the ball inside against their
zone? Or did you think the ball would eventually just start going down?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Well, one of the things is I think that they were really
clogging things up in there. Almost like Lindy hit a three right off the bat.
But I thought we were not necessarily taking shots in good rhythm.  
But I think that's what they were giving us. I think they had seen Nnemkadi
and Chiney, and Sarah Boothe going five for six, and they said all right,
we're going to pick our poison and live with them, kind of taking perimeter
shots.  
Now they weren't just flat out leaving people, but I really feel like we need
people really recognizing that they are open and shooting in rhythm. Maybe
even right off the bat.  
I don't feel we were impatient as much as not shooting in rhythm and not
recognizing what we need to do. I also think that as the coach I didn't do a
good job enough giving them good alignments to be in. They're a very athletic,
quick team. And you know, we do want to keep working the ball and get it in.
But we didn't do a good job in the first half.  
  
Q. Can you talk about as you move into the tournament how you see it playing
out as kind of a perception that no one can beat the top four seeds? Do you
kind of see it that way?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Are we one of the top four seeds? Okay, yeah, good. I really
hope that on Monday we are given a No. 1 seed. I think we have earned it in
this game. I think UCLA deserves a 2 seed. They really have improved a lot and
they're playing really well.  
I think you just look at the tough game we had. Baylor had a tough game.
Connecticut had a tough game. When you play teams in your league anything can
happen, and they just get you better.  
I don't know that, but I hope that we are able to improve and really play well
in the tournament. But you've got to come out ready to play every single game,
and that is a lesson for our team to learn today, which I think we did.  
  
Q. Was there any point in the game where you saw that No. 1 seed slipping
away?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I wasn't thinking about that at all. I think Kayla kind of
addressed this a little bit. We probably had the absolute worst half, although
I think maybe DePaul, I think we could say that they were head in head going
for the worst half.  
But I think really our team did not panic. They really kept working hard,
talking to each other. I think the run when we came out in the second half, to
me -- to me the first half we boggled. I take responsibility for how we
played. We didn't do a good job. I didn't help them enough.  
The second half we got aggressive defensively. We got the ball inside better,
knocked down some shots. Jeanette hit a couple of shots, and Toni had a big
play for us. I was never thinking about that.  
The seed is not critical anyway. It's more important that you have players
that are healthy and want to play with each other. And what I think you saw
with this game was our players showing a lot of heart. When you beat teams by
20 and 30, a lot of people get in. But we had to dig down and see what kind of
character we had, and I'm really proud of them.  
This is a real big win for our program, and four in a row for Kayla and
Jeanette, and Toni's got the hang of it here. Thank you.

_LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA_  
  

STANFORD - 64  
UCLA - 55

  
THE MODERATOR: We welcome the UCLA Bruins. We've got Coach Nikki Caldwell,
Doreena Campbell and Darxia Morris. Coach, an opening statement and then
questions.  
COACH CALDWELL: First off, I'm very proud of this team. I'm one of the
luckiest coaches in America, because I get to come in and work and work with
some unbelievable people.  
I can't tell you how enjoyable it has been coaching this group, how enjoyable
and how much fun we have outside of basketball. The one thing that I want for
them is just nothing but greatness.  
  
Q. How does a team learn how to win these games and close them out?  
COACH CALDWELL: Play for 40. I think this group did an amazing job, pretty
much for about 32, 33 minutes of the game, and then there was the run, and you
knew it was coming. This group is tough, and they're resilient. But we
couldn't go deep in our bench tonight, and I think that hurt us a little bit.  
I think when you're playing a team like Stanford who has so many weapons --
their ability to shoot the ball from the perimeter, their ability to score in
the paint -- you can't give them both. You've got to be able to take one of
them away.  
I thought in the first half we did a good job of taking away the paint points.
In the second half, they really got on the offensive glass and got some
putbacks. Their defensive pressure fouled up, and they got transition baskets
off of our turnovers. So you've got to take care of the ball, late game as
well.  
  
Q. You said you knew that they would make a run at you. You had a nice lead
at the half and you had them rattled. Did you have a feeling though that they
were not going to go away?  
COACH CALDWELL: They definitely weren't. You knew that they weren't just going
to give in. They've got too much great leadership in Pohlen and Pedersen. And
you know the fight that they have because you know Stanford, and you know
Coach VanDerveer and her competitive spirit. They're not considered one of the
best programs in the history of the game for nothing. So she does something
extremely right, and she does a great job of making adjustments and getting
her team ready to go in the second half.  
But I like the intensity of our group coming out in the second half. I thought
they really stood toe to toe with a very, very good basketball team.  
  
Q. Why was this so emotional for you?  
COACH CALDWELL: These two over here. You don't have favorites. You're not
supposed to have favorites, but these two are two of my favorites probably
that I've coached in my entire career. These two have meant so much. Just
taking on so much responsibility for the success of this program. They've been
very coachable. They've been a joy to be around.  
Doreena doesn't say much, but when she does there's a lot of wisdom that comes
out of her mouth. She talks a little fast sometimes, but we understand her.
Rex is always laughing. Actually, Rex wants to be a rapper in her next life.  
But it's them as people. This journey is short, and we potentially have six
more games. But I know it's coming to an end, so it's a joyful sorrow with
these two though.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about the Stanford bigs and how they just
adjusted well to your style of defense?  
COACH CALDWELL: I thought they really got on the board and we started
overextended a little bit and they were posting really hard in the paint. You
saw the second and third effort of them battling, and to me that fuels a
different type of energy that they had, and it also sucks the energy away from
you when you've played that full clock and we've extended our defense and we
get them to take that contested shot and then they come up with the rebound.
That's definitely an energy boost for them.  
But the Ogwumike sisters are relentless on the boards, and I thought Pedersen
also in there was giving them good looks in the paint as well. But we've got
to be able to, by committee, box people and just try to battle as hard as we
can inside.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the difference that Toni Kokenis made for Stanford off
the bench when she hit the runner and made a couple big threes in the second
half?  
COACH CALDWELL: Well, when you have bench play that can come in and give you
that spark, she's been able to do that for them. She's had great games against
us. She's a very aggressive player as far as offensively because you've got to
guard her off the dribble. She knocked down some big shots for them.  
We talk about this at any given time, your number's going to be called and you
need to be ready to answer the call and she did. Again, the game doesn't know
your age, and she plays much more experienced than a first year.  
  
Q. What was the mindset going into the half? How confident were you that you
could hang on and pull this game out?  
DOREENA CAMPBELL: Well, coming back into the half we knew that the first half
was gone and Stanford was going to make a run at us. So we came out saying
don't look at the score, don't look at the time. Go for 20 minutes and put
everything you you've got.  
COACH CALDWELL: Told you she's a woman of few words (laughing).  
DARXIA MORRIS: Yeah, I agree with Doreena we look at the score and it's
basically 0-0, and we need to play for another 20 minutes and go out and play
hard, and that would stick us into the game.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the tournament, the NCAA Tournament, and how you see
it playing out? Can anyone beat those four teams that are regarded as the top
four seeds?  
COACH CALDWELL: You know, they're pretty tough. I think when you look at
Stanford and them beating Connecticut early on, I think that's a great
indicator of the 1 and 2s that are out there.  
Tennessee's playing inspired basketball right now. It's going to be a great
battle. The thing that I will say about the tournament, I think in the Pac-10
is it has allowed, or I hope we have been prepped enough with the competition
in our conference to help Stanford, help ourselves. Hopefully we get four
teams in.  
When you look at Arizona State and Arizona, you've got great teams in this
conference. We've also fared well against the Big East. I mean, we were 6-2
against the Big East and we've been able to win on the road against that
conference as well.  
When you're looking at those four, they've got go-tos, and they've got some
big time go-tos. Baylor with Griner and Sims, and then you look at Maya Moore,
I mean, at Stanford you can say their roster, the first five.  
Your go-tos have got to play, your bigs. If your bigs don't come ready to
play, it's going to be a long day for you. I think Stanford's got a great shot
at it. They've got all the tools. They've got the players, the discipline, the
heart, the competitive drive, but most importantly they've got the spirit of a
team that's on a mission.  
  
Q. I know both of you were there at Nikki's introductory press conference
when she was hired a few years ago. Can you put into perspective how far this
program has come since that day and maybe why it's gone that far?  
DARXIA MORRIS: Yeah, when Coach Nikki first came in, I was just intimidated. I
was like she came from a top-notch school, especially coaching under Pat
Summitt. But we were excited and just looking forward to meeting her. She knew
what she wanted from this team, but she did a good job, and we did a good job
following her.  
DOREENA CAMPBELL: Yeah, when Coach Nikki came here, she came with a drive and
intensity that we weren't going to take anything less. She came in and
instilled discipline into us and hard work and the belief that we can do
anything, as long as we put the effort in and we put the time in, we can do
it.  
  
Q. Whose cell phone went off in that press conference?  
DARXIA MORRIS: I don't want to say any names. But Coach Nikki wasn't happy
about it.  
  
Q. That was a great coaching job, I have to say, for most of the game not
only did you take away their inside game, but you pretty much shut down
transition. What is the secret or whatever in doing that? Do you focus on
Pohlen? How, exactly, aside from getting back quickly?  
COACH CALDWELL: Well, when we look at their ability to run the basketball at
you, obviously the ball's in Pohlen's hand quite a bit. But the Ogwumike's
take off. They're on a dead sprint. So we wanted to have one pirate pick up
the ball and make sure everybody else was sprinting back. We had an
opportunity to set up our 12 because we were hitting some shots here and
there.  
So that gave us a chance for our full court defense. But to this group's
credit, we went into this game with the same concepts, the same defensive
scheme. They just played it harder. I thought they did a much, much better job
of really trying to close out and keep the ball in front of them. I thought we
battled in the paint for the most part for most of the game.  
But, again, it was their level of intensity and their ability to really pick
up that level of intensity from the last time we played them.

_LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA_  
  

STANFORD  100  
ARIZONA - 71

  
THE MODERATOR: We've got the Stanford Cardinals, congratulations, we have
Coach VanDerveer, Chiney Ogwumike, and Nnemkadi Ogwumike. Coach, an opening
statement?  
COACH VANDERVEER: First, I just want to compliment Niya Butts and Arizona on a
great season, and I hope they're able to play in the postseason and the NCAA.
They have some really terrific players and we got them on their third game in
three days, and I thought they did a really good job.  
But they had trouble guarding Nnemkadi and Chiney inside. Nnemkadi came to
play. She was aggressive. Finished inside really well. And I'm so proud of how
Chiney has improved so much during the year, offensively, has a lot of
weapons, go right, go left, high post shot working for her. She is a worker
and a defender. She really worked hard defensively.  
I think they just brought just great energy to the court. Kayla Pedersen
getting the ball inside. Jeanette didn't have -- maybe an A-game for Jeanette.
But other people picked up the slack really well. I thought our inside
presence was really well. Sarah Boothe coming in going 5 for 6 was really
well. And this was a great game for Melanie Murphy too.  
  
Q. Chiney, during the broadcast when you walked over after you lost your
tooth, I heard you whisper it's the second time. Can you elaborate what was
that about? What were you trying to --  
CHINEY OGWUMIKE: I've been known to get the butt of hits to the mouth, and I'm
not that reliable about putting my mouth guard in, which is bad, but I
advocate everyone wearing it. And I just had a tooth that just got chipped,
and then I re-chipped it again. So it happens. Got a big hit in the mouth.  
But I should be wearing my mouth guard more, which I will. And you guys can
hold me accountable to that too.  
  
Q. Describe how anxious you guys were to start playing today after having a
week off?  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: I think we were very anxious. I wouldn't necessarily say we
had a week off because we've been practicing all week and we've been
practicing really hard. I think everyone's just really excited about
tournament time.  
Everyone came out hard, and I think we were just really ready to go because
Tara was telling us that this is a new season, and we need to define who we
are.  
Obviously, we've had preseason and regular season. It's tournament time now.
If you don't know who you are by now, then those teams aren't really going to
be as successful of down the road. I think we're doing a really good job of
accentuating our assets and just really working hard as a team and
collaborating.  
  
Q. In the second half, you guys have such a huge lead, how are you able to
still be focused and bring that intensity with the huge lead that you guys
accumulated?  
CHINEY OGWUMIKE: I think the ability for our team to play so many people and
to utilize so many players on the court forces us always -- like we look at
another player that we play with, and we're like okay, we have to do well for
them. And everyone brings energy when they come in. And that's one of the
things we've been trying to do is concentrate on every possession. And I was
really proud of how we tried to maintain that concentration.  
Even though we did make some mistakes, we had good moments. And I'd like to
say that everyone on our team had a good moment at some point. It's really a
great effort.  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: Well, I mean, obviously we were up by a lot. But at the
same time we always go into the second half no matter what the score is
thinking that it's 0 to 0. We play like it's 0 to 0. We never let the score
affect us.  
Quite frankly, I honestly couldn't even see the scoreboard, so I think that
kind of helped too. But for the most part we just played hard for 40 minutes.
That's what Coach was telling us before the game. You have to just keep
playing hard for 40 minutes. Nothing's guaranteed. Doesn't matter what your
jersey says on the front or the back, so I think we did a really good job of
just maintaining our poise and playing hard.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little about your three-point shooting? Are you guys
concentrating on getting the ball inside and perhaps giving up a little bit of
that three-point shot at this point? Do you feel like at some point in a few
days you may need that back?  
COACH VANDERVEER: You know, I think that we just try to go with what's
available. I thought people did a great job of getting the ball inside. Kayla
Pedersen with 7 assists, Melanie Murphy got the ball inside really well, 6
assists. We're going to make that pass, and someone like Chiney going 10 for
13 or Nnemkadi at 15 for 22, we're going to take that.  
I have the ultimate confidence in our three-point shooters. And Lindy hit one.
Jeanette hit one. If it's going to be open, they'll knock those shots down.  
But I just think that when you have -- when you can go inside to somebody like
Sarah Boothe, going 5 for 6, why not?  
  
Q. There is still another semi to be played. But if it plays out according
to seed and UCLA advances, can you talk about UCLA and your match-ups with
them this season and what they present?  
COACH VANDERVEER: UCLA has had a great year. I think Nikki's done an awesome
job with her team. They have a lot of weapons with their perimeter game, with
Campbell and Morris, Gardner, they go inside really well with Nyingifa. They
have people coming off the bench. And they're a very aggressive, athletic
team. They play a little bit different style. They like to press and trap. You
have to take care of the ball against them.  
This team, they weren't really extended a lot, but I thought we did a good job
taking care of the ball and making good decisions. Our team is confident
because we've done well in the past, but not overconfident. And we know that
we'll have to board, we'll have to play great defense, and a lot of different
people will have to step up for us.  
I think Nnemkadi would like to play against UCLA. She didn't get to play last
time. So we know we have to play really well against either team.  
CHINEY OGWUMIKE: I agree completely with everything she said.  
  
Q. You weren't able to play in that last game, how would you see it come at
you?  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: I'd be excited whether it's UCLA or Cal. They're both great
teams. But however, if it's UCLA, she's right. I didn't get a crack at them
the last time, and that was a really good game and they're a really great
team. I love playing against people that give us a challenge, and I would love
playing them again.  
  
Q. You mentioned that you hope Arizona could make the tournament. Why? What
do you see there that makes them a tournament team?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I think that Arizona finishing fourth in the Pac-10, getting
those two wins coming into this game, they've got a lot of offensive weapons.
I think Lucet is playing really well for them. Davellyn Whyte is a terrific
perimeter scorer and Ify Ibekwe is a big time player. They don't have a lot of
depth. But in the NCAA you're not playing three games in three days. You're
playing one game and then you get a rest. I think they've earned it.  
I'd like to see a minimum of four teams going, and I think they'd be a good
pick.  
  
Q. You scored the first two baskets. Then did your lens pop out?  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: Yes.  
  
Q. Is that something that happens frequently during games?  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: Actually, yes, I don't know why, for both of us. A lot of
our teammates have asked us what brand we're using, I'm not really sure. But,
yeah, my lens did pop out.  
  
Q. When you put it back in, you talked about your eyesight, was it never
quite good?  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: Oh, no, it was fine. I just had to put it back in.  
  
Q. Are you guys feeding off each other a little bit at this point in the
season? Get started, and maybe Nnemkadi scores inside, and then maybe Chiney.
Is it a situation where you're feeding off each other's energy?  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: I'd have to say yes. It's funny, because I was thinking
about it the other day. It's like when Chiney gets a rebound, and it's like I
get a rebound. When Chiney scores, it's like I scored. We have an a invisible
extension between us. It's a lot of fun to play with her. I'm proud of the way
she's playing and she's having a lot of fun.  
That goes with all our other teammates. This year our team is very special
because we're very close. We're each other's best friends. I guess you could
say, yeah, we are definitely feeding off each other. We give each other energy
during the game.  
CHINEY OGWUMIKE: I agree completely, again. I think sometimes it's just
natural for a sister to look for a sister. I usually know where she is, I know
where she's probably thinking about going. And sometimes that really makes it
easy in the sport of basketball.  
I also consider Kayla our sister because she can pick up on what we're saying
and the communication we have, and basically the rest our team, because we're
all there for each other and we have each other's backs. If one person's
struggling, they always say the right thing to keep them in the game and make
sure our minds are correct. I really think it's the sisterhood of Stanford in
general.  
  
Q. Would you welcome a close game in the final? If you have another blowout,
is that going to put your team in a good, competitive mood going into the NCAA
Tournament?  
COACH VANDERVEER: You know, I'm not going to -- I don't try to script it. The
most important thing for me is that our team stays healthy. That is the most
important thing. Obviously keeping the same attitude that they have. What I
found is that players, if they want to play with each other, they keep it
going. They know that we could only have a total of 7 more games, and you have
to earn each game.  
Whatever the score is, it doesn't matter to me. The most important thing is
that everyone's excited to play, and they stay healthy ask keep improving.  
  
Q. Can you compare this year's squad at this point in the season to last
year's squad at this point in the season embarking on the postseason run? What
do you bring this year that you didn't have last year? What maybe have you
lost?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I think that this is a very different team. Last year at
this time a lot of our offense went through Jane. Jane is a great passer, but
she wasn't even 100%. So we had to figure out how to play without Jane a
little bit in the tournament. And we weren't ready to, nor were we really good
at it.  
This year we have a lot of different weapons, you have Nnemkadi, Chiney, Sarah
Boothe, Kayla, Jos. We have more options. Jeanette maybe struggled a little
bit in the first half, and Melanie Murphy came in and did a great job. Toni
Kokenis, Lindy La Rocque. We just have more options. These are young people
that are really mature. And I think we're a very close team, but we're a very
unselfish team. They will do whatever it takes.  
I think especially young players are taking coaching well. There are some
people that heard some things they didn't want to hear at halftime, and they
came out and responded really well. I think they're just willing to do
whatever their teammates need them to do to be more successful. We just have
more weapons and different weapons.  
  
Q. You set your season high in points of 32, breaking your previous mark of
24 which you had against Arizona earlier in the season. Do you think your
excellent play was because of the match-up against Arizona, or were you just
feeling confident and good about yourself right now?  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: I would have to say that I guess I came out with a more
aggressive mentality. I think they call me the analyzer. I think way too much.
So when you're playing sometimes you just have to play. Not sometimes, most of
the times.  
I was talking to Tara and she was saying that we have to put the hammer down.
I think I assumed that role, and it helped me be more aggressive and more
productive on the court.  
So I'd have to say with the help of my coaches and my teammates I was playing
hard. It's also exciting to play during the tournament. I don't want to make
it seem like I was waiting to play, but a lot of things are going on. You have
to go through the scouting reports and we're practicing hard. There are a lot
of things going on during this time.  
The focus kind of gives you an adrenaline rush. It's also really exciting to
be able to share an experience like this with other people. So I think all of
that mixed together is kind of why our team is playing a little more
aggressively.

_LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA_  
  

UCLA  63  
CAL - 50

  
THE MODERATOR: All right, we've got the UCLA Bruins. Coach, an opening
statement, please.  
COACH CALDWELL: Well, I'm excited for this team. I'm excited that they've put
themselves in a position to play for a Pac-10 championship. Though Jasmine
Dixon didn't have an outstanding game, I thought that these two young ladies
to the right of me really stepped up and did what they needed to do to secure
the win for us.  
These two have been huge, not only players for this program, but they've just
been huge in moving the UCLA program to the level that it is at right now. I
just hope that they continue to play as a unit, and we'll see how far they'll
take us.  
  
Q. Besides getting the victory today, what was the mindset going into this
game, and how were you able to execute your defense so well?  
COACH CALDWELL: Our mindset was, because we've been off since last Saturday,
was to make sure that we came into the game with great intensity. We talked
about you have a choice every time that you step on the floor, and you have a
choice to go toe to toe with your opponent and compete with them at a level
that's higher than them or you can stay even with them or below them.  
I thought tonight, for the most part, our team made the choice to elevate
their play. And they understand that we've got to do it on the defensive end.
They understand that that's who we are, and that's how we get our transition
game going. That's how we get easy looks. That's how on we turn people over.
To me, that's a fun way to play this game.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about how difficult it would be to come back against a
team like yours, just the way you play the kind of controlled offense that you
play? How difficult it is to even chip away at a lead like that?  
COACH CALDWELL: Sometimes it's controlled. Sometimes it's not. Sometimes Do
and Rex will come off with a single ball screen and not make one pass and
shoot it. But they do have the green light to do it. I think for us, because
we eat up a lot of the clock against our opponents, because we extend our
defense 94 feet and we show different looks. Tonight we stayed more to our
one-two-two look.  
But when we're getting you late, 13, 12, to run your offense, to me that makes
a big difference in you being able to come back. Then a lot of teams are not
pressing period in the country. So we're not having to speed up our offense or
we're not even having to take time off on of our offensive possessions.  
We pretty much dictate when we're going to shoot the basketball. Sometimes I
don't want them shooting it that early, it depends on what rhythm we're in.
But I think that has a lot to do with it.  
  
Q. Without getting really technical, you said your defense keys your entire
game. But was it as easy as it looked? You got off to an 11-1 start and then
just for a layman, was it from your perspective as easy as it looked?  
COACH CALDWELL: No, I kind of worry about how much pressure we're going to
bring and how long, because I don't want to wear them out. But because we've
been that way all year, they've been conditioned that way. So when you're
having to go up against traps and bring the ball up 94 feet, don't know when
the trap is coming, or we may get you on reversal.  
I think to me that makes the other opponent very hesitant in their play as far
as being aggressive, because even if you come at us aggressively, that can
still prompt us to trap you. If you're come ago cross half court and we feel
we've got the lanes covered, we'll go then as well.  
So for this team they work hard at it. They work extremely hard at it. Again,
we're not the biggest team in the conference nor in the country, so we want to
use our athleticism. We want to use our quickness and our versatility to make
sure that we're disrupting people away from the basket as much as we can.  
  
Q. Can you talk about match-up with Stanford and what they do and what
you're going to have to do differently to make it a better game and possibly
beat them?  
COACH CALDWELL: It's not what they do, it's what don't they do. They have a
very balanced offensive team. Their ability to stretch you and their ability
to score in the paint. For us, we'll have to really, really focus in on being
stronger and being much tougher than what we've been.  
Obviously, there are certain things in the game that we can't control, but I
do feel that our possessions that we've taken off, a team like Stanford is
going to exploit you and they're going to capitalize on it.  
So we've got to understand that every possession matters. We've got to
understand that defensively you cannot miss your rotation because they'll make
you pay for it. When we're looking to battle inside, it can't just be Jasmine
and T. I mean, Darxia and Doreena, everybody's got to be involved in keeping
them off the offensive glass. We've got to be involved in making sure that our
ball pressure's there so there's not easy post entries. We've got to do things
at a very higher level than what we've done. We're capable of doing it. It's
just a matter of are we going to sustain it for 40.  
DOREENA CAMPBELL: I think Coach is right. We have to play for 40 minutes, and
just play our hardest, you know, and go out there and give it our all.  
DARXIA MORRIS: Yeah, play for 40 minutes, rebounding, make open shots is the
key for us. Just no room for mistakes because Stanford's a great team, and
it's a championship game, so, yeah.  
  
Q. You mentioned this wasn't Jasmine Dixon's best game. Was it just an off
night for her or something that the defense was doing specifically that
contained her?  
COACH CALDWELL: I think for Jasmine, when you're playing teams twice now and a
third time you're going to know they're going to come with double teams and
they know your game. She's got to be more comfortable in the high post area
for us, which is where we're moving her around, because she has that high post
shot. We're definitely giving her the green light to do so.  
Jasmine is a tough competitor. She knows how to win. For Jasmine, this is the
longest and basically season that she's had in her collegiate career. She
didn't really play at Rutgers. Then last year we only had her for half a
season. So now it's a full season for her. We're very conscious of the fact
that Jasmine is basically a year and a half into the league, but she's a
junior. She's really a sophomore in that regard. So she's going to have those
nights.  
At the end of the day we're going to go with Jasmine because she's put us into
this position, and she's a player that's going to compete.  
  
Q. How important was it coming into this game not looking past this team,
knowing that Stanford's pretty much going to be next and that daunting
challenge? How important was it to stay in this game?  
DARXIA MORRIS: It was key. You can't just look ahead of games. You have to
look at what's in front of you. You take a game day by day, you don't look
ahead. We just did a good job preparing for this game. Cal's a good team, and
we did good executing on our offense and defense, so that gave us a good win.  
  
Q. Can you explain how you had been playing at the beginning of the season
compared to how you're playing now individually and as a team? Do you feel
that you're peaking as a team right now?  
DOREENA CAMPBELL: Well, I think starting from the beginning of the season to
the end of the season you're going to have -- you're going to make changes,
you're going to adjust and whatnot. For me, personally, this is it. We're
going to the end now, and every game counts, you know. Every game is that one
last game that you'll remember or whatnot. Why not put it on the line? Why not
give it our all, and that's what I think.  
DARXIA MORRIS: I agree with Doreena too. Coming to the beginning you play
everybody twice. But no matter what you still give it your all. Coming to the
Pac-10 NCAA you're one and out. So basically give it your all and play your
hardest.

_LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA_  
  

STANFORD  100  
ARIZONA - 71

  
THE MODERATOR: We've got the Arizona Wildcats. Coach, an opening statement.  
COACH BUTTS: Well, obviously I want to give a lot of credit to Stanford. They
played an awesome game. You can't say enough about their efficiency
offensively and defensively. I definitely think that they're one of the top
teams in the country. They're definitely hands down the No. 1 seed, and
arguably the best team in the country.  
As for our team, we certainly had a great run, ran into a bit of a buzz saw
today, but I'm proud of our effort. I'm proud of what we did throughout this
tournament and throughout the season. With that being said, now it's a wait
and see game for us, and hopefully we've done enough to get into the
tournament.  
  
Q. Do you think you're an NCAA Tournament team, and if so, why?  
COACH BUTTS: I definitely think we're an NCAA Tournament team. I would say
that if I wasn't a coach on this team, watching our team play. Obviously
today's outing was not indicative of the type of team we are, but we did go
against Stanford. I would argue that Stanford has -- so hopefully we won't be
judged on that, because they've done that to top four, top two, top one teams
in the country. So hopefully this outing has no bearing on how people view us.  
We've won 8 of our last 10 games and been playing really well. We have 21 wins
on the season. There are a couple teams that are being talked about getting
into the tournament who we've beaten, one of them twice. I feel like we're
deserving of an opportunity.  
  
Q. What are you guys doing on Sunday? Are you getting together?  
COACH BUTTS: We haven't discussed that yet. I'm not sure. One thing is we're
going to stay hopeful and hopefully the people that are on the committee or
involved will actually get tapes and watch them, because I think if they watch
the teams that are on the bubble, watch us, they'll see that we're a pretty
good basketball team and deserving to get in the field of 64.  
  
Q. Stanford seemed to take it to you inside. Can you talk a little bit about
that and the players also?  
COACH BUTTS: Well, they certainly inside they have two of the best players,
arguably, at their positions in the country. Both of those young ladies are
number one players coming out of high school and they certainly performed that
way today. So any time you allow players with that ability to get deep
position -- even when we played really solid defense, better offense will
overcome a good defense any day.  
Looking at those two young ladies you should be happy because you're in the
midst of some great players all time in our game. They have potential to be
some of the best in the world, not just our conference, not just the country,
but in the world at their position. They're very, very efficient.  
We didn't have an answer for them today, but no one has really had an answer
for them all year long.  
  
Q. I noticed normally you guys get off to a very quick start. Today you guys
kind of started off a little slow. Do you attribute that to Stanford's
defense, or were you guys just trying to get into a rhythm?  
COACH BUTTS: I think certainly Stanford is a more imposing team physically
than a lot of teams in terms of their size. But they do a good job of getting
back. But I also thought on our end we didn't force the issue early. I thought
we should have done a better job of pushing the ball and forcing the issue.  
At times they seemed to be back, but I still think we had opportunities to
attack them.  
  
Q. You've played two games already. They came in here with a two-game bye.
How much more fresh do you feel they were than you guys were?  
COACH BUTTS: Obviously that's a huge advantage to the 1 and 2 seed. But again
I think the outline of the tournament this year had heed us. I think it helped
us prove that we belong in the NCAA Tournament. Certainly that played a part.  
I think our kids have played hard. We ran the floor in the first two games
tremendously well. Played a lot of minutes. For them to come in with 8, 9 days
off, certainly they had fresher legs.  
But I wouldn't say that that was the overwhelming difference in the basketball
game. They have players that make plays, and they're pretty dang good. So it's
as simple as that. That's why they won the game.  
  
Q. Davellyn, looking forward to the next couple of days, is it going to be
strange to wait or awkward? What do you anticipate the waiting game to be
like? If you guys aren't included in the NCAA Tournament, is the NIT still
better than what you've been doing the last couple years?  
DAVELLYN WHYTE: We're just going to wait until Monday to see how everything
just kind of falls into play. To me it's not a shock because I knew what kind
of team we had, so this was our ultimate goal was to get to post play. Really
it's just something we knew was going to happen and we just hope that it's the
best and that we do get to the big tournament.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about banging with the sisters inside, and what
problems they present to you guys as a team?  
SOANA LUCET: Backing up on what Coach Butts was saying, the sisters are like
-- they're really, really big, and big post players. It was pretty tough. But
once again, even though the outcome didn't go like we wanted, we still went
hard and tried our best.  
  
Q. Can you folks talk a little bit about -- I was impressed by the way you
really kept pushing the ball and fighting right down to the end even though
the score was obviously out of hand at that point. Can you talk about as
competitors how you're able to keep bringing it when there is such a lopsided
score as there was in this case?  
COACH BUTTS: Well, I think the one thing you have to understand, especially
with my personality as the coach of this basketball team, I don't come from a
background where quitting is an option. So not doing those things is just not
optional. For us and our team, they understood the challenge that was in front
of us. We knew it would be tough, but we also know that our identity is not to
quit.  
We push the ball, we run, and we want to continue to do that even though the
score was what it was. We know we're playing a good team, and we didn't come
this far to stop playing now. That was our mentality.

# [PACIFIC-10 CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=PACIFIC-10+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 11, 2011

  

### [Tad Boyle](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21400)

### [Afure Jemerigbe](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21950)

  
_LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA_  
  

UCLA  63  
CAL - 50

  
THE MODERATOR: We've got the California Golden Bears. Coach, opening
statements?  
COACH BOYLE: Just a lot of credit to UCLA. I think Nikki's got them in a great
place just really playing hard and getting ready for a championship game, and
probably a really good run in the NCAA Tournament.  
For us, I thought we had a really good two games coming in. Today, just
disappointed with our effort, and just trying to get our team to compete. It
kind of tells the story of our season how we'll compete and then we shut it
down. Just how to compete day-in and day-out for 40 minutes. I think we have
to learn how to become that team.  
  
Q. It seemed UCLA's press and trapping defense really enabled them to get
out to that early lead. Was that accurate the way the game started for you
getting down 11-1 and tough to proceed from that point?  
COACH BOYLE: Yeah, I think getting down. We talked about the press break, and
people breaking it with confidence. People wanted to be a part of the press
break, and sometimes we had people hide and not flash big. We'll break a
press, and then we just hand the ball to Layshia and expect her to run a play
instead of everybody participating in the runs that you can have. That's what
I'm talking about. It's like everybody's got to want to be a part of that. I
think we struggled there.  
We struggled on the boards. We struggled to make lay-ups. I mean, our
confidence was shook. We're not going to get better looks than right-handed
lay-ups, so we've got to be able to finish. Other people have to be able to
put the ball in the basket for us. I just feel like we played tentative at
times and that press got us rattled. We took the ball down the sidelines way
too much trying to keep it in the middle of the floor.  
  
Q. It has been sort of a season long issue for you. How frustrating is it
that you have some talented players, but to be able to get them to play hard
all the time and after 30 games when you're still not doing that, it must be
maddening for a coach.  
COACH BOYLE: It's my biggest frustration. You know, we have some youth. But
the youth that we have other than the freshmen, they've played a lot of
minutes. They've played a lot of minutes.  
So to understand that to be a championship team you've got to wear that jersey
with pride. You've got to walk into practice every day and compete. You've got
to have a passion for your sport. You have to look at it as an opportunity
that a lot of people don't have. You've got to value the fact that you've been
given the opportunity.  
We're not always on the same page with that. I think that's my biggest
frustration is just wanting this team to die for what they've been given and
to earn it and to work for it and to appreciate it. That is the biggest
frustration as a coach, and I would say probably any coach feels that way that
kind of goes on a roller coaster.  
  
Q. There seemed to me to be a lot of hustle plays going on out there. I'm
wondering if, Afure, you could talk about what it feels like to be in the face
of that constant? I mean, some teams will press for a minute or two minutes,
usually when it's too late in the game. But the constant persistent press, was
it befuddling?  
AFURE JEMERIGBE: Yeah, it was tough. It forces you to, like Coach B. said,
flash and get open, constantly working to be available for your teammates. I
felt like we were just not poised and we hid behind a lot of the UCLA players
and forced Layshia to handle the ball the whole time. It's tough. I think
that's where we lacked a lot.  
  
Q. Stanford beat UCLA by 14 a couple weeks ago without Nnemkadi. How do you
see the final game shaping up? Do you think UCLA has any shot at them? What
are they going to have do to keep that game close?  
COACH BOYLE: Oh, yeah, when you get to a championship game it's anybody's
game. They're completely different teams two completely different styles.
Obviously, UCLA's offense is even much better at this time of the year than it
was at the beginning of the year.  
So I think they have a great defense, and people can knock down shots for
them. How aggressive can they be? How poised can Stanford stay, which they
have been over the course of the year? Who can make baskets? Just contrasting
styles.  
But I think it's a great match-up between two great teams. I wouldn't give the
edge to anybody. I just think that adding Nnemkadi to the mix is huge for
them.  
Stanford's been here many times. They know what a championship atmosphere is
like, and I think Nikki's done a great job preparing her team throughout the
season with the schedule that she's played and the games that she's won, to
earn the right to be there and compete for it.  
  
Q. This third game in three days, is fatigue an issue at all?  
COACH BOYLE: I didn't see my team as tired. I can tell when my team's tired. I
think it was how we started the game and just kind of like we got punched in
the head a little bit and then just deflated. We didn't respond to it. When it
comes easy, we're good. When it doesn't come easy, that's when we have to find
that next whatever it is, the "it" factor that teams have, we need to find the
"it" factor when it's tough.  
  
Q. Could you talk about which teams you think from the women's side should
be coming out into the NCAA and where you believe they should be seeded?  
COACH BOYLE: I don't know about the seeding. I haven't looked at the brackets
like that, but I definitely think Stanford and UCLA. But I do think Arizona
State's earned a bid. USC's had a great run down the stretch here. I know they
lost yesterday, but they've played a really good schedule as well. I think
they've at least got to be on the table for some conversation.  
I think Charlie did a great job this year. I think she won 7 much her last 9
if I'm not mistaken. Going into the tournament we've always played
competitive, so it's always been so close that I would hate for the committee
to look at that as a reason to keep them out.

_NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE_  
  

Tennessee  90  
Kentucky - 65

  
THE MODERATOR: We're ready to begin with Kentucky. We'll take an opening
statement from Coach Mitchell.  
COACH MITCHELL: I want to compliment Tennessee on winning the championship.
What a great performance they had. I want to compliment our players on a
really, really good run after starting our SEC portion of the season 0-2.  
To get to today, they put a lot of hard work in. I didn't give them much help
today with the game plan. I put them in some bad positions in the press. A lot
of that's on me.  
I'm just really proud that our players got to today. Very disappointed in our
performance today.  
THE MODERATOR: Victoria, your thoughts on today's game?  
VICTORIA DUNLAP: We came out strong in the first half as a team. And then just
in the second half we let up and weren't playing Kentucky basketball.
Tennessee took advantage of that. With a team like that, you can't give up
things like, that, especially in transition. They kept going with that.  
The good thing about that is we still have a lot of basketball to play in the
NCAA tournament. We're just get to get ready for that.  
THE MODERATOR: Bernisha?  
BERNISHA PINKETT: We didn't come out and play our best Kentucky basketball.
Tennessee took advantage of that. We still have a lot of practices to go
through to get ready for the NCAA and we're going to be ready when that comes.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Victoria, what happened with your chin? Did you get stiches?  
VICTORIA DUNLAP: No, just Band-Aids. I fell to the ground. My chin hit the
ground.  
  
Q. Talk about their three-point shooting.  
VICTORIA DUNLAP: Well, that's one thing we didn't do well in the first half.
We let them get that going from the very beginning. In transition they were
getting a lot of open looks and they started hitting them. Built a lot of
confidence off of that, kept going. We didn't do any better job of defending
it. It just kept happening.  
BERNISHA PINKETT: Yeah, I just think we wasn't matches up in transition,
letting them get wide-open threes. They was getting excited with it and just
going after it.  
  
Q. Do you think fatigue may have played a part in it?  
VICTORIA DUNLAP: I don't think so. I mean, you can throw any kind of factor
into the game, what might have been happening. We played the same amount of
games they played. I think for us we mentally weren't in it, focused as a team
in the end. We were thinking about what they were doing.  
They were getting excited from the crowd, making shots. We were worried about
what they were doing instead of working about what Kentucky needed to do.  
THE MODERATOR: Bernisha, any fatigue issues tonight?  
BERNISHA PINKETT: No.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
VICTORIA DUNLAP: With a team like that, I mean, the basketball game is made up
of runs. You can't really focus on that. Just focus on the things that we can
control. Just not even think what just happened. Just kind of move forward
from that.  
  
Q. How much did their length and their size inside impact you guys
offensively? Seems like it's harder for you to score against them. I'm sure
that's true for everybody. How much did that affect you?  
VICTORIA DUNLAP: I mean, I guess it can affect a lot of people if you're not
used to that size of play. Tennessee has always had a huge lineup height-wise
over the years. I mean, if you're not used to it, you kind of have hesitations
about when you're going to score, what you're looking at. They kind of have
that advantage over us.  
BERNISHA PINKETT: I mean, they were pretty tall. But if you go in strong and
just be physical, I think you can get in there. You just got to look for the
open guy. If you don't have nothing, just kick it out to your teammates.  
I mean, it was quite -- I don't know what I'm trying to say. It was pretty
tough. I mean, if you just go in strong, I don't think it was that much of a
problem.  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, we'll excuse you and continue with questions for Coach
Mitchell.  
  
Q. Coach, how many ways can Tennessee beat you? Looks like they can do just
what they want to do and oppose their will on other teams.  
COACH MITCHELL: They're a very talented basketball team. I just thought they
played really hard tonight. When they shoot the ball well, to me they have to
have a chance to be one of the best teams in the country. Of course, we don't
see everybody, so I don't want to speak out of turn. But I just can't imagine
when they're shooting like they did tonight that, you know, they're not the
best team in the country.  
So they have a lot of weapons. They're so deep. Their kids come in. I think
coach has done such a great job, Coach Summitt has done a great job of keeping
the chemistry going. A lot of these kids come in and they play varying amounts
of minutes in different games. Seems like she's just been able to really keep
it together. No matter what the situation is, they're able to get a lot of
talented kids on the floor that can play.  
I just think they're very, very good. When they're on like tonight, they're
tough to beat.  
  
Q. When you talked about coaching mistakes you made, were you talking about
matching up in transition on the three?  
COACH MITCHELL: Yeah. I think that early in the game we had the pace going
pretty good, but we just did not rotate out on three-point shooters. You know,
we didn't make a real big emphasis on that. That's maybe where I should have
done a better job as a coach, you know, coming out. By the time we started
trying to make that adjustment, I don't think our kids were really in tune
with that. I just feel badly I didn't prepare them for that particular part of
Tennessee's game.  
But, you know, we had a chance. You think if they're shooting threes in
transition, you're kind of getting the pace going, they miss a few of those,
you can race it back down the court, but they didn't miss many of them. I
didn't think we had them prepared for that part of the game.  
  
Q. A'dia had ice packs on her back the entire time you had her sitting.
Victoria had her chin nicked up. How important is this week off?  
COACH MITCHELL: I think it's good. I'm concerned about A'dia. The MRIs didn't
show anything. The x-rays didn't show anything. That's good. Hopefully we can
get her back spasms calmed down with some treatment. Obviously we didn't have
time to get going there.  
I think when she was in the game, that gives us a better chance to play with
Tennessee. When she's limited to 15 minutes, it's really tough.  
I'm really proud of Megan and Crystal coming in tonight against that
tremendous size of Tennessee, great athleticism. I just thought those two kids
hung in there, especially Cowright there just played real hard.  
Tough night for us. I think the time off would really benefit Victoria and
A'dia, who had had really good seasons in the SEC.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Bernisha, how well she played in terms of trying to
get in the mix and battle.  
COACH MITCHELL: I thought Bernisha had a great tournament. Just proud of that
kid. She has overcome a lot in her life to be at this point in time. She's
developed into a great student, just a really wonderful young woman.  
She played real hard. She had to go at the ball for three straight days
against some of the best players in the country. So I thought she had a great
tournament. Very appreciative of her effort.  
Today you look at six offensive rebounds, she's about a foot shorter than most
folks that are on Tennessee's roster. She was battling in there. Real proud of
her individual performance.  
We just didn't play well as a team today. We just let our offense affect our
defense. It's tough. You shoot 27%, it's just hard to get going. But we have
to find a way. It's remarkable. We shot under 40% in both of the games to get
here. It's pretty remarkable we're here today. It just caught up with us
finally today, bad shooting.  
  
Q. Going forward, how do you prevent the blow-out here from affecting your
mindset?  
COACH MITCHELL: I just told the team back in the locker room, I was very
disappointed in this game today. I didn't want them to think anything but
that. I'm very disappointed that we didn't play better, we didn't compete
better in this today.  
Having said that, we've had some tough times this year. We've had some very
deflating losses this year. And each time this group has been able to bounce
back. So that's just what I shared with them in the locker room. We wanted to
cut down the nets today. We wanted to be the champions today. It didn't
happen.  
Another chance for us to bounce back, show the great character these kids
have. So I don't think we'll have a problem with that. I believe in them.
We'll regroup. We played a really, really fine Tennessee team today that
played really well. There's probably a lot of teams in the country that would
have had the outcome that we fell to today.  
Life is tough. The SEC is a lot like life: it will knock you back on your tail
sometimes. You just have to battle through.  
So I'm not worried about that with our bunch. Our kids have a lot of good
qualities and a lot of character. I wouldn't trade places with Coach Summitt
right now for anything.  
  
Q. At times it was a little bit physical out there. Did that work against
you, given you were the smaller team on the floor?  
COACH MITCHELL: You know, I think that you have to really try to figure out
what you can do to impact the game. I just didn't think we played as tough as
we would need to play.  
When you are a little bit challenged there from a physical standpoint as far
as Tennessee's size and athleticism, you really have to - as we say in
Mississippi - you have to bow up and play a little bit tougher. That was the
thing that was most disappointing to me.  
Once we see it's going to be a tough, physical game, generally we respond a
little bit better. That's a disappointing part of it. I have no control over
anything but trying to get our kids to play real hard. When we don't against a
good Tennessee team, you get a result like today.  
So the physical play, we had a chance to get as physical as them, and we
didn't do it. So that's a credit to Tennessee.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Mitchell, thank you very much.  
COACH MITCHELL: Thank you.

_NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE_  
  

Tennessee  90  
Kentucky - 65

  
THE MODERATOR: We're ready with Tennessee. We'll start with an opening
statement by Coach Summitt.  
COACH SUMMITT: Obviously very, very pleased with the focus that we had coming
into the game, just our intensity overall. You know, maybe a little slow
start. But I thought we picked things up.  
Obviously Shekinna and Angie, they're two key players to this team both on and
off the court. Really pleased with what they brought. Shekinna obviously with
19. Meighan Simmons also came in and did a great job. It was great to see
Angie come in, play loose, knock down the three ball.  
Obviously Alicia Manning, she's the one that will do the dirty work and come
in. I love her game. You know what you're going to get every time she comes
in.  
But great team win. We battled the boards hard. I'm proud for this team.
They've worked so hard to be where they are. They deserve what they got today
because they went after it.  
THE MODERATOR: Shekinna, your thoughts on today's win?  
SHEKINNA STRICKLEN: You know, I think we came out with a lot of energy. We saw
that the game was going to be really physical and we made adjustments. We came
back and were really physical. We were just knocking down shots, getting the
ball to people who was hot.  
Our defense, I think our defense worked pretty well. I think we still could
have did a lot better on blocking out. They got a lot of offensive rebounds.
They really killed us there.  
But overall I think we did a great job.  
THE MODERATOR: Angie, your thoughts on the championship today?  
ANGIE BJORKLUND: Man, I'm just proud of our team. I'm excited that we won and
I'm excited. It's fun to play when you have the entire team coming in with
focus and energy and everyone's going for one goal. If we do that every single
game, I mean, when we get better on the boards, continue to work this week,
I'm excited where this team's going to go.  
THE MODERATOR: Ready for questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Angie, how do you explain shooting like that from you and the team?  
ANGIE BJORKLUND: Man, once we kind of got used to Kentucky, how much they were
pressuring us, we played a lot more composed, we worked the ball. That gave us
a lot of open looks. I think with composure, coming into the game ready to
shoot, I was proud of our team. Everyone was ready to play, ready to knock
down shots, so...  
  
Q. Shekinna, you kind of hit one early and Meighan hit one to start off.
What was working well from beyond the arc?  
SHEKINNA STRICKLEN: I would just say we were in the rhythm. You make that
first one, you just feel like you're going to make the rest of them. From the
get-go, though, we were just pumped and fired up. When Meighan came out, she
came out with high energy. She knocked down the first two shots. So that
really got us going.  
  
Q. Angie, Coach Summitt talks about Glory Johnson setting the tone in terms
of energy. Seems she did this for the entire tournament. Could you comment on
that?  
ANGIE BJORKLUND: Oh, absolutely. I thought Shekinna and Glory, the focus and
energy they brought the first couple games is what got us to this championship
game.  
I give Glory a lot of credit in that. She's always coming in, she's always
going to be aggressive, she plays strong, she looks to score, she looks to
rebound, and also defend. That's what we need from her every time and that's
what she gives us.  
  
Q. Angie, what does it feel like when you guys are shooting the three ball
as well as you did?  
ANGIE BJORKLUND: It's fun (laughter). You know, especially with the crowd that
we had, I mean, it felt like a home game. I mean, I give our fans a lot of
credit just helping us with momentum when we're hitting shots. I mean, we kept
it going.  
It's like Shekinna said, once you hit the first few, you just feel like you
can't miss. We just shared the ball a lot, pushed the ball a lot, broke their
press. That's what got us open looks.  
  
Q. Angie, I think Coach Summitt was singing. Can you critique her
performance?  
ANGIE BJORKLUND: She's got a good voice.  
COACH SUMMITT: I don't know how after all the yelling I've done (laughter).  
ANGIE BJORKLUND: After that game, I don't know if I could sing (laughter).  
  
Q. When you think about all the history of the Lady Vols, to be one of three
teams ever to go undefeated in the regular season in the SEC, then win the
tournament as well, to be part of that history, how does that feel? What does
that mean to you guys?  
SHEKINNA STRICKLEN: You know, it feels great. I think 'cause our class, we
have been through a lot. We don't want to go down in the Tennessee book in a
bad way, but to get in the book in a good way. One, go through the conference
undefeated, then come out winning the tournament, it's a great feeling and I
think we really needed it.  
ANGIE BJORKLUND: Man, this team has worked for it, especially in the off-
season. I mean, with Heather Mason, our conditioning, just getting in the gym.
So I'm just proud of this team. Like Shekinna said, we've been through the
highs and the lows. We don't want to give up. We want another championship.  
  
Q. You went most of the first half with no points in the paint. I think you
got four by halftime. Talk about the different ways this team can beat other
teams, what you have in that arsenal that you possess.  
SHEKINNA STRICKLEN: You know, teams really don't have to focus on two or three
people. Our whole team, you don't know any given night who is going to have
their best night. You don't know if the guards, who was hitting for us today,
or if our postgame is going to be there.  
We strong throughout our whole team. You know, today our shots was falling
outside. But when we needed to go inside, our post did what they needed to do.  
ANGIE BJORKLUND: I mean, we just have such a deep bench. All 13 players will
come in and play. If one person is not having an on-night, someone else is
going to step up. That's what is great about this team. Tonight it seemed like
everyone had an on-night. When that happens, that's when we wins
championships, when everyone comes in and plays like we did today.  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, we'll excuse you, and we'll continue with questions for
Coach Summitt.  
  
Q. Coach, the girls talked about making bad records at Tennessee. When you
were going through that, did you think positively that two years down the road
you'd be sitting here?  
COACH SUMMITT: After the loss to Ball State, no. I still can almost chew on it
every day if I wanted to.  
You know, I think it took something like that to wake this team up, their
youth. Now you look at the experience we have in this junior class, 13
players. You know, they've invested. Heather Mason and her staff have done a
great job off the court. Then on the court, us having Pratt Pavilion is
obviously a tremendous asset to getting in extra shots.  
We have a team, they've bought into what it takes to be a champion. I think
they've held each other accountable.  
When it's not coming from the coach all the time, it's coming from the coaches
at practice only, I just think they're a lot better. Again, with the strength
and conditioning, they've gotten a lot stronger. I mean, this team is strong.
I just give a lot of credit to the people that obviously work with us outside
of our coaches.  
  
Q. When teams shoot as well as yours did today, you usually think of that
team being loose. Kentucky put a lot of pressure on you early in the game.
Does that make you feel good about maybe how this team will respond in the
tournament to come?  
COACH SUMMITT: It does. You know, I think this team, again, they're a very
tight-knit group. We play a lot of different players. There's no selfishness
involved on this team. It's all about teamwork works and everyone wants to be
ready to play.  
That's been a real joy for us as a coaching staff, to just know that we can
call anyone's name at any time and they'll go in and do the best they can do.
If they don't, they come out, they're going to be cheerleaders on the
sideline. Again, I credit that to the overall maturity of this junior class.  
  
Q. Obviously you've been part of many, many big games. Is this as good a
shooting performance, especially from three-point range, as you've seen in a
big game like this?  
COACH SUMMITT: I'd have to go back and do my research. You know, I thought we
played really well, shot the ball well, distributed the ball. Didn't play as
good of defense early on, and I was concerned about that. The ball security
wasn't where it needed to be.  
But once they settled down, because Kentucky was really putting a lot of
pressure on us, but once we settled down, I thought we were in a very good
place. The communication, that's something we talk about all the time. You got
to talk your action. They were doing that. So the communication I think gave
them a lot of confidence and also got them where they needed to be.  
  
Q. Can you talk about what Coach Mitchell has done with the UK program,
making it to their second SEC championship game?  
COACH SUMMITT: Matthew Mitchell has done a tremendous job. I don't know if you
know the history with us. He came and worked our camp. He was late one day. I
told him he was fired. Get out of here. You're late, you're fired. He came
back that afternoon saying, Please give me a second chance. I thought he was
the cutest guy I saw in a long time. You got to love Matthew.  
Long story short, he was a GA that worked in our program. Just what he's done
in a short period of time is pretty amazing. It's hard to do. I think he has
done a great job and obviously has a great staff to work with. He knows how to
hold people accountable, he knows how to teach the game. He's passionate about
it. He loves it.  
I told him before I came in here, I'm just so proud of him, what he's done at
Kentucky. I know they're excited that he's there.  
  
Q. Talk about this team's versatility, being able to beat teams inside,
outside, you name it, you can do it.  
COACH SUMMITT: They surprise me at times. But you never know who's going to
step up on a given day. So the unknown kind of drives me nuts. But overall you
know that someone's going to step up. If someone else is not shooting the ball
well, you know, there will be somebody else that will take over.  
You know, we've got a lot of good shooters on our team. There's no jealousy.
They're just all about team, wanting to win. I just like the place that we're
at right now. I don't think that, you know, who is going to play, this and
that, that's not even an issue. I mean, sure, everyone wants to play. But
everyone has to want to win first.  
  
Q. Have you ever had as many players have the green light from three-point
and beyond?  
COACH SUMMITT: No.  
  
Q. Does anybody not have it?  
COACH SUMMITT: Well, depends on what day it is (laughter). Depends on how
they've been shooting.  
Well, let's say like Alicia Manning, you know, she just now has worked herself
into being able to take that outside shot 'cause she was really a post-up type
player, both offensively and with her defense she obviously is very good. With
her offense, she knew she had to get paint points. Now she is knocking down
some threes.  
So once they show you that they can do it, then I have the confidence. Of
course, Meighan, she's never seen a shot she didn't love, downtown or in the
paint. But I'm glad we got her. She's a terrific guard for us. She's made a
lot of other people better.  
  
Q. Yesterday you talked about how winning today and finishing off this
undefeated conference season was important to you, was a priority. Now that
you've accomplished that and done that, how does it feel?  
COACH SUMMITT: It feels great. First and foremost, I'm just so proud of our
team, you know, proud for the university, our great fans, our administration.
It's just great to the have that level of support.  
But most of all just proud that this team pulled together the way they did.
You know, there's no jealousy. There's great feelings as far as, you know,
being a team that's not jealous. They're all happy for everybody.  
I haven't had many teams that are just happy for everybody. I'm proud of this
team, how they handle it. We got all the administration here, chancellor,
president, Joan Cronin. I'm just fortunate we have such a great support system
for women's basketball. I don't think anyone does it better.  
  
Q. You mentioned different players stepping up. It looked like Alicia
Manning probably played her best game of the year. She had a double-double.
Got any explanation for why she played so well this afternoon?  
COACH SUMMITT: Well, it's not just this afternoon. She's notorious for going
in and being a difference-maker. She has a toughness about her. She'll do the
dirty work. She'll play defense. She battles the boards. She's that utility-
type player that you might not know it till you pick up the stat sheet and you
think, Oh, my goodness, I didn't know she had such an impact. She's done that
in a number of games.  
I know our team has tremendous respect for her work ethic and just the type of
teammate she is.  
  
Q. How rare is it to have a team that's one big happy family? Usually you
have as many players that can shoot the ball, there's not enough basketballs
to go around?  
COACH SUMMITT: Usually you say if I ain't happy, they ain't happy. But quite
honestly, I think they had to grow to get to this point. It didn't start out
that way. It was my turn all the time - not meaning me, but they were all
wanting the ball, not getting enough touches, this and that. That was their
freshmen year, really part of their sophomore year.  
I think just doing a lot of team building with them, which we do, just talking
to them individually, What are you going to bring, making them accountable for
the best things they can bring for this team. Not everyone can bring
everything.  
That's where Alicia Manning, she brings that toughness. She's got a lot of
grit. She's hard-nosed. She plays great defense. Obviously she's doing a
better job on the offensive end.  
We've gone through that with a lot of players. They just have to grow up and
understand there's going to be role players and there's going to be go-to
players. Fortunately we got a lot of go-to players right now. I love it.  
  
Q. With 22 straight wins, a championship in a dominant fashion, could you
ask for any more momentum going into the NCAA tournament now?  
COACH SUMMITT: No, I feel really good about it. Again, we go into it, we've
got to be ready, we've got to be prepared. We got a target on our back. We've
had a target on our back for many years.  
But I think it's giving them some time off, letting our coaching staff get
some game plans. I have a lot of confidence in my staff. A tremendous staff. I
think our team will do what they have to do.  
I'm looking forward to it. I'm excited the first and second round is going to
be in Knoxville, Tennessee. That's a pretty good place for it.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.  
COACH SUMMITT: Thank you. Thank you for being here.

_NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE_  
  

Tennessee  82  
Georgia - 58

  
THE MODERATOR: We're ready to begin with Tennessee. Coach, if you'll give us
your thoughts on today's game.  
COACH SUMMITT: Overall I thought we had great focus, we had a lot of people
step up. I thought our intensity overall, both offensively and defensively,
was where it needed to be.  
You know, we have a lot of respect for Georgia. We knew that it would be a
battle. Obviously, it took us a while to open the game up the way we wanted
to. But a lot of different people stepped up. Obviously, Taber started out
playing well.  
Glory continues to understand how important it is for her to do the job
inside. Does a great job as a post player. Her skill set has really developed
to a great place for her, and obviously it helps us.  
Shekinna did a good job. I just think a lot of different people. Certainly
Meighan came in and did well. I don't know why I have to tell Angie to shoot
the ball. Obviously, she's feeling a lot better. With her being better, that's
a good thing. Getting Vicki good minutes, wanted to do that, as well as Kelley
Cain.  
A lot of people came in and did some good things for us. I think the depth
overall of our team is one of the strongest things that we have going for us.  
THE MODERATOR: Glory, your thoughts on today's game?  
GLORY JOHNSON: I think we came out strong. We brought the energy from the
beginning of the game and finished it pretty strong. Just working our five
defense, switching up defenses, going to zero, going to 2-3, that helped a
lot. It kind of shook up Georgia a little bit.  
I think we played hard. I think we communicated a lot better on defense today
rather than yesterday. We were all on the same page, and that helps to
maintain success. I think we've got to keep that up.  
THE MODERATOR: Meighan, your thoughts on today's victory?  
MEIGHAN JOHNSON: I think we played extremely hard today. We learned from a lot
of mistakes we made from the previous game. Pat was talking to us to say, You
can't just arrive in this game, you have to be prepared for everything, any
challenge that comes towards you.  
I think we communicated a lot better today. We played Tennessee basketball. We
didn't play down to our opponent. We just kept the pedal to the metal and kept
going.  
THE MODERATOR: At this point we will take questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Meighan, coach was talking about watching a lot of video with you this
morning. What was the focus of that video session and what did you get out of
it?  
MEIGHAN JOHNSON: I think the focus of that video session was her explaining I
can't just ball watch all the time. I have to be in a stance 24/7. I have to
know where the ball and my man is at all times.  
  
Q. Meighan, yesterday you told me you weren't so comfortable. You said
things would be better today. What was the comfort level for you today?  
MEIGHAN JOHNSON: I just think I got good rest last night. Of course, I wasn't
so focused on my ankle today. I just wanted to go out and play hard, get my
teammates involved, learn from the mistakes I made yesterday, from the film
session. I didn't want to let my coach or my teammates down.  
That's just a part of the process: you have to learn from your mistakes and
move forward.  
  
Q. Meighan, coach said yesterday she wanted to see more from you. Was there
added pressure when you came in today? Did you feel differently than when you
came in yesterday?  
MEIGHAN JOHNSON: Yeah, there was a lot of pressure yesterday. I've never been
in the situation. But I think the second game, my mindset just totally
changed. I just have to go out there, play my game, not be intimidated by my
opponent, listen to what the coach has to say because she knows what is best
for us. Just go out there and play hard.  
  
Q. How good is this team right now and how good can you be?  
GLORY JOHNSON: I think we're at a level where each and every game we learn
something different about ourselves, along with the team. We learn things that
we need to improve. As far as communication, we have to maintain communication
on offense and defense just to avoid confusion on both ends of the floor.  
When we do that, even though we mess up, as long as we go hard and we bring
the energy, we can mess up here or there, still make up for it as long as
we're communicating and having each other's back.  
I feel like we can go so much further. You learn something new every day,
every practice, every game. Everyone has room for improvement. I think it
shows within our team. I think we're still at a high level. We can just go a
lot further.  
MEIGHAN JOHNSON: I think this team can be a very great team. I think we're a
national championship team. I just think as far as, you know, everybody's
mindset has to be on the same page. We have to want to go out there and win
and fight for the national championship. Like we've always been talked to
about, Well, where you want to be later on in the season? Well, we want to be
there.  
I think everybody's mindset now that we're in the SEC, we have a point to
prove, and we have to get past the SEC in ordering to go the NCAAs.  
  
Q. Glory, as a veteran player, can you empathize with the situation with
Meighan where she comes in as a freshman and play a prominent role,
particularly point?  
GLORY JOHNSON: She has a huge role for our team. She's at a position where she
has to pull the whole team together as the point guard. She's the one that has
to lead communication. She calls the plays. The coaches communicate through
her to get to us on the floor.  
I think she stepped up this game. Coming in first game SEC, you never know
what to expect. As a player, you want to play your role. You don't want to do
too much. You want to be there for your team however you can. I think she's
getting there.  
Her confidence is back. When we talk to her, we bring the energy, you can see
it in her. We just want to maintain confidence throughout the whole team and
make sure that she's looking positive all the time no matter what. Turnover,
forget about it. Move on to the next play. As long as she's doing that, she's
fine, as you saw today.  
  
Q. Glory, how hard is it to keep the intensity level up when your opponent
is struggling?  
GLORY JOHNSON: As long as we're talking to each other. We're messing up, too.
Might not look like it, but we are messing up, too. We'll just make up for it.
We have each other's back. It looks like we're trying to be on the same page.  
As long as we keep communicating, like I said before, it keeps us focused and
making sure that we're doing the right thing the next play.  
On offense we're going to try to work the ball, hit the hot hand. On defense,
we're going to try to switch faster, get steals. We're not getting as many
steals as we want or, we're not pushing on transitioning and getting as many
layups as we want to. We're working on it.  
It's not a point where we're playing against Georgia just to play against
Georgia. We're playing against ourselves, too. Every game we're trying to get
better, no matter the opponent.  
  
Q. Glory, the past two days you missed a lot of open layups.  
GLORY JOHNSON: It's just focusing, something that we are still working on
every day, like I said before. That's just focus. Going a little too fast when
you have wide-open layups like I had today. Just slow down. A layup is
something we make every day in practice. Something we know we can do. Focus on
the finish, that's all you have to do.  
  
Q. Meighan, Glory was referring to your confidence, That it's back. Has it
waned in the last few games? Did you have a drop-off in confidence?  
MEIGHAN JOHNSON: There was a moment of time where I felt I could have gave
more. Even though my team said I did a good job. Sometimes I get hard on
myself. I say, I could have did this better, I could have did that better.  
My confidence is slowly starting to come back. I'm starting to feel more
comfortable with my teammates encouraging me, film sessions with Pat, all the
assistant coaching there encouraging me no matter what, keep working hard,
pushing forward.  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, we'll excuse you. We'll continue with questions for
Coach Summitt.  
  
Q. There seemed to be a difference in play from Glory's first and second
half. What did you see?  
COACH SUMMITT: Just encouraged her to, you know, really battle on the inside,
to get touches. You know, she's a tremendous athlete. But sometimes, you know,
she'll go and play, and you're thinking, What did she accomplish? Just
challenging her to really, on both ends of the floor, be very focused.  
I think she's doing a much better job at using the glass. I think she has a
lot of confidence in the paint. She likes to step out, shoot the three ball
occasionally. Not happening anymore, not this year, not on my dime. I think we
got that squared away.  
But you're talking athletic and someone that really makes a difference on the
defensive end, as well. She can create a lot of havoc for the opposing team.  
  
Q. I remember at the beginning of the year talking to the girls. They said
more so than in years past they're joking and laughing. This is a team that
always has fun. I know you mentioned their maturity. Have you noticed a change
in camaraderie?  
COACH SUMMITT: I think so in the fact that they all get along with each other
and they like each other. I haven't had a lot of teams that got along with
each other and liked each other to the extent that they do.  
But I think if you look at it, just the maturity of our team, how long they've
been together. I mean, Meighan is a new kid on the block. I'm sure at times
when she came in, she was thinking, Oh, will I ever get it? They've really
brought her along. I think that's where she feels a lot better. Kamiko is more
confident. It is a team that's really like family.  
I've enjoyed, really enjoyed, the opportunity to travel with them and listen
to them. I mean, they'll work hard. But off the court sometimes they can be a
little crazy. That's when I go to my room.  
  
Q. Talk about where this team is now. How far can this team go?  
COACH SUMMITT: I think this team can win a championship. There's no doubt in
my mind. But in order to do it, you can't have an off night. So the one good
thing is I go back to our depth. If someone is having a bad night, then
somebody else has to step up.  
Fortunately, with the depth of this team, this junior class in particular, I
think that keeps the coaching staff with a lot of options.  
I think every player is really invested in trying to win a championship.  
  
Q. Talk about your zone, how long and strong you guys are, especially
inside. Not much air in there.  
COACH SUMMITT: Well, the one thing that I think has been a great benefit for
us, whether we're in our zone or in man, but particularly when we are in our
zone, we can go really big. It's hard for people. A lot of teams will choose
to try to shoot over it as opposed to attacking it. I think that works to our
favor.  
But, you know, it's been great. It's been really great for us. We've used it a
lot. We've certainly used it against Georgia when we played Georgia at home.
We've used it just about every game. We'll mix up, you know, whether we want
to play zone or man. We'll mix it up and come out of timeout so we can keep
people off balance from that regard.  
  
Q. Pat, obviously you want to win every game. Winning the conference
tournament is important. Does it really mean more or extra to be undefeated
throughout the whole conference season? Is that something that is really
important to you, other than the obvious?  
COACH SUMMITT: Never thought about it because didn't even think, you know, we
need to do this. It was just one game at a time.  
You know, I think our team was very focused on trying to go through our
conference undefeated. I don't think our coaching staff really thought about
it. It's one day of practice at a time and one game at a time.  
But as we got closer, I didn't want to lose. You know, I started to feel my
hands a little sweaty when I was coming to the gym, because I thought, We've
gone this long, we don't want to lose. I think it's something special. It came
from this team. The coaches can only do so much. But they're the ones that
said, We're going to get this done.  
  
Q. Now that you have a chance to cap it off, is there that sort of light at
the end of the tunnel? Does it mean that much more to know you're one win away
from finishing the whole thing off?  
COACH SUMMITT: It's on all of our minds, in our hearts. That's what we want to
do. I'll be disappointed if we don't do it. It's not the end of the season,
you know, overall. But, you know, hopefully we've got more games to play ahead
of us.  
I know that it's a priority for this team, and I know it's certainly a
priority for this coaching staff. I have a feeling it's a priority for all of
our fans and the chancellor and the president. Everybody sitting in this room.
I'm like, Oh, my goodness (laughter).  
At least they're smiling. Got the governor the other day. He spoke to the
team. It was great.  
THE MODERATOR: Congratulations, Coach. Best wishes for tomorrow.  
COACH SUMMITT: Thank you.

### [Jasmine Hassell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21800)

### [Andy Landers](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13868)

### [Porsha Phillips](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21797)

  
_NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE_  
  

Tennesssee  82  
Georgia - 58

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Georgia. We'll turn it over to Coach Landers
for an opening statement about today's game.  
COACH LANDERS: Well, there's not a whole lot that you can say other than they
whipped us. You know, we, for much of the day, did some of what we needed to
do. But when you have breakdowns doing what you need to do to be successful
against a team as good as Tennessee, you pay for those.  
I thought our inability to box out particularly Glory on the offensive board
and Stricklen early on the offensive board, really created problems for us.  
Even in the second half when we had gotten it to 12. We let that happen again.
Our inability to get up and defend the three hurt us. You know, I mean, they
play with a lot of enthusiasm, a lot of tempo, aggressiveness. Whipped us.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll have opening statements from our student-athletes.
Porsha, your thoughts on today's game?  
PORSHA PHILLIPS: I think Tennessee came out with a lot of energy tonight. I
think we gave up a lot of three-point shots. We gave up a lot of offensive
rebounds and offensive put-backs.  
THE MODERATOR: Jasmine?  
JASMINE HASSELL: I agree with Porsha. I feel like they got a lot of offensive
rebounds. The three-pointers killed us. They just wanted it more than we did.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll have questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Especially in their zone, how long and how strong are they inside?  
JASMINE HASSELL: They're big, but they're easy to steal, you know, just going
in there and finding them. It's not really a big deal. They just execute on
the offensive end.  
PORSHA PHILLIPS: I think Hassell did a great job tonight putting her body into
them, scoring, finishing the shot. I think that helped us a lot.  
It wasn't enough. We should have posted up harder and been more physical.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the first few minutes of the game. Were your struggles
coming from what they were showing you on defense, or was it just you weren't
quite settled down yet?  
PORSHA PHILLIPS: I don't know. I think we wasn't very comfortable in the
offense yet. We didn't settle down. I think we didn't keep up the offense as
fast as we could.  
JASMINE HASSELL: I felt like it wasn't our offense. I think the defensive end,
they got like two offensive put-backs and on open three. I think that killed
us because we were playing the defense, but we wasn't blocking out. They got
the rebound and put it back in.  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, we'll excuse you and continue with questions for Coach
Landers.  
  
Q. Andy, you've seen Tennessee teams a lot over the years. Where do you
compare this team? How far do you think they can go?  
COACH LANDERS: Well, they're one of the most talented basketball teams in the
country. You know, they may be the most talented team in the country.  
But when you say 'compare them,' I'm sure Pat could do that much, much better
than I could because she works with them on a day-to-day basis. What you see
when you go watch a team play doesn't always tell the whole story.  
I don't know how they're woven in terms of their work ethic and their
toughness. I wouldn't have a clue. Pat would have to compare them to other
teams.  
On the surface, I mean, you go down through the roster, is there anybody
that's got more good players than that? I don't think there is.  
  
Q. Andy, can you also talk about the first few minutes of the game, what you
thought.  
COACH LANDERS: I saw what Hassell saw. I saw us be reasonably good
defensively. We still gave up shots, but we didn't box. I know Stricklen ran
right by us from the corner right in front of our bench - which would have
been right side corner right to the front of the rim - got an offensive
rebound, put it back. I mean, just ran right by us. I think that was like the
second possession.  
Then the next couple possessions, I think it was Johnson, same thing. We
didn't box. You know, the tough thing about that, I mean, they're not going to
be easy to box. I mean, I know they're quick. I got all that. That's not what
bothers me.  
The tough thing about what bothers me about not boxing them out is you work on
box-outs almost every single day for this. You know, you don't have to box the
bad teams out to beat 'em.  
But if you have the habit of boxing, then when you get to this, you're in a
much better place. That's what concerns me about our team.  
But you're not interested in our team, you're wanting to know more about
Tennessee. Go ahead.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you.  
COACH LANDERS: Thank you.

_NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE_  
  

Kentucky  69  
Vanderbilt - 56

  
THE MODERATOR: We're here with Kentucky. We'll take an opening statement from
Coach Mitchell.  
COACH MITCHELL: Just a tremendous win for us today. I'm so proud of our
players. Turned in some unbelievable defense today against a really good
Vanderbilt team.  
To be in the finals for the second year in a row and able to be right where we
intended when we left Lexington for Nashville, in the finals, I'm really proud
of that.  
We're excited to play tomorrow. I thought these two young women that are up
here on the podium with me were absolute warriors today. You can tell by their
rebound numbers that it was a great day for those two young women.  
So really proud of our team. We're excited to be in the finals tomorrow.  
THE MODERATOR: Victoria, your opening thoughts on today's game?  
VICTORIA DUNLAP: I thought we definitely came out really strong in the first
half as a team. A lot of defense, pressure, intensity. We played really well
in the first half. We ran the plays where we expected to be, like coach said.  
We're just ready to play tomorrow in the championship.  
THE MODERATOR: Brittany, your thoughts?  
BRITTANY HENDERSON: We knew it was going to be a rough game on the boards and
things like that. We took a couple punches, and we gave some back, and we came
out with a win.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Brittany, you said it was going to be a battle. Knowing that coming in,
did you know you were going to be really aggressive or...  
BRITTANY HENDERSON: We knew it was going to be aggressive. We know Tuomi is a
great physical player. Also No. 34, Clarke. We had to battle. I knew it was
going to be tough on the boards today.  
  
Q. Why do you think your full-court pressure gave Vanderbilt in particular a
lot of problems?  
BRITTANY HENDERSON: We know that nobody likes pressure, so that's our mindset,
just going in, pressure, getting turnovers, getting points off of turnovers.  
VICTORIA DUNLAP: That's our game plan for games, we go in with a lot of
pressure, a lot of intensity. Just from previous times, it's expected for us
to have a game like that.  
We know last time we played Vandy we had a lot of pressure, so we had to have
the same mentality and pressure on the court.  
  
Q. Can you talk about how much different the start of this game was compared
to yesterday?  
VICTORIA DUNLAP: We just had a lot more intensity coming out. Coach got us
excited in the locker room. Just told us that it was about us today, giving
our best effort. We had to know as a team we had to go out there with a
Kentucky mindset of playing hard, up-tempo defense. We got it done. It started
there.  
BRITTANY HENDERSON: We know we have to come out with a lot of energy the first
four minutes. I thought us coming out, bringing energy the first four minutes
kind of led into a great first half.  
  
Q. To score 22 in a row, what was that like?  
VICTORIA DUNLAP: It felt good just to know that especially our defense is what
was getting us the points. We've worked on defensive fundamentals so much in
practice, when you play intensity like that, you just know that we're going to
get points in transition and on offense, being comfortable with ourselves.  
BRITTANY HENDERSON: We know we had a 22-point lead. But coach was telling us
in the timeout, Don't worry about the score, keep fighting, keep getting
turnovers, keep being scrappy with them. So that's what we did.  
  
Q. When they cut it to 8 in the second half, were there any big worries at
that point?  
VICTORIA DUNLAP: There weren't any worries. I think we were really not focused
as a team and together on the court. There was miscommunications on a lot of
things. We just knew we had to stay together as a team and just know that what
we were doing with our fundamentals had to get better and we just had to stay
focused.  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, we'll excuse you and continue with questions for Coach
Mitchell.  
  
Q. Coach, what is the status of A'dia?  
COACH MITCHELL: She took a charge back in the Arkansas game and bruised her
back. It's right down in the small of her back where her back ends and her hip
starts. It's been real painful for her. She took a charge early on. It just
started tightening up. It just got progressively worse.  
So we think she'll be checked out right now. When we had her out of the game,
we didn't have any intention of not putting her back in. But then we had the
game in hand, we thought. Then once she had stayed out for an extended period
of time, she really got tightened up. It was a situation where she couldn't
come back in.  
So we don't know anything that would prevent her from playing tomorrow, but
we'll just have to see. We're trying to be as cautious as possible with her
health obviously.  
But it's a contusion. That's all we know right now. She's going to go for an
x-ray to make sure that there's nothing structurally wrong there. So we'll
keep everybody up to date on that.  
  
Q. As far as the difference between halftime yesterday, the message was a
lot different. What did you say to them when you were up 22?  
COACH MITCHELL: Well, we were excited about the defense at halftime, but we
had just gone in and tried to talk to them. The danger with this team is that
we lose intensity. We gave up a three right there at the end of the half.  
We tried to talk about that play. That's the kind of play that can hurt us and
let Vanderbilt back in. 22 points or even 27 points, as you could see today,
was not safe.  
Anytime a team can drive the ball as well, post up as well, shoot threes as
well, they're so explosive offensively, you don't feel as a coach they're ever
out of it.  
We just tried to talk about we would love to see the same kind of intensity
and win the first four-minute segment; we did that. We won the second four-
minute segment and were really feeling good. We thought if we could win the
third one, it would be just outstanding.  
We were just talking about staying with it and trying to play really tough
defense like we had in the first half, which was a really incredible defensive
performance in the half.  
  
Q. Victoria said you got them fired up before the game. What did you say?  
COACH MITCHELL: I didn't say a whole lot differently. I just talked to them
about how special it is to play at Kentucky. As we were driving back from the
shoot-around today, you see all the Wildcat fans out in the street, a lot of
people had given a lot of their money and time to come down here. And the
reason they did is because they're excited about the way our team plays, and
the players have created a lot of excitement.  
I just wanted them to understand that they're part of something real special
right now that's happening at Kentucky. The way we could go out there and show
everybody how much we appreciate that is to play Kentucky basketball with a
lot of passion, a lot of enthusiasm. And I thought that they came out of the
gates like that.  
But that's nothing that I haven't told them before. You'll have to check with
Vick if there's anything different or special that was said today. It's always
to me about the players. It's not about the coaches. It's about the players.
And when this group makes up their minds they're going to play with a lot of
passion, a lot of intensity, play Kentucky basketball, they are awfully tough.  
  
Q. You don't have much time to celebrate. Talk about the next game, the
matchup with Tennessee. And talk about Brittany today.  
COACH MITCHELL: Really proud of Brittany Henderson. I thought she was one of
the keys to us having a successful day. I didn't know how many she had as far
as rebounds go. I just knew that early in the game, there were a lot of tough
plays. I felt like there was a lot of contact on rebounds early in the game,
and she was coming out of there with them. That made me excited, because that
is where she needs to be.  
Obviously 18 boards in one game is unbelievable. But just her mindset allowed
her to do that. She was tough and tenacious today. I can't say enough good
things about her performance. Really happy that she played so hard. We'll need
something like that from her tomorrow.  
The matchup tomorrow, we have a very, very tough opponent that we had a
tremendous game with in Lexington. They are a very talented team. They are a
team that poses you a lot of challenges.  
We came down here with the goal of winning this tournament. You know, as a
coach, I figured that if we could get to Sunday, I figured we'd see Tennessee,
and that's what's happened. We will try to get back to the hotel and get
ready.  
Have to rely on our defensive fundamentals, what we worked so hard for to get
to this point, turn it loose, give it everything we have tomorrow, see if we
can be the champions of this great, great tournament that I love so much.  
  
Q. 12 turnovers in your first game here, then only 13 tonight. Can you
discuss your ability to take care of the ball?  
COACH MITCHELL: Well, I think that is really, really key for us in a lot of
areas, is to try to out-hustle a team. That's a lot of the hustle plays, loose
balls, taking charges, things like that. We did a lot of that today.  
I think that the rebounding battle is really, really important. Looks like
they won that by one, and won that by two yesterday. So that was important.  
Then the turnover battle. When we can get to plus 10, plus 12, that's a great
day for us. Our goal is always 25 turnovers and 25 points out of that. Looks
like we hit the 25 and got 27 points.  
The turnover battle I think in the Southeastern Conference is one of the three
main keys you have to pay attention to, and we've done a good job the first
two days. We'll need to do that tomorrow.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about that game in Lexington with Tennessee. Do
you have some confidence going into tomorrow, playing Tennessee as close and
as well as you did in Lexington?  
COACH MITCHELL: That was a really tough basketball game. Both teams played
hard. We certainly had a chance to win there at the end.  
It's been a few weeks back. Our players need to have confidence because they
worked so hard to get themselves into this position, and they now have an
opportunity to compete with Tennessee again. We need to have a different
outcome this time. We need to win the game.  
I know it would mean a lot to those players back in the locker room to do
that. So we definitely know when we come with the right mindset and we do what
we do well, we can beat anybody. So that's what we have to come to the gym
with tomorrow.  
  
Q. Were you surprised how effective the full-court press was?  
COACH MITCHELL: I think you're always, as a coach, planning, especially in the
semifinals of the SEC tournament, for a real tough, close game. I don't know
if 'surprise' is the right word. But I was very, very pleased that our
pressure was causing them problems, because that's what we have to do against
a team like Vanderbilt. We cannot let them comfortably run their stuff because
they're so good at that.  
So our only option against Vanderbilt is for our pressure to work. So we
worked really hard on it all year long in practice day after day. And so just
really pleased that it worked.  
But, you know, I may be wrong on this. I never go in expecting for something
like that to happen. You're just trying to get yourself prepared for close,
tight situations. I just thought the performance in the full-court press, when
we really had our starters in there going, was one of the best we've seen all
year. It was a great, great effort by our kids.  
  
Q. Coach, how do you think Crystal played?  
COACH MITCHELL: I thought Crystal had a terrific game. I thought Crystal was
very good in the first half. That duo worked well together. Both of those kids
need each other to play their best.  
And, as you saw, when A'dia went out and Crystal had to go those extended
minutes, that puts her in a situation where she gets a little bit tired and
doesn't play her best.  
So when we have both of them going and she plays the way she played today, it
really excites me about the future of this basketball team. I think that she
has made unbelievable strides over just the last two weeks. So I'm real
excited about the way Crystal Riley is playing.  
  
Q. Earlier this week you talked about making it more about what Kentucky
does.  
COACH MITCHELL: You focus in on your fundamentals, what your principles are.
It's going to be a very, very simple game plan tomorrow. I tell our players
all the time, Don't confuse simple with easy, because it will not be easy
tomorrow.  
But we will have to work extremely hard to try to pressure Tennessee and try
to make them uncomfortable in their offense. And then the big, big key is
working hard to compete on the boards.  
We need to really bow up tomorrow and win the battle of the boards. When you
do that, you have an opportunity to win in those three areas I talked about:
the hustle, the rebounding, and the turnover battle.  
It's Tennessee. They're really talented. It's going to be tougher. It should
be in the SEC tournament finals. It should be a tough, rough game. And that's
what we need to be ready for. I know our team will be.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much for your time.  
COACH MITCHELL: Thank you.

# [SOUTHEASTERN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=SOUTHEASTERN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 5, 2011

  

### [Melanie Balcomb](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13863)

### [Tiffany Clarke](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21798)

### [Hannah Tuomi](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20534)

  
_NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE_  
  

Kentucky  69  
Vanderbilt - 55

  
THE MODERATOR: We have Vanderbilt. We'll start with an opening statement from
Coach Balcomb.  
COACH BALCOMB: This was a tough one. I didn't see this coming, the start. You
know, I think I have to give credit to Kentucky. They came out so energized,
physical, and just really put us on our heels right away, which we should have
been ready for after playing them twice. We didn't respond well.  
The second half, you know, when our backs were against the wall, we're a
pretty good team. We fought back. I'm proud of our effort in the second half.  
THE MODERATOR: Hannah, your opening thoughts on the game?  
HANNAH TUOMI: Just like coach said. We definitely didn't come out in the first
half ready to play. We let them dictate us, be aggressive. We didn't go after
it.  
In the second half, we came out and put up a fight. But it obviously wasn't
enough to get us out of the hole that we dug in the first, so...  
THE MODERATOR: Tiffany, your thoughts on the game?  
TIFFANY CLARKE: This was a tough one. Like they said, we didn't come out ready
to play. They were definitely a lot more physical and more energized than we
were. Obviously, it hurt us.  
We came out second half with more energy, more intensity, more focused, but it
was too late. And, yeah.  
THE MODERATOR: At this point we'll take questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Why do you think it took you so long to come out with that energy?  
HANNAH TUOMI: I'm not sure there are any excuses. We played Kentucky twice
before in the regular season. We knew how they played. We knew their
personnel. They just came out ready to play and we just didn't, so...  
The better team that shows up that night, at that game time, wins, so...  
THE MODERATOR: Tiffany, your thoughts?  
TIFFANY CLARKE: Pretty much what Hannah said. There's not an excuse for it. We
just came out flat. We didn't come out ready to play. Don't know why. We knew
what to expect. We knew what they were going to bring to us. We didn't react
to it or we didn't initiate anything.  
  
Q. The late night wasn't an excuse. Can you give me any positives that you
saw in the second half that you want to hang on to and build from?  
TIFFANY CLARKE: We definitely fought back and became the aggressor in the
second half. We were more physical, attacked more, got to the free-throw line.
First half, I don't think we went to the free-throw line at all. Second half,
we definitely were the aggressors.  
It was a little too late for it to happen. But that's a positive.  
HANNAH TUOMI: Yeah, in the second half when we got the ball we were ready to
attack. We drove, kicked, hit some shots. That was definitely a positive half
that we came out ready to play.  
Like we all said, we knew that in the first. You need to put 40 minutes
together, not just 20, to win a game.  
  
Q. How defining was it for you guys as you got closer to miss some of those
free throws?  
HANNAH TUOMI: No answers. We've been here. We played on this court the night
before. Just a lack of focus, I would say. A lack of focus on putting the ball
in the hoop, relaxing, slowing down, all of those things.  
THE MODERATOR: Tiffany, your thoughts on the missed free throws?  
TIFFANY CLARKE: I think it was just a tightness and overthinking. Free throw
is a lot of mental. I think when we overthink them, that's when we miss them.
I think that's what happened.  
  
Q. Looking ahead to the NCAAs, do you have any ideas?  
HANNAH TUOMI: We'll see, you know. It will all unravel here at the end of all
the tournaments, so we'll see.  
TIFFANY CLARKE: Yeah, I don't know where we'll be. But hopefully we're in
there and hopefully we definitely put 40 minutes together when it really
matters, 'cause that's when it's one-and-done time.  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, we'll excuse you and continue with questions for Coach
Balcomb.  
  
Q. Coach, did you feel like you would be able to handle the full-court
pressure this time?  
COACH BALCOMB: Yeah, I did. Like I said, this one caught me off guard. Had two
point guards on the floor. We talked about our game plan, what we wanted to
do, but we didn't really go out there and do that.  
I think there was just a lot of unsure hesitation caused by the aggressiveness
and Kentucky's defense. They put us on our heels, and we didn't execute what
we had worked on.  
  
Q. Your thoughts on the comeback. Did you feel like there was some energy
there?  
COACH BALCOMB: If there wasn't, you know, it would be a tough situation as a
coach to not have a team fight back. We're supposed to compete. At the least,
we should have fought back like we did. That's expected.  
When you're down, when things aren't going your way, really getting
embarrassed in your own city in the SEC tournament by another team, you better
fight back, and it better be your best effort.  
I really liked the five players we had in at the end of the game. I thought
they did a great job. I just played them till they dropped or fouled out. I
just really felt like if I could just get five kids to get that grit and
determination and compete as hard as they could, that we could make a good
run, and we did.  
The tough part was, then when we got close, we got tight on the free throws.
So that fear creeped up in us again.  
  
Q. Looking towards the NCAA tournament, what do you think you need to
improve on as a team?  
COACH BALCOMB: Well, that's what we were talking about in the locker room:
individual accountability on doing their job. Obviously toughness, physical
play. And communication.  
When we do have adversity at times, we looked like we were all playing on an
island by ourselves and stopped communicating. Everybody felt like they were
out there by themselves instead of getting together as a team.  
That's just more verbal leadership on the court. They're the same things we've
been working on all season. We just need to keep working on them.  
Apparently we'll have a little time to practice here and they'll be mine for a
while. That's always a good thing (laughter).  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.  
COACH BALCOMB: Thank you.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=SOUTHEASTERN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 4, 2011

  

### [Dawn Staley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15625)

### [Ieasia Walker](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21773)

  
_NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE_  
  

Georgia  66  
South Carolina - 34

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by South Carolina. We'll take an opening statement
from Coach Staley.  
COACH STALEY: I thought our kids played extremely hard. But obviously it
wasn't our night tonight. I thought Georgia had a lot to do with it. They
really disrupted us from a defensive standpoint. We really didn't have an
answer for them.  
Again, I thought our kids tried their very best and gave their very best
effort. We just came up short today.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for Ieasia Walker.  
  
Q. Why where y'all struggling so much on the offensive end tonight?  
IEASIA WALKER: I think their zone forced us to take more outside shots than
getting to the basket, which is what we were used to doing. When we got to the
basket, we weren't finishing with contact. It was hard to get buckets. When we
did get fouls, we weren't making our free throws. That was a struggle for us.  
  
Q. Obviously Georgia has a big size advantage over South Carolina. How much
of a factor do you think that was tonight?  
IEASIA WALKER: They were able to pound it inside a lot, got a lot of layups,
high-low looks. That was a big disadvantage for us. They scored off their
offensive rebounds. I think they beat us on the rebound side. That really
helped them out a lot.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll turn it over to questions for Coach Staley.  
  
Q. Coach, seeing that you improved your basketball program over the past
three years, what do you think you need to improve on in the future?  
COACH STALEY: I think for us, we just have to get more talented. I think for
what we've done with the program, we've gotten better through just working
hard, just changing the culture, getting our kids to buy into working hard
every single night out.  
For the most part the games we won, we pretty much out-worked people. The
games we lost, we pretty much got out-talented. We got to add some more talent
to our roster. Hopefully when we're given our opportunities like we did
tonight, they'll be more favorable to us.  
  
Q. Do you think your team made a good case for the NCAAs this season?  
COACH STALEY: You know, now that we played all of our regular season and our
tournament games, looking at it, I think our body of work, for what we've
done, I think what the committee looks for, as far as playing a tough non-
conference schedule, who we had to play in our conference, the teams that we
had to play twice: Tennessee, Georgia, Kentucky, Auburn - all of those teams
put us in a position where there's some argument. We did win a game in the
tournament as well.  
So I would say we put up a good argument. If you look at our entire body of
work, I think we should be able to grab one of those at-large bids.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much.  
COACH STALEY: Thank you.

## March 4, 2011

  

### [Andy Landers](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13868)

### [Meredith Mitchell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20512)

### [Porsha Phillips](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21797)

  
_NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE_  
  

Georgia  66  
South Carolina - 34

  
THE MODERATOR: We're here with Georgia. We'll begin an opening statement from
head coach Andy Landers.  
COACH LANDERS: It started much the way that we thought that it would. South
Carolina being aggressive offensively and defensively. And I thought that they
played well. I also thought that they might have gotten tired, having played
last night. They played really, really hard, and really well last night.  
But, you know, just really pleased with our basketball team. Their decision-
making in the first half was excellent, when to run, when not to run. Their
execution in the halfcourt offensively was excellent in the first half. I
thought Jasmine James was terrific offensively the first 10 minutes and
separated us from South Carolina.  
Then I thought Hassell and Meredith offensively were very good the rest of the
game. We were able to keep that distance. As usual, I'm a Porsha fan. I
thought she was just crazy rebounding the basketball and defensively. Overall
defensively just really did what we came to do. Did a good job of being
focused and addressing the needs that we had defensively.  
I thought the two guards on the top of the zone were just outstanding. I
thought the three back-line players played very, very well, and as a team
excellent.  
THE MODERATOR: Meredith, your thoughts on the game tonight?  
MEREDITH MITCHELL: We just played hard. I think we focused more on defense
during the game, getting the ball inside. All the players did a good job of
getting open on the inside and finishing with good shots.  
THE MODERATOR: Porsha, your thoughts on the win?  
PORSHA PHILLIPS: I think everybody came to win tonight. We played with a lot
of heart, a lot of pride. We just got after it. We executed our offense very
well and played our defense well tonight.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Porsha, I think you set the tone early with the double-double by
halftime. What were you doing inside to be so dominant?  
PORSHA PHILLIPS: Are you talking about offensively?  
  
Q. Both. The points and the rebounding.  
PORSHA PHILLIPS: You know, rebounding is very important to me as a player. I
love, enjoy rebounding. Offensively, I just let it come to me. I don't go
searching for shots like I used to. I just be patient on offense.  
  
Q. In the second half, Meredith, you picked up your third foul 12 seconds
into the second half, then pretty much took over and scored 13 points.  
MEREDITH MITCHELL: Yeah, I just tried to play smart. I definitely didn't want
to do anything that caused me to get back on the bench. Especially in the past
two games, I've been in foul trouble, not helping out my team. They did a
great job of reminding me just to play smart, continue to play hard and
aggressive, not to pick up any more fouls.  
  
Q. Porsha, y'all limited South Carolina to 24% shooting. Why do you think
your defense was so effective out there?  
PORSHA PHILLIPS: I think playing great defense, winning ballgames, we stopped
them from penetrating. That's what they mainly do. They have great three-point
shooters. We just focused on defense a lot tonight.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll excuse you, ladies. We'll continue with questions for
Coach Landers.  
  
Q. Why do you think your defense was so effective out there tonight?  
COACH LANDERS: Well, I don't think it's a secret. South Carolina's guards are
very good. They're very good off the bounce. They're very good off the drive.  
So first of all, we felt that zone was probably the way to go, to try to
protect the paint from the way that they attack it off the bounce.  
Then in selecting that as our defense, we knew that they liked to use ball
screens against the zone. So, you know, we talked about it and worked on that
this morning.  
Those two kids on top of zone were really, really, really good. I mean, I
don't know what you saw. One of those guards could be guarding the right wing
and two quick passes later be guarding the left wing, or she could be guarding
the right wing and one pass and a drive be under a ball screen that her buddy
had been screened and stop the penetration.  
They were just really, really good up top.  
What South Carolina likes to do is penetrate and score or penetrate and draw
you in and pitch to the three. When they do that, they're good three-point
shooters. They shot a lot of threes tonight, but they didn't hit 'em. I tend
to think that's because our back kids were able to get up on 'em, and our back
kids are long.  
You know, it was just a good effect.  
Then when they did get by us, and they did. They hit the gaps a couple times
and drove. Hassell was really good about stepping into the path of the driver,
making them change their shot.  
  
Q. Some would argue that you limped into the final part of the SEC season,
losing the last game to Florida. This is a best-case scenario waiting for you
guys to get back on a motivational standpoint?  
COACH LANDERS: Who would they argue with? I wouldn't argue with them. We
slithered in here. We didn't play well. Our team knows that. Their coach knows
that. Fans know that. Why, is the question.  
But, yes, this is good for us. I told our kids this morning at shoot-around,
You need to win for you. I mean, you need to get back to feeling good about
you. There were certainly a lot of things in this game that they can feel good
about.  
  
Q. How do you feel about your team's defensive performance tonight, seeing
now it's the best in the history of the SEC tournament?  
COACH LANDERS: I thought they were really well-coached (laughter). If you
print it, I'll come get you. I'll Google you, find where you live, come get
you. Just kidding.  
I'm very, very proud of not just how we played it, but how we played it the
entire game. You know, we were consistent from the beginning till the end. We
stayed focused. We stayed on point with the things that we wanted to
accomplish for 40 minutes.  
Again, I do think, you know, South Carolina played really, really, really hard
last night. I think they were a little bit tired. And then you get behind, and
it's tough mentally.  
But I'm proud of our basketball team.  
  
Q. Obviously you have to play Tennessee tomorrow, but --  
COACH LANDERS: It's not a but.  
  
Q. How do you prepare to come out better this time?  
COACH LANDERS: I don't think we played very well against them. I don't think
we played well in our last three games. I mean, first of all, and this is what
I said to our basketball team just now before I left the dressing room to come
in here, I told them, You can't beat 'em if you don't want to. I mean, you
don't beat good basketball teams unless you want to.  
Now, if you want to, really, really want to, there's a lot that goes into
that. Now you commit to the hurt. You commit to sprinting up and down the
floor with a group like Tennessee. You got to get back. You commit to boxing
out. You just commit to a tough, tough task.  
But you got to want to. And somewhere down in there, down in that little tiny
place that nobody can see, you got to believe you can. I mean, you don't have
to go around and tell everybody. You don't have to hang a sign. You got to
believe it.  
I mean, that's it. There's no magic to it. What do you want me to see? You got
to keep them off the offensive boards? Sure you do. But you got to want to
beat 'em.  
I don't know what they would say because they're cool. See, kids are cool. So
I'm not sure that they would tell you the truth about Knoxville. But my take
on it - and I'm with them every day - is they got out there and got shell-
shocked. Tennessee hit two threes, they went, Oh, my God, and they got scared.  
They're scared again tomorrow night, the result will be the same. If they're
not, it will be different.  
Is that good?  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much.

_NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE_  
  

Tennessee  92  
Florida - 75

  
THE MODERATOR: We're here with the University of Tennessee. We'll start off
with an opening thought about today's game from COACH BUTLER.  
COACH SUMMITT: Obviously, you'll take a win anytime. Thank goodness that we
had Shekinna and Glory come to play. We were having a little bit of trouble
off the bench, trying to find people that could knock-down shots and defend.  
But overall, you know, when you get a win, you're in the situation we were in,
it's survive and advance and move on, and that's what we're going to do.  
THE MODERATOR: Shekinna, your thoughts on the game today?  
SHEKINNA STRICKLEN: You know, I think our defense wasn't really there the
whole 40 minutes. We played good defense at spurts. Coming in as the No. 1
seed in our conference, we have to play 40 minutes, great defense the whole
game. We just got to pick it up on our defense and rebounding.  
That's what coach says, you win games by defense and rebounds. That's what
we've got to bring.  
THE MODERATOR: Glory, your thoughts on today's victory?  
GLORY JOHNSON: We started out strong. Let up a little bit in the game.
Whenever they made runs, it hit us hard. We need to work on playing a
40-minute game. We tried. We need to put it into effect. What we do in
practice, we need to bring it over into the game. We'll be a lot more
successful and make our coaches happy when we do that.  
COACH SUMMITT: If I ain't happy, ain't nobody happy (laughter).  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Glory, you played with a smaller lineup for a lot of the game. You had a
great game. How do you like playing in that smaller lineup with you at center?
Talk about the effectiveness of the press in the first half against Florida.  
GLORY JOHNSON: I think just being one of the bigger post players in the game
at the time, I think the guards rely a lot. Whenever they kick it inside, they
want us to be effective as post players. Inside out. It's go to work.  
I think being one of the post players, Leesey started off strong. Whenever she
was strong, I tried to hit her. Whoever is strong, we got to hit them when
they're hot.  
Our press shook them a little bit. Closing our traps and everything like that,
I think that was really effective. They kind of caught on through the rest of
the game throwing long passes. I still think it shook them up a little bit.  
  
Q. Glory, your size advantage inside, I think you in the paint were 50 to 30
points. Talk about how tough it was in there and how you used your height
advantage?  
GLORY JOHNSON: It was extremely tough. Florida is a physical team. They were
giving me a hard time. I don't know if it looked like it or not, but they were
giving me an extremely hard time. Just going up strong, trying to go up strong
no matter what. Drew fouls with their hands up. Got to be strong with the
ball, have ball security, play as hard as I can. That's something that I try
to do.  
  
Q. Glory, this is a start of what you hope is going to be a very long post-
season run through two tournaments. Is the realization of Game 1 in the post-
season make you up your game?  
GLORY JOHNSON: I think it's just a start. You got to take it one game at a
time, focusing on your opponent at the time, the time being. After that, when
you're done with that game, move on to that one and focus on your next
opponent.  
It's not about who we play, but Tennessee playing their game, us playing the
Tennessee way, everyone being on the same page throughout the whole game, and
we're bound to be successful.  
SHEKINNA STRICKLEN: You know, I give a lot of credit, Florida came out, they
played us real tough. They played a great game. This first game just kind of
woke us up that we have to come ready to play no matter who we play. We got to
play Tennessee ball, that's playing every possession, just rebounding, playing
great defense, mainly playing a whole 40-minute game.  
  
Q. Glory, there was a moment when you were on the bench and the cameras
caught you after you scored your career high. Why so bashful about playing
such a great game today?  
GLORY JOHNSON: I don't know. I can't take all the credit. Being a post player,
you have to get your touches from the guards. Just having the camera on me, I
wanted to get Kelly in the camera, too. I kind of hid behind her. We joked
about that a lot.  
I'm not trying to take all the credit. I have off games. There's times where
I'm not hitting shots and not pulling rebounds. That's why I rely on my
teammates. Today they relied on me and Shekinna. I think we just kind of
stepped up.  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, you're excused. We'll continue with Coach Summitt.  
  
Q. Pat, you made a couple of substitutions early that seemed to help right
away offensively. You took out Spani, put in Bjorklund. Kamiko Williams seemed
to have a good game at the point offensively in place of Simmons. Could you
talk about the thinking behind those moves.  
COACH SUMMITT: I thought Kamino came in, did a really great job for us. She at
times gives into fatigue. Taber wasn't on her A game. That's why I wanted to
make a substitution there.  
Meighan is a great athlete, but she's learning to become a more skill player
and distribute the ball. I think she's going to be a great player for us. But
just seeing and having a feel for it, making those adjustments, it's something
as a coaching staff we talk about throughout the game.  
  
Q. Coach, Florida I don't believe had eclipsed 40 points in either of their
regular-season meetings with you. Can you talk about what they did differently
in terms of an aggressive approach on offense?  
COACH SUMMITT: They shot the ball (laughter). You can tell, they spent a lot
of time on their offensive game. The ball didn't stuck in players' hands. I
thought they were really aggressive. They're tough. I mean, it's obviously the
best that they played us, in my opinion. They played us with just a real
attitude, aggressiveness and, like I said, toughness. They're really tough.  
  
Q. (Question regarding the second half.)  
COACH SUMMITT: If you would have been in the locker room halftime, you
probably would have heard us.  
Yes, obviously we had to really just dial 'em up. I wanted to make sure that
everybody that went in went in with passion to play great defense, to rebound,
and to take care of the basketball.  
  
Q. The fact that they played so well, you maybe not your A game, you still
get a win, do you take satisfaction off that being in the post-season?  
COACH SUMMITT: Not really right now. Might later on. I think we just have to
hold this team constantly to the level that we expect. We do it in practice,
we do it in games. When we don't reach that, we'll obviously go back and talk
about it.  
I think because we play a lot of people, sometimes I think that might affect
us. So we may have to shorten the number of players that we play. I hope not
because it can be very effective.  
So, you know, it's kind of a feel as we go through it.  
  
Q. Pat, talk a little bit about Amanda Butler. Did you know her at all as a
high school player? Did you recruit her?  
COACH SUMMITT: No. Let me tell you, she's tough. Amanda kind of reminds me a
lot of myself. She's not going to take a player taking a possession off, she
holding them accountable. She's got a toughness. I think her team responds
very well to her, and they play really, really hard on both ends.  
I think their defense has been one of the best in our league. The way they
shot the ball, you know they've been in the gym. But I have a lot of respect
for her game and her team and how she goes about her business.  
  
Q. Did you know her at all?  
COACH SUMMITT: I knew of her, yeah.  
  
Q. You went undefeated in the regular season. To win the tournament, you
have to continue. Is there some weight that comes with that, carrying that
undefeated streak through in the conference?  
COACH SUMMITT: You know, I didn't feel it going through the conference. It was
just all about the next game, the next possession, what we needed to do,
finding the people that would bring their A game, have a sense of urgency.  
I think the whole team has really become very, very close, predominantly with
this junior class. When they were freshmen, we lost to Ball State, I was about
ready to slit my wrists. We went back and practiced the next day, so that
cured my ailment there for at least a little bit.  
But I think that was probably one of the best things that happened to a young
team.  
As sophomores they were a lot better. Now as juniors, they're at a whole
different place. That's why I think Shekinna has really stepped up. I've
challenged her to be an All-American, and she's been that. I remember when I
went to visit her in Arkansas. All she wanted to do was go fishing. So I went
fishing with her. I thought, What am I doing (laughter)? I went down and
watched her fish. I met all the family. I thought, These are the most laid-
back people.  
When she stepped on the court as a sophomore, she was very different. As a
junior, she's been terrific. I don't even have to say anything other than look
at her and we kind of connect.  
  
Q. Big game from Glory Johnson. As the week goes on in practice and pregame
warmups, is that something you can sense?  
COACH SUMMITT: The thing about Glory is that you know she's going to play
hard. I think she's really committed to getting paint points. She's using the
glass so much better, using both hands a lot better. I have to give Dean
Lockwood a lot of credit. When we finish up and they go over to Pratt, they
get in a lot of shots.  
Her face-up game is better, but I like her in the paint because of her skills
there.  
  
Q. I know even Glory mentioned it's been a problem, not playing the full 40
minutes. Now that you're in post-season, what's happened in the past, how big
of a frustration and concern is that for you now?  
COACH SUMMITT: Well, it's a concern, but not the entire team. I think Glory is
doing what she needs to do. I think Stricklen is doing exactly what she needs
to do. Our guard play was not that good until Kamino went in. We need Meighan
at a different place and we really need our perimeter game to really take care
of the basketball. We had some careless mistakes. So we can get better.  
We'll watch this game and get ready for the next game. But we can get a lot
better.  
  
Q. With all the uncertainty in the past, is that smaller lineup becoming a
more viable option? Also the effectiveness of the press today with that
lineup.  
COACH SUMMITT: Well, I think the lineup was pretty good for us. I think we're
going to have to mix things up, just like we mixed up our man-to-man and our
zone. But that's not something uncommon. It's kind of a wait and see.  
Let's say we want to go straight man, you know, just player to player, if
that's not working we're going to change. I used to be so stubborn, I wouldn't
change. But I have three other coaches on my back, so I have to change.  
But I think our man-to-man has been very good. But also our zone, when we go
with a bigger lineup, we're long and rangy. I think it's hard for people to
get inside in that situation.  
  
Q. On a 1 to 10 scale, how would you rate the Pat Summitt peel the paint
halftime talk?  
COACH SUMMITT: When you're happy, and our governor was there, I told him to
come up and talk (laughter).  
But, no, I was just disappointed. Look at all the orange. Look at our fans. We
have the greatest fans in the women's game. Don't just mess around. Let's take
care of business and go out and get refocused.  
That's what we did. But I was not happy.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much.  
COACH SUMMITT: Thank you.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=SOUTHEASTERN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 4, 2011

  

### [Sharon Fanning-Otis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16876)

### [Mary Kathryn Govero](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20538)

### [Diamber Johnson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21780)

  
_NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE_  
  

Vanderbilt  69  
Mississippi State - 55

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with Coach Fanning-Otis.  
COACH FANNING-OTIS: I'm pleased with how our basketball team has continued to
progress and they fought. It's been a learning process for us.  
Tonight I'm disappointed that it wasn't on the line. I felt like that we were
getting to a point. But Vanderbilt is a very good basketball team, they're
very balanced. They have some scorers off the bench that can give them a lift.
Clarke had zero points at the half, in the starting lineup, ends up with 23.  
The free-throw line has been an area this whole season. When a season is over,
you made 10 more attempts a game than your opponent, if you've out-rebounded
your opponent, positive assist-to-turnover ratio, you have a positive
ballgame.  
Those are statistics we haven't been good at. I think we've been improving as
a team. We have one senior. I hate that a season comes to an end, but I'm
proud we have continued to fight and improve. Hopefully this will be really an
end to the season, but I hope it's a starting point to a lot of players who
are returning, as players are made in the off-season. It's what they do when
you're not looking that's going to determine their development.  
These two young ladies have been a big part of our progress this season. Their
leadership has been very important to the success that we've had and the way
that we've continued to improve.  
THE MODERATOR: Diamber, your opening thoughts on the game tonight?  
DIAMBER JOHNSON: I mean, we fought. Couple things didn't go our way. One
thing, we kept our head in it the whole game, tried to stay focused. A lot of
stuff happened, but we stayed together and we grew together tonight.  
THE MODERATOR: Mary Kathryn, your general thoughts on tonight's game?  
MARY KATHRYN GOVERO: Like Diamber said, we fought. Earlier in the season,
there would have been a point where we wouldn't have fought. I think it shows
the progress we made in this season, just that we were able to keep on
fighting even when shots weren't falling or things didn't go our way. That's
all you can ask, is to come together and for everybody to fight till the last
second.  
  
Q. Coming off an emotional victory last night, late last night, how much of
an effect do you think fatigue might have had on you tonight?  
DIAMBER JOHNSON: Not used to making it back to the hotel almost 12:00 at
night.  
Personally, I didn't feel too much fatigue like I normally do after a game.
Just knowing and preparing for this whole weekend, the adrenaline probably
came in. I don't think it affected us too much. But, yeah, it was pretty late.  
THE MODERATOR: Mary Kathryn?  
MARY KATHRYN GOVERO: It's part of the fun of the SEC tournament. I mean, you
come in, the fact we got to play again today, that's the reward. We could have
gone home last night.  
I don't think fatigue was necessarily a factor. I mean, yeah, we played a
game, and Vanderbilt hadn't. But, you know, that's part of it. I wouldn't say
that had anything to do with tonight's loss.  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, thank you. We'll continue with questions for Coach
Fanning-Otis.  
  
Q. Your team did a great job on the offensive glass tonight, but wasn't able
to translate to quite as many points as you would have liked off 22 offensive
rebounds. Talk about how you were able to get so many offensive rebounds and
where you came up short with them.  
COACH FANNING-OTIS: We were able to get them because we surely missed a lot of
shots. We took a lot more than our opponent. Vanderbilt contested a lot of
shots. Some of the things I felt we probably didn't have the confidence or the
balance that we needed in a couple of positions.  
But this is something we're trying to improve. The positive side of that is
that we got them. That's important. That's the first step. Now, as we continue
to work in the off-season, we'll work on making them. The field goal
percentage is a big key. We've been holding a lot of teams to under 40% from
the field. A player early like [] way low, her threes initially in the first
half, three for four, a player like that, you have to get under, can't let
them get a shot off.  
Isolation in the post, with that you're going to have to get some great help.
We have to play better team defense to keep them shooting the percentage they
have, then we have to step up to get our field goal close to 40, 45% or
better.  
Anyway, I guess the positive side is trying to get the offensive boards and
that effort that is there. If you can continue to have effort, you'll find a
way to win some ballgames in the future.  
  
Q. Looking back on this game and season, what do you think you need to
improve on?  
COACH FANNING-OTIS: A lot of individual skill work relative to the confidence
of shots. Players, they have to really put in the time themselves. This has to
be an individual decision, so when we come back in the fall we're a tougher
team. They've had the experience of playing some non-conference teams that
were very successful, learning from that, then going into the conference,
learning how to grow, finding ways to winning ballgames, coming back from not
being in a game in the first half.  
We get in foul trouble. We saw that a little bit tonight with Bett and Brown.
We have to be a better basketball team.  
Hopefully the experience itself. I think that you grow from wins and losses.
We expressed this to our team after the game. Every game this season is going
to help you win a game next year, either the success you had because you want
to repeat that and do that a little bit better, or a loss, what do we have to
do different.  
So this experience is going to help us win a lot of basketball games next
season. Right now it sort of goes in their lap relative to the off-season
preparation because we can only be with them a very minimal time. Hopefully
there's motivation and enough experience returning where they can be good
teachers for the new players coming in as well as carry over what they've
learned.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much.  
COACH FANNING-OTIS: Thank you.

_NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE_  
  

Kentucky  60  
LSU - 58

  
THE MODERATOR: We're here with Kentucky. At this point we will have an opening
statement from Coach Mitchell.  
COACH MITCHELL: Tremendous win for Kentucky today. Very proud of our players
and the fight they were able to show. It was such a tough game. LSU is an
opponent that has our respect. We knew it would be a real fight for us today.  
Bounce-back from a subpar performance in the first half and I thought played
much more to our identity in the second half.  
So really proud of our players. They deserve a ton of credit for finding a way
today.  
THE MODERATOR: Victoria, your thoughts on the game today?  
VICTORIA DUNLAP: I don't think we started the game we wanted to, but we
definitely finished it the I way we wanted to with a win. We've had a couple
games like this where the game has been close at the end, but we got it done
together at the end.  
THE MODERATOR: A'dia, your thoughts on the game today?  
A'DIA MATHIES: I give LSU credit. They came out and played very aggressive,
played real tough. I think in the end we just turned it around, played
Kentucky basketball like we should have been playing the whole game. Came out
with a win with our defensive pressure.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start out with questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Can you both talk about your play down the stretch, your defensive
intensity.  
VICTORIA DUNLAP: I think we were being a little bit more aggressive on offense
attacking the basket. We were running the plays that coach was calling,
executing well. Our defense, we were just getting stops, pressuring the ball a
lot more than we did in the first half. We were getting comfortable with
ourselves and with our shots.  
A'DIA MATHIES: We was being way more aggressive, especially on defense in the
late stages of the game, came out with some crucial turnovers. We practice
that every day. To see it happen on the floor over and over again, I think
it's a statement to how we play, how it should be the whole game.  
  
Q. Victoria, what did you see in that dish to A'dia to get yourselves up and
to be on the bench most of the first half?  
VICTORIA DUNLAP: Well, in that pass, I was definitely about to shoot it, some
crazy shot. I know the shot clock was running down. I saw A'dia cut back door,
saw she was opened, passed it to her, she finished.  
First half, just not being smart with my fouls. My first foul wasn't on
baseline with my fundamentals. I got a little bump foul. Not being balanced
for the second one, I had to sit out and watch my teammates. They still held
up for themselves. Then the second half, just being a lot smarter than I was
and helping my teammates on the floor.  
Coach told me to be prepared to run certain plays. I just felt good with that
and I was really comfortable.  
  
Q. Victoria, that stretch that you scored 10 or 12 points in the second
half, do you feel you were in some sort of zone?  
VICTORIA DUNLAP: I guess so. I mean, I don't think I've ever done, scored in
that way before, shooting jump shots, coming off of ball screens. Different
kind of mentality I had. I felt good doing it and I knew it was helping my
teammates a lot.  
  
Q. You won for the first time at Vanderbilt since the '80s a couple weeks
ago, coming back here to your hometown, do you feel like you left a little bit
of an impression?  
VICTORIA DUNLAP: I guess so. I'm pretty sure people kind of know who I am.
I've been here my whole life.  
It's just great to play in a place where you have a lot of family and friends
that come out and watch you and support you.  
  
Q. A'dia, does it feel like it's always going to be close when you and LSU
play?  
A'DIA MATHIES: No, I don't think I really ever thought about it. They just a
great team. They came out with a lot of intensity. I think we matched it,
ended up winning in the end.  
They really played a good game. But I think we played even better, so...  
  
Q. What were you trying to do on their last possession where she got the
shot off?  
VICTORIA DUNLAP: We were not trying to give up any threes. We just said, No
threes. We were switching all of the screens. We had to make sure we were
focused and our intensity was up and we had to know what was going on. A'dia
did a good job of checking her that last shot.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll excuse you ladies and continue with Coach Mitchell.  
  
Q. I wasn't aware you were from the same town that Van Chancellor is from.
How is it to go against somebody like him?  
COACH MITCHELL: Well, it's no fun going against him. Has nothing to do with
the town that we're from. It's the defense that they employ. It's just no fun
at all to play LSU. That's not my idea of a good time, to play LSU. It's very,
very difficult.  
They just do such a great job of making you earn baskets. The matchup with
Kentucky and LSU is just such that we're going to play a certain style, and
they are. Neither team really seems to be able to get any separation from the
other. When we got that draw, I thought if we faced LSU, it was a real tough
game for us. Everybody that was there today saw that.  
Coach Chancellor does a really, really good job with their defense.  
  
Q. As far as managing the first half when you had the foul trouble, can you
talk about that?  
COACH MITCHELL: Very, very proud of everyone who had to come in in a difficult
situation. Some of our young kids had to play. They're not a hundred percent
ready for this type of situation. So they had to play real hard.  
Whatever you're called on to do, we talked about that before the game. The
whole key to today is finding some way to win. You know, no matter what you're
called on, if it's 2 minutes, 20 minutes, 40 minutes, you have to go in and
work real hard.  
There's a couple of kids that aren't used to playing. I thought they got us
into halftime. Huge three that Keyla made to get it to 4, good psychological
lift going in down 4. You can talk to them, Hey, a couple stops, buckets,
right there. That's what happened coming out.  
Real proud of everybody getting in there today and fighting and being able to
earn a real tough victory.  
  
Q. Victoria had 12 points in that early run in the second half. Did you
challenge her to do something like that?  
COACH MITCHELL: Yeah, I was certainly not pleased that she was on the bench
with 10 minutes left. I was upset with a couple things. We had them in a bonus
with almost 14 minutes left in the half, then Victoria is left on the bench
with 10 minutes left in the half. Not a good situation for us.  
I did talk to Victoria at halftime that, you know, we're going back to
Lexington if we don't win today. I don't think she wanted to go back to
Lexington. We had worked hard on a couple of things to try to get her moving
some today so people can't load up on the block, double-team, triple-team her.
Boy, did she respond. That's about as good a stretch as she's ever had facing
the basket. Shows you she's still developing, getting better.  
A player of her caliber, arguably the best player in this league, needs to
come up big in that kind of situation. She did. That's why she's one of the
best players that's ever played at Kentucky.  
  
Q. You had 13 fouls in the first half. Was that more LSU coming at you or
your team being overly aggressive?  
COACH MITCHELL: There's some possibilities there. First of all, I can't tell
you exactly why we do what we do a lot of times. We have a lot of young
players we're playing. They'll do some things that kind of make you scratch
your head.  
I thought being in the game, everybody wanted to win. We were putting a big
emphasis on full-court pressure, full-court press. If you're not really sharp
and mentally focused on your fundamentals, and you just stand up a little bit
on a real good team like LSU, you're going to get those body-block calls.  
We were fouling. There was no question about it. It wasn't poor calls. It was
not we weren't getting bad officiating. We were not down in a stance against a
team the caliber of LSU.  
Our pressure is predicated on being, first and foremost, fundamentally sound,
having kids that are in great shape, but fundamentally sound. When we don't do
that, it gets a little loose.  
We felt like we could make it tough on LSU to score if we can make them set up
and run stuff. They can score very easily if they get to the line.  
Thank goodness they didn't make a lot at the line today. That was a big key in
the game because we fouled way too much. We'll have to clean that up whoever
we face tomorrow.  
  
Q. LSU's last possession, do you think you forced them to take a shot they
didn't want to take? Do you think they should be an NCAA tournament team?  
COACH MITCHELL: There's absolutely no question they're an NCAA tournament team
in my mind. Unfortunately for LSU, that will mean nothing that I think that
they should be. I do think they should be. They are very, very difficult to
score against.  
In a tournament setting, when you must win the next game, I think they're one
of the toughest teams to play against because they make it so hard to score.  
Your kids, it starts to wear on their minds a little bit. I think they are,
without a doubt, a NCAA tournament team.  
The last play, I thought that was a great play on our part to get a contested
15-, 16-footer. A lot of times kids are worried about fouling. You give up a
layup in that situation. A lot of times people lose focus and get lost in
screens or you give up a three.  
Once we got the ball driving to the left, Graham driving to the left, didn't
look line anybody was on that side for her to kick it to, I felt like we were
going to be in pretty good shape. For her to pull up and make that shot, I
thought that was an excellent possession. Seven seconds. Victoria makes the
free throw, it's much easier to guard. You can just guard the three-point
strike. We sort of had to guard it all there. I thought that was excellent
defense on the last play.  
  
Q. You had a couple of situations down the second half of the SEC season
where you had really close games and your team has responded. Can you talk
about what you learned about your team through those games?  
COACH MITCHELL: I wish we wouldn't be in those situations. I think we can play
a little bit better. I think we have a couple of kids that, when we miss a
couple shots early, it affects us for the entire game until it gets crunch
time. So I wish we weren't in those on one hand. I think we could do some
things better not to be in that situation.  
But having said that, it's pretty remarkable what these kids have been able to
do because all these one- and two-point games make the season look very
different, makes the feeling of the program look different, makes our progress
very different.  
I'm really grateful that we find ways. They hang in there. They've had an
uncanny ability to make plays in the press late. That's just difficult to do.
You just don't see that. When they know you're pressing, they know you have to
have a steal, they have a chance to set up and get into some things, and you
still are able to turn them over, turn the game when it looks bad for you,
that's a credit to our players.  
They've worked hard to get into that situation. I'm proud they've taken
advantage of all their hard work. I thought that's what won it for us today.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much for your time.  
COACH MITCHELL: Thank you.

### [Van Chancellor](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18047)

_NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE_  
  

Kentucky  60  
LSU - 58

  
THE MODERATOR: We have LSU with us now. We'll have Coach Chancellor make an
opening statement.  
COACH CHANCELLOR: Really proud of our team today. We played awfully hard. We
had to play back to back. We played some of our players 36 minutes, 35
minutes, 34 minutes. I thought they did a great job. I thought they played
with all their heart, all their character, all their toughness. We just come
up a little bit short today.  
THE MODERATOR: LaSondra, your opening thoughts on the game?  
LaSONDRA BARRETT: I mean, I thought it was a hard-fought game. Right now I
really don't have any words to say. It hurts to lose. You go out and play your
hardest, keep coming up short.  
Just proud of how my team fought tonight. Just going to keep our heads up.  
THE MODERATOR: Adrienne?  
ADRIENNE WEBB: Like she said, we fought hard. It is hard to say much after a
loss. We played our hardest out there. Unfortunately, we just came up short.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll have questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. LaSondra, you got wrapped up with the Kentucky player in the first half,
did that affect you for a while? In the second half you started scoring again.
Was that a reason that you were tight there for a while?  
LaSONDRA BARRETT: Before the game, I was having back problems. I think she
just aggravated it on that tangle up.  
It had nothing to do with the second half. It was just the will to win. I was
fighting a lot of injuries, playing through a lot of pain.  
I mean, just to go out and play hard, that's part of basketball. Just being
there for my team, I had to play through it. I couldn't make any excuses at
the time, so, yeah.  
  
Q. Adrienne, they trapped you on the baseline, you were trying to make a
move. What were you trying to do when that turnover happened?  
ADRIENNE WEBB: I was trying to advance the ball up the court, kind of relieve
some pressure off our point guard. I guess I got tangled up in everybody
else's feet and didn't go anywhere.  
  
Q. Adrienne, when you hit that three there late to tie it up, it was a point
where they could have put you away earlier, you guys came back and got a
layup. Did you feel you were getting momentum at that point?  
ADRIENNE WEBB: It kind of felt like a momentum shifter. Knocking down big
shots, getting to your open players, that kind of converts to how you got to
get a stop on the other end.  
But it wasn't enough to pull out the game.  
  
Q. Do you feel like you accomplished enough here to garner an NCAA berth?  
LaSONDRA BARRETT: No question in my mind we're an NCAA team. You can lose any
given day. We came out, competed hard, competed with the top team in the
nation, also in the SEC.  
With our defense, we bring it every night, I don't see any reason why we
wouldn't be in the NCAA tournament.  
ADRIENNE WEBB: I agree. Yes, we should be an NCAA tournament team. You know,
playing in this tough conference, like she said, getting our wins, playing
against a lot of top-tier teams this season kind of helps get us that NCAA
bid.  
  
Q. Will there be some worry between now and March 14th?  
LaSONDRA BARRETT: I mean, all we can do is prepare. Whatever happens happens.
But we just gonna continue practicing like we are an NCAA team, hoping for the
best. But right now, like I said, we bounced back from that loss and all we
can do is hope for an NCAA tournament bid.  
I think we're likely to get in. That's just my opinion. I don't know. We
deserve it.  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, thank you very much. We'll continue with questions for
Coach Chancellor.  
  
Q. Coach, in the first half, Kentucky had foul trouble. They committed 13
fouls. Victoria was on the bench. Did you feel there was an opportunity for
you to put more daylight between you and them at that point?  
COACH CHANCELLOR: We opened up the game up there, we couldn't get anything
going for the whole game. This game we opened up the first half and we got
about three or four easy little basket shots. We got free throws.
Uncharacteristically of us, we were 6 for 15.  
I thought in the first half, we had an opportunity to open up a 9-, 10-,
11-point lead and couldn't. That was also a factor in the game when we
couldn't make that happen. We opened up the second half with a play we called.
We run a little out-of-bounds play to open up the second half, got a wide-open
layup, couldn't make it.  
Those are the kinds of things in a game of this nature, plus free throws. They
had second-chance points. We had been a really good rebounding basketball
team. We had not given up much of that.  
  
Q. What were you trying to do on the last play?  
COACH CHANCELLOR: We tried to run a little play, get the ball to [] booing
begin. They did a good job of denying her the ball. It's hard with the way
Kentucky plays to get a good shot. We still got a 12-footer for the shot. It
wasn't a bad shot that we got. It was contested, but it was still a shot. We
were trying to run a little screen across and get the ball to Boogey, but we
couldn't do it.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, who is Boogey for those who don't know?  
COACH CHANCELLOR: LaSondra Barrett.  
  
Q. I know the players were asked about this. But your own opinion, coaching
in what arguably is the toughest conference, do you think you deserve to get
in the NCAA?  
COACH CHANCELLOR: Well, if Kentucky deserves to go, we deserve to go. We
played them twice, went to two points both time. If there are 64 better teams
than LSU right now, I'd like to find them. I don't have any doubt in my mind.
I mean, we had a chance today. We were down 8 points, had a chance to get beat
15 or 20, and we didn't. We played back to back. We played them big minutes
tonight. We played 36 minutes, 35 minutes, 34 minutes. We could have gotten
beat there. We were just one play away.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.  
COACH CHANCELLOR: Thank you.

### [Melanie Balcomb](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13863)

### [Tiffany Clarke](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21798)

### [Hannah Tuomi](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20534)

  
_NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE_  
  

Vanderbilt  69  
Mississippi State - 55

  
THE MODERATOR: We have Vanderbilt. We'll lead off with a statement from Coach
Balcomb.  
COACH BALCOMB: I felt like in the first half we didn't take away their threes
like we needed to. They took too many threes. But then I thought in the second
half we did a much better job with our game plan, got them to shoot 28% in the
second half.  
On offense, I thought we did a much better job getting the ball inside to
Tiffany and Hannah and take high-percentage shots. We shoot 52%. I thought
that was important, us getting our shot selection much higher, a higher
percentage. I thought we played a good second half. We played smart and we
played both ends of the floor.  
THE MODERATOR: Hannah, your thoughts on the game tonight?  
HANNAH TUOMI: It was a win. A win is good. But I would have to agree with
Coach Balcomb. We went into halftime, made a change when we started the second
half. I think that really started our second half off, we took the game away,
it was ours.  
THE MODERATOR: Tiffany?  
TIFFANY CLARKE: Just to repeat back what they said, I thought we played really
hard. I thought we came out the second half with a sense of urgency and we got
a great win, great energy momentum to lead us into our game tomorrow.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Tiffany, were you just a little fresher or more motivated in the second
half having sat for so long in the first?  
TIFFANY CLARKE: I would say I was more motivated, more focused, ready to play.
My team needed me and I needed to be there for them. I would say I was more
focused and ready to play.  
  
Q. People talk about how difficult it is to beat a team three times in one
season. You beat Mississippi State three times in one season. How did you get
it done again tonight?  
HANNAH TUOMI: We already beat them twice, that gave us the upper hand in that
aspect. Obviously at this point in the season, with any team in the SEC, you
can't take anyone lightly.  
I think that since we played them twice, we knew their personnel, we knew what
we had to do. In the second half, we really refocused on what we needed to do,
get done. I think that's how we beat them for the third time, so.  
THE MODERATOR: Tiffany, your thoughts?  
TIFFANY CLARKE: It's always hard to do. I feel like we fought through it. We
knew what we had to do. We had the game plan and the will to do it. We knew
what was on the line. We were focused.  
  
Q. Tiffany, I assume you knew you weren't going back in with the two fouls
in the first half. What do you do on the bench to stay in the game at that
point?  
TIFFANY CLARKE: I just let it not be about myself. I don't focus on myself
'cause it's a team sport. So I just decided -- I knew I wasn't going to go
back in, I knew I had to be there for my team to cheer and keep them
motivated, ready to play, and energetic.  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, we'll excuse you and continue with questions for Coach
Balcomb.  
  
Q. What did not having Tiffany in the first half, what kind of difference
did that make?  
COACH BALCOMB: Especially on offense, I thought we just took too many outside
shots. We didn't get the ball inside. I felt like we were relying too much on
the outside shot.  
They do a really good job of doubling in the post, coming in from weak side
quickly on Steph. They had done that before. I thought Steph and Hannah with
their footwork got them low defensively and we were able to get it in from the
wing. For Steph we got it in from the top and they got in there and doubled.
We relied too much on the outside perimeter shot. We talked about that at
halftime.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
COACH BALCOMB: No, I was not. I kind of have the two-foul rule. When we're up,
if we don't need her, don't want to put her in. If it was a game getting out
of hand, we were losing, then I probably would have been tempted and probably
put her in.  
  
Q. The way Tiffany was playing the second half, how did you like the way she
responded having to sit so much in the first?  
COACH BALCOMB: I thought it was great. It's very hard to do what Tiffany did.
We talk a lot about team focus, cheering, what it means to be a great teammate
on the bench. Not to be selfish, think about yourself, feel sorry for
yourself, those kinds of things, that's what we teach. You could tell that's
what Steph was focused on. I think she did a great job with it.  
I told her at halftime, You got a lot more energy than everybody else. We
should see it. She didn't just bring energy, she brought a toughness. She
rebounded. She defended. She scored. I thought she brought a mental and
physical toughness that was hard to fight through sitting so long in the first
half.  
Like the question asked earlier, she hadn't done that all season so I didn't
know what to expect.  
  
Q. Mississippi State was active on the offensive glass. How was your team
able to keep that from being more harmful to you?  
COACH BALCOMB: There's two reasons they had 22 rebounds offensively. She
missed a lot of shots is one. They had a lot of opportunities to get offensive
rebounds. They also took 23 threes. Long shots cause long rebounds. We didn't
do a good enough job boxing out, especially the shooter. The person that shot
it chased the rebound a lot. While we're in the air, which you shouldn't leave
the ground on a shooter, we're in the air, they chased.  
I thought they did a good job of kicking back out when they got offensive
rebounds. That's when they got good open looks from three and didn't knock
them down. It could have hurt us a lot more.  
  
Q. Looking ahead to tomorrow, it's not a long layoff, how do you get your
team prepared to take on Kentucky?  
COACH BALCOMB: I think one of the things my leaders know, Hannah and Jence,
we've been successful in tournaments because they know they have to fight
through and be mentally and physically tough the next day and play the next
day.  
I don't think that will even enter into their minds. They know what it takes
tournament time and how to prepare for that. The rest will follow that lead.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.  
COACH BALCOMB: Thank you.

# [SOUTHEASTERN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=SOUTHEASTERN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 4, 2011

  

### [Deana Allen](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21786)

### [Amanda Butler](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18040)

### [Ndidi Madu](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21758)

  
_NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE_  
  

Tennessee  92  
Florida - 75

  
THE MODERATOR: We're here with Florida. Coach Butler, an opening statement.  
COACH BUTLER: Obviously really, really proud of our fight tonight. I told the
team in the locker room, there were a lot of things we could have done better,
but there's no way we kickoff fought any harder than we did. However, we
didn't just come here to put up a good fight. We're disappointed we lost.  
We feel we're playing our best basketball right now, feel good about our team
going forward. We hope we get the opportunity to show that we're one of the
best teams in the country.  
THE MODERATOR: Deana, your thoughts on the game today?  
DEANA ALLEN: I was excited coming into the game. I felt like we really had the
chance of beating them. We knew it wasn't going to be easy, but we was going
to fight as much as we could.  
Of course, we're disappointed about the outcome. But, I mean, I'm proud of my
teammates and what the coaches put together for this tournament. We'll try
again next year.  
THE MODERATOR: Ndidi?  
NDIDI MADU: I agree with DA. Our fight was unbelievable today. There wasn't
one point in the game I thought we were going to lose the game because of how
hard my teammates were fighting. But it's a disappointing loss.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll have questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Within two in the first half, scoring 36 points after not getting 40
against them in the regular-season games, what sort of confidence boost did
that give you, what you were doing offensively against them?  
DEANA ALLEN: It gave us a lot of confidence. For us to be only two points
against one of the best teams in our league, it really gave us a lot more
confidence than we already had. We came in the game believing we could do it,
but being down two points at halftime sparked us.  
THE MODERATOR: Ndidi?  
NDIDI MADU: I expected us to come out with fire because this is the
tournament. I don't know.  
  
Q. How disappointing was the start of the second half with Glory Johnson
coming out of the gates?  
DEANA ALLEN: It was very disappointing because we knew they were going to come
out at halftime and come out on a run. When Glory was scoring back to back to
back, it deflated us in a way. We knew we had to answer. When coach called the
timeout, we were trying to come back together and go on our run.  
THE MODERATOR: Ndidi, your thoughts?  
NDIDI MADU: I mean, that's expected. They had the lows in the game, and some
parts of the game where they was just up. We expected them to come out wanting
to make a run. For us, they should have been up more than two than us at
halftime. We didn't come out with the same intensity in the second half as the
first half and that was our fault.  
  
Q. Your top three post players ended up fouling out of the game. Talk about
how physical it got in the second half.  
DEANA ALLEN: It was very physical. I didn't even know that we was in foul
trouble like we were. I just wanted to play smart because I knew that I was
the last one in there and I knew I had four fouls, but I just wanted to play
start, play straight up.  
THE MODERATOR: Ndidi?  
NDIDI MADU: Just like Deana, wasn't aware we had that many fouls. I took it
upon myself to rebound and give us second chances. Out of the guards, I'm the
person that coach looks to to put in that extra fight under the boards.  
I mean, it wasn't easy.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll continue with questions for Coach Butler.  
  
Q. Pat said she knew of you as a high school player, didn't recruit you.
Talk about the first time you even heard about Pat Summitt and Tennessee
ladies basketball. Is that where you wanted to go as a kid?  
COACH BUTLER: If you're a basketball player, as a little girl in this state,
when you begin playing basketball, that's when you know who Pat Summitt is.  
You know, ironically, I did not have the burning desire to be a Lady Vols.
That worked out well since she wasn't interested in me either. Just really
proud to compete as a Gator. I always do admire what Pat has done. I've said
it over and over again. She's the best. She deserves this arena to be filled
up with orange, all the support and love that she gets in the state.  
  
Q. Coach, did you feel like your team got tired in the second half or did it
start to wear on you with the play inside?  
COACH BUTLER: No, I didn't really feel like we were tired. Obviously we were
having a hard time trying to manage the foul calls, our rotations, trying to
keep the right people on the floor, trying to stay aggressive but stay out of
harm's way. That's where we seemed to struggle.  
I didn't feel like fatigue was ever a factor. They're a great team. Glory is
just fantastic. She's a very hard match-up for anyone. You try to zone or try
to man them up. The thing we wanted to be consistent with was our fight and
effort, and I thought we did that pretty well. I didn't feel like we ever got
tired. I felt like our team was ready to go, whatever was next.  
  
Q. I think in the paint they got you 50 to 30. Talk about that inside
presence they have, both size and strength. Did that wear on you guys?  
COACH BUTLER: Certainly it's a challenge right from the tip. But when we're
playing the last 10 minutes or so without the kids that play the bulk of the
minutes for us in the paint, it becomes an even greater challenge.  
Again, you have to give Tennessee credit for pounding the ball inside. Like I
said, I don't think that was a game plan that took hold when we got in foul
trouble. I think that was what they probably wanted to do from the onset.  
It's a tremendous part of their ballgame and something that you have to reckon
with when you know you're going to go toe-to-toe with them. The points
certainly went in their direction in terms of paint scoring. But I thought the
paint battle, if there's a way to measure battle, was probably pretty even.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much, coach.  
COACH BUTLER: Thank you.

### [Renee Ladner](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18026)

### [Valencia McFarland](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21777)

### [Kayla Melson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20523)

  
_NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE_  
  
THE MODERATOR: At this time we have Ole Miss here with Coach Ladner and
student-athletes Valencia McFarland and Kayla Melson.  
Coach Ladner, your opening thoughts on how the game went tonight.  
COACH LADNER: I just think it's very difficult to win games when you shoot 26%
from the floor. We did a lot of good things right, we just couldn't make the
ball go in the hole. We tried to guide it. We tried to do everything in our
power to score.  
We're one of the maybe top free-throw shooting percentage teams, we shoot the
best free-throw percentage in the league, and today we were 13-26. We're not
three-point shooting team, but they did a good job taking away the drive and
we ended up shooting three. Probably should have been beaten worse than 12.  
Naturally I'm proud of our effort and I think the future is bright.  
THE MODERATOR: Kayla, your thoughts on the game tonight?  
KAYLA MELSON: The ball didn't fall in the hole. But I think our young team
showed a lot of heart and determination and the will to fight. I'm very, very
proud to be a senior with this group of individuals. I know they will do great
things in the years to come. I'm just very happy for them.  
I hate we couldn't move on. But sometimes like she said, the ball doesn't fall
in the hole. We got to be able to defend and rebound.  
THE MODERATOR: Valencia, your thoughts on the team's performance tonight.  
VALENCIA McFARLAND: I think we played hard, gave a great effort. This off-
season, we're going to continue to work hard and grow as a team.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. You lost by 12, but it was a lot closer in the final minutes. What do you
think you did well to keep the game close?  
KAYLA MELSON: They started off hitting the three threes. We limited those
three-point shots from falling. We played great pressure defense, made them
turn the ball over a couple times. In those latter minutes, I think that was
something that I seen that was very well for our team.  
VALENCIA McFARLAND: At the beginning, they came out shooting threes. We had to
stop that. Later they started driving. Couldn't stop them from driving.  
  
Q. Everybody knows you have a young team. I know it hurts right now. In a
year from now, when you look back on the environment and the experience here,
what do you take from that?  
KAYLA MELSON: From my standpoint, this will probably be my last game, you
know, I think they have learned the urgency of the game. They have learned how
much one possession can be to a game. I think they will be very great in years
to come.  
They are young. Valencia is the leader. She's very mature for her age. I know
she will get the team ready and they will be great next year. Mark that down:
they will be great.  
VALENCIA McFARLAND: Now that I've had this experience, I know next year how
it's gonna be and I can lead the freshmen coming in. Hopefully we can get more
wins next year.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll dismiss the student-athletes and continue with questions
for Coach Ladner.  
  
Q. What do you think you did well late to kind of keep it so close when some
of the parts of your game weren't working very well?  
COACH LADNER: For the most part we took very good care of the ball. We out-
rebounded them. It was almost an 'almost' game. We'd be right there. They'd
pick up the loose ball, knock a shot down. We were almost in every possession.  
Again, we're either feast or famine. For the most part these young players,
you know, things like fouling a jump shooter, trying to block a three,
allowing somebody to get a put-back with one second on the clock, those are
things that they've had to learn.  
On the flipside of that coin, they've had a lot of game experience. You know,
I've looked up this year with all the circumstances that we've had, Kayla has
been out for 27 days. So they've had to play at a very high level for a very
long period of time. Because Valencia was our only ball handler in the month
of February, I would look up and we'd get the ball and they'd throw it
directly back to her. I would say, We're not playing fast enough. It was
almost a high school speed. Well, then I realized I was playing with high
school players.  
When Kayla came back for the last practice, all of a sudden we kicked into
gear and we were a collegiate team again. I'm extremely proud of this team.
They played with everybody in the league, except for Tennessee and LSU. A lot
of them have been one-possession games. They just didn't have enough gas or
enough experience to finish the games.  
It's all led by the little dynamite, Valencia McFarland. She is an incredible
player, mature beyond her years. She understands the game. She's a competitor.
She's probably already lost more games this year than she's lost in her high
school career.  
Through it all I've seen a lot of character. You can coach kids with
character. So I'm extremely proud of my team.  
  
Q. What did you tell your players at halftime?  
COACH LADNER: Well, it's been an unusual season. This team has been behind in
most games that we've played. We opened up the season, we played a tournament
in Hawaii, we were down 18-4 against Gonzaga. Then we would climb out of holes
and find a way to win. Valencia made the last shot in that day. The next day
we were down 14-4. The next day we were down 16-2.  
We're constantly in battle. They've been down, so they know how to fight back.
I tell you today, had we have made a couple of easy chip shots, I think we
would have climbed back in because they never really think about losing. They
always continue to think they're going to win. That's to their credit.  
We said, Take away the three. They didn't allow another three-point shot. We
said, Get on the boards. We took care of the boards.  
Again, it just comes back really to one statistic: we absolutely could not
find a way to make the ball go in the hole today. Lesson learned. That's going
to happen. Again, I hope this is one more lesson that we've learned. You have
to make stops on the other end and go back down and not force shots.  
I thought we got in a hurry. Sometimes we were always trying to create our own
shots at times. Stay within the offense, and those are things you learn in
experience.  
Then I can't repeat the other things I said, so there you go (laughter).  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much.  
COACH LADNER: Thank you.

THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Alabama. We'll start off with an opening
statement with Coach Hudson. Your thoughts on the game today.  
COACH HUDSON: I thought we played hard. But I thought we did not shoot the
ball very well. When we're not shooting the ball very well, we're not as good
of a basketball team. Did not play as well as we needed to play together I
thought early.  
I thought we still had some wide-open looks. Shooting 24% for the game,
against a team like LSU, it's going to be tough to come out on top.  
Turnover-wise I was happy with that. Assist-wise, because we didn't shoot the
ball very well, that didn't help. LSU did a good job. The way they played
defensively halfcourt, didn't do a lot of things we didn't expect them to do,
just make you make shots, and we didn't do a very good job of making shots.  
THE MODERATOR: Tierney, your thoughts on today's game?  
TIERNEY JENKINS: Like coach said, we really didn't shoot the ball well. That's
how we get into our game plan as far as defensively is to make shots and then
press. When you're not making shots, it's kind of hard to play how you like to
play.  
Like Coach Hudson said, we played hard, but we just didn't make shots.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athlete.  
  
Q. I know you're unhappy with today. Talk about what you were able to do
with this team, getting them through February, turned around the season.  
TIERNEY JENKINS: Just being a senior leader, I knew this was my last go-
around. When I first came to Alabama, I knew it wouldn't be an easy process. I
felt we were going the right direction.  
Coach Hudson, the coaches do a great job of recruiting each year. We set a
goal this year as far as what we wanted to do. This is my last turn. I wanted
to do whatever I could as far as helping the team, so I did that.  
  
Q. You couldn't make a basket to start the game. How frustrating was it that
you couldn't close that gap even though they left the door open?  
TIERNEY JENKINS: It was tough for us. We kept saying, Get stops on defense,
get stops on defense. There was like a stretch where we got some stops on
defense and took good shots. Just wouldn't go in. Gets kind of frustrating.  
You have a young team, your mindset is you're getting stops on defense, but
you're still not scoring. I think that definitely played a factor into
tonight.  
  
Q. Coach, are you guys looking at maybe a WNIT or something like that down
the road?  
COACH HUDSON: We want to continue to play, post-season play. If we can get
into the WNIT, we'd love to continue to play. I think we have worked hard
enough and played in this league. We've had a great February, got things kind
of turned around, headed in the right direction.  
It would be really nice to continue to play.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll dismiss the student-athlete. We'll continue with
questions for Coach Hudson.  
  
Q. Did you see an opening at the start of the second half?  
COACH HUDSON: We talked about that at halftime. We hadn't played very well. We
were still in the basketball game. You look at the halftime score, we thought,
Okay, if we can come out, make a couple stops, get a couple baskets. Had some
good looks, but just did not make a couple of baskets.  
Basketball is one of those games where you can play on the defensive end all
you want, but eventually you got to be able to score some points. We didn't do
a very good job of finishing the plays.  
I thought the opening was definitely there start of the second half.  
  
Q. Talk Barrett's play today. She was inside, outside, rebounded.  
COACH HUDSON: That's the key. She was inside, then she was outside. She made
some big three-point shots. I thought we were pressing them. They turned the
ball over three or four times. She stepped up and made a big three-pointer out
of the corner there - I remember that one after we came out of the press -
that really hurt from our standpoint. I thought she just played a great all-
around game. I don't know if she had a turnover. I think she had one turnover,
played really well.  
Not only that, but defensively I thought she did a very good job of causing us
some trouble when we got the ball inside.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much, coach.  
COACH HUDSON: Thank you.

# [SOUTHEASTERN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=SOUTHEASTERN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 3, 2011

  

### [Markeshia Grant](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21774)

### [Dawn Staley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15625)

### [Ieasia Walker](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21773)

  
_NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're ready to begin with South Carolina. We'll go with an
opening statement from Coach Staley.  
COACH STALEY: I thought we came out making a conscious effort to push the ball
down the floor. I thought our offense was pretty good to put up 30 points in
the first half. I just thought we lacked in what got us here, which was our
defensive tenacity and rebounding.  
But I thought we closed the gap in the second half. I thought our players gave
us a gutsy performance.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll have opening statements from each of the players.
Markeshia, your thoughts on the game tonight.  
MARKESHIA GRANT: I just think we came out ready to win. We came out
aggressive. Our defense in the first half, we were a little slow, but in the
second half we came out and we just started executing.  
THE MODERATOR: Ieasia, your thoughts on the game tonight?  
IEASIA WALKER: I think in the first half, we were more efficient on offense
and in the second half we picked it up on the defensive end. They did a good
job crashing the boards. Second half we closed the gap. It was a hard fought
game and a good win for us.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Tight, hard-fought game. Do you like that going into the second day?  
IEASIA WALKER: Yes and no. Yes, because you know what to expect. You know how
to come out the next game. But no, because you're going to be a little tired,
aches and pains. Have you to be mentally tough and just get through it.  
MARKESHIA GRANT: This is my first time here, so... I'm just hyper. I'm just
glad to be here. I want to bring the same intensity tomorrow, so...  
THE MODERATOR: We'll dismiss the student-athletes and continue with Coach
Staley.  
  
Q. Struggling from three-point range, what were you doing to limit them?  
COACH STALEY: One of the keys for us was not to allow them any three-pointers.
I think we were just trying to just make them put the ball on the floor. We
were giving a lot of help. We were trying to make sure we weren't giving up
any threes, keep them out of the paint. I think our players for the most part
executed that part of it.  
We sent them to the line a lot, but that was due to how we were playing
defensively. We just got ourselves out of position in rebounding, box out.  
  
Q. There was a point in the second half where you were getting some good
lay-ins, stretched the lead out to 10. Did you figure you needed that lead?  
COACH STALEY: Absolutely. We've never blown any teams out. All the games are
going to be close with us. If we can give ourselves a cushion, you know,
probably a 10-plus cushion down the stretch, it's only going to benefit us. We
do have to factor in that we're not shooting free throws extreme think well at
this time. We need that cushion in order for us to ensure a victory.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much, coach. Good luck tomorrow night.  
COACH STALEY: Thank you.

# [SOUTHEASTERN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=SOUTHEASTERN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 3, 2011

  

### [Nell Fortner](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13860)

### [Chantel Hilliard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21781)

### [Alli Smalley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20504)

  
_NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, opening thoughts?  
COACH FORTNER: No question, it's disappointing to lose. Especially when you
have a senior as good as Alli Smalley, what a tremendous career she's had at
Auburn. Just so proud of her. I hate that we lost this first game because I
thought she played her tail off tonight, like a senior does.  
But I thought we got ourselves to the free-throw line. That's one of the
things we like to do. But obviously we didn't knock down enough free throws to
win the ballgame. That's part of our offense. Just kept us from winning the
game.  
THE MODERATOR: Alli, your thoughts on the game this evening?  
ALLI SMALLEY: Mississippi State came out and executed a lot better than we
did. We had a lot of breakdowns defensively. We didn't play with the energy we
needed to win a game in the SEC tournament.  
THE MODERATOR: Chantel, your thoughts on tonight's game?  
CHANTEL HILLIARD: They just came out and they just executed better. We had a
lot of breakdowns like they said. That's something we just had to clean up. By
the time we started doing it, it was just too late.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Take us through the last play.  
ALLI SMALLEY: Yeah, that was exactly the look we were wanting to get. I came
off of two screens. I had some daylight in the corner. I was a little bit
behind the backboard, but it was a shot I should have hit. Just a tough break.  
  
Q. Chantel, as Mississippi State started breaking down the lead, chipping
into it, did you gather around and point out a couple things you were maybe
trying to do? As they started to build into that lead, what were you saying to
each other?  
CHANTEL HILLIARD: We were talking about how we need to get it together. Alli
got us together quickly, told us what we needed to do. We just talked about
what we needed to do.  
  
Q. Chantel, when you were making your run, it seemed like there was a lot of
down low happening. How did they start defending that?  
CHANTEL HILLIARD: We wanted to get the ball inside. That was what coach wanted
us to do. They started double-teaming me. It was my job to know that I could
shoot the ball or kick it out.  
It's kind of tough when they started double-teaming me. I had to find my
outlet. It was tough. Sometimes I forced the shot, sometimes I didn't.  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, you're excused. We'll continue with questions for
coach.  
  
Q. As Diamber starts making her run there late, scoring the last 11 points,
she was doing it in a variety of ways. How difficult is it at that point in
the game to try to control a player like that who seems to be hot?  
COACH FORTNER: It's very difficult because her confidence was soaring at that
point. She is such a versatile player as far as she can shoot the three or
take out the dribble.  
When you get a player like that whose confidence is good, you have to make
sure you cover up other shooters. When you bring help, you're leaving yourself
vulnerable someplace else. Yeah, she was hard to guard.  
  
Q. Having the ball in Alli's hands, is that pretty much the person you want
the ball in her hands?  
COACH FORTNER: Absolutely. I have a tremendous amount of confidence with the
ball in her hands. She played a lot of point tonight. The reason why is
because we thought she could get her shots off on ball screens, take advantage
of some things.  
She's a first-team all-SEC player. This is her senior year. She played hard
tonight.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much, coach.  
COACH FORTNER: Thank you.

## March 3, 2011

  

### [Sharon Fanning-Otis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16876)

### [Mary Kathryn Govero](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20538)

### [Diamber Johnson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21780)

  
_NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're here with Mississippi State. We'll go ahead with an
opening statement from Coach Fanning-Otis.  
COACH FANNING-OTIS: It's definitely a team win. Last few weeks, we've been
progressing as a team. It's really been a process in the SEC. The players have
learned to be tougher and play through adversity.  
The second half is how we've been playing basketball a lot better. The first
half, I thought we were just tentative in terms of taking the ball at them. In
fact, we got on Diamber pretty hard, You have to stick your nose in there, you
have to go take some shots, not looking to pass first. That aggressiveness is
going to be contagious for our basketball team.  
There's always somebody guarding. Obviously, these two young ladies are going
to draw a lot of attention. You have to find ways to win. May take an extra
cut, an extra screen.  
The second half, I felt like we took better care of the basketball. Our field
goal percentage went up. We kept theirs down below 40. Those were two keys. We
still got out-rebounded. But I felt we had some key boards, but made some big
plays. It was a team effort. I'm really, really proud of how they hung in
there and kept fighting.  
That second half is a reflection of how we've been playing and I hope we can
carry that over to the next basketball game.  
THE MODERATOR: Mary Kathryn, your thoughts?  
MARY KATHRYN GOVERO: It wasn't pretty, but it was a win. We'll take it. Like
she said, both teams started off shooting the ball bad. We were thankful we
were only down I think 7 at halftime. We rallied back in the second half. A
lot of credit to Diamber. She kind of put us on our back for a spell there,
took charge. Like coach said, we were able to pull out the win tonight. We had
some key rebounds when we needed them. They had a couple opportunities at the
end. Thankful to get a zero, zero, zero with more points than them.  
THE MODERATOR: Diamber?  
DIAMBER JOHNSON: Tonight's game was a great team win for us. M-Kat kept us on
our back the first half. We stayed in there, me playing bad. Our shots weren't
falling. We stayed together as a team. That's what helped us. Second half, we
were like let it all go, leave it on the floor. That's what happened.  
We started playing like we've been playing the last couple games. We stepped
up and got the win.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Diamber, I think you scored the last 11 points in the second half. Are
plays being run to you? What's going through your mind?  
DIAMBER JOHNSON: I just saw that there was a couple times I jumped at the
basket because they were all looking at M-Kat. I was just reading the defense,
not necessarily going for the play that was called.  
At that point in time, I was looking at the time. Once a couple shots started
falling, you get that feeling. I was confident. I was looking for my shot
fore.  
  
Q. Mary Kathryn, when you were down 11 in the second half, what were the
players saying to each other?  
MARY KATHRYN GOVERO: I think a lot of it was just, C'mon, y'all, let's pull
together right now. Leave it all out on the court. We knew it's win or go
home. We tried to rally together as a team.  
Whether it was going to be win or lose, we were going to leave everything we
had out there.  
  
Q. Diamber, during the second half, what got you going? What was your
motivation?  
DIAMBER JOHNSON: The first half I wasn't feeling good. I was, like, I don't
want my season to end right now. Coach kept saying, You know you don't want to
go home.  
I'm like, I don't.  
I zoned everything out, blocked everything out, just focused on what was going
on on the court. Rubbed a little dirt on it, as coach says. I'll worry about
that tonight.  
  
Q. How does this win feel?  
MARY KATHRYN GOVERO: Well, it was a must-win. If you the don't win, your
season's over. So I guess it's special just to see how far our team's come
from the beginning of the year to get to this point. When everything was on
the line, we were able to pull together, you know, step up and make big plays
together as a team, get a win. Gets us another game. I guess it's special
because it's not the end yet.  
DIAMBER JOHNSON: This game will be remembered, it's special for that reason.
It's our first win as a new team. The girls are experiencing a lot of new
things. Hopefully we'll continue to enjoy our time this weekend.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much, ladies. You're excused. We'll continue
with questions for coach.  
  
Q. Pretty symbolic of this team. Mary Kathryn and Diamber. Was this about
one player carrying the other for a little time?  
COACH FANNING-OTIS: For this team to be successful this year, those two young
ladies had to step up. They were the ones coming back with some significant
experience. Danielle Rector has been in the rotation. You had some off-season
things on people recovering for some things. 11 new faces. Three kids coming
in in December.  
It's really been a process. Our goal is to be the most improved team in the
league by the end of this season. I felt like we finished the regular season
on a very positive note.  
Now to begin today, get through this, as they're saying, the first game for
some of these young ladies, it's a whole new season when you get to the SEC
tournament, just like it is when you begin SEC play. February takes a step up.
It's special as they're growing together.  
Our goal is to be the best team we can be. We're not finished yet because you
have to put the halves together and you have to be more consistent as you go
along to win the next game.  
Hopefully we'll step up in a big way, get the jitters out and understand what
we have to do to win another ballgame. Every team in our league is a little
different, they play in a different way. You have to play your best basketball
at this time of year to keep progressing.  
  
Q. What is your assessment on Vanderbilt?  
COACH FANNING-OTIS: A very balanced team. Jence knows how to keep going to the
rim until somebody stops her, Tuomi inside. You look at Lister, all of them.
It's a very balanced team. They have good depth. They're very competitive.
Clark has been playing so aggressively.  
So I think the depth, the fact they have transition, the fact that they have
threes, hard to guard, very patient team. They're going to make as many passes
as they need to get the great shot they want. We're going to have to be a lot
smarter, play a lot harder. We didn't do a good job defending. Couple
possessions where Smalley got some good looks. We're going to have to play
better as a team so we're not isolated. We're going to have to do a better job
blocking out and contesting first shots.  
I think I didn't answer your question a minute ago as directly as I should
have with Diamber and M-Kat. This team has a number of people that can score.
It's not just those two. But how they go, their confidence, their
communication with the team, their look, even though they're playing different
positions this year as well, have a little bit different responsibility, they
will make this team go. So they have to have that right look. They have shared
that this semester as we've gotten into SEC play and, in fact, this whole
year.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.  
COACH FANNING-OTIS: Thank you very much.

# [SOUTHEASTERN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=SOUTHEASTERN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 3, 2011

  

### [Tom Collen](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18035)

### [C'eira Ricketts](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21760)

### [Sarah Watkins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21759)

  
_NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Arkansas, Coach Collen, Sarah Watkins and
C'eira Ricketts. We'll start with an opening statement from the coach.  
COACH COLLEN: It's always hard to lose. We came in here with high
expectations. I know we came in on a two-game losing streak. I was pretty
happy after we got through, being a little shell-shocked at the beginning,
pretty happy with the way our team played and fought back. I think that's a
sign of maturity, something that this team needs to continue to work at and
grow.  
I was happy with their efforts. Disappointed we lost. We know, feel pretty
comfortable we're going to be in post-season play, we have a regular-season
game to play. We'll go back, rest our bones a little bit, regroup, try to
figure out what we need to do to win the NIT, if that's where we end up.  
THE MODERATOR: Sarah, your thoughts on the game today?  
SARAH WATKINS: Even though we got down a little bit early, we made some hard
decisions, made some good plays to get back in the game. Give credit to
Florida. They played really aggressive defense.  
THE MODERATOR: C'eira, your thoughts on today's game?  
C'EIRA RICKETTS: We dug ourselves in a hole early. We fought back to cut the
lead down. Lyndsay Harris had a great shooting night for us. We had shots that
just wouldn't fall for us, but I thought we fought back hard.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. I wanted to hear your explanation on the comeback you had. Pretty
impressive comeback from 26-9. You were in it the rest of the game.  
SARAH WATKINS: I think we just got in them defensively. It's been one of our
keys all year, is to play really good defense, let that guide us on the
offensive end.  
I think we got a couple key stops, and that helped us get on a little bit of a
roll.  
C'EIRA RICKETTS: I think once Lyndsay Harris got hot on the three-point line,
that got our whole team going. We feed off of her. We feed off of each other.
I thought that got us going.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll dismiss the student-athletes and continue with Coach
Collen.  
  
Q. A couple days ago you were saying you were pretty straightforward with
your players, the NIT might be a possibility, Tennessee would be in the second
round. Taking that into account, obviously you don't like to lose, but how do
you feel about your team at this point in the season?  
COACH COLLEN: I think the hardest thing for us is that we did a lot of great
things this season. It was a season of firsts for us in many ways. But we were
so close in so many games. I think it's probably been stated before. I think
we lost six games, SEC games, on the last possession.  
I felt like going into the last week of the season, we were still in a mindset
where we really just needed to win maybe one more game, get to 7-9, 8-8,
getting into the NCAA.  
That's the tough thing. When I make the statement I think we might be the best
team in the country heading into the NIT, I believe that in my mind,
especially if Lyndsay Harris is healthy and not injured to the point where she
can't play.  
You know it's tough. I've played in the NIT or coached in the NIT many times
before. It's a great tournament. We'd rather be in the NCAA, but I think we've
got a relatively young team. We have no seniors that play. The opportunity to
get into any kind of post-season play I think would really benefit us for the
next year.  
  
Q. Seeing the comebacks you made today, does that give you confidence?  
COACH COLLEN: I think this team is being so close to not being just a good
basketball team, but a great basketball team. The best example I can give you,
we were a little shell-shocked in the last game of the year. We felt if we
could beat Alabama, we were still on the bubble. They shot 65% against us in
the first half. We got down the same way we got down today. This time when we
got down, we fought back, found a way to tie the game and a way to win.  
That's a good learning experience. If you can get down that bad and battle
back, no matter what happens, you can find a way to win. That's a great thing
for a young team to learn. I think we'll carry that forward with us. It's
going to benefit us somewhere down the line.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much. Good luck in the post-season.  
COACH COLLEN: Thank you.

# [SOUTHEASTERN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=SOUTHEASTERN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 3, 2011

  

### [Amanda Butler](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18040)

### [Jordan Jones](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21757)

### [Ndidi Madu](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21758)

  
_NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're ready for the news conference with Florida.  
Gators now have won four in a row, improving to 18-13. We have Jordan Jones
and Ndidi Madu. We'll have an opening statement from Coach Butler.  
COACH BUTLER: Just obviously really pleased. We came in with a lot of
momentum. I think we played that way in the first half, really seemed like for
a while we may just have this game in hand.  
Arkansas is a great program. Tom does a great job. A team I definitely think
is good enough to be playing in the post-season.  
To be able to hold them off, as many offensive weapons they have, to play the
type of defense down the stretch to get the win, really proud of our team and
the guts we showed, in particular to make the plays to finish it off.  
THE MODERATOR: Ndidi, your thoughts on the game today?  
NDIDI MADU: I was excited the SEC tournament was here. I just wanted to be
aggressive coming into the game. I wanted to take my shots. I just wanted to
be aggressive on the rebounds. I wanted to play good defense, do whatever I
needed to to help my team.  
THE MODERATOR: Jordan, your thoughts on the game and getting a thousand points
in your career.  
JORDAN JONES: I had no idea until they told me in the locker room. It's
special, but it's even more special it happened in a win. We're coming out
here trying to earn some respect. Having won four in a row, that's our goal.
That's what our goal was today and that's what our goal will be tomorrow.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll have questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Ndidi, you had a great rebounding game today. Talk about the challenge of
rebounding against Tennessee.  
NDIDI MADU: We had to box out and then pursue the ball. We can't get into a
jumping match with Glory or Brewer or whoever we're going against at the time.  
  
Q. Jordan, you played Tennessee twice this season. What did you learn from
those two games? What do you have to do going into tomorrow?  
JORDAN JONES: Obviously, they're a great team. It's going to be a tough
challenge. I think we're a lot different team than we were even two weeks ago.  
I think the game that we gave them at home, the game we gave them at their
place is going to be a different game than we give them tomorrow.  
We're a much more confident team, we're playing aggressive, we're playing our
best basketball right now.  
  
Q. Jordan, talk about your charge that you took late in the game. Coach
Butler has been preaching.  
JORDAN JONES: I said this before, she challenged me at the beginning of the
season to step up and take charges. I wasn't taking them at the beginning.  
Ricketts was being aggressive all game. We preach it every day in practice,
take charge, take charge. It was a huge play. It was definitely in my mind,
somebody had to step up and make a play. It just happened to be me.  
  
Q. Ndidi, obviously a first-round bye, but you did play the opening game.
Little bit of a challenge to get started this early. Do you think that will
help a little bit tomorrow? Do you like the way you started the game with a
lot of energy?  
NDIDI MADU: Yeah, I love the way we started. Playing early, it was our
advantage because we have another early game tomorrow.  
  
Q. Jordan, your thoughts about playing early today and tomorrow?  
JORDAN JONES: Obviously we know what to do tomorrow. We have a routine in
place. Gives you less time to get distracted. We can wake up focused on us and
get ready to play.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll dismiss the student-athletes and take questions for Coach
Butler.  
  
Q. Coach, how big were getting rebounds late in the game there?  
COACH BUTLER: I think aside from maybe Jordan's defensive play with the
charge, it gave us a lot of energy. Those were some of the plays of the game.
A lot of times people on the outside look at who hit the shot, what happened
on offense.  
When a team is offensively as capable as Arkansas is, us getting stops,
getting rebounds, was really where we were trying to place our emphasis.
Really proud of the fact we could hold such an offensively potent team to 59
points.  
But they were huge plays, no doubt about it, in particular some of the
offensive rebounds. Deana Allen snuck in there and made a huge play, the play
where Harris was injured. I thought we were aggressive and we knew we had to
close out the game on the defensive end.  
  
Q. It's not easy to have that opening game on Thursday. Did you like the way
you started? Would you like to bottle that up and do that again tomorrow?  
COACH BUTLER: Absolutely. We'd like a few bottles of it so if we run out in
the first bottle, we can throw some more on the second one.  
These kids and their routine, game times and stuff, these kids are getting up
and going to class at 8:00 or 9:00. Having to go to pregame on 8:00 is nothing
other than what they're doing on a normal Thursday or Friday. It's not much of
a departure from what their normal schedule is. I don't think it's a big deal,
getting up early.  
I thought we had a fantastic start. That's important for our team. It's going
to be really important for our team tomorrow, to get out of the gates quickly.  
  
Q. Have you ever had a team blow leads in the same game, up 17, come back,
push it up to 11?  
COACH BUTLER: You mean another team besides this team? We've done it several
times this year (laughter). We've had a little trouble with maintaining leads.  
I think that was that first 12 minutes or so, it was probably the best
basketball we played. I don't know that we relaxed or what happened, but we
just kind of went away from what was working. That's one of the things, we
just got to be aware of. I think that's an awareness level thing. This is
what's working, this is where our momentum is coming, keeping your foot on the
pedal in that direction.  
It's a little bit of a problem that we've had. But the difference now, as
opposed to before, is we're correcting it and we're holding on, making plays
down the stretch.  
  
Q. What do you tell your team about Tennessee, having suffered two losses to
them already, to get them motivated?  
COACH BUTLER: You know, I agree with everything Jordan said. I thought that
was very well-put. We're playing better than either of the times we played
against them. The second time we played them in Knoxville we held them to
their third lowest point total. We made some strides defensively.  
Again, I think that's where our success is rooted, is taking a lot of pride in
trying to get stops and rebounds.  
Now, is that going to be a challenge against the best offensive team in our
league? Absolutely. We'll probably have to try a few different things and see
what's working, which people are working best.  
But a huge challenge. It's real simple in one way. You said, What do you tell
your team? We want to be a championship program. There's one way to become a
championship program that's real certain in this league, and that's you have
to go through Tennessee.  
So we're excited about this opportunity. We don't look at it as, Oh, gosh, bad
seed, blah, blah, blah, whatever. It's a chance to go out and show how we're
playing, how much we believe in the things we're doing right now, a great
opportunity.  
  
Q. How hard is it to scout Tennessee when you're never quite sure who is
going to be in uniform for the game?  
COACH BUTLER: Regardless, you have to have a good grasp on all their
personnel. I think our team does. That's the advantage of playing them now for
the third time. There won't be a lot of, Who is this, what does she do? We're
familiar with them, their individual strengths and skills.  
Just like Ndidi coming right off the bat, we have to box out Johnson, we can't
jump her. I think we have an idea of what the challenges are going to look
like.  
As far as their depth, trying to construct a game plan, like I said, there's
not going to be one way to beat them. It's going to have to be two or three
different ways. I fully expect, more than anything, our team to play the best
game we've played all year tomorrow, and that's where I'll hang my hat.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you for your time.  
COACH BUTLER: Thank you.

# [SOUTHEASTERN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2011&title=SOUTHEASTERN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 3, 2011

  

### [LaSondra Barrett](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19292)

### [Van Chancellor](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18047)

### [Adrienne Webb](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21770)

  
_NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by LSU. We'll turn it over for an opening
statement from Coach Chancellor.  
COACH CHANCELLOR: Basically been a team that's made our living on defense.
Today was a great example. When you hold an Alabama team to nine points in the
first half... They got my attention.  
I thought this was a great win for us. I'm really proud of our team.  
I thought Taylor Turnbow did a great job on Jenkins today. Defensively had 12
rebounds. I thought Barrett and Webb were really great offensive sparks. Webb
just kept plugging away, and Barrett did some really good things off of some
plays we were running for her.  
I'm really pleased with this victory on this team.  
THE MODERATOR: LaSondra your thoughts on this game today?  
LaSONDRA BARRETT: I thought this was an important game for us. We were told by
the coaches before coming into this game that last year's loss to Vanderbilt
was the first time LSU lost in the first round. We kind of took that to heart
and came out and played for our seniors, just wanted to get this first win.  
Alabama was an important game because they've been playing really well towards
the end of the season. To start off with a win, give everybody a chance to
play, I thought it was great.  
THE MODERATOR: Adrienne?  
ADRIENNE WEBB: We started off pretty well. We came in here ready to play,
getting what we wanted out of our offense, taking away Alabama's offense.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Could you talk about the 13-0 run to start the game, the mentality
there.  
LaSONDRA BARRETT: Defense is what we set out every game. Their three big
threats were Jenkins, Horn, and Russell. The team goes through Jenkins and
Russell. To stop them, not get them started, will give us the edge. That's the
head of their team. We put that away, we pretty much took away Alabama's
offense.  
The 13-0 run, there were some points we couldn't score, we had to keep
chipping away, just relax on their pressure defense, just give credit as a
team effort, a team win.  
  
Q. LaSondra, did you take it upon yourself to lead this team to an important
win?  
LaSONDRA BARRETT: Every game I take a big part in it, being a leader on this
team, one of the primary players.  
I knew coming into the SEC tournament I would have to show by example. Coach
Chancellor tells me I'm the most influential person on this team. I know a lot
of things start with me, the way I come out and approach the game. Gave a lot
of energy. Maybe some people could feed off of me. And vice versa, I could
feed off of them, too. That was my mindset, coming out the first 5 or 10
minutes, making a statement.  
  
Q. Adrienne, when the rest of you see her playing that well, what does that
do to your confidence level?  
ADRIENNE WEBB: I believe it raises our confidence level. Every time she comes
out, plays with a lot of energy, knocks down shots, every time we're feeding
off of her also.  
Whenever she comes out ready to play, everybody else is going to come out
ready to play. She's one of our leaders on the team.  
COACH CHANCELLOR: I thought Kathy Graham was on the defensive team. She did a
great job on Ericka Russell. Russell only had 9 points on 3 of 10 shooting. I
thought those two defensive stops were really big for us.  
  
Q. How big do you think this game was? You're trying to play your way off
the bubble, get in the NCAA tournament.  
LaSONDRA BARRETT: We don't really look much to the NCAA tournament. Of course,
it's important to us. Our main focus was getting this first win for the SEC
tournament. That's the only thing we can control right now, just coming in and
getting this first-round win and moving on to Kentucky.  
We try not to put too much pressure or think about the NCAA. Just come out,
take it game by game. Now our focus is Kentucky.  
  
Q. (Question regarding Kentucky.)  
ADRIENNE WEBB: It's a big game to play. We just have to come out with a lot of
energy, play like we did today. If we play like we did today, we'll come out
with a W.  
THE MODERATOR: LaSondra, any thoughts on the Kentucky game tomorrow?  
LaSONDRA BARRETT: Absolutely. Everything Adrienne said. They're one of the
premiere teams in this league, in nation. It's going to be a fight. We have a
sour taste in our mouth from Lexington. It's going to be a battle because they
have tremendous athletes and they're well-coached.  
Like I said, we're going to prepare back at the hotel, come out the way LSU
does, hopefully just carry this momentum from this Alabama win over to
Kentucky tomorrow.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll dismiss the student-athletes and continue with Coach
Chancellor.  
  
Q. Talk about the importance of being able to give your starters some
rest?  
COACH CHANCELLOR: First of all, I thought we just had to win this game. That's
all there is to it. We got to win. We brought in our subs and I thought they
played really, really well. That let me let Graham and Lutley out longer than
I would. I let Eason set out. That let three starters take some time out. That
was really big.  
Lots of time when you get a game under your belt in this tournament, you
usually come back out and play pretty good. This was a great win for us today.  
  
Q. You needed this win for the NCAAs. How important do you think that
Kentucky game is?  
COACH CHANCELLOR: I'm not on the NCAA committee. But if a UCLA win on the
road, now won nine SEC games, have played Tennessee twice, Connecticut. If
we're not an NCAA team, I don't know what it takes to be one.  
I did think we had to win this game. But that's just my own personal opinion.
Usually if you win eight games in this league, you can win a game at the
tournament, that's a pretty good situation.  
We do have a major-league road win at UCLA against a top-10 team. Name me
another bubble team that's got one of those - and on the road, not at home.  
I'm not on the committee. I don't run it. Just giving you my opinion. My
opinion used to be 50 cents could get you a cup of coffee, takes $1.50, $1.75
today. That's one of the biggest things that's changed in my life, that and
cell phones. But that's neither here nor there.  
Next question.  
  
Q. Besides the big run early, midway through the second half, you pulled
away a little bit. That seemed to be a pretty good stretch.  
COACH CHANCELLOR: I thought the two keys of the game, we opened up with a run.
We didn't want to give Alabama any confidence. They've been playing really
well. Had 92 against Arkansas. Had beat some nice teams. We didn't want to
give them a start.  
We went in at halftime and told them we had to come out at halftime and not
give off any points, shut them down. We controlled the first five minutes of
each half. I thought that was the difference in the game.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much.  
COACH CHANCELLOR: Thank you. It sure is good to be hanging around another day.
I'll tell you that right now.
