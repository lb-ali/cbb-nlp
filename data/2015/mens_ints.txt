_HARTFORD, CONNECTICUT_  
  

SMU - 62  
CONNECTICUT - 54

  
MODERATOR: Ladies and gentlemen, we welcome from SMU Mustangs Head Coach Larry
Brown, Cannen Cunningham, Yanick Moreira and Ryan Manuel. This will be their
first NCAA Tournament appearance since 1993 with the American Athletic
Conference championship. It's their first conference championship since 1998.
Coach, an opening statement?  
COACH BROWN: Yeah, I just want to admire what Connecticut was able to do,
after we got such a big lead and the character they showed to come back. It's
never easy playing against Kevin, and it's amazing when you play in an
atmosphere like this and you realize the tradition they have and you
understand why.  
About my team, I don't know if any team had to go on a home court to win a
conference tournament. I'm so proud of them. These seniors have been amazing.
Matt Doherty should be up here with me because he left me with an unbelievable
group of guys. And I celebrate with him. And the greatest thing is we don't
have to worry about anybody letting us know whether we're worthy of going or
not. Sunday last year at this time was about as disappointing as it could get
based on the body of work that these kids did, but fortunately we've got
another opportunity and didn't have to get anybody to decide whether we're
worthy or not. I'm proud of all these guys for that.  
MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach. Just a couple questions for the players. SMU will
make them available but we want to get them out to watch the show.  
  
Q. Can you guys talk about briefly what it means to each of you to come away
with that win at the end of the season and going into the NCAAs with
momentum?  
RYAN MANUEL: This is big for all of us, not just the seniors but it's as big
for SMU as a school, as a basketball program. You know, when Coach Brown got
here, he wanted us to put it back on the map and I think we made great strides
in that. Although we not going to be here next year, I think it's setting a
stepping stone for what SMU can be for years to come.  
  
Q. Ryan, if you could just talk about what this means to the school? First
NCAA appearance since 1993 especially after what happened last year?  
RYAN MANUEL: Means a lot. Like I just said, you know, put in this hard work
and like Coach Brown said, we don't want to leave it in anybody's hands and we
don't want to depend on anybody, it's up to us and the coaches. For us to come
out here and get a victory at UConn it just speaks to what we've done this
whole year going through adversity and once again we prevail.  
  
Q. How much more difficult was it for you guys in the second half with Ryan
out there for UConn?  
RYAN MANUEL: I mean, he's a shot blocker, so it made it a little difficult,
but every team makes their runs, and UConn, they have a tradition of coming
back and we knew they weren't going to go down without a fight, so just for us
to stand there all of us as a team and to get the win, it speaks to the
maturity of our team.  
  
Q. Despite the momentum that this crowd was giving UConn earlier, you guys
still maintained your composure. How do you take that poise that you had in
today's game moving into the tournament?  
CANNEN CUNNINGHAM: I think it's big. The Coach mentioned that nobody else in
the country probably had to play a road game for their conference
championship, but we only have neutral games ahead of us. Our fans travel well
and we appreciate that. It was a good test and I think we passed today going
against this crowd because they really carry that team.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about what you guys did down low, especially in the
first half, you got them into foul trouble early and you kind of dominated in
the paint?  
YANICK MOREIRA: We just trying to get the ball to the post and trying to find
open shooters. We knew they was going to double the post so we was just trying
to find a teammate.  
MODERATOR: All right, gentlemen. Go find out where you're playing next.
Questions for coach.  
  
Q. The same question, Kennedy, early especially in the first half, you got
their bigs in foul trouble really early and Kennedy kind of dominated. Was
that the strategy going in to try to take it right at their big men?  
COACH BROWN: That's how we play. Nic Moore didn't shoot the ball very well
this whole tournament. Obviously when you're the Player of the Year, a lot of
people kind of focus on you, but we have four big people that we feel can
contribute. They all can catch, they all can pass, they're all post presence,
and we tried very hard to get it -- you get it down low, you get a chance to
get a second shot or get fouled but really keep them out of transition. We
didn't do a good job second half doing that, we got a little anxious. Ryan did
a marvelous job. I know they had the defensive Player of the Year but there's
no way you can have -- you ought to have a separate one for a perimeter guy
and a post guy because, you know, the young big kid is phenomenal, his
effort's great, he just protects everybody, and I don't take anything away
from him. He changed the whole game the second half. But when you look at this
league and you look at all the wonderful point guards and two guards in this
league, you've got to have a big-time defender in the backcourt and I don't
know of anyone any better than Ryan, I don't know of any better player,
perimeter player than Boatright, and we did a wonderful job on him. I thought
that was the key.  
  
Q. Larry, can you talk about just what you touched on earlier about kind of
what this means to you a year later after what went down last year and then
this year's completely different?  
COACH BROWN: Well, I mean, the validation of last year was Connecticut winning
the National Championship being an 8 seed, watching Louisville and Cincinnati,
and I think Memphis got in, I'm not sure, I don't know. I was proud of our
conference. We almost, you know, won everything. The women won, the men won, I
think Rutgers won the NIT. We were an out-of-bounds call away from winning the
NIT, and we got great experience playing in the NIT. I didn't say anything
last year, but that, to me, when I saw Louisville the 4th seed. So I told the
kids all year, we don't need to let anybody determine our fate. Reminded me
when Coach Smith was down 1 against Georgetown, he told everybody we were
exactly where we wanted to be, we had Michael and we had a chance to win it.
But to come in here and win on the road against such a courageous team because
Connecticut, they had to win some unbelievable games to put themselves in this
position. I have so much admiration for them, but I'm hopeful our guys are
enjoying this moment because it doesn't -- it just doesn't always happen.  
  
Q. Last year Louisville was a 4 seed, Connecticut was a 7, of course you
guys were omitted from the field. Are you concerned this year about the
perception of the conference when it comes to seeding now that you do have
your bid?  
COACH BROWN: My hope is Connecticut, Tulsa, Temple get in. My hope is that
they realize this is a quality conference. I hope like crazy that they get a
chance to defend the championship. But I don't know, that's out of my hands. I
can just tell you from a personal standpoint every game we play in this
conference to me is against a quality program with a great coach. And to come
out on top is very exciting, but I'm hopeful, I don't want people to go
through what we went through.  
  
Q. Larry, I asked Nic the other day about your superstitions and he said he
didn't know anything about it. Do you try to keep that away from the players,
is that just with the assistant coaches? Is that tie safe, is that going to
the NCAA Tournament? Do you have a bus driver picked out yet?  
COACH BROWN: Well, our bus driver's the guy that we got beat against
Connecticut last time we were here but we forgot to tip him, so we decided to
bring him back. Yeah, ties are important. This thing's important more so than
anything. I don't share that, they think I'm crazy enough as it is, I don't
want to get them to have any ammunition to prove that point.  
  
Q. Coach Brown, congratulations. I had a chance to work with Brown and Moore
with the Global Sports Academy this past summer, really enjoyed them and their
personalities and we obviously share some contacts. I saw earlier in the game
you made a few gestures, a few pounds to Nic Moore, you grabbed him by the
cheeks and just encouraged him. I'm just curious if you could say a few things
about the importance of building relationships with the kids you coach?  
COACH BROWN: Well, again, Matt had a lot to do, a lot of people we have and my
staff, but my coach was all about the kids. Sometimes I do some things I'm not
really proud of, but I think they know I care. Nic's had a hard time with me,
it's been a real difficult adjustment. He played for Tim and then all of a
sudden now I become the head coach and things I'm asking him to do are
sometimes, they might take away what he's capable of doing but it's necessary
for our club. But my coach was direct and honest with me and I think I was
able to take it because I knew how much he cared. I hope my players understand
that.  
  
Q. Earlier this weekend you talked about your relationship with Jeff Lebo.
Obviously you have a relationship with Kevin Ollie as well. Can you discuss
your feelings for him and do you see some of your coaching when you watch what
UConn does?  
COACH BROWN: I mean, anybody that's ever been around him would send their son
to play for him. He's all about what our profession should be. It's all about
teaching these kids to grow up and be responsible young men, which is not easy
based on how a lot of them are brought up with people hesitating to tell them
what they need to be told, people reluctant to coach them, people to talk
about things outside of basketball that they're going to value for the rest of
their lives and that's what he's about.  
I have no fun coaching against him or Jeff, but last year was one of the
neatest experiences of my life, watching the NCAA championship and knowing it
couldn't have been a more deserving program or a more deserving kid. Like
Coach talked about a tree, I've got a forest right now, and the forest right
now is because of him, so I celebrate when I see things like that happen to
players that have meant a lot to me.  
MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach. Good luck.

_HARTFORD, CONNECTICUT_  
  

SMU - 62  
CONNECTICUT - 54

  
MODERATOR: Welcome to the stage from the University of Connecticut Huskies,
Head Coach Kevin Ollie, senior Ryan Boatright and sophomore Rodney Purvis. We
would like to ask Coach for an opening statement, please?  
COACH OLLIE: First, I want to congratulate SMU and Larry Brown and all his
players for a terrific season and then finishing off with the championship. So
hats off to them. We didn't give it away, they came and took it, and that's a
great team where we faced. I thought our guys fought again, we just can't get
down by 17 to a team like this and then we try to come back at the end, but
you've got to play perfect basketball. But so proud of my guys. Nobody thought
we would be in this championship game and for us to get here is a great
accomplishment for them, and to Ryan Boatright right, our senior and the heart
of our team, I just want to thank him for, and I know playing in front of
these fans for the last time, he's just a warrior. I love him to death. I know
Purv is going to take this experience and come back and be even better, a
basketball player and better man next year for us.  
MODERATOR: Questions for our student-athletes?  
  
Q. Ryan, I guess just your emotions right now, knowing that this is your
last game at Hartford in all likelihood. Just your emotions overall and
falling a little bit short here in this championship game.  
RYAN BOATRIGHT: I'm extremely proud of my teammates. They came out and they
battled. I know Purvis had a tremendous game, he stepped up huge. I'm just
disappointed in my play. I missed a lot of shots that should be easy knock-
down shots for me. You know, I just ain't show up and be the player I know I
can be, I can be better than that. But my teammates fought, man, they played a
tremendous game man. This being my last game, I'm just disappointed that I
played like that.  
  
Q. Rodney, with your teammates struggling, did you feel a need to try to
take over the game a little bit?  
RODNEY PURVIS: No, I just was trying to be aggressive and take what the
defense gave me, that was the main thing.  
  
Q. For Rodney, obviously the last couple days and the season gave you
confidence you could come back, and when you get it down to 6 six with about
five to go, were you guys feeling good, thought you could do it again?  
RODNEY PURVIS: Definitely, I gave up an offensive rebound. Coach been telling
me to hit all year, I have to take ownership and work on that area. I can take
the blame for missing the offensive rebound and that kind of changed the game.  
  
Q. This is for Ryan. Ryan, what was SMU doing to you defensively? And were
you happy with the looks you got today?  
RYAN BOATRIGHT: Yeah, every 3 point shot that I took, I felt was a good look
except the ones that I had to take with two, three seconds on the shot clock.
I was just off, just off night for me. Missed a few shots, tried to get to the
rim, didn't get to the foul line, them didn't go my way. But I'm a man though,
I can take it, I can take it on the chest. I'm going to move on and keep
working.  
  
Q. Ryan, obviously in the last four years a lot of ups and downs for the
team, but for you personally as well, some on the court, some life's lessons.
Could you put into words what this experience has been like for you, good,
bad, indifferent?  
RYAN BOATRIGHT: I mean, I can't really put it into words. All I can say is I
became a man here at the University of UConn. Came in an 18 year old, immature
kid and I'm leaving a grown man. I learned a lot from my teammates and from KO
as a ball player and as a person. I'm just happy and thankful for the
opportunity to play at the University of Connecticut.  
MODERATOR: Anyone else? Okay, thank you, gentlemen. Questions for Coach Ollie?  
  
Q. Kevin, what was the main message you said to the team after the game
today and just encapsulating the whole season and the game itself?  
COACH OLLIE: Yeah, the season not over with. I had pride in them. I was happy
in they effort. They showed a lot of resilience and a lot of heart, a lot of
hustle. Like I told you, a lot of people didn't think we was going to be in
the championship game so that's an accomplishment in itself. Of course we
wanted to win it, this is the second year in a row that we put our self in the
opportunity to win it, and just came up short. I'm very, very proud of these
guys. They played with heart. We down two players with Sam being out and
Kentan being out. You know, these guys really stepped up and we pretty much
got eight guys with healthy bodies. So very proud of these guys. The heart
they showed, and this crowd was wonderful and I just want to thank them all
for being behind us and supporting us the way they did the whole season with
the ups and down that this team had. I told them in the locker room that gifts
and blessings don't happen immediately all the time, you've got to go through
experiences like this and really understand how it feels and what you're
gaining from it and the inner strength that you get from experiences like
this. And I think they're going to get inner strength as people and come back
even stronger when we get in this position again next year and take it home
when we got the opportunity.  
  
Q. Obviously four games in four days is tough. How much was a fatigue a
factor and how much did the crowd give you a lift?  
COACH OLLIE: The crowd was wonderful, as I keep saying, couldn't ask for a
better crowd, couldn't ask for a better family in supporting us and just
giving us a push. But you know, it's tough on your body. You've got four
games, Ryan's been playing every minute and I know he takes a lot of blame but
it's no blame on that kid. That kid's got heart, got desire. I go with him any
day. Just for Rodney to step up was great, but Ryan has been a soldier and we
wouldn't have been in this situation if it wasn't for his stellar play down
the stretch and throughout the whole season. He's kept these guys together not
just on points or rebounds or assists. Pretty much led us in a lot of
categories but just the heart and the leadership that he showed through the
ups and downs was something special. You know, we not going to say our
goodbyes to him yet because we still have a post-season left, but I'm going to
miss him.  
  
Q. Obviously you guys are going to be disappointed not making the NCAA
Tournament. Now with the NIT most likely going to happen --  
COACH OLLIE: Who knows?  
  
Q. Is it going to be hard for them to gear up for that?  
COACH OLLIE: Why? You put on a UConn jersey. If you can't get geared up, then
I don't want you on my team. So, no, you put on UConn jersey. It's important
when you put that jersey on and that's my message.  
  
Q. If it is the NIT, what can you get out of it, how can your team grow and
develop from that experience?  
COACH OLLIE: Post-season play. You lose, you go home. That's what you get out
of it, it's experience. As a man, you grow up, you have experiences and your
mama whoop you and you go back and you learn from it. Just like everything in
life, you got post-season. There's no next day. So these guys are learning
from it. If it's NIT or NCAA, they going to learn from it and they going to
come back better from it. I am still coach them the way I coach them. They
still going to play the way they going to play. We've got to make better
plays. We've got to be more poised. I can break the game down, we got the game
down in five, we missed a defensive rebound and we fouled with three seconds
on the clock three times. Three times. So we got to be poised in those
situations. But man, I love these guys, and they fought like champions and
hopefully our fans are proud of them.  
MODERATOR: All right, Kevin, good luck the rest of the way.

TULSA - 42

  
MODERATOR: Gentlemen, ladies, we would like to welcome from the Tulsa Golden
Hurricane Head Coach Frank Haith, junior guards James Woodard, and Rashad Ray.
Coach, can you give us an opening statement?  
COACH HAITH: Obviously it was a tough loss for us. I thought our guys competed
their butts off. We played extremely hard, we played to win. We rebounded the
ball well. Under the circumstances, you know, playing in a tournament setting,
the atmosphere today, and I thought our guys handled everything well, other
than just win the game at the end.  
MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach. Questions?  
  
Q. James, do you feel like this is a game that y'all had in grasp and it
slipped away or was it more UConn just making those plays late in the game?  
JAMES WOODARD: We came out, we competed hard, we did, we felt like we did a
good job throughout the game except the last four minutes they took control.
If you don't shut out a game, anything can happen in college basketball. Hats
off to UConn and they just finished the game.  
  
Q. Rashad, can you talk about you guys had the 10-point lead with 6:35 to
play after that layup. What happened from that point on? Did they just shut
you down on defense or was it nerves, was it the crowd, what was it?  
RASHAD RAY: I just think us not being disciplined and just going through our
plays and stuff like that. I just think we should have just been more
aggressive with the ball and just, yeah, hats off to UConn about having a
great defensive effort on us.  
  
Q. For both you guys, this is a pretty tough place to play. Do you think
that that had any effect on y'all late in the game when the team is coming
back and the crowd's really into it?  
JAMES WOODARD: They just played pretty good, they strung together a run, they
got defensive stops and we failed on defense. Like I said earlier, you don't
-- play 40 minutes and anything can happen.  
  
Q. James, do you feel you guys have done enough at this point to have earned
an NCAA bid and kind of make your case?  
JAMES WOODARD: Just it's in the committee's hands, you know. We just playing
one game at a time. We just going to let the NCAA committee, whatever that is,
just handle it itself. We just worried about Tulsa. Whatever happens, happens.  
  
Q. This is for the players. The UConn defense was incredible toward the end
of that game. What made them so difficult to face today?  
JAMES WOODARD: I think they just tightened up. They got more aggressive. Then
we did a great job rebounding, but down the stretch they closed out
possessions on rebounds and made plays.  
MODERATOR: Anything else? Thank you, gentlemen.

_HARTFORD, CONNECTICUT_  
  

SMU - 69  
TEMPLE - 56

  
MODERATOR: Gentlemen, ladies, welcome to the podium from the Temple Owls Head
Coach Fran Dunphy, Quentin DeCosey and Jesse Morgan. After an opening
statement from Coach Dunphy we'll take questions for the players. Coach?  
COACH DUNPHY: I thought we were in pretty good shape throughout most of the
first half. We made a basket right away in the second half that put us in
decent position and then I thought it got away from us a little bit. I thought
we had some decent shots in the second half, some decent looks. I thought we
may have rushed it a few times. Did we shoot poor shots? Not necessarily, but
we shot some quick shots that didn't go, and I think against this team,
because they are so efficient, that when you get your opportunities, you must
make it good and we obviously didn't shoot it very well in the second half at
all. 2 for 16 on 3 will probably hurt you. So we struggled with that and they
are -- they're a really good team. I thought, when I look at the box score and
you see Moore's numbers, and I thought we did a pretty good job but his 3 in
the second half was a killer, it took it from 4 to 7. We just didn't get out
on them quick enough. I thought that gave them a little bit of separation and
I thought they did a good job from that point on. Again, we had some good
looks but we couldn't knock anything down.  
  
Q. For both players, what are the next 24 or so hours going to be like
waiting to see if you guys hear your name on Selection Sunday in?  
JESSE MORGAN: We've just got to, you know, focus and locked in and just be
ready for, you know, whatever's next.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about what it was like when Jaylen Bond picked up his
fourth foul and you knew you were going to be most of the second half without
him?  
QUENTIN DeCOSEY: It really hurt us when he picked up his fourth foul. We knew
we would have to go small so they hurt us a little bit on the inside getting
rebounds, second chances, so that really hurt us when he went out.  
  
Q. Q, especially you having to play like a power forward, just talk about
how tough it is going up against that big physical front line that they had.  
QUENTIN DeCOSEY: It was a tough challenge. I was up for the test but they got
a couple rebounds second chances that hurt us and they got some separation in
the second half.  
  
Q. What is it that SMU does in the second half of the games that kind of
limits you guys offensively?  
JESSE MORGAN: I mean, just like Coach said, they're very efficient offense, so
we got -- me, myself, I got a little carried away, just my emotions, I guess.
I wanted to beat that team so bad, and trying, you know, be a leader. You
know, we rushed some shots. We wasn't very poised down the stretch and they
took advantage of that. That's what they do well, they take advantage of your
mistakes and they've got a senior point guard who's a leader, he led them
tonight.  
  
Q. Conference tournament, obviously it's rare that you guys play back-to-
back days. What was that like? I know Jalen had an ankle injury, Will had a
couple bumps, can you talk about the struggles playing back-to-back days?  
JESSE MORGAN: I really don't think it was a struggle. You know, you come out
and play basketball. You know, we just -- they played a little harder the 40
minutes. Just that quick turnaround is kind of what you want, when you get a
chance to just play basketball, it's not about the X's and O's; you get to go
out and play together as a team. We've just got to continue to push forward
and kind of worry about what's next.  
  
Q. Jesse, it looked like you guys might have employed, you know, defending
Nic the same way you guys guarded Boatright a week ago. Was it a matter of
some of the other guys knocking down some of the open looks that they got?  
JESSE MORGAN: I mean, yeah. I mean, we try to do a good job and cut the head
off the snake but other guys for the team stepped up. You know, their bigs did
a great job tonight and they played as a team, so they pulled out the win.  
MODERATOR: All right, gentlemen, thank you very much. Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. When Jaylen picked up his third foul, you elected to keep him on the
court. Just what factored into that decision?  
COACH DUNPHY: It was relatively early, and I was hoping he could stay out of
foul trouble and I thought his fourth foul was an interesting call. I thought
he made a pretty good play on it, I didn't think there was much contact there.
I'll wait and see the film and see if it was. You just take your chances at
that point. You could feel that we needed him in there, that they were going
to go even more inside, and just you're hoping that he doesn't pick it up
right away. It was an interesting play, to say the least.  
  
Q. Fran, all three games against SMU, you had foul trouble in the front
court whether it be Watson, Bond, Obi in the first game. Do you look back and
think or coming into this game do you think could you play things a little
differently to try to avoid that?  
COACH DUNPHY: We probably could have played some zone but I thought zone would
hurt us against those guys. Again, I thought we did a really good job against
Nic Moore. We don't rebound very well in zone and I think we have a little bit
of an issue with that, and obviously that was somewhat of an issue today. They
got 11 offensive rebounds, a couple of them really stung us. I thought the
biggest issue is, again, Kennedy stepped up and made a couple really huge jump
shots for them, on hit the front of the rim, back of the rim. He made another
big jump shot at the top of the key. But you know we're a man-to-man team,
that's what we do, we stay with what we do well. We did get in obviously some
foul trouble early. We stemmed the tied a little bit in the first half and we
weren't as good at it in the second half.  
  
Q. What's your case for Temple belonging in the field of 68 in the NCAA
Tournament?  
COACH DUNPHY: Obviously I don't follow it as close as some others might. The
only time I see it is when I'm watching another game and I see a bubble team,
Temple, and so I guess I have to believe whatever is out there that the
prognosticators have it pretty much in tow. I think we've done a really good
job this year. The hope is that we've done enough and that will be in someone
else's hands other than me. We'll get together tomorrow maybe and watch it
together as a team, but really haven't decided what to do yet. We'll see. I
don't really know how to answer that. We're hopeful but whether or not it's
good enough will be in somebody else's hands.  
  
Q. Coach, beating this SMU team since there was two losses earlier this
season, obviously would have been a huge help on your resume, but how
confident are you with a big win against Kansas and other significant wins
that you guys will continue your season in the NCAA Tournament?  
COACH DUNPHY: Well, it's certainly the hope, did we do enough. Again, it will
be something that we don't have anything as a basketball team and the coaching
staff and players, it's for somebody else to decide. Hopefully we did enough.  
  
Q. Fran, I want to ask a similar question, just a little different context.
You've been coaching 26 years, this is probably the first Sunday where you're
truly on the bubble. So what kind of anxiousness, what kind of feeling? It's a
little different?  
COACH DUNPHY: Yeah, there's great angst, great angst. I didn't think a lot
about it going into the game today, I was thinking about SMU and how we were
going to play against these guys who are a really good team. But now, and I
just said it to our guys, we're in an unknown area that we're not real
familiar with, and we just kind of have to take a step back and see what this
next 24 hours brings.  
  
Q. Coach, yesterday you mentioned that you wanted to get Devin Coleman back
in in the second half, and he deserved to get back in, but the minutes didn't
work out. Today when Will Cummings went down, he seemed to be the spark. Can
you talk a little bit about Devin's performance throughout the season?  
COACH DUNPHY: Yeah, I think he's done what he could do. I think he's been a
terrific teammate, he's been a pretty good defensive player, he's done a good
job rebounding the ball. I think he will shoot it very, very well next year
when he's got a much different role for us. I thought he made a couple really
big plays for us today, a steal and a nice drive to the basket as well. I
thought overall we had some decent looks at that 3-point line. He was one of
them that had it, we just couldn't make a shot. But Devin, he's a good man and
I'm anxious for him to get what he deserves.  
  
Q. Fran, what is the status of Will's shoulder? It looked like even before
the injury he was wearing that bandage.  
COACH DUNPHY: Yeah, I think it was sore before and I didn't check with the
doctor yet, I will when we get out of here, and I'll talk to him a little bit,
but I think it's more of a bruise rather than a -- I was worried initially
that it was a separation. It doesn't appear to be that way. He seemed to be
fine when he went back in. He said I'm ready to go. I was a little surprised
that he told me that because I thought he was really in tough shape there, but
he's a pretty tough kid. He wanted to get back in, he was champing at the bit
at that point.  
  
Q. You said yesterday that Bond had the right ankle sprain but you didn't
know what his status was going to be. When did you have the idea that he was
going to be able to start for you guys?  
COACH DUNPHY: Earlier today we had a little shoot around, we didn't do much on
the full court level but he did half court and he said he felt pretty good
about it and he was with the doctor and trainer most of the afternoon as well
so I thought everybody did a good job. In the first half he did a great
rebound and stick-back, we could have used him doing that a little bit in the
second half but it didn't work out that way.  
MODERATOR: All right, Coach. Thanks so much.

SMU - 69  
TEMPLE - 56

  
COACH BROWN: I want to acknowledge something. It's pretty hard to beat a team
three times, especially a quality team with an unbelievable coach. Again, we
kind of got off to a bad start, but I thought Sterling kept us in the game. We
got behind, he made some unbelievable hustle plays, and then hit a huge 3 and
it seemed like after he made that 3, we kind of got control a little bit. We
got in real foul trouble the first half, and my assistants got on me about
playing a zone. You know, just to protect some of our players. The zone kind
of was pretty effective, I think they only scored one field goal when we went
zone late. Coach Smith's going to be upset with me about that. And then the
second half we just kind of got the ball inside a lot, and that -- you know,
when you have Yanick and Markus, Cannen and Ben, I think that really put them
on their heels. They went small. I know it affected us a lot, you know, on the
defensive end, but we had some opportunities on the offensive end. But to beat
a Temple team, a quality program like that three times, it really means a lot
to our program.  
MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach. Questions for Markus and Sterling?  
  
Q. Markus, how was Temple different without Jaylen Bond on the floor?  
MARKUS KENNEDY: You know, Jaylen's a great offensive rebounder, great overall
player and I think that without him on the floor it's a little bit easier to
get to my spots and get where I want. We played against each other our whole
lives growing up in Philly and stuff, so he kind of knows my game, I kind of
know his game and we kind of take aways stuff from each other, and without him
on the floor, it's kind of easier for me to get where I need to go.  
  
Q. Sterling, can you talk about that run early in the second half when you
guys took control and how important that was and what you guys were doing
right there?  
STERLING BROWN: We were just getting stops and executing. We talked about that
at halftime, we wanted to come out and execute and do what Coach said.  
  
Q. Markus, Philly native, obviously you came to Liacouras Center had 21
points, 7 rebounds. Today, you had 17 points. Is there something about playing
Temple you get up for?  
MARKUS KENNEDY: No. No, I guess you could say for bragging rights, you know. I
just know most of their team, I'm real good friends with a lot of them, me and
Jesse Morgan are real close, we played on the same AAU, Coach Fran recruited
me out of high school, their whole coaching staff when I was getting recruited
by them were real nice to me, always showed me a lot of love, and I think even
with my freshman year when I was at Villanova they always supported me even
though I played against them in the big five, so it was always love when I
play against Temple, but I play hard for my teammates and I know how much the
game meant to us even when we went to Temple last year, I mean during the
season it meant a lot for us as a team and I think that's what it is more than
anything is just playing harder for my teammates because I know how much this
game means.  
  
Q. All the contests between SMU and Temple have been pretty tough, physical
games this year. Do you feel like there's a rivalry developing between the two
teams?  
STERLING BROWN: I mean, I guess you can say it is but we haven't played them
long enough for it to be a rivalry. They just a good team, they like to come
out, when they compete, they run the offense, they knock down shots, it gives
us a good challenge and lately we've been standing up to it and we've been
fighting through adversity and winning.  
MARKUS KENNEDY: I like the sound of a rivalry still.  
  
Q. For both players can you talk about -- talk about the fact you started
slowly pretty much the last five games, what's up with that, and do you guys
just need to be behind to start playing well?  
MARKUS KENNEDY: Oh, man, I don't know to be honest with you, I think we just
like to get -- take a punch first, I guess. I really don't have an answer to
that. I think we just, our MO, that's one thing we can't have going forward
this season and next year and the years to come, we going to know the teams
are going to come out and give it their best shot. We no longer the underdogs,
people are going to come out and give us their best shot, everybody wants to
beat us so we can't have slow first halfs anymore.  
MODERATOR: Thank you, gentlemen. And for Coach Brown?  
  
Q. Coach, what do you guys do to kind of make Temple struggle in the second
half because in the match-ups they've really struggled in the second half
against you guys?  
COACH BROWN: I really don't know. We come out with the same mindset. Obviously
I'm not doing a real good job in the locker room prior to games if -- I didn't
realize it was five games in a row, but it has been a pattern. We've been down
double digits against Temple the two previous times. I was sad to see Cummings
go down late. I mean, he's -- that kid is as good a player as we have in our
league. Pretty confident he's going to be playing, you know, once this is
over. But I think we pay attention to detail. You know, we talk so much before
the game about getting the ball inside. I think Obi, he's going to be a great
player. Right now, like all freshmen, physically he's not right there, just
like Ben Moore, but when Bond got in foul trouble, that obviously helped our
inside game a lot and I think when you play good offense against Temple, it
affects them offensively because they can't get out and run, and Cummings is
so good in the open floor, and their game is to get into the paint and pitch,
and I think the second half we got it in so deep and got to the free throw
line we didn't get to the first half, I think that was really effective. And
then second half we just dominated the board in every game we've played
against them.  
  
Q. Coach, just talk about Markus Kennedy, not just in games against Temple
but how key he's been for you guys pretty much all season.  
COACH BROWN: Well, we didn't have him all season. You know, a lot of people
don't realize what we've lost. Losing Keith, losing Justin, not having Markus
early. This team has been through an awful lot, and to Markus to come back and
have the attitude he's had, it's been so important. And then to be humble
enough to not start, come off the bench and accept that role, not a lot of
kids with his ability would, especially this new generation, I think playing
time is such a key thing and young kids forget the object of this game is to
make your teammates better and give yourself a chance to win. He's accepted
that. But I started him the second half, he got in foul trouble, didn't play
much the first half and he did great. But he's a quality, quality player and a
really great kid.  
  
Q. Coach, back at the Liacouras Center, you said you don't like to coach
against friends. Last night, Coach Dunphy got his 500th win. Can you talk
about that a little bit?  
COACH BROWN: That was the first thing I said, I told Aaron McKie who was
responsible for about two of them, but I think everybody knows how I feel
about Fran, and it's kind of universal. The way he accepted that award was
incredible but being in Philly, and you realize the tradition at that school,
and I used to watch him work at Penn and I got the opportunity to coach a
couple of his kids at Penn. Jerome Allen always reminds me I only coached him
56 games, but he's a class act. To win 500 games is an unbelievable
accomplishment but to do it in the way that he does it is even more
remarkable. Every young coach should spend time with people like him. I can't
figure this stuff out now that they've given so many young coaches coaching
jobs and telling older guys to mentor them. I think it should work the other
way around. I look at Aaron, who I admire so much, and Aaron McKie is going to
be an unbelievable coach and he's going to be better for it, playing under
Coach Chaney and now with Coach, he's remarkable. That's a great
accomplishment.  
  
Q. Coach, like you said, it's a big accomplishment to beat this Temple team
three times, but when you took a look at the last two times you played them,
what did you really stress to your players leading up to this game? I know it
was a quick turnaround.  
COACH BROWN: Well, I stressed they thought they felt they could beat us and
that we had to make them know that we didn't feel exactly that way, and that
if we just stick to what we do and what we do best, we'll give ourselves an
opportunity to win. I didn't think it was a fluke, either game. I thought --
but I also thought we had to play great defense to win. I was scared to death
coming here. We haven't defended the three in Hartford very well. You know,
UConn last time we played made everything yesterday, East Carolina made
everything, they started out first shot, bam. I was a little concerned. Then
when I looked at the sheet, they're 4 for 24, I thought there was a misprint.
But if you limit them to one outside shot, you've got a chance. If they get
into the paint, you have no chance, and that's all we talked about.  
  
Q. Larry, could you give me your thoughts on Temple and the NCAA and if they
belong in there?  
COACH BROWN: Well, shoot, they beat Kansas when Kansas had everybody by over
20. I've talked to Bill. Bill's playing without Cliff, he's playing without
Perry Ellis, Selden's been hurt. They're playing in the finals of the Big 12.
Everybody says that's the best team. Shoot, I don't know how they judge it.
Last year on Sunday I knew how good this conference was. I didn't have any
idea that Connecticut was going to win it, it doesn't make me sad at all that
Kevin won it, but I knew how good our conference is. I know how good our
conference is now. I know since Fran has gotten those kids healthy and the
transfers eligible, if you look at their body of work, it's pretty darn good.
They had a terrible road trip. I can't imagine spending four days in Texas,
you know, playing us and then having to go to Tulsa. I think you should wipe
that road trip off the map. But they deserve it. I thought Louisville was a
top 5 or 6 team last year, thought Cincinnati, Connecticut and Memphis were
much better than 7 or 8 seeds, and I was hopeful we would get a chance. But
I'm hopeful it happens because they're a deserving team.  
  
Q. Coach, you joked about defending the three well here, not defending the
three well, excuse me. Do you have a preference on who you would want to face
tomorrow if you had the choice? Do you want to go against Kevin and kind of
get the revenge from that last match-up?  
COACH BROWN: I don't look for revenge. I don't want anybody to play poorly, I
want the best team to win. I love Kevin Ollie. You know, I mean nothing
against Tulsa, I love the way that team's played. Fran summed it up best, the
job they did and the way they competed until the last day for a championship
is remarkable, but you know, personally, Tulsa should be in and I hope people
recognize that, and it would be nice if Kevin gets the chance to defend the
championship. When I saw Boatright miss a free throw and then knock down a 3,
you know, he deserves something pretty special to happen to him. I'm just
thankful we're there and I don't wish anything bad on anybody else.  
  
Q. Do you see making the championship as kind of a turning point for SMU?  
COACH BROWN: The next game?  
  
Q. Yes.  
COACH BROWN: We had a turning point a long time ago when Keith Frazier decided
to come, and Emmanuel Mudiay decided to come, and Markus Kennedy decided to
come and Nic Moore, all these kids. This is a whole different animal now.
We're going to be here for a long time. You don't win this conference and say
the next game's the turning point. I got this silly idea, if you play 18 games
in a conference and you win the conference, that body of work is much more
significant than a three-game tournament. I can't figure that one out. I can't
figure out how you go to the NCAA Tournament with a losing record in the
conference. I haven't figured that one out. But winning the conference playing
18 games and beating the national champs twice last year and then you go ask
me if this is an accomplishment? You must be an economics major. No, I'm
kidding.  
MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach. Good luck tomorrow. They'll be tipping at 3:15 on
ESPN.

_HARTFORD, CONNECTICUT_  
  

CONNECTICUT - 47  
TULSA - 42

  
MODERATOR: Gentlemen and ladies, we're joined by, from the University of
Connecticut, Head Coach Kevin Ollie, senior Ryan Boatright, sophomore Rodney
Purvis. With this win, they'll move to the American Championship final,
tomorrow at 3:15 on ESPN. Ended the game on a 16-2 run. Coach, do you have an
opening statement?  
COACH OLLIE: Kind of loss for words, but one word that come to mind is heart.
And these guys just played with heart. We called a timeout about 3:40 to go
and everybody looked at each other and said we still believe and we've got a
will to win and they just dug in. They made big shots, we kept getting steals
and that's just a UConn tough victory. I love my guys and they didn't falter,
and we could have laid down and said no, and then that sixth man stood up and
gave us that jolt of energy and we just kept playing and grinding, and sooner
or later we're going to get you, and we got them at the end.  
MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach. Questions from the floor?  
  
Q. This is for all three of you guys. What emotions have you guys felt over
the last two nights?  
COACH OLLIE: Well, for me, you know, it's a scenario where we lose and we
don't get a bid. You know, we feel not the pressure but we feel the
opportunity. When I got soldiers like this beside me, we can't lose. We put in
the work each and every day, we buy into each other, and this is the outcome.
We went through a lot of ups and downs, a lot of pain this year, but it made
us stronger, it made us tougher and more resilient and I think these guys are
really proving it now. We've got 40 minutes in front of the best fans in
America. I'll take that any day. My feelings is the same. We're going to
overprepare so we don't underperform. We missed a lot of shots today, but our
defense is what kept us in there, especially at the end. We got kill after
kill after kill, and that's what we're about.  
  
Q. Ryan, it seemed like kind of this program is bringing out point guards
from Kemba to Shabazz to you that are just fantastic and play with such
confidence down the stretch. Is there anything that you've learned playing
under Shabazz to be able to go out and put on a performance like that?  
RYAN BOATRIGHT: Yeah, I played with the man for three years, so I learned a
lot from him with being a great leader and being on the court. The way that
used to create separation and read situations to get his shot off at the end
of shot clock situations, I just put it together with my had own mind and my
own twist to it and I learned a lot from him.  
  
Q. Ryan, this question's for you. When it comes to looking at your legacy
here at UConn and the fact that you said back in October this was your team,
you look at Shabazz, you look at Kemba. For you, what's Ryan Boatright's
legacy, and how does that weigh with each night trying to win this conference
tournament?  
RYAN BOATRIGHT: Just win, no matter what you go through, no matter what you've
got to do, you got to win. It's kill or be killed, simple as that. When you
get to the post-season, it's one loss and you're done. So I just trust in my
teammates, my teammates trust in us, and we trust in the coaching staff, and
we go out there and we fight every day for each other.  
  
Q. Coach, Daniel hadn't made a shot all night and then hit that 3. What does
that say about his poise and confidence?  
COACH OLLIE: He big-time poise, but I look at the other stats. He got 12
rebounds and most guys that's 0 for 8, they are they not doing nothing else.
He still has a nose for the basketball. You look at his stats, 12 rebounds, 5
assists. And that's what Daniel Hamilton is. If you look at versatility,
that's what he is. He stepped up with 2:39 on the clock, 0-8, stepped up and
hit a big 3, cut it to 3. And then Ryan stepped up and hit a 3. They went down
and made one free throw and then Rodney stepped up. All our guys kept
believing, and we believe in Daniel. He does so many other things on the court
and he keep believing in himself. That young man that has been through a lot
the last week, so, you know, we just thank him for, you know, just staying
with us with his grandma passing. We love him and we want him to get back on
that plane and bury his grandma with a championship. We going to keep
fighting.  
  
Q. Rodney, two-part question for you. No. 1, you came out of the under four
media timeout down 8. And I believe it was your off balance shot there in the
lane that kind of started the run that led to all the 3-pointers. Can you take
us through that play? Also, what's it like for you this year to be out on the
court for all this post-season excitement and these thrilling victories?  
RODNEY PURVIS: Well, of course it's exciting to be out here fighting with my
brothers each and every night. This is a great opportunity for us. We've got
our home crowd in here. As far as the play that I made, Coach just continued
to tell me to stay aggressive, you know, so I went to the basket, I was able
to finish. We was able to get stops mainly, that's what we pride ourself on,
is our defense, and along with the defense, came the 3s and the things like
that. So we continued to play defense. Our offense is going to take care of
itself.  
  
Q. Ryan, for most of the game, Daniel struggled and Rodney struggled from
the floor, you were kind of doing it yourself again but they stayed with it in
the last couple minutes, made the big shots. Is that, in your mind, the
difference between this team now and maybe a month ago or two months ago?  
RYAN BOATRIGHT: Definitely. These guys will tell you they self, earlier in the
year when they was not making shots, they was having a rough game, they get
down on they self. They lose confidence in they self and stuff like that.
Throughout the entire game you guys, both of them, I kept telling them we need
you, keep your head, man, you going to make a big play, especially Daniel, he
was going to make a big play. I knew it because they was keying in on me and
Rodney on each side of pick and roll. He stayed with it, he said, boy, I got
you, man. He stepped up and made a big 3.  
  
Q. This question is for Ryan. You were shooting 55 percent tonight behind
the 3. At what point in the night did you feel that was going to be your area,
that was going to be your stroke for you?  
RYAN BOATRIGHT: The second half of the season has been -- that's been my area
where I have to score. Guys, teams are so scared of me getting in the paint
and causing havoc and scoring and creating plays for each other that I knew
that's where I was going to get my shots. Earlier in the year, I was shooting
it okay, after I seen what they was doing, every day after practice I put up a
lot of shots because I knew that's the shot they was going to dare me to take,
and I've been working on it all year and knocking them down.  
  
Q. Couple weeks ago in this building, you guys beat SMU by a good amount.
What lessons from that game are you going to put into tomorrow?  
COACH OLLIE: It's going to be a whole different game. They're a better team,
we're a better team. We're going to go down and get back to the hotel. My
coaching staff is incredible. They stayed up 4:00 in the morning. We grinding,
watching tape, and we going to do the same thing. We'll take a rest on Monday
but it's no time to rest now, we're going to go back, we're going to break
down SMU, their last couple games and just know it's going to be a fighting,
like we always say. They the best team in our league. They won the conference
hands down against Tulsa that last game. There's no better way than go through
the best, and that's what we're going to have to go through to win a
championship. It's going to be a great game, game atmosphere, and I can say I
would not want it anywhere else but the XL Center, and thank God we got it
here and our crowd is going to stand up together with us and give us the
victory that we need.  
  
Q. Ryan, talking what Coach was just talking about. The crowd all night is
just begging for a run, every time you get a stop. You're down nine with five
left. How big is it that it pushes you guys or inspires you when that crowd is
going as it is?  
RYAN BOATRIGHT: Man, when you're tired and gasping for air and things ain't
going your way, that crowd is the thing that pull you through. The screaming
and emotion and the support that they give us all year through our ups and
downs, we just want to continue to fight and give them a show and give them
something to cheer for.  
  
Q. Kevin, in the three games in this tournament you've held them under 54 in
each game. What has worked defensively for you guys?  
COACH OLLIE: Just playing hard, playing aggressive. We went back to
fundamentals after the Temple loss. That's what we do, it's called Chicago
shell. We get in there each and every day. These guys roll their eyes when I
call their names out, but that don't bother me, so we give back to that
Chicago shell. We do it over and over again, and it shows up in crucial times
like this. And Amida has been great, too. Phil has been great for us. It's
just not all our perimeter guys, and I know they get a lot of credit, but
Amida is backing shots, Phil is moving his feet, and Rakim is coming in and
playing a hell of a defensive effort, too, when he gets his minutes. I know
everything is going to be written about our guards, and they're great, don't
get me wrong, but our bigs are showing up. It don't show in a lot of the stat
sheets, but they do a lot of our dirty work for us. We do it as a team.
Everybody say Ryan is the leader, which he is the leader, but all these guys
when they struggle and they still playing defense, and yeah, Ryan is carrying
the load on the offensive end, but these guys are still playing defense, so we
all do it as a team. And it's not a one man show, it's a team, it's UConn.
This is what we believe in, and our time is now, and we've got 40 more minutes
to get it done.  
MODERATOR: Thank you, gentlemen.

_HARTFORD, CONNECTICUT_  
  

TULSA - 59  
HOUSTON - 51

  
MODERATOR: Gentlemen and ladies, we're joined by Head Coach Kelvin Sampson and
junior forward Devonta Pollard from the University of Houston. Coach, would
you like to make an opening statement?  
COACH SAMPSON: I'm very proud of my team. We got up five. there were some
possessions that could have gone either way. There was a loose ball, there's a
loose ball that I felt like we had a good shot at. We get the loose ball,
we've got clear sailing and got a chance to go up 7, 37-30, I think at the
time. But Harrison makes a good play, goes in and gets the basket. All of a
sudden, now it's 35-32 instead of 37-30. It goes back and forth, you know. Two
teams just slugging it out. I didn't think there was a huge amount of
difference, I think the biggest difference was just guard play. Their guards
are good. Woodard obviously's an all-conference guy. Harrison's a good guard,
too. The little Ray kid does a nice job. And obviously Stiggers, tough kid,
he's so much better with letting someone else make the decisions. We put him
in a tough position, obviously he's not a point guard and he shows that. We
gave ourself a chance to win tonight. Disappointed we lost, but I'm not
disappointed in our effort.  
MODERATOR: Questions from the floor?  
  
Q. Coach, overall are you proud of your team's performance in the
tournament, and do you feel like you guys accomplished enough to build on this
for next season?  
COACH SAMPSON: Yeah, I think it was a Temple game, we were playing at Temple,
I think we were up 5 on Temple early in the second half and then, you know,
you can tell what we don't have and what we need to go get in certain
situations. But we came home after that game and I looked at our schedule, I
said we've got at Tulane, South Florida at home, at Tulane, I can't remember
the order, East Carolina and then the first round of the tournament. I told
our guys, we're going to have a chance to win four in a row and then we'll go
from there. What was our first game after Temple? Do you remember? What was
after Temple, South Florida at home, right? We come home, beat South Florida,
go on the road and beat Tulane, come home and really play probably our best
game of the year against East Carolina at home, I think we won by 18. Then we
come here and beat a good Tulane team. That team won at Cincinnati, they won
at Memphis, and shows you the improvement our kids made. We win that game. And
today we put ourselves in position to compete for this game. This was a
winnable game. So I think so. But more importantly I think our kids believed
that. I believe it, but it's far more important that they believe it, and you
can tell just by how they responded today after yesterday. You think about
Stiggers played 40 minutes, 40 minutes, you know. I think LeRon Barnes played
39 yesterday, these guys are playing a lot of minutes but that's what happens
when you only have seven scholarship guys. But proud of them, really, really
proud of this team's heart and the way they came together in an adverse
situation.  
  
Q. Devonta, you struggled early shooting as a team, I think you missed 10 of
your first 13. What got you going late in the first half to get back into the
game at halftime?  
DEVONTA POLLARD: I think it's just effort. As long as we just out there going
through the motions, I don't think our shots are going to fall for us anyway,
but once we turn our effort up and start to finish, start rebounding and start
getting out in open court and getting easy baskets in, then half-court sit and
our shots start falling, I think that was the difference, that was the change
that we made.  
  
Q. How did you feel when you got up by 5? Did you think you were kind of in
control at that point?  
DEVONTA POLLARD: Well, just because of how good Tulsa is, I'm not going to say
I felt like we was in control. I just felt like, you know, we had a lead that
we needed to keep, and down there in the stretch, you know, they made plays
and we had the same plays to make and we just couldn't find a way to make
them. So it wasn't that I felt like we was in control. We had the lead
obviously but we just couldn't keep it for some reason.  
MODERATOR: Thank you, very much.

_HARTFORD, CONNECTICUT_  
  

SMU - 74  
EAST CAROLINA - 68

  
MODERATOR: Ladies and gentlemen, we're joined from the ECU Pirates by Head
Coach Jeff Lebo, junior Terry Whisnant and senior Antonio Robinson, who both
contribute heavily to East Carolina's 15 made 3-pointers, which was a
conference tournament record.  
Coach, would you like to open with a statement?  
COACH LEBO: Well, congratulations to SMU, they've got a terrific basketball
team and really proud of my team and these two guys sitting beside me. We
battled our tail off, we shot the ball like we needed to shoot it to have a
chance, and our defense was really good when we didn't turn the ball over,
made some adjustments in the zone, they didn't score much in the half court on
the first shot defense was excellent. But we had some turnovers that they got
out on the break and obviously their size inside was a big difference. But
really proud of my group and in particular my seniors, Paris Roberts-Campbell
and Antonio Robinson, who was terrific today with a career-high 18 points.  
  
Q. Antonio, you had a great stat line against a nationally ranked team in
your final game. Talk about you leaving it all on the floor, and were you
looking for your shot today going into the game?  
ANTONIO ROBINSON: You know, shot was open, team has a job. A lot of teams
don't play my 3-pointer, so today I was, like, if I'm open, I'm going to shoot
it. I try to play every game like it's my last. If the ball's in there, I'm
going to try to deflect to my teammates. Every day -- I always do it on
practice, too. So practice and a game day, same thing. I try to leave it all
on the court like it's the last game.  
  
Q. Terry, obviously you struggled a little bit yesterday offensively but
coming out today and starting to hit your shot, can you talk about your
comfortability today?  
TERRY WHISNANT: I just know my teammates needed me today. Like you said, I
didn't shoot very well yesterday. Coach just talked to me, all my teammates
talked to me because they want me to shoot the ball, so I came out today,
wanted to be aggressive and wanted to get this win today.  
  
Q. You guys, great shooting the 3-pointer and missed the final 6. Was it
just being exhausted, fatigued? What led to that? Did they change their
perimeter defense?  
COACH LEBO: I'll take that one. Caleb missed three wipe-open looks that we'll
take all day long. They were big ones. As a shooter myself, I don't know why
they miss or why they make. I wish I knew that, I'd be doing something else
probably. We got good looks and as a coach I think that's what you want. And
we knew coming in we would have to shoot a lot of 3s to have a chance to win
this game. We did have a long game yesterday. I mean, SMU didn't play, but
these guys play three games a day in AAU, so back-to-back I don't think really
bothers them at all. Just couldn't make a couple of key ones down the stretch
and we got good looks. At least three of the six I thought were really good
looks by Caleb White, just couldn't put them down.  
  
Q. Could you talk about trying to cover Markus Kennedy at the end of the
game obviously with Marshall fouling out as well?  
COACH LEBO: Yeah, he's a beast in there. He's got great hands, he can pass, he
can rebound. Their four bigs, they've got the best obviously in the league and
not only can they score, all of them can score a little bit but they can
really interior pass. Some of the best interior passing big guys, and I
probably need to attribute that to Coach Brown, but they're hard to handle in
there, no doubt about it. You've got Markus Kennedy, a guy like that and you
can bring him off the bench, you've got a chance to have a special season.  
  
Q. Team played really tough in their first year in the American. Now that
this season's wrapped up, can you talk about the heart of this team?  
COACH LEBO: Yeah, this is a huge jump for East Carolina basketball. We go from
not being really relevant in any league that we've been in to jumping to a
league that's seven or six or whatever it is in the RPI and we got seven wins
in the league. That may not sound like a lot to most but if you look at the
history of our basketball program, this is a lot for us. We haven't had that
many in any league, maybe two or three times in the last 16 years. I think
that we learned a lot about being in this league, how good the big guys are,
how tough defensively the teams are in this league, the physicality. We've got
to continue to grow. We want to try to get to the middle first and then try to
creep our way into that top. These programs aren't going to come back to us,
we've got to keep growing, we've got to keep investing, we've got to keep
moving forward with our basketball program. It's not going to be easy but it's
a heck of a challenge and I think these guys really laid the foundation to
say, hey, we have we're not going to roll over and die here, we're going to
compete our tail off and you better be ready to play, whether at home or on
the road against East Carolina. I think we set that tone in year one.  
  
Q. For Antonio, in the zone you ended up guarding Nic Moore quite a bit. Can
you talk about how you tried to contain him and talk about defending him?  
A.He's a great player, Player of the Year, he's kind of short, he's like 5'5
maybe. I'm like 6'4, so I actually got to get real low and he's really quick
and he can shoot, drive, do both. It's like you've really got to be smart with
him because he can outsmart you any time, it's really tough playing one-on-one
defense with him. Just watching him play, I think he's a really great player
so he's going to be pretty good after this season, it's pretty good.  
MODERATOR: On that note, thank you to the East Carolina Pirates.

_HARTFORD, CONNECTICUT_  
  

TULSA - 59  
HOUSTON - 51

  
MODERATOR: On the season, Tulsa is 17 and 0 and leading at the half, and this
was their fourth consecutive win in conference tournament play after going 3-0
in Conference USA last year and then winning this game. Joining us from the
Tulsa Golden Hurricane are Head Coach Frank Haith and junior guards James
Woodard and Shaquille Harrison.  
COACH HAITH: Obviously it was a tough win for us. I thought our guys, we got
off to a great start first 10 minutes of the game, and I thought we took our
foot off the pedal a little bit and we turned the ball over, allowed Houston
confidence. And having been idled yesterday, some teams when that happens, you
really struggle to get your flow going. But I thought we got it going and then
we did not -- we let up and Houston did a good job getting back in the game
but these two guys helped us finish there at the end.  
MODERATOR: Questions from the floor?  
  
Q. For James and for Shaq, with this being such an important game for
y'all's post season hopes, how were you all able to weather the runs that
Houston went on?  
SHAQUILLE HARRISON: I felt like we had to come together as a team, we talked
about in the huddles when they went on little runs, and kind of got to tighten
up on little things like getting in the passing lane, boxing out. I felt like
we came together and finally got that done.  
JAMES WOODARD: Like Shaquille said, we just came together as a team and we
tried to control the controllables like boxing out, getting the shooters, and
that's what we did, we just tightened up on defense and finished the game out.  
  
Q. What was happening whenever Houston went on that run at the end of the
first half?  
COACH HAITH: I felt like we turned the ball over, I think we had eight
turnovers in the first half and they were blazing the ball right back at us
and they were scoring in transition. We weren't able to set our defense
because of those live ball turnovers. I think that was the difference. Then we
took some ill-advised shots. I thought we took some quick shots, we needed to
play inside out and I thought we did a better job of that in the second half.
After we started the game, they started the game in the zone, we made some
shots and I think scoring became easy the start of the game and we relaxed,
but I give Houston credit, they turned up their defense, they got tighter on
their defensive end and forced some turnovers.  
  
Q. Were Houston's 3-pointers, was that taking advantage of y'all's zone or
were those just tough shots they were putting up?  
COACH HAITH: They didn't make the 3s, believe it or not, against our zone.
They made it against our man, a lot of it in the first half, and then Baker
made a couple there in the second half against our man, and we had a couple
broken plays. He made one in transition, but I thought our zone was really
good, I thought our zone really helped us win the game, and obviously I
thought our pressure, three-quarter pressure helped us win the game.  
MODERATOR: Thank you, gentlemen. Good luck.

TEMPLE - 80  
MEMPHIS - 75

  
MODERATOR: Joining us now from the Memphis Tigers are Head Coach Josh Pastner,
junior Shaq Goodwin and junior Kedren Johnson. Coach, do you have an opening
statement on today's game?  
COACH PASTNER: Yep, first off want to congratulate Coach Dunphy on his 500
win, tremendous accomplishment obviously for an outstanding human being and a
great coach who I had said earlier in the week which I believe should be in
consideration for the Hall of Fame. Secondly, appreciate all of the
hospitality from everyone here, Mr. Aresco, Dan Leibovitz and my man back
there, OJ, and his son, so we appreciate you guys and the rest of the American
Conference.  
Tough game, I mean, I thought our guys, which they've done all year long, have
battled from start to finish. Came up a little short at the end there but
there's no question that guys had left it all on the floor and that's all you
can ask for. I thought Cummings had that big play on the floor. There's two
big plays that stick out, Cummings had a big 3 in front of Temple's bench and
then he dove on the floor and got that loose ball in that scramble there which
resulted in the 50/50 ball which resulted in the 3-point play. That's why he's
a First-Team All-League guy, made some big plays, but I'm so proud of our
guys, so proud of Shaq, his improvement throughout the season. I'm proud of
Kedren Johnson, his improvement throughout the season, and tough way to lose,
but it was a great basketball game.  
MODERATOR: That, it was. Questions from the floor?  
  
Q. Shaq, is there anything you tried to do differently when Jaylen Bond went
down with that ankle injury?  
SHAQ GOODWIN: Just really to be more aggressive on the glass. I was aware that
he was one of the top rebounders in the conference so after I seen him go down
with the ankle injury, just wanted to be a little bit more aggressive.  
  
Q. Shaq, not having Austin next to you in the front court, what type of
challenges are there for you?  
SHAQ GOODWIN: Well, we all know you can't replace Austin Nichols, but Calvin,
when Calvin got free with Nick King, I think they did a good job after Austin
went down after the Temple game, I believe it was, it was a struggle without
him but I think we did fine picking up his slack.  
MODERATOR: All right, gentlemen. Thank you so much.

TEMPLE - 80  
MEMPHIS - 75

  
MODERATOR: Good afternoon. Today we have with us from the Temple Owls, Head
Coach Fran Dunphy, senior Will Cummings and junior Quenton DeCosey. This win
advances Temple to the American Championship semifinals tomorrow at 3:00. It
will be on ESPN2, and this win was also the 500th in the head coaching career
of Fran Dunphy. Coach, an opening statement on the game?  
COACH DUNPHY: Yeah, just a great win for us. Any time you can advance in your
conference tournament, we're delighted to do it. I thought we made some good
plays down the stretch, I thought our defense was decent and yet we gave up a
couple of easy baskets that we probably can't do, but we survived. And we
survived and move on tomorrow and play a very good SMU team.  
MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach. Questions for Will and Quenton.  
  
Q. Will, that final play when you get the ball to Obi and he fumbles it,
what was going through your mind that play?  
WILL CUMMINGS: I would say just make the best play possible. I didn't really
-- it was kind of a bad play to take it at the time, at the time of the score,
but it kind of worked out, I just kind of wanted to get the ball as quick as
possible to Obi on the break. It was a loose ball so I tried to just dive on
the ground and get it, and fortunately we made a great play with that one and
knocked out the free throw.  
  
Q. Will, how's your ankle after that play?  
WILL CUMMINGS: I'm great, I'm great.  
  
Q. Not having Jaylen to start that second half, what was the impact, if
any?  
WILL CUMMINGS: I would say impact really just because he's a key part of our
team, but ultimately we told guys they had to step up. Devontae came out
strong, he gave us a great lift when he came in the game. We just tried to
rally around each other and just pretty much trying to win the game.  
  
Q. You got to the free throw line 11 times and went 10 of 11 from the free
throw line. Was that something you guys stressed coming into the game?  
WILL CUMMINGS: I would say that's kind of our game plan every game. We're a
team that likes to get to the free throw line. I'm a guy that can get there,
too, we are just trying to emphasize on putting guys in foul trouble and
making sure we stay aggressive, and that's what we get through for doing.  
  
Q. Q, you had Shaq on you, Goodwin on you. It looked like you thought you
could take him off the dribble, could you talk about your aggressive
mindset?  
QUENTON DeCOSEY: Yeah, when I saw he was on me, honestly my eyes lit up and I
just wanted to be aggressive and make a good play for our team.  
  
Q. What was it like playing defense in the second half without Jaylen, they
went big. Just talk about the impact down there?  
QUENTON DeCOSEY: Like Coach said, we were decent, it was tough because four
guards. We battled, they hurt us a little bit on the boards but we stuck it
out.  
  
Q. Can you guys talk about the contributions that Devontae made with Jaylen
out, he caught fire there, got a couple key baskets for you guys?  
WILL CUMMINGS: That's great for his confidence and the team's confidence with
him coming off the bench, and giving us a great lift, that's what we really
needed, that was a key part of our winning today, we need him to keep doing
that, our presence on the glass and when we throw it down to him in the post.
That what he needs to do and what we expect him to do so he did give a great
effort today.  
  
Q. You've been here for four years, what does this mean to you and the rest
of the team to get this win for Coach Dunphy?  
WILL CUMMINGS: It was great, just paying back Coach Dunphy for giving us all
scholarships. It's great just being here from my four years, we've kind of
been bounced out the first round of our conference tournaments every year. So
this was an important game for us as a team, and glad we got the win for Coach
Dunphy, too.  
  
Q. Just going off of that, also getting Coach's 500th win for the team. What
have you learned from Coach? What has he really taught you over your career
here at Temple?  
QUENTON DeCOSEY: Really just taught me how to be a great team player. It's not
about you, it's about the team and that's what it was, a great team effort by
everybody and we pulled out the victory.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about the poise of a young guy like Obi, late, stepping
up and hitting those big free throws?  
WILL CUMMINGS: Definitely he's been growing over the year and that's what we
expect him to do now. We say he's a sophomore, we don't say he's a freshman
anymore, so we trust him out there on the course in situations and he's
gaining our trust even more by knocking out free throws and making big baskets
like he did down the stretch.  
MODERATOR: Thank you, gentlemen. Questions for the Coach?  
  
Q. Coach, just to hear your players talk about what you meant to them
throughout this time and now getting win 500, what does that mean to you?  
COACH DUNPHY: Well, as far as the 500, then we don't have to talk about it
anymore, that's a good thing. I've been coaching a long time, so obviously
I've had great people on whatever staff I've had, we've had some really good
players and I'm just, you know, really happy for this group today that we
could survive and move on and get this win.  
I think these two guys played terrific basketball today. Happy for a kid like
Obi who really stepped up and made some big plays for us. That's what we do,
we coach these guys. We just borrow them for four or five years and it's been
a pleasure to borrow somebody like Will Cummings. I hope we have a long run
now that we can do some good things tomorrow and Sunday. But I'm privileged to
do what it is that I do at a great university.  
  
Q. Fran, obviously with no bond available, we saw the risks and the rewards
of playing the four guards. Was it a no-brainer in your mind that you would be
able to get the eight minutes out of that lineup going down the stretch?  
COACH DUNPHY: It's a hope, Mike, to be honest with you. You're hoping that
everything will go okay and you've just got to battle. We did a lot of
switching, there was that one stretch where Goodwin got two or three offensive
rebounds and made a couple really good plays. You're worried about it, but
there's a risk to it, and then there's a reward down the other end. I thought
Q made some great runs to the basket as well. Will Cummings took it in there
pretty hard as well. Sometimes that helps you on the offensive end what hurts
you on the D.  
  
Q. Coach, do you have any update on Jaylen Bond and if he's not able to go
tomorrow, what's the game plan?  
COACH DUNPHY: I'm not sure yet. We'll talk about it as a staff tonight when we
go back but the trainer just came to us, trainer and the doctor were with him
at halftime and they said we're going to shut him down for the rest of the
game. I'm sure they will ice him down very well and hopefully there's not a
lot of swelling and maybe he can play for us tomorrow, that would be great. If
not, obviously we'll mix and match like we did a little bit today.  
  
Q. Coach, to see Obi battle in the later stages of the game with four fouls
and knocking down free throws late and in a clutch situation, just what comes
to mind?  
COACH DUNPHY: How good he's going to be as a college basketball player. He's
already very good. There was another play, I forget, I thought it was Will
that kicked it to him a jump shot in the corner that thing was in and out,
that would have been a huge jump for us. He's really coming of age, he's a
really good basketball player. He's a good guy. He doesn't say much. I would
like him to be a little bit more verbal but he's really playing well.  
  
Q. Even before Jaylen got hurt, your bench was really coming off big,
especially in the first half. Can you just talk about the game you got from
your bench today?  
COACH DUNPHY: Devin Coleman played very well in that first half and you're
trying to get him some minutes in that second half, he deserves them and he's
probably going to do a good job for you but it's not just not how the game
flowed at that point. So I thought he was big in that first half. Dingle made
some good plays in the first half, Josh Brown made a huge 3 in that first
half, he made two huge 3s for us, one in the first half to kind of get us back
in the game a little bit and one in the second half that bumped us to 6, I
believe, I can't remember exactly. Josh is a 6th starter. He's always in the
game at the end of the game. I think that's a tribute to how good a basketball
player he is.  
  
Q. Fran, exactly what is Jaylen's injury, and can you address the play of
Will, particularly on that last, that late play where he kind of dunked the
ball out and got it to Obi?  
COACH DUNPHY: Jaylen, it's ankle sprain, how severe I guess they'll determine
in the next couple of hours. As far as Will is concerned, that was a huge
play. The ball was on the ground, he jumped on that very quickly. It was sort
of a blur to me so I'm going to look forward to seeing it on film. I'm not
sure exactly how it all came together but I'm sure Will made a great play on
that and obviously Obi's stick in the basket and the foul shot was huge for
us.  
  
Q. Coach, this is a rare situation where you play back to back days. What's
the itinerary like?  
COACH DUNPHY: We'll just get as much rest as we can. We'll sit down as a staff
tonight and go over what exactly should happen. We talked as a staff about
even coming over here this morning to get some extra shots in because you
don't get a whole lot the warm up. I was worried about maybe getting these
guys up too early but it worked out okay for us and we'll do the same thing.
When we go and use our practice time tomorrow we'll talk about that and we
probably will because it's not that long, we'll just get here, and we have
some more space between us an the next game. We'll talk about that, I'm not
sure exactly how it's all going to go, hopefully we will get a good night's
rest tonight and be prepared for an outstanding SMU team.  
  
Q. Coach, two tough, really close games versus SMU this season. What is
going to be the key for you guys to secure the victory tomorrow?  
COACH DUNPHY: Well, we have to play very, very well obviously. We'll see if
Jaylen Bond can play. He's obviously our best, he's our best forward defender
so if he doesn't play that will hurt us a little bit but we've got to control
what we can control, we have to do a good job of running offense and we have
to -- a kid like Nic Moore, he stepped up and hurt us a couple times in his
last two games but we need to play really well. We have to be solid on the
defensive end to take care of the ball and on the offense we had turnovers
today, that's not something we can do tomorrow.  
  
Q. Last time you guys played up against SMU, Larry Brown said he doesn't
like coaching against you because it's no fun to coach against friends.
Coaching against Larry Brown tomorrow for you, do you like coaching against
Larry Brown? What are the challenges of that?  
COACH DUNPHY: It's not a box of chocolates by any stretch but I have so much
respect for him and he's a terrific guy and he's been very good to me. In the
coaching profession, I would go to watch his practices all the time when he
was coaching for the 76ers. But it's like everything else, I've coached
against some really close friends and once the ball goes up, you're just
coaching your guys and you're not concentrating too much on who's down on the
other end of the bench. I just have great respect for he as a coach and
certainly for his team as well, and we've had two great games against him, we
just came out on the wrong end so we've got a lot of work to do before
tomorrow.  
MODERATOR: All right, coach, on that note, thank you.

# [AMERICAN ATHLETIC CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=AMERICAN+ATHLETIC+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 13, 2015

  

### [Troy Caupain](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28621)

### [Gary Clark](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28620)

### [Larry Davis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22089)

  
_HARTFORD, CONNECTICUT_  
  

CONNECTICUT - 57  
CINCINNATI - 54

  
MODERATOR: Gentlemen and ladies, we would like to welcome from the University
of Cincinnati Bearcats Head Coach Larry Davis, couple talented underclassmen
in freshman Gary Clark and sophomore Troy Caupin. Coach, do you want to open
with a statement about this dogfight tonight?  
COACH DAVIS: First of all, I'm very proud of these guys in a very, very
difficult situation and environment with a lot of things going against them.
They hung in there, they fought, they gave themselves a chance to win, and
that's all you can ask as a coach is for your team to give yourself a chance
to win. They didn't give in when they could have, when virtually everything
went against them in the last four minutes of play. But these guys, they
fought, they listened, they did everything I asked them to do and they gave
themselves a chance to win, and we've got to get past this quickly, we've got
a week to recuperate, rest a little bit and get ready to play in the big
dance, which is the one that matters the most.  
MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions from the floor?  
  
Q. Coach, are you positive that you've done enough now to get off the
bubble? That you're in the tournament and can you make your case?  
COACH DAVIS: Everybody has us as an 8 seed. I don't see us getting knocked out
being an 8 seed. If we were a 10 or 11, yeah, but, no, we've got six top 50
wins and eight top 100 wins. There's two teams in our conference who are still
playing tomorrow that don't have that. We're undefeated against the top of our
league. Yeah, we're in. I would say I sure think we're in, put it that way.  
  
Q. What were you trying to do defensively the last play against Boatright?  
COACH DAVIS: Well, obviously we were going to switch all ball screens and I
put Tay on five because I thought they were going to sprint Brimah out, which
what I think they were going to do. They made the adjustment and Tay switched
out. And had I to do it over again I would tell them just doubling, no matter
what, make somebody else beat us, but if you do that and he throws it back to
Hamilton, we'd bank the 30-footer in with one second on the clock. Maybe it
was fate tonight for them but Tay did a good job switching, he launched one up
there and it went in.  
  
Q. Troy, can you just talk about the defensive battle that these two teams
had? It seemed like it was stop for stop there, especially when it was tied at
45 for almost three minutes.  
TROY CAUPIN: Around that time, you've got a lot gaining on both teams. It's
about getting stops, it's about making that one big rebound, trying to get the
ball as best as possible. Coach told us, hey, let's get a stop, that's the one
thing we've got to focus on and I'm sure their coach was saying the same
thing. That's what it came down to in the last three minutes, you said it was
45-45 for a long time and the ball just wasn't dropping in the basket for both
sides.  
  
Q. How do you guys feel now going into the tournament? You had won five in a
row, you played well tonight but didn't win; what's your mindset going forward
now?  
GARY CLARK: It's the same mindset. We had three losses back to back, you know.
It's still try to play Bearcat basketball. He threw one in tonight, so it's
going to sit for a while, you know, it's going to light a fire behind us to go
into next week and be really ready for no matter who we play. They should be
worried definitely, definitely.  
MODERATOR: Gentlemen, thank you so much.

### [Larry Brown](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14093)

### [Ryan Manuel](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28590)

  
_HARTFORD, CONNECTICUT_  
  

SMU - 74  
EAST CAROLINA - 68

  
MODERATOR: Ladies and gentlemen, we're joined by the SMU Mustangs head coach,
Larry Brown, and Ryan Manuel. Before we get started, I just want to let you
know that the Mustangs have advanced to the semi-finals, that would be
tomorrow at 3:00 on ESPN2, and after Coach's opening statement, we're going to
take some questions for Ryan only, and then let him go and talk to Coach. Some
remarks on this win, Coach?  
COACH BROWN: Feel kind of fortunate we're up here talking about playing
tomorrow. Jeff had his team really well prepared. We pride ourselves in
guarding and I think for the most part we tried to guard as hard as we could,
but they executed and made shots. They got off to such a good start, I think
last year we probably would have packed it in, but we've matured a little bit,
and I think have handled adversity much better, and I truly believe that's why
we're moving on. On a team, I think they were 15-31 at one time. When a team
shoots outside as well as they did, you've got to be pretty fortunate you're
going to move on.  
MODERATOR: Questions for Ryan?  
  
Q. Can you talk about the perimeter defense? They were hitting all those 3s
but I think they missed their last six. What did you guys changes, if
anything, and how did you close this game out?  
RYAN MANUEL: I think at the end of the game we had to get stops, like Coach
Brown said, and I think we got those at the end of the game. They were 15-35
from the 3-point line, but as Coach Brown said, we faced adversity and we got
through it.  
  
Q. Ryan, can you just talk about the slow start you guys had and how you
battled back from that?  
RYAN MANUEL: They came out making shots. Like coach Brown said, they had
nothing to lose and I think we just stuck with it and after the game we came
out with the win. We were fortunate to get it, but we live to fight another
day.  
MODERATOR: All right, Ryan, thank you. Good luck. Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. Coach, having coached Jeff Lebo in San Antonio, was there a moment when
you realized, hey, this guy might have a coaching career ahead of him? And how
does this team reflect his attitude as a player?  
COACH BROWN: Well, I got the San Antonio Spur job and they made me president,
coach, GM, whatever, and I felt I couldn't do all three, so they fired the GM.
I told the owner you've got to hire him back. So they drafted a kid in the
second round and gave him some money and Jeff tried out and I thought he was
much better, and the GM, who I thought I saved his job, he said, tell me one
thing Jeff does better than him, and I said he listens to me, but he should
have made the team and he probably would have played for a number of years.
Obviously you know what Jeff's been through the last three weeks, so, you
know, Jeff -- myself, so many of us are doing this because of Coach. So I look
down at him and I get a sense of pride. His dad's a coach, he's a terrific
young man and I think a great coach. I look at our conference, it's filled
with young players and terrific young coaches, and I think this conference is
really moving up. It's not only going to be about Cincinnati, Memphis,
Connecticut and Temple; it's going to be about a well-rounded conference
because there's really terrific young talent and great young coaches and I
hold him up with any of them.  
  
Q. Coach, Markus Kennedy got hurt and he came back and seemed to play even
better after that. Can you talk about how well he played down the stretch?  
COACH BROWN: Remember last year he got hurt? It took him about 28 seconds to
get down the other end. He played great. He won 6th Man of the Year, but
everybody on our side understands what a terrific player he is. I think for
the most part all our guys played pretty well. I just think they played great.
We had a huge advantage inside. So much of it is because we lost Keith, we
lost Justin, so many people pack it in. But with Nic, they extend, and I think
they extended the zone to stop him and we had holes inside and we needed our
bigs to play well and they did. And Markus was terrific.  
  
Q. Could you just give a comment on the teams you might play in the second
round, either Temple or Memphis, just what you think of both of those teams?  
COACH BROWN: Well, I hadn't even thought about Temple or Memphis, to be honest
with you, but I saw Austin Nichols with a boot on and I felt terrible because
obviously he made all-league first team and he's an unbelievable young man and
a big part of their team. It's really, really difficult to overcome injuries
like that, but I think Josh has done a great job in keeping that group
together. They've gone with some smaller wings and they seem to be doing a
terrific job. You know, when you have Shaq, you have an inside presence as
well.  
Temple, I heard Fran's comment about winning Coach of the Year and being so
humble about it. When you take a team that I think won nine games last year
and beat Kansas by whatever they beat them and played at such a high level,
especially since he's gotten those transfers, just tells you a little bit
about what kind of coach he is and what kind of team they have. They're deep,
they've got size, they've got a phenomenal point guard, so I think we're just
fortunate enough to play against a good basketball team, and I'm hopeful we'll
be ready to play.  
  
Q. Coach, you guys go down like 19-9 early on and Nic scores like 11 points
in a four minute span, how important is he as kind of a spark plug there when
you guys are struggling early?  
COACH BROWN: He was Player of the Year, that's what they're supposed to do.
When I look at Player of the Year, you know, I look around, I saw Boatright
last night, I saw Hamilton last night, you see Cummings, you see Shaq, you see
Austin. This league's full of really quality, quality players. And this is the
time of year they've got to step up. We got some of our baskets because we got
stops, which we weren't doing earlier. It's really hard, especially for him,
to score against a set defense that's really geared to stop him. But he gave
us a lift, he made a couple really unbelievable hustle plays. I think that was
really significant. I'm proud because last year, obviously last year at this
time it wasn't very exciting. This is the first time, I found out, we won a
conference game in nine years. How about that?  
  
Q. Coach, they were hurting you at the beginning of the game. Screen-to-
screen action. What was the best way to take them out of that offense?  
COACH BROWN: We got hurt on dribble penetration and kick-outs, and that's
something we pride ourselves keeping people in front of us. And then we got
hurt on a couple transitions where we gambled in the backcourt and didn't get
back and they found open shooters. But I think more was made of the fact that
their senior point guard really controlled the pace of the game and he got the
right guy, shot. I think he was 6 for 20 on the year shooting 3s, and he made
two or three in the first half. Seemed like everybody -- sometimes missing
fouls gets contagious, sometimes making shots gets contagious. And I told our
team, they weren't expected to win. We haven't been in this position where
we're expected to win much and it puts a little bit of burden on you in a
different way. You're afraid to lose instead of just playing. I was trying
hard to get that point across. But again, I think they would have beaten a lot
of teams today, there's no doubt in my mind the way they played, the way they
were coached.  
  
Q. Coach, you had 27 points off of turnovers. Just how pleased were you with
your team's defensive efforts today?  
COACH BROWN: We've had a trouble guarding the 3 in Hartford. We came here, I
guess, a week ago and guys that hadn't made a three in a month looked like the
rims were bathtubs. We didn't guard the three very well, we didn't guard it
tonight as well as I think we need to, but turnovers got us easy baskets
because their zone, when you realize a lot of our guards are reluctant to
shoot the ball from outside and I've got to do a better job, Ben Emelogu never
looked at the goals, Sterling never looked to take a shot outside, Ryan never
did, but turnovers got us easy points and the biggest play of the game was Ben
Moore. You never know what's going to happen to a four point game that late,
them fouling, Ben Moore gets a big steal so turnovers got us going and gave us
a chance to win.  
  
Q. (MODERATOR): Thanks, Coach. Good luck.

_HARTFORD, CONNECTICUT_  
  

CONNECTICUT - 57  
CINCINNATI - 54

  
MODERATOR: Gentlemen and ladies, joining us right now from the UConn Huskies,
we have Head Coach Kevin Ollie, senior Ryan Boatright and sophomore Rodney
Pervis. With the win tonight, the Huskies will advance to the American
Championship semi-finals tomorrow at five, it will be on ESPN-2, and they did
this in a game that was tied nine times and featured four lead changes. Coach,
an opening statement?  
COACH OLLIE: It was just a gutty win, and everybody knew it was going to come
down to possessions and I think we just did a great job. What we did, we took
care of the basketball. I thought our guards played excellent in this
magnitude type of game with that match-up, and them guys really being able to
turn over their opponents for us to get three turnovers and 12 assists, I
thought they did a great job. We hit timely shots in the second half, we
really started understanding our open spots in their match-up zone, and I
thought we just took the game at the end. Ryan stepped up, Purvis stepped up,
and that last play by Ryan was just a great crossover, just great individual
move. I wanted to put the ball in his hands because he deserved it. He's a
senior and he came through for us. I'm very proud of him but I'm very proud of
our team. We hung in there today, tonight, and we live to play on Saturday.
And that's what UConn basketball is all about --  
MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach, questions from the floor?  
  
Q. Ryan, could you just describe that last drive and what you did and did
you take a lesson from Kemba there or what was going on?  
RYAN BOATRIGHT: No, I'm going to start with the free throw, man. I thought it
was good. That felt better than the first two I made. Once I missed it, man,
they got that put back, it was like deja vu, this is Texas all over again.
Once we got to the huddle, Coach kept us composed and he told me he's going to
give me the ball. I told myself I'm not going out like that. We going to take
this last shot, and I'm going to make it, but when I came off, Coach drew up a
great play for the slip so they couldn't double me. Once I came off, he was so
nervous and he beating them baseline, gave him one good crossover to give
myself a good look and knock it down.  
  
Q. Ryan, as a senior playing in front of your home crowd potentially for the
last time, what is the moment like that mean to you to make a shot like that
to survive and advance?  
RYAN BOATRIGHT: It's unbelievable, man. I'm just blessed and fortunate to be
in this situation and have the opportunity to play with this team and play for
this great program and just to make a shot like that man, great guards that we
done have, Shabazz, Kemba, we put in that work to be in that situation and be
able to make that shot, but without my teammates, we not in that situation for
me to be able to take that shot so I give all the credit to them.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the noise from the crowd tonight and how much that
helped you guys?  
RODNEY PURVIS: Oh, yeah, definitely, it was crazy. I felt -- I just couldn't
wait for one of my teammates, somebody to make the next shot, that's how loud
it was in there. I wanted to jump in the crowd with them. It was exciting out
there, but that's what you come to UConn for. We're fortunate to have the
tournament here and we're just giving our crowd something to be here for.  
  
Q. Coach, Rodney's really stepped up these last couple days, 13 yesterday,
17 today. What are your thoughts on the way he has played in this
tournament?  
COACH OLLIE: He's just playing with confidence. He's not looking over at me
and that's a good thing. He's just shooting the basketball, he's playing great
defense, you see his enthusiasm. I never want my players to dictate the
passing by making shots or not making shots, I want you to play hard, and he's
understanding that now and he's just playing with supreme confidence. We've
given him a lot of responsibility, we putting the ball in his hands and he
finally rebounded, too. I like that, too. That means he's sacrificing his
body, getting in there, but he's been doing an amazing job, he's allowing me
to coach him, and I just love that about him and I just want to keep giving
him all the confidence in the world and he knows I believe in him, know I love
him, I want him to keep playing this way, keep playing at this high level. It
don't have to be 17 or 13, just have to be engaged on every play offense and
defensive end, and I think he's doing an excellent job of that.  
  
Q. Ryan, last week against Memphis you took the ball to the hole on that
last play. Tonight were you looking for more the jumper because there will be
some contact, no call? What was your outlook going into that play?  
RYAN BOATRIGHT: I was just trying to make the right play, wasn't trying to
make a great play. I was just trying to make the right play. Like I said,
Coach drew up a great play involving the slip so they couldn't trap me. In the
Memphis game, we ran a pick and roll and they just trapped me, and I had to
make tough shot. So when they made the slip, I just wanted to give myself the
best opportunity to make it. And I knew I had a big on me, so I just gave him
one good crossover just to give myself enough space and I just locked in and
followed through and made sure it went in.  
  
Q. Ryan, last night you said you expected this game to be a dogfight and
that's what it turned out to be. Do you expect there to be a level of fatigue
tomorrow, especially having it be the third game in three days?  
RYAN BOATRIGHT: That's what why we got the hardest conditioning in America. If
y'all there and you in the preseason you understand why we can play like this.
Being here with this crowd and with our pre-season, I'm sure we're going to be
all right. We're warriors.  
  
Q. You heard what Ryan said in the huddle, that I'm not going to go out like
this, I'm going to make this shot. What did you think? What do you feel like
the team thought when they heard that and he had the ball, what was the level
of confidence with the ball in his hands in that shot?  
RODNEY PURVIS: I just knew after he missed the free throw, like he say, he
wasn't going to go out like that, I knew he was going to give a great move. He
is great for crossing people over. I saw the ball going in the air and I
started celebrating before it even went in the air because I knew it was good.  
  
Q. I know you want to go all the way to Sunday and do this the automatic
way, but if you could talk to the selection committee right now, how would you
build your case? What would you say about this being one of the top 68 teams
in the country?  
COACH ANTIGUA: I'm not even worried about that now, I'm going to go back and
we going to take possession by possession and whatever happens, happens. We're
going to go out there and play Connecticut basketball. If the selection
committee thinks we worthy of it we worthy of it, but I want to put ourselves
in a position to get in the tournament, and that's by preparing ourselves
well, so we don't under-perform, that's my motto. I'm not trying to build a
case. We're going to go out there and try to beat Tulsa, and we go and try to
beat whoever we play on Sunday and then they can't deny us after that.  
  
Q. Kevin, the situation you're in tonight with the bigs you had to play
Rakim quite a bit. How important were his contributions particularly --  
COACH OLLIE: Oh, it was huge, and he played so well because he gave us that
physical presence. You know, those guys couldn't back him down. I put him in
the second half, he had a huge block and he just always stayed with it and you
know, Rakim's been up and down, hasn't been getting a lot of minutes but you
just never know when your name is going to get called. I think Glenn Miller
does a great job with our bigs, just always having them prepared and getting
ready to play. I thought he did a great job, his defense was great, he moved
his feet and he just gave us that presence and you know we always say it
commit to it and you know that's one person I don't have to tell him to hit,
he just goes out there and throws his big body around and we love it and we
want him to continue to do that. Don't know when Kentan is going to be back.
Hopefully we can get him back here soon, but Rak is going to keep giving us
good minutes, Amida, we have three bigs, that's my fourth guard but he's my
big now at 190. We going to go out and we just going to play hard and we going
to stay connected.  
  
Q. Ryan, in a lot of games you have to match teams shot for shot. In this
game it seemed you had to match them stop for stop. Can you talk about what
that was like when they would make a stop at one end and what your focus was
on defense?  
RYAN BOATRIGHT: We going to live and die on this defensive end. That's what we
build our program on and build this team on, defense. We had some good looks,
we missed a lot of shots tonight. We made some fortunate ones but we missed a
lot. I told the team in the huddle that we couldn't see-saw. We had to get
stops and we came together and we got the stops that we needed to win the
game.  
MODERATOR: All right, gentlemen, thank you.

## March 12, 2015

  

### [Kelvin Sampson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13715)

  
_HARTFORD, CONNECTICUT_  
  

HOUSTON - 66  
TULANE - 60

  
MODERATOR: We would like to welcome the Houston Cougars to the interview room.
We've got Head Coach Kelvin Sampson in his first year, Jherrod Stiggers and
Devonta Pollard.  
Coach, do you want an opening statement about your first tournament win this
year?  
COACH SAMPSON: Yeah, I'm just proud of our guys. We've obviously, with all the
transfers and kids quitting, and LJ and Mikhail breaking their feet, we've had
so much adversity, we've got seven guys on scholarship. When you have only
seven guys on scholarship, they tend to come together a little bit. We know
what we can't do, but these guys have really balled into playing for each
other. Our offense has gotten a lot better because we move the ball and share
it a lot better. You know, I think you have to give a lot of credit to Jherrod
Stiggers because he's going from, I don't even know how to describe him
earlier, just crazy, crazy shots, but some of that he had to. We were all over
the place. But now his shot selection's better, our team's playing a lot
smarter. It always helps to bring Mariano Rivera off the bench, AKA, Chuck
Baker.  
MODERATOR: Questions from the floor?  
  
Q. Can you expound on Baker's second half?  
COACH SAMPSON: Baker actually did the same thing, maybe not the same thing,
but played similar at Tulane. We actually ran a good offense tonight, our guys
really executed, but when Chuck's in the game, he's the one guy on our team
that can put the ball on the floor and create. That's not Stiggers' deal. If
he puts it on the floor he's usually going to shoot a jump shot. Pollard can.
Barnes, you know, we don't have an overly skilled team. Chuck can do that and
I think he was steaming a little bit and didn't get in the game first half,
but when he did get in, he made up for lost time. When he gets in the game we
give him the freedom to create, he's good at that.  
  
Q. That intentional foul?  
COACH SAMPSON: Yeah, what was that? I didn't see it, did you see it? No,
that's Chuck Baker. He's, you know, a box of a sorted chocolates with that
guy. You just don't know what Chucky B's going to do. That's why his playing
time's what it is, but he's capable of doing some really good things to help
us. I'm not sure, you know, the last two times we've beaten Tulane, I'm not
sure we beat them without Chuck's contributions. One thing about Chuck, it's
easy to figure out what guys can't do. The thing I like about Chuck, he's a
tough kid, he really is a tough kid and I respect that about him.  
  
Q. New York or Philadelphia guard in Chucky?  
COACH SAMPSON: Oh, yeah, yeah, I'm not sure what side of New York he's from,
but he's exactly what he is. He's a New York guard, that's a great analogy.
What did he have tonight?  
MODERATOR: Career high 20.  
COACH SAMPSON: Did he really? 20 in 12 minutes? Well, maybe if he had a
smarter coach, he could have had 40.  
  
Q. And a dunk.  
COACH SAMPSON: How about that? He had fresh legs, for sure. Stiggers was solid
at the point. We're going to turn the ball over, we don't have a point guard.
Pollard did some good things until he picked up his fourth foul, but our team,
everybody has to contribute, everybody has to give us something. That's why we
won four games in a row.  
MODERATOR: Anyone else? Thanks, Coach, good luck to you.

### [Donnie Jones](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26648)

### [B.J. Taylor](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28541)

  
_HARTFORD, CONNECTICUT_  
  

EAST CAROLINA  81  
UCF - 80

  
MODERATOR: We have with us right now Coach Donnie Jones of the UCF Knights,
and B.J. Taylor and Adonys Henriquez. First game of the tournament, took it
the extra frame against newcomer East Carolina.  
Do you have an opening statement for us, Coach?  
COACH JONES: First of all, I was proud how our kids competed, especially in
the second half. Got off to, I thought, a good start early, they had a run
there, East Carolina did, and got up on us 15 or 16, whatever it was. I was
really proud of how our kinds fought back to get back into the game. Cut it to
8 at halftime, and then I thought the second half we came out and played with
some grit and some toughness in the second half to give us a chance to get to
overtime, and cut down a couple huge possessions down the stretch, we had a
couple balls there at the one point game. Two offensive rebounds there really
hurt us in that last minute, but we still had a chance at the end to win the
game and obviously fell short. I was proud of our kids' effort tonight, other
than obviously losing, but our seniors Kasey Wilson and Myles Davis, both
those guys have played their last game here at UCF, and just appreciate the
way those guys have handled themselves on the floor as well as off the floor,
they have been a huge part of help growing our culture at UCF. I want to thank
both those guys with that and obviously congrats to East Carolina on the win,
but it's a tough one tonight and a hard fought basketball game.  
MODERATOR: Questions from the floor?  
  
Q. Coach Jones, big night from B.J. Tyson and also B.J. Taylor. Can you talk
about the poise of these young guys coming in and how excited you are for the
league as freshman to come in and play like that?  
COACH JONES: Yeah, obviously B.J. Tyson is a good player for them. He's Sixth
Man Of The Year, I think, for the league. He gives them energy, he can put the
ball on the floor and score. He had 19 points tonight. He's a tough match-up.
Obviously, both these guys beside me here, I've asked so much from them this
year as a coach, as freshman, and those guys have been as consistent as
anybody not only on our team but any probably two freshmen in the country.
Both of these guys have come in and we've asked a lot from them from an
offensive standpoint and a defensive standpoint, and they've been two of the
most coachable guys that I've ever coached. Every day in practice with their
work ethic, their attitude, their belief in coming here to help change this
culture as we move forward at UCF. These guys have bought in and committed to
that. That's been huge for our program and that is why they continued to get
better is they're coachable. Obviously I think the future is very bright not
only for them but for our program as we bring these guys back next season.  
  
Q. Coach, your team was able to come back on a 15 to 6 run to end the first
half. What were you able to tell the guys when you called those timeouts and
there's five minutes left in the game in the first half to be able to get them
to get their motivation back and basically charge on?  
COACH JONES: Yeah, just keep playing defense, just thought defense has been
the thing that we've really been trying to get better at. I think sometimes we
as a young group sometimes we get focused and just not these guys as young,
talking about the other guys on our team, too, is that we sometimes let our
offense dictate our defense, and our defense needs to dictate our offense so
just keep getting stops. I thought we come down, we played unselfishly, we
were able to get some shots against that zone, which is what we struggled with
the previous times that we played them. Both these guys hit big shots against
the zone, and I thought defensively we got some stops which gave us a chance
to get out in transition, get some buckets early on and get us back in the
game, but my biggest thing I'm saying in the timeouts was to play hard, play
with toughness, play unselfish and try to get this thing under 10 if we could,
and we got it to 8 coming in to the half.  
  
Q. Take us through the last play and what was supposed to happen, it seemed
like Kasey Wilson went up for the shot, he seemed a little bit uncomfortable
with that position.  
COACH JONES: We were running a double drag action out of it, and we wanted to
come off two screens with B.J. off of it, and look to pop Adonys to the corner
to stretch it and then off that, Casey was going to pop, and we were going to
try to turn the corner but they switched everything off of it. We got jammed
up out front and we ended up having to take a tough shot at the end.  
  
Q. For B.J., you had a pretty strong second half, what did you learn from
playing ECU twice throughout the year, one pretty close game towards the end
of the season. What do you learn from those games that really pushed you
today?  
B.J. TAYLOR: I think I learned a lot from all the games I played this year,
just going against all the different teams in the league, watching film on all
those teams, you know, we watched a lot of film on ECU leading up to this game
obviously and just a lot of points that Coach brought out and told me, and a
lot of points that I could see myself and just watching film all year. I saw a
lot of different teams do a lot of different stuff so I think it was just a
great learning experience.  
MODERATOR: All right, gentlemen, thank you very much.

_HARTFORD, CONNECTICUT_  
  

EAST CAROLINA  81  
UCF - 80

  
MODERATOR: All right, welcome to the first press conference of the 2015
American Athletic Conference Basketball Championship. Our first game was an
exciting one with an extra frame. We have Head Coach Jeff Lebo, B.J. Tyson and
Marshall Guilmette.  
Coach how about an opening statement?  
COACH LEBO: Well it was a heck of a basketball game to open the tournament.
Good offensive game, a lot of points and we had a great start to the game, up
17, and give Central Florida a lot of credit, they really battled hard and
battled back, and I give my team a lot of credit in the overtime when a team
comes back like that and ties the game, a lot of times in those overtimes they
mentally have an advantage and physically have an advantage, and we had --
showed some toughness coming down the stretch and made some key plays. It's
exciting to be able to play another day. It's our first American tournament
victory and I know our guys are excited to get a chance to play again tomorrow
against a terrific team.  
MODERATOR: Thank you. Question from the floor?  
  
Q. For the first half when Tejada coming off the bench, had a great first
half, how important was it to have Antonio out there as your senior guard out
there in the second half.  
COACH LEBO: It was important for us defensively. I thought Lance was terrific.
He's a freshman that's been up and down, his first tournament in this stage
and he comes in, has eight assists in this game and really calmed us down when
we had two fouls from Antonio. You like to have your senior out there at the
end of the game, the guy's been through the wars, but really credit Lance
really in that first half for giving us a big boost. Our bench was terrific.
Terry Whisnant didn't have a great game by any stretch and Caleb White
struggled. Our bench was really the big difference, especially our backcourt,
they were terrific.  
  
Q. Mike and Marshall got in foul trouble late. What did the other guys do to
kind of neutralize those big bodies for UCF towards the end?  
COACH LEBO: I don't know if we neutralized them. There are some big bodies.
McBride was terrific. When he catches it in there, it's hard to get around
him. When he catches it in there, he has great hands and skills, but we had a
lot of fouls on him in there. I thought that Nzege got around him. When we
played at the five, we had a key steal late in the game where we got around
him and Paris came up from the back side and got a key stop in there. But he's
a load in there. And they shot it well from 3. They've been struggling,
shooting the ball from 3 and they made 9 of 22. Their penetration hurt us from
the guard spots also. They got off the ball screens a little bit and got into
the painted area, but they made some -- we couldn't stop them the second half.
They shot 61 percent the second half. So give them credit. They're an
offensive team that when they get going on a roll, they're hard to stop.  
  
Q. For BG, as a freshman could you talk about your nerves coming into this
game on this stage?  
B.J. TYSON: Well, I was just excited to be here because it's my first time
playing in American Conference or any like college basketball tournament. I
was excited. I really wasn't nervous. You know, just like we took it the next
as a new game so I just came in with the same mentality that I always had all
year and I just play.  
  
Q. For Marshall, a few victories there and you started to shoot well towards
the end of the year. Talk about the development of your game and when you want
to pick your shots?  
MARSHALL GUILMETTE: Yeah, well, developing the shot takes a lot of work, a lot
of times, there's no way around that. Picking my times, I want to help
displace the floor, we have great shooters on our team like Terry and Caleb,
so I'm not looking to get ten 3s up a game but when I get an open look, I
think its something that helps opens up our offense.  
MODERATOR: Anyone else? All right. Gentlemen, have a great night, see you
tomorrow.

### [Ed Conroy](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28552)

### [Jay Hook](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28551)

  
_HARTFORD, CONNECTICUT_  
  

HOUSTON - 66  
TULANE - 60

  
MODERATOR: All right, good evening. We've got the Tulane Green Wave in the
house; Head Coach Ed Conroy, senior Jay Hook and junior Louis Dabney. Coach,
would you like to make an opening statement?  
COACH CONROY: First give credit to Houston. I thought they made a lot of tough
shots and moments where I thought we defended pretty well for a long part of
the possession, and they stepped up and made shots and then when we put them
on the free throw line a little bit too much late, but also credit our guys, I
think you saw kind of the heart and resiliency they have, really led by these
two right here, I have two seniors and one junior on the roster, and Tre Drye
the one not being here and those three guys have been great leaders, and they
wouldn't let us quit and gave us a chance to win the game at the end. We just
weren't able to get one more chance to go down, but credit Houston most of
all, I thought they really came out and played with great energy and made a
lot of shots but I thought both teams played really hard.  
  
Q. Coach, you're down by one and then Baker has that run again, he had the
big game against you last time. Must be a nightmare to see that guy.  
COACH CONROY: Yeah, I think he ended up with 20 in 12 minutes.  
  
Q. He had 12 straight.  
COACH CONROY: There was one play where we had two guys guarding him and they
kind of split off and he still stepped up and hit a tough shot. The one he got
fouled on. He just hit everything he put up. He's been a tough matchup for us.
I think they present matchup problems for everybody and then when you throw
him in the mix late in the game with fresh legs, it's really, really, really
difficult and credit him for that's twice against us and we played him two out
of the last three games where he's really stepped up and won it for them.  
  
Q. Also about the seniors and Louis, can you just talk about what they've
meant the whole year? You have a number of guys coming back next year but to
lose Jay and Tre, you've got everybody else back.  
COACH CONROY: Yeah, our program, I don't know how familiar everybody is with
it, but not only kind of unprecedented things, you don't normally go through a
league change, and two years ago with the fifth-year rule and some other
things where we were, we had a lot of turnover in our roster. These three
guys, Tre Drye, Jay Hook and Louis Dabney, they showed great loyalty and
belief in what we were trying to build here and they're really invested. I
think that's why they maybe overachieved in some eyes, finishing 7th when they
were picked 11th and had several other games that I think we could have won,
but most of all, I think it showed up, their character showed up and their
toughness in getting five road wins in this league, which is not an easy thing
to do but most of the time it's just because they fought and hung in there and
just kept willing themselves to be in position to get wins and tonight they
did the same thing and I thought for sure we were going to pull it out and we
just couldn't get that last basket to go to get in the press one more time.  
  
Q. Just a question for Jay. What's it like for you, Jay, now knowing that
this is the end of your career, possibly the end?  
JAY HOOK: I think the first step is appreciating everything that Coach has
given me the opportunity to do, playing with these guys for a few years and,
you know, going through what we've been through has been a great ride. So the
first step is appreciation and looking forward. We're a program about next
play and we have to take this as what it is. Wish we had it back but we have
to move on.  
MODERATOR: All right. Thank you, gentlemen.

_HARTFORD, CONNECTICUT_  
  

CONNECTICUT - 69  
SOUTH FLORIDA - 43

  
MODERATOR: Good evening, welcome to the University of Connecticut Husky press
conference. There were some conference championship records set tonight. 11
made 3-pointers were a conference tournament record; 20 points by conference
Rookie of the Year Daniel Hamilton are the most in a game by a freshman in the
American Championship. Yukon's field goal percentage of .545, and 3-point
shooting percentage of .647 were single game records in our championship, and
the 14 points allowed in the first half by Yukon were the fewest in a game in
the history of the tournament. So with that said, Coach Ollie, do you want to
open with a statement?  
COACH OLLIE: You said it all right there. We want to continue with that. I
thought our guys came out with intensity, we stayed connected, we play hard on
the defensive end and we wanted to establish that the first five minutes and I
thought they did a great job. We've just got to continue it now. It's a short
turnaround and we know that. It's tournament play so we don't go back, get off
our legs, get ready for Cincinnati and everybody knows when we play
Cincinnati, it's a dog fight and we've got to come out and play with intensity
and play hard. And the one thing I always try to stress with our guys is have
confidence, and I thought they played with confidence today on the offensive
end and you see with that execution that we did during the first half and the
second half, it just shows them we played real well and we are going to
continue to just fight and do what we have to do to continue to survive.  
MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.  
  
Q. Ryan, the strategy all week pretty much has been trying to get more out
of Daniel and Rodney, that's what you were talking about through the Temple
game. Could you have asked for anymore out of them tonight?  
RYAN BOATRIGHT: No, they answered everything that I asked them to do, they
stepped up, played with confidence, took care of the basketball, played both
ends of the floor, they did a great job in there.  
  
Q. Daniel, you hit that 3 right off the bat first possession, first shot, it
seemed to set the tone. Did that kind of give you the confidence that you
needed to get through the game?  
DANIEL HAMILTON: Yeah it gave me a whole lot of confidence, especially I've
been struggling from the field, it gave me a whole lot of confidence seeing
that one go in and I think that helped me out the rest of the night.  
  
Q. Rodney, you held them scoreless for the first six minutes of the game.
Can you explain what you guys did on defense, especially the guards, 14 points
in the first half?  
RODNEY PURVIS: We just tried to make them uncomfortable for the most part,
just up in our men as far as the guards, pressure the ball, just try to
deflect the ball and get steals, so that was our main thing.  
  
Q. Kevin, you guys are 7-1 in this building. Is there anything to that and
why do you think you guys have played so well in this building this year?  
COACH OLLIE: I don't understand why we played so well in this building but I
just think the fans are great. You know, Gampel was great. We just had a
couple fortunate bounces that go against us in Gampel and we would have had a
good record there. XL has been great to us this year and I'm glad the American
Conference chose the XL Center to have their tournament in, we're going to
continue to play, we're going to continue to play aggressive, we're going to
continue to play hard and we wanted to have the will to share the basketball
tonight and I thought we did that, and we are going to have to have that
Cincinnati to go out there and have the will to play together and will to
share the basketball. I thought our execution offensively was great. No one
really cared about who was getting the shots, who was scoring, we just
throwing it to the open man, and the open man was making plays, and that's how
we're going to have to play the rest of the way.  
  
Q. Daniel, this is your first game in postseason play. Could you feel a
difference between the intensity of the regular season and the postseason?  
DANIEL HAMILTON: Yeah, I could definitely feel the difference, especially the
intensity, intensity rise. And we just had to come up and step up and make
sure we played defense and let it translate to our offense and we executed
real well tonight so I felt the difference in that.  
  
Q. Ryan, about four minutes left in the half they scored about four straight
points and Coach called a timeout at that point, still 25 to 9. What was the
message then?  
RYAN BOATRIGHT: That we need to finish the half, good teams finish halves, and
we slipped up a little bit on our defensive assignments, and we need to
regroup and finish the half strong.  
  
Q. Kevin, how nice was it to get the seven rebounds, the job you did tonight
on the boards?  
COACH OLLIE: That was -- I think tied his career high so it was great. I kind
of challenged the bigs because the Temple game, I think Phil played 20 minutes
and got two rebounds and Amida played 28 minutes and got one rebound, so it
was great to see those combine for 12 rebounds in their minutes, we want them
to continue to rebound out of their area, and Phil did an amazing job. It
don't show in the points but I put on this tape when I get back, when I get
back to the hotel and I bet you every defensive assignments I want him to be
at he's going to be there, and he sacrificed his body for our team, he takes
charge, he does all the small things. That's why, you know, I give him the
minutes that I give him, because I really trust him on the defensive end and
then on offensive ends he knows the right spots to be in. I want Phil to
continue to play hard and, you know, he knows about this time, he played all
six games in our run last year, started all six games in our tournament run
last year so he's a very experienced guy, especially in March and April.  
  
Q. Kevin, can you talk about Kentan Facey? Is he going to be out for the
entire tournament, do you know what his situation is at this point?  
COACH OLLIE: We just trying to make sure his symptoms get better. Him and
Daniel banged heads in practice and he got a concussion, so we're just
waiting, our medical staff is excellent. James Doran, Travis Illian, all of
our team of doctors, they're going to do a good job assessing it and hopefully
he can come back tomorrow. If he can't, the first thing we always look is our
student-athletes' health so we want him in the right frame of mind to get back
and play hundred percent and not worry about symptoms and anything coming
back. So I'm going to just listen to James Doran, I'm going to listen to our
doctors and hopefully Ken will be back.  
  
Q. You guys took a 25-25 lead there in the first half there in that dunk by
Amida. Ryan, I think all three of you touched the ball before the dunk, what
did you see unfurling in front of you Ryan?  
RYAN BOATRIGHT: When I got the steal, I seen Rodney doing what he do best,
which is just run the lane. I think he's great in transition and open floor so
I just tried to get him the ball as soon as possible and let him make a play,
help somebody else, and he did that. Who did you pass to, Daniel? Yeah, he
passed to Daniel and Daniel made a great play with finding a trailer, and
Amida did he did best, which was just finish.  
  
Q. Ryan, with Cincinnati tomorrow night, what are you expecting from them?
And you played them a lot, I'm sure it is going to be a physical game.  
RYAN BOATRIGHT: Yeah, it's going to be physical. I played them a lot of times
and every single time that we play them it's extremely physical and it's going
to be a close game, it's going to come down to whoever want to within the most
and it's going to be a dog fight. They probably going to play their match-up
zone, whatever they're going to do, so we've got to execute and break that
zone down.  
MODERATOR: Anything else? Thank you, gentlemen.

### [Anthony Collins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23335)

### [Troy Holston, Jr.](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28567)

  
_HARTFORD, CONNECTICUT_  
  

CONNECTICUT - 69  
SOUTH FLORIDA - 43

  
MODERATOR: We have with us from the USF Bulls Head Coach Orlando Antigua,
Anthony Collins and Troy Holston. Coach, do you want to make an opening
statement?  
COACH ANTIGUA: I just think came out in the first half and faced a team that
came out with a little bit of vinegar. I thought our guys were a little bit --
had some nerves, and understandably so in a conference tournament with the
kind of atmosphere that was here tonight, and once we settled down and we
started making some shots. But you have to give Connecticut credit, they came
out and played extremely hard and made some tough shots, especially early on.  
MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions from the floor?  
  
Q. Troy, over the last few weeks you've had to pick up a lot of the scoring
load. Can you talk about what you have learned over this past month or so
that's going to help this team going forward?  
TROY HOLSTON JR.: I think that towards the end of the stretch of the season we
kept working hard and everyone was competing in practice even though the
losses were, we were losing games, we were still competing and working hard
and I think that that shows everyone still had some fighting in them and
that's a good sign for the future.  
  
Q. Coach, can you just address the future, such a young team, obviously not
the way you wanted to end the season but the way these guys stepped up after
your two top scorers went down?  
COACH ANTIGUA: Just everything the team dealt with throughout this past
season, I'm proud of them, I'm proud of them. They got some life lessons from
it, dealing with adversity and understanding that they have the power of
choice of how they decide to deal with adversity. Do you sit there and feel
sorry for yourself or do you get back to work, roll up your sleeves and
continue to work, continue to work and they did that, they did that. We had
several occasions throughout the year where different guys were out and guys
stepped up, next man up, the next person then just stepped in and for the
betterment of the team, took the next step forward and that was huge, that's
important for us and for our future. We've got a bunch of young guys that had
to get a lot of experience and I was joking with both of these young men as we
were walking in and I said you guys got to be tired because I looked down and
they both played 39 minutes. And I was trying to figure out how to get them
some rest, but as warriors, they stayed out there and they competed and gave
us all their effort.  
  
Q. Anthony, can you just address the first six minutes of the game? What
were they doing to shut you guys down and what did you guys say to each other
after you look up after six minutes and there is zero points up on the
board?  
ANTHONY COLLINS: I think we took the shots and we just missed them, that just
happens in the game of basketball. I think we let that discourage us on
defense and we shouldn't have, but I think, I mean that's basketball. We have
to give them credit, too, but we did miss some shots that we normally make.  
MODERATOR: Anyone else? Thank you, gentlemen.

_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

Notre Dame  90  
North Carolina  82

  
COACH WILLIAMS: That was a big‑time game for about 30, 32 minutes, and then
after that it was a big game if you were a Notre Dame fan. It wasn't for us.
We have a nine‑point lead, and all of a sudden, they started making a bunch of
threes, and we called timeout after they had gone ahead by three, and we turn
it over three straight times after that timeout. They're still making shots.  
They were really, really hard for us to guard their dribble penetration. They
kept getting us inside, and then we'd have to help, and then they'd throw it
out and somebody would make a three. As I said, the first time we played them,
it's a tough match‑up for us. We tried to go small the last part of the game
to see if we could do a better job of guarding them, but they made some really
good plays.  
You just have to congratulate them. That is the bottom line. It wasn't
anything about being tired from playing four days. That was not a factor in
the game. That would just be an excuse. They played better than we did. We
panicked a little bit more than we have at any time this year, and their
defense got stronger with every basket and our movement got worse.  
I tried to stay out on the court for a couple of seconds because I was going
to congratulate Grant and Connaughton, because I think when you have seniors
in this league, and both those guys are seniors and winning an ACC
Championship it has to be a great, great moment for them to remember the rest
of their lives, and I was just going to congratulate them.  
Look at the two seniors, Grant had 24, and Connaughton had 20. Grant had 10
assists and two turnovers. Connaughton was 7 for 9, so you're not going to
beat too many people when they shoot 32 free throws and you shoot 7. But at
the end we had 10 or 12 times we fouled them intentionally, trying to see if
they'd miss some free throws and they didn't miss very many of them. They shot
87%, 28 out of 32.  
But we've got to be more aggressive and get more things going to the basket so
we can get fouled more often ourselves. But it's a tough day, and a very good
three days. We did some good things for three days. Did some good things for
32 minutes today. That's about it, guys.  
  
Q. Marcus or Brice, just the sheer quickness with which the run that they
had. I think it was 11 ‑0 in 68 seconds. What kind of impact does that have on
your psyche as a player when it happens so fast?   
MARCUS PAIGE: When you sense a team going on a run and making a couple of
shots, we always talk about that is the extra important time to value the
basketball and run some offense and make them guard for a little bit because
that takes them out of their rhythm offensively. But I think during that time
I took a quick shot and we had a couple turnovers back‑to‑back right out of
half court, and that is going to lead to run‑outs and easy baskets or open
three pointers for them. So we did the exact opposite of what we talked about
in that situation. We want to be disciplined on offense and make them work to
try to stifle that run, and that just didn't happen.  
BRICE JOHNSON: In that situation, like he said, you can't turn it over because
we turned it over three times in a row and that really hurt us in the long
run. They end up with a bigger lead and we couldn't recover from that. That is
the biggest difference in the game.  
  
Q. You go on the run coming out of halftime, Marcus hits a couple threes and
then right then Notre Dame seems to kind of leap into action. With things
going so well for you this week, was there any sense of a false sense of
security there that you had turned things around coming out of halftime and
that's the way things have been going for you guys that you get caught off
guard a little bit by Notre Dame there?  
COACH WILLIAMS: As a coach, I didn't feel that way. I don't know what the
players would feel like. But I feel like when you get on a little run like
that, you need to play tougher defense. You need to make sure you keep getting
better shots.  
But I was just looking at it. At 8:45 we had a turnover. At 8:22 we had a
turnover. At 7:27 we had a turnover. 6:27 we had a turnover. 6:25 we had a
turnover. 4:00 we had a turnover. So that's six turnovers from 8:45 mark to
the 4:00 mark, and we only had 13 for the game.  
So I think what happens when you're feeling good, you should keep playing
exactly the way that you were playing. I think their sense of urgency at that
point was a dramatic change, and it was dramatically better than our sense of
urgency was.  
I don't know if it would be complacency. I forget what word you used‑‑ that
things are going well and you think you've got it made, because I know as a
coach I never feel that way. I've always felt like if I get you down six, I
want to get you down nine. If I get you down 12, I want to get you down 15.  
You guys know what I feel like about Coach Smith. He called me my second or
third year at Kansas State. He said, "You're not running four corners at all."
And I said, "Coach, I don't have Phil Ford, but if I've got somebody 8, I want
to beat them 15. If I've got them 10, I want to beat them 18." That's just the
way I've always been.  
I didn't do a very good job of coaching today during that stretch. We had
already had to use one of our timeouts to get the basketball inbounds, and I
eventually did call one. I didn't want to call one, but as I said from that
stretch in there, that was between the 8:00 and the 4:00 TV timeout. Then when
I called that one, I only had two left and it was a three‑point game at that
time. Our first three possessions after the timeout we turned it over, so that
is the most long‑winded answer you've ever gotten to a very simple question. I
apologize.  
  
Q. Brice, you guys had a lot of success getting the ball inside. During that
run a couple of those turnovers were on entry passes. Did they do anything
differently to change up things to take that away or was it just rush things a
little bit?  
BRICE JOHNSON: Just we didn't really do a good job of holding off whether the
big guys took it or guards didn't get a great angle for it. It's just the
little things that we need to work on because we've been working on it all
year. We've got to execute it in a crucial time like that because those
turnovers did hurt us in the long run.  
  
Q. I want to ask Brice and Marcus, you guys get a lot of criticism about the
heart of this team. Could you just speak on that really briefly and what your
perspective is in that regard?  
MARCUS PAIGE: I think we showed a lot of heart this week. We battled four
straight times. Obviously, it didn't go the way we wanted it to today. A lot
of that was execution. But you can't really say that the five guys on the
court didn't want to win. You know, we were going after 50‑50 balls with
everything we had. And for three games before this one we won the 50‑50 balls,
competed on the backboard and showed as much heart as we have all year. So
people can say what they want, but the proof is in the fact that we competed
at the highest level this past week.  
BRICE JOHNSON: Yeah, I agree with that. People probably counted us out at the
beginning of the tournament. They didn't think we'd make it this far. We
really showed a lot of toughness and a lot of heart being able to go four days
in a row and being able to get to the championship. We were the fifth seed,
and people were probably looking past us when Louisville was up ten, and they
said Louisville is probably going to beat them. But we showed a lot of
toughness to come back and win that game. And yesterday people probably looked
past us just because it's Virginia. They're the number 3 team in the country,
and we showed a lot of toughness. You can't say we didn't show toughness,
because, I mean, we beat two top‑10 teams in two days, and we should have
beaten another one, but they made a lot more plays than we did today.  
COACH WILLIAMS: You know, I say some things a lot of time about a sense of
urgency, but our kids have got tremendous heart. I mean, come on. Other teams
have pretty doggone good players and they want to win, too. It's not just
about NorthCarolina. I've had some really, really good teams that may not have
a sense of urgency on every possession, but that didn't mean that they didn't
want to win just as much as anybody else. Everybody is not built like Tyler
Hansbrough. Everybody's not built like Raymond Felton. But people want to
criticize our kids. That's okay. They don't have anything better to do.  
  
Q. Marcus, Coach said that the four days, four games wasn't really a factor.
Is there anything you can pinpoint that led to those turnovers and led to that
snowballing on the run in terms of what you guys were doing?  
MARCUS PAIGE: Yeah, I mean, it's hard to explain because we had gotten into a
rhythm and we were playing so well. That got us up nine and we were getting
every shot we wanted. We were getting the ball inside, we were moving,
cutting, getting open shots. I think having one turnover probably led to the
next, and then we got a little tight when they started making threes.  
But it's hard to point to a specific reason why because we really were kind of
in a groove offensively. We were starting to find out what worked. We were
getting the ball to Brice inside and working high‑low and getting shots.  
The fatigue didn't have anything to do with it. It was more mental. It's not
because they pressured us and we couldn't attack the basket or we were too
tired to do anything. It was just a couple mental lapses back‑to‑back that
really hurt. I don't really know why we had them.  
  
Q. For either of the players or coach, how much better do you feel about
where you guys are and how you're now getting ready to go into the next
tournament than you did four days ago?  
BRICE JOHNSON: I feel great, even though we didn't get this win today because
we did grow on all levels as a team. We just have to cut down a little more of
the mistakes and we'll be right there because we are a great team. We're
starting to gel together and starting to play a little bit more to our
potential as days go on.  
COACH WILLIAMS: Yeah, I think we have grown in the four days that we've been
here. I think we've shown some toughness during those four days. We've played
better defensively during those four days.  
Sometimes, and I talk about this all the time, you've got to give the other
team some credit. I mean, yes, we turned it over six times in whatever it was,
4:45 there, but Notre Dame had to make some plays, too. I think that is the
one thing that gets lost. It's not just about what we did that was bad or what
we failed to do. To answer a little bit of the question about the tiredness,
and I'm not picking on these players. I'm just using it as an example. At the
8:45, the turnover from Joel Berry. He hadn't played 30 minutes in the games
like these guys had. At 8:22 it was Isaiah. At 7:27 it was Jackson. At 6:47 it
was Kennedy and he hasn't even played but two games. 6:25 it was Brice, and at
4:00 it was Isaiah again.  
So I don't want anybody to think that we're up here begging off saying that we
had to play four days in a row and Notre Dame only had to play three. They
beat our butts. That is the bottom line. They played better than we did and
they had a tremendous stretch there that they should be congratulated for.  
  
Q. Coach, a second ago Brice mentioned that the team is starting to gel. A
couple years ago you guys switched to a smaller lineup and things started to
click. Last season slow start to the ACC but then you win ten games in a row
and things are starting to click. Do you feel you're at the point right now
where you guys are starting to gel where things are starting to click?  
COACH WILLIAMS: Yes, I do. I really do. I mean, again, I think it was Brice
that said it. I think he said two top 10s. I think it's two top 15, but we did
beat some pretty doggone good teams, and Notre Dame is a top 15 team. And we
had a bad stretch for four minutes. If you were here the other day, guys, my
teams have taken me to seven Final Fours. Only one time did we ever win the
conference tournament and that was in 2008. Every other team we lost. Even in
'05 and in '09 when we won the National Championship we lost in the conference
tournament. This team has a chance to make a really good run.  
We've got some things we've got to improve on, there is no question.  
  
Q. Coach, it almost seems a little strange to say Notre Dame is the ACC
Tournament champion. I'm wondering if it just feels different with the new
characters in this league and this sort of cements that this is a different
conference than it used to be?  
COACH WILLIAMS: It does feel different, but it is a new conference. I'm the
oldest guy in here, close. Barry says I'm older than he is, and I can't see
some of the other guys out there‑‑ well, nobody, God is not as old as you are.
I wasn't including you, big fella. (Laughing). But when there were eight
teams, NorthCarolina, NorthCarolina State, Duke, Wake, Clemson, Virginia, all
that kind of stuff, that's not the landscape we have right now.  
I think it's exciting. What we have is the most unbelievable regular season
I've ever been involved with; not even close any other time. The marathon I
referred to it, and then I said it's a marathon running 26 miles uphill,
because it was really a bear. But it is different to say Notre Dame won the
ACC Championship. I think it's just a change in culture. I mean, my gosh, we
have Texas A&M in the southeast. We have West Virginia in the Big 12 or
whatever it is. I mean, the landscape of college athletics. We've got Colorado
in the Pac‑10, we've got Notre Dame in the ACC. That's Atlantic Coast. Damn
Atlantic Coast is a lot more prevalent out there nowadays than it used to be,
but that's just what it is. And I think it's been a fantastic league,
fantastic league.  
  
Q. Coach, when we look at the stat sheet we have Notre Dame has five guys in
double figures, whereas Marcus and Brice accounted for more than half of
Carolina's points. How big of a concern is that for you as you prepare for the
Tournament?  
COACH WILLIAMS: Well, that's always a concern for me. I'm one of those guys
that always likes five guys averaging in double figures. I think that's always
been the way I've always coached. But the best players always scored the most
points. Tyler Hansbrough led us in scoring for three straight years and that
didn't bother me a bit because we won.  
But today I think it was just‑‑ you know, we got one, two, three, four, we've
got five guys that could be potentially one basket away from it. There is a
guy with seven, three guys with seven, one with eight, one with nine. So it's
not like these two guys are scoring 75 and the other guys are scoring two
apiece. But, yeah, I always like it when we have more balanced scoring because
I think that kind of team is harder to guard.  
Like Notre Dame today, we couldn't leave one guy alone. They had everybody
that could shoot the ball in there. We couldn't foul. In 2009 we had everybody
shooting 80%, they couldn't foul us. That is a comfortable feeling as a coach.  
These guys, the question about heart sort of bothers me a little bit. These
guys played their tails off. Are they perfect? No, not by any means, but
they've really given a lot here.  
  
Q. I think you just started to answer the question I was about to ask. You
were giving credit to Notre Dame and rightly so. Just help us understand the
difficulty of dealing with a team that has five guys that can hurt you?
Because I saw when you had big guys on Connaughton, he hurt you. You switch,
then other guys hurt you. And there was one possession, Coach, where I think
you closed out exactly the way you wanted to and the ball moved all the way ‑‑
it was unbelievable. You did probably exactly what you wanted to do
defensively, three or four legs in a row, and it still ended with a converted
three in the corner. Just elaborate on that challenge.   
COACH WILLIAMS: Yeah, it really is a challenge. They had great spacing. We
were split‑second late, split‑second late every time and we got there. Then we
were a little more than a split‑second late and they made the shot. It is,
again, I refer all times to past experiences. We were a load for people to
guard in '82 because we had Tyler inside, and Danny, and Wayne, and Tyler on
the perimeter, and Deon to pick up the trash. When you have that kind of team,
it really is difficult to guard.  
It's what I've always tried to look for. I've run away from prospects in the
past if I thought they felt like they had to have 50 shots a game.  
I had one guy say one time when I was recruiting. He said, I want to play as
much as Tyler Hansbrough played. I said, good, if you're as good as he is, you
will, but you're not. We didn't get the kid, but that's all right, too. I do
think that what you just described is really hard. And if you think about it,
Notre Dame is probably, as I said, when we played them the first time and this
time too, Notre Dame is probably the toughest match‑up for us in the league
because we try to play two big guys and Notre Dame is playing one medium sized
guy as their biggest guy. He played well too. I think Auguste, yeah, 16
points‑‑ yeah, 16 points, 13 rebounds. They had five guys that played really
well.  
  
Q. Coach, does the new look ACC and the challenge that this season presented
to you, does that necessarily prepare you for the NCAA Tournament?  
COACH WILLIAMS: Oh, I think it does. You know, you're playing every night. It
really is. I don't know how you guys felt as writers covering it, but as a
coach, it was phenomenal the stress and the expectation, the competition that
we had. We had a lot of stuff going on. It's the only team I've ever had where
we went three weeks basically without practicing for more than 15 or 20
minutes a day, and that was hard on our kids.  
You know, sometimes the ball bounces your way for you. I was astounded when I
started looking at the stats for Notre Dame, and you can do it again today.
They played 34 games. They started the same four kids 34 of those games, and
Auguste didn't start two games. So they haven't lost anybody. I mean, that's a
phenomenal kind of year that you want to take advantage of. Mike has done a
great job. Today they played 36, 37, 35, 38, 35. They've been fortunate that
nobody's gotten hurt, and those kids are tough kids that do what they need to
do to take care of their body, and you need to take advantage of those kind of
times.  
But this league, it's been a bear. They did a great job. I think I read it
somewhere. I don't read a lot. I think it's in Steve's thing or maybe a Notre
Dame thing. They had six wins last year and 14 wins in the regular season this
year, and that is the second biggest improvement one year in the ACC forever.
I mean, those are big‑time accomplishments. I do believe‑‑ I really did want
to sit out there and just congratulate Jerian and Pat, because I do think
there is something about seniors staying in college and enjoying moments, and
I think those kids enjoyed these moments today.  
  
Q. Roy, given how different the season was and just how difficult it was
with such good competition, did the opportunity today feel like a different
level of reward? Or did it have a different feel for what was at stake
today?  
COACH WILLIAMS: It's been a tough year. I've had some personal things that
have been really tough. Coach Smith, my best friend in town, all those kind of
things, all the injuries, not knowing when you went to practice every day who
you were going to have. The stuff that we've got going on around campus. You
get tired of dealing with all of that. I never allowed myself to think about
what I was going to feel like if we had won, but I did try to explain to the
kids that this could be a great, great time out on the court at the end of the
game because I wanted them to experience that feeling.  
I've been fortunate. I've coached a long time and I've been able to cut down
some nets a few times, but this team has really faced quite a bit of
challenges and I really wanted it for the kids. Thanks.

_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

Notre Dame  90  
North Carolina  82

  
COACH BREY: Just, I am a little bit in awe of what my team did tonight, and
really the whole weekend here. To be down nine and come out of that timeout
and get maybe seven, eight, nine stops in a row, when it looked like we
couldn't guard them. Then put that together with beautiful basketball, which
we've played all year in ball movement, it was a lightning strike to watch it.  
To win the championship going through Duke and NorthCarolina on Tobacco Road I
think is extremely powerful. It's really powerful for our program. We've never
won a conference tournament championship. Of course, we weren't in the
conference, but 18 years, but to be part of the first one, I'm really proud.  
These two seniors have set the tone from June on.  
  
Q. The run that you guys had, was that pretty much the essence of what this
team has been all season?  
COACH BREY: Yeah, I think we really combined defense with just a great
attacking offensive run. Now, like last night, we got to the bonus quick
because we were driving that ball, so getting to the foul line helped us too.
But I think Demetrius and Jerian were really able to get into the lane when
they needed to, and it put a lot of pressure. They got fouled, but then they
started kicking the shooters. I love how fearless we are when we step up and
take big‑time shots. We've done that all year though. We really have.  
  
Q. Coach and players, anybody that wants to answer, was there a point on or
off the court during the run that you thought what just happened?  
COACH BREY: We were down nine and then up a bunch.  
JERIAN GRANT: I really didn't know what happened. I seen us down 7 or 9, and I
looked at the scoreboard and next thing you know we were up three. It was kind
of a blur. But when we get into the zone like that, there is really no
stopping us. Offensively we know we can score. The way we play is really
unselfish, but when we're getting stops like that and running, we can score so
quick, it's almost like a blur.  
  
Q. Pat, since Jerian answered, what is it like to be in the middle of a
lightning strike like that? Were you guys simply taking the ball away from
them every possession?  
PAT CONNAUGHTON: When they made their run because of how fabulous of a team
they are, we just kind of had to think in the timeouts that we've been in
situations like this before. We've been down 18 at NorthCarolina State. We've
been down and been a part of runs. Miami in this tournament made a run on us
in the second half. Duke did as well. So we've been a part of things when
other teams made runs. It's how do you respond.  
I think Coach has done a great job of instilling that in us, how are we going
to respond? We knew that we needed to do it on the defensive end. That defense
fuels our offense. That's something that we've really tried to build this
program on this season, and it's something that allowed us to get out in
transition and allowed us to score like that so quickly.  
  
Q. Coach, you said yesterday if you guys won the championship it would be
the greatest accomplishment for the basketball program. Can you talk about
that? Do you still feel that way? Also, has playing in the ACC made your squad
tougher?  
COACH BREY: Digger Phelps would probably argue with me a little bit, but I
can't wait to have that argument and debate with him when I get back to South
Bend. But, again, we were an independent then and we were a really good
independent. To do this and still the early stages of league play for our
program, there is not a better achievement in the history of our program. I'm
thrilled that Jerian and Pat, when we come back or they come back for
reunions, that is something they'll always remember.  
  
Q. Pat, I think the go ‑ahead three that you hit was after about four or
five passes around the perimeter and about a half a second. You had a bunch of
those plays today. When you're standing there and watching the ball whip
around, do you feel that's coming? How quickly does that happen for you guys
on the court?   
PAT CONNAUGHTON: It's something we work on in practice. Our assistant coaches
are fabulous at getting us game shots, even if it's just in shooting drills.
We work on one more pass. I think Steve was the one to knock down the one to
tie it where we ripped the ball across the perimeter for literally three, four
passes. I think that was something that we just knew it was going in. I held
up three fingers before he even shot the ball because we take "one more" to
the next level.  
It's something that is a really unselfish team that we have. All 13 guys in
there have one goal, and that is to win. We don't care who does the shooting,
who does the scoring, who does anything on the offensive end. We just know we
all need to dig together on the defensive end.  
  
Q. Pat, when you have to guard a much taller player man ‑to‑man, you've done
this all year, but what do you need to do to make it work and exploit his size
to your benefit?   
PAT CONNAUGHTON: You need to get low. You need to get lower than they can. I'm
closer to the ground than a lot of these guys I cover, so I have to use that
to my advantage and try to get them as far away from the basket as I can. Make
them as uncomfortable as I possibly can.  
At the end of the day my teammates did a great job of digging down. I think
the one thing about this program that we've built on the defensive end is you
never feel like you're on an island. You have four other guys out there that
have your back, and they talk to you and let you know where they are. They let
you know when they're going to help, when they're going to get back.  
So at the end of the day it's not me guarding a bigger guy, it's our whole ‑‑
all five guys out there helping each other defend and get stops.  
  
Q. Coach talked about the gravity of beating a Duke and Carolina on Tobacco
Road and what it means to him. But he's lived it and you guys haven't. I
wonder if you have any sense of what it means and if you felt that pressure of
having to win here and against those teams or it wasn't that big a deal for
you as maybe it was for your coach?  
STEVE VASTURIA: I think growing up Duke and NorthCarolina are two premier
programs, not only ACC but in the country. So anytime you beat them it's big.
But we came in with a lot of confidence in this tournament beating both of
those teams during the regular season. With the leaders we have and the way
we've been playing all year, we came in here with a certain confidence and
we've played with an edge just like the coaches have been talking about.  
So, yeah, we knew it was big to beat these guys, but I think we came in here
with the confidence and ready to attack that opportunity.  
JERIAN GRANT: Yeah, we could hear it from the crowd. Obviously there were a
lot of Carolina fans in there. We almost took it as a road atmosphere. We play
well on the road, so like Steve said, we had a lot of confidence going in.  
  
Q. Coach and Jerian, when you think back 365 days ago, what life lessons
that basically you guys went through?  
JERIAN GRANT: Yeah, it's something we talked about. Coming back and the guys
welcoming me back. This is what we talked about. We wanted to do something
special this year. Me and Coach talked about how we weren't done yet. We
hadn't done anything special here together, and I think this is really
special.  
COACH BREY: Yeah, I put on the board at the end of last year after losing 17
games I needed something to look at every day to give me some hope. I had my
assistant, I said, put up the top 15 returning players in the ACC. This is
after the one‑and‑dones left. And Grant and Connaughton were easily on that
list, and I made sure I walked by that every day because I'm looking and
going, all right, we've got a place to start with those two guys.  
I thought they'd be great leaders. They've been even better than I could ever
imagine. They've kind of run this ship, and it's one of the great stories in
college basketball. They're two unique stories. Jerian's story is a feel‑good
story.  
But we've come a long way since getting knocked out of here by 3:00 Tuesday a
year ago by Wake Forest and limping up to my room with the returning guys to
talk about putting the ship back together.  
  
Q. There was a brief stretch in the second half where you used both of your
bigs at the same time. For the most part you avoided that temptation. Why did
you go to it and did it not work or did you just not feel comfortable with
it?  
COACH BREY: You know, I thought we're looking at it going, okay, help us
rebound and help us defend their bigs. Your natural instinct is to go big and
we tried it a little bit. But what it does do is it really changes us
offensively. Yeah, we played great D, but part of that lightning strike and
part of them having trouble playing against us was we were in such a rhythm
offensively that that breaks your spirit a little bit. We've had teams in the
past that have played like that. This team does it at a whole other level.  
So great offense like that is part of your defense, and I felt we needed our
small guys, Pat as our second big. So the floor was really spread for Jerian
and Demetrius to drive and kick, and that's what we got into there in the
midst of that run.  
  
Q. One guy who is actually not up here is Zach Auguste and he played really
well today against their bigs. Can you talk about his performance.  
COACH BREY: You know, he was great last night against Okafor. He gave himself
up and fouled out playing post defense. And he's taken it to a whole 'nother
level. That's another reason we won this thing. He is really consistent,
focused, I'm thrilled how he's playing right now. He was great both nights.  
  
Q. Steve a minute ago said, "We play with an edge." Does this team maybe
have, and especially your senior leaders, have a little more edge than some of
your previous teams?   
COACH BREY: Yes. Yeah, there is no question. There is a little toughness and
an edge about this group. Certainly our two seniors have it. This guy here, I
know there is a certainly here about the baby‑faced assassin, but this guy
here from Jersey, he grows his hair out long in the summer so he tricks
everybody. But he's a killer. He's a flat out killer. Demetrius Jackson is a
killer. Auguste is starting to develop that edge, and Bonzie Colson is another
one.  
So we've really got a tough group. Our toughness level is the highest it's
ever been mentally and physically.  
  
Q. 6 ‑1 against the Tobacco Road teams. Won at Louisville, Michigan State,
Purdue, what kind of resume is this? Could it be a No. 2, No. 1 seed?   
COACH BREY: No. When I told our guys, don't worry about the seed. We're
thrilled we're going to be in that thing. We'll go wherever they send us to
play. We have won away from our place. We've had great wins. Our non‑league
schedule is a thing that people will be critical of. When you lose 17 games, I
didn't put a non‑league schedule together thinking, well, I want to get a 2
seed instead of a 3 seed. I'm hoping and praying and lighting candles at the
Grotto to be an 11 seed in freaking Dayton, so I could care less. We needed to
get confident, and we did get confident with it.  
We had fun playing. In Italy, I didn't want to play anybody good in Italy. We
won by 30 every game. These guys need to come into the locker room and smile a
little bit because the last month of last season we were pummelled. So that
was maybe part of the therapy, probably as much for the coach as the players.
But our resume is really strong, and we go into the Tournament a very
confident team.  
  
Q. Jerian, I don't know how well you know all these names, but as the MVP
you added your name to a list that includes Tim Duncan, Jerry Stackhouse,
Christian Laettner, James Worthy and others. If you could tell us just what
that means to you. Coach Brey, just to give you a second to think about this
while he's talking, you talked about this being a personal journey, even as
you're very proud for these guys. If you could tell us who flashed before your
eyes in that long journey as you finally got to the end of the rainbow?  
JERIAN GRANT: That's special. Obviously the names you named were great
players. It's special just to be on that list and to know your name is down in
history. It means a lot. This is what I envisioned coming back. This is
something that's really special. To do it with these guys and to do it with
coaches, it means a lot.  
COACH BREY: You grew up a Maryland basketball fan and an ACC guy. Certainly
eight years at Duke. Have a lot of respect for the league. Never in my wildest
dreams did I think I'd be coaching in the ACC for the University of Notre
Dame. That is how crazy league expansion is.  
But to win a championship in this league, it does mean a lot. Personally, I'm
really proud. I had a Lefty Driesell flashback though. And maybe some of you
old timers will remember this: Going through Duke and Carolina and what we've
done on Tobacco Road this year, I remember Lefty when he won it, he said, I'm
going to bolt the trophy to the hood of my car and drive all over Tobacco
Road. So if you see a Buick Enclave in June with this trophy going from
Asheville to Wilmington, that's me. That's me going through there.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 13, 2015

  

### [Mike Krzyzewski](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13672)

### [Jahlil Okafor](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28618)

  
_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

Notre Dame  74  
Duke  64

  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: I want to congratulate Notre Dame. I thought Mike had his
team primed for us, and they played with great energy and togetherness. They
were a very difficult team to defend.  
We've won a lot in a row. I think we had won 12 in a row and playing light's
out basketball, and I don't know from last night to tonight we just took that
for granted on the necessary components to do that. But for about the first 24
minutes, I'm not sure‑‑ I don't know who we were coaching tonight. We weren't
talking. We weren't doing anything. We weren't following instructions and it
was like an out‑of‑body experience.  
Again, Notre Dame has something to do with it because they come out with that
verve, and in the last 16 minutes we play like we've played. This has been a
great basketball team. They finally found their character, and they put
themselves in a position where they could win the game, which was, to me
unbelievable, to be quite frank with you with how poorly we've played for 24
minutes.  
Hopefully, we're still in a point in time where we can learn from this. Next
game we play, there is no more learning. You've got to do it. We had not lost
since January, and sometimes I think you can take winning‑‑ not winning for
granted, but the preparation to win, the emotional, the intellectual
preparation that it takes to win, and we as a group didn't have that.  
Then the last 16 minutes we played our butts off. Yeah, I'm proud of how we
played the last 16 minutes, but not how we played before then.  
  
Q. Coach, you mentioned a lot of things that didn't go well in the first
half. Was there one thing in particular that was the most concerning for you
about your team?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: No, no. Just that there wasn't it. We've had it this season,
and then we found it at the 16‑minute mark of the second half. Look, I love my
team. My team has played great. But for some reason we were not there. Even if
we're there, we may not beat Notre Dame, but there was no way in heck that we
were going to win.  
  
Q. Did you feel at any point, even with the 16 minutes that you played
really well, and this is a question for either one of you, that you ever
really got into an offensive flow?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Yeah, yeah, I mean, the second half, absolutely. We scored
like 38 points, and then we missed every jumpshot. I mean, Q had‑‑ I'm not
blaming him‑‑ but he had wide open looks.  
No, our offense in the last 16 minutes was excellent. That's the best Ja's
played in a couple weeks, really, as far as getting him the ball. No, I had no
fault then in the last 16 minutes. If we play like that, we'll be all right.  
  
Q. Mike, did you notice right away that things weren't looking good and
that's why you called that timeout really quick?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Yeah, we said three or four things for them to do, and they
didn't do any of them. That is so uncharacteristic. Obviously, it's not
because they have a bad attitude or anything, but whatever, they weren't there
mentally.  
We were trying to get something the whole half, but even at halftime starting
a different group. Then I think they got themselves going at the first
timeout, and then they were a fun team to coach. They're battling, just like
they have all year. So you have to play 40 minutes and we didn't do that.  
  
Q. Yesterday you said Quinn had been a little under the weather. Were his
legs there today? Was it more a product of them ‑‑  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: I never use injuries and that, sickness as an excuse. He had
to guard Grant and Grant was good, but, yeah, the two of them were having a
battle, let's put it that way. So they probably tired each other out.  
I think more so Quinn missed his shots because they meant more because we
hadn't played well, so you put some pressure on your shot I shot to hit this,
instead of being in the flow of things. I think it was more of that, but I'm
sure he's tired. He played a lot of minutes, and he's played really hard.  
  
Q. Last year you had a young team that didn't live up to expectations in the
postseason?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: I don't know. My team won 26 games last year. They lived up
to my expectations. My team last year lost in the first round. That doesn't
mean they didn't live up to my expectations. It was a disappointing loss. My
team played their butts off last year to put themselves as a high seed in the
NCAA tournament. We all have different ways of looking at it. I'm telling you
the way I looked at it and I was with them all year.  
  
Q. Tells you this young team is going to have that poise in the postseason,
and also for Jahlil, coach said this was a learning experience, what did you
learn?  
JAHLIL OKAFOR: Just we started off poorly and coach tried to warn us before
the game that this is a game where we might get off to a slow start. Myself
and my teammates, like I said, we started off poorly. Just finding a way to
get each other before the game, he could sense something going on when we
tipped the ball because coach he called a timeout in the first two minutes,
and we weren't ready to play. So we had to figure out a way to get each other
going when things like that happen.  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: My answer to your second question is that we've won 29 games
and have been one of the best teams in the country with four freshmen and
eight guys. I like my team. We're ready to go to war in the NCAA tournament,
and we'll take what the consequences are of our efforts. And each team is
different, each team, each season is different.  
  
Q. Jahlil, you played very well today, you had 28 ‑8\. What was your
mentality today with the ball in your hands and what is your mentality going
into the tournament?   
JAHLIL OKAFOR: Just trying to play better than I have the last couple of
weeks. Me and coach talked before the game and he told me I wasn't playing as
well as I needed to. So just trying to play better for my teammates. The past
couple of weeks they've really been playing well and that's why we've been
winning.  
So I feel like I let my teammates down, so we played with a lot of heart
tonight and I tried to get my teammates going. But for March Madness or the
next postseason it's the same thing. Just try to be dominant, get my teammates
going and try to help them out a little bit.  
  
Q. Coach, after all these years are even you sometimes surprised that your
team has the it, almost perfectly, against N.C. State? It was all it, and then
you're searching for the it the very next day?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: No I mean, 40 years of doing this, it's tough. I'm glad
we've had it a lot, but it is not owned by anybody, it has to be earned,
whatever it is. All right. But we've had it most of the year.  
  
Q. Jahlil, given the ease that you were getting the ball in deep and scoring
in that run in the second half. Were you surprised they never came at you with
the double team?  
JAHLIL OKAFOR: I wasn't surprised. We played Notre Dame previously twice and
they never double teamed me. So going into the game I was expecting them to
play me single coverage.  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: I want to thank the city of Greensboro and all the
volunteers. They go nuts to make sure everything goes well for us, and, again,
spectacular event. From Duke University and all of us, the fans and our
contingent, just thank you very much.

_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

NORTH CAROLINA  71  
VIRGINIA - 67

  
COACH WILLIAMS: We feel fortunate and lucky, happy, everything to be here. We
made some big plays down the stretch. Made six of our last seven free throws.
I think that was big. The little fella beside me was a big‑time player for us
today, there was no question about that. Four out of five from three, and the
only one he missed was in the first half, and I said did you rush it? He said,
yeah, I wasn't balanced.  
But I think he was phenomenal for us, and not just the threes. He kept moving
without the ball, and I think he got two lay‑ups as we opened up the court,
and he turns down the middle and guys hit him with good passes.  
But there is a reason they were 29‑2, and they're really a good basketball
team. We're very fortunate, and I hope they get everybody healthy, because
they have a very sincere run in them if they're healthy to win the whole
blessed thing. They need Justin to get healthy, and Atkins hurt his ankle in
yesterday's game, and we understand that.  
But we'll take it. But I do think Justin was great for us, and I thought
Marcus, when it was a 1‑point lead and we called a timeout with six seconds to
play, I think his play at that time was the play of the game really. I thought
Brogdon was sensational. He scored 12 in a row on us. I think he had 22 or 23
in the second half. Perrantes scored their last five, but Brogdon was off the
charts for them.  
But the job Tony has done has been sensational. We're especially pleased to be
here still playing.  
  
Q. Justin said he thought your defense sped them up. Was that the case? Was
your offense that good?  
COACH WILLIAMS: I think it was one of the best games we've played defensively,
and yet we made some huge mistakes too, but I thought we were much more
active. We were more aggressive. We were pressuring. In a half court situation
that could be the most aggressive, most active defense we've had all year
long, and I think that helped us. There is no question we didn't get as many
fast breakpoints out of it as we had hoped, but I think it was good for us,
yes.  
  
Q. For the majority of the game from the free ‑throw line around 50% you
were shooting. But then in the clutch down the last couple minutes, the shots
were falling. Can you just talk about the composure of your team these last
few games down the stretch?   
COACH WILLIAMS: Well, I think, again it's getting the right guys to the
free‑throw line. We set the out‑of‑bounds play, full court when it was a
three‑point game to get the ball to Marcus, and they got it, and they fouled
him. Justin made two big free throws. He made two big ones yesterday, maybe
more than two yesterday.  
So having the good shooters in the game, and good shooters usually make more
than some other guys. I like the focus and toughness too. Teams talk about us
being soft and all that kind of stuff, but I liked our toughness down the
stretch yesterday and today both.  
  
Q. Coach has been telling us all season long, Justin, what an excellent
shooter you are. But you're at 26% on threes and to have a night like this,
actually I looked it up since the Duke game at Duke, you hit 50% of your
threes. So how did you go from being a good practice shooter to a good game
shooter?  
JUSTIN JACKSON: I always knew I was a shooter. Obviously, like you said, the
numbers didn't show it. But for me, I knew it would come around sooner or
later. I think after the Duke game, me and coach sat down and I told him it
would be all right, it will start coming. I guess, right after that, it
started clicking a little bit. So I'm just glad I was able to contribute to
this game and be able to move on tomorrow.  
COACH WILLIAMS: It's just what he said. I've said all along he was going to be
a real good shooter for us. He could have shown more savvy by saying coach was
right, but he missed that opportunity too.  
I really think that. Marcus' freshman year I said he's going to be a big time
player, and I get to see it when recruiting him, yes, but I get to see it
every day. It's a matter of time, sometimes it takes some guys longer than
others. But I think that we need Justin to be a big‑time scorer.  
I think he's getting better and better at moving without the ball as well. In
the off‑season he'll be able to work on his body and the whole bit. I did know
that he was going to be a big‑time shooter before he left. I just hoped it was
in my lifetime.  
  
Q. Would you say this is about as complete an all ‑around game as you've
played this season?   
COACH WILLIAMS: Well, again, it's such a good opponent. You have to feel that
way. I hated the way we turned the ball over. We had some of the worst
turnovers in history; but a coach is always going to find some things that you
can get better. But I think it was a good dog gone performance, yes.  
MARCUS PAIGE: I agree. We shot 50% from the floor against one of the best
defensive teams in the country if not thee best defensive team in the country.
Like he said, minus the turnovers, when we got a chance to get shots, we got
good ones. Justin did a great job of finding the open pass or cutting to the
basket and getting the lay‑up. We were just played unselfish and sharing the
ball.  
Defensively we made mistakes here and there. We changed our defense a couple
times and the guys didn't get the assignments at times. But we competed at the
highest level we've competed all year, and that was one thing that was a
positive for us.  
  
Q. There have been a couple times this season where you guys have had a lead
late in the game and it sort of got away from you. Coach mentioned free throws
tonight, but was there anything beyond that yesterday and tonight that was
different than earlier in the year?  
JUSTIN JACKSON: We got stops. Obviously, Brogdon came down a couple times and
hit some shots that you've got to get back on offense. But I think late we
started getting some stops, which then they had to foul us and we started
making free throws. So the biggest thing was we got stops and ended up making
free throws.  
MARCUS PAIGE: I agree, not turning the ball over late. Very late in the game
we didn't have many turnovers, so we were able to keep the ball, keep
possession and get the ball to our foul shooters and knock them down. They
missed a couple good looks. The one possession we really needed to stop on
when Justin Anderson caught it on the wing. Brice did a good job of
challenging that three‑point shot and we were able to get that rebound. That
was big for us.  
Just executing the little things. We missed a couple boxouts and stuff, but we
competed on the glass late and got the ball to our foul shooters, and we made
them.  
COACH WILLIAMS: J.P.'s turnover, 2:26, and we didn't turn it over the next
five possessions. I think that was big too.  
  
Q. Marcus, could you describe what you were trying to do on that shot, and
what was going through your mind knowing Brogdon was on you, you went airborne
and you had to get it up quick?  
MARCUS PAIGE: Yeah, we set up the elevator door play for me to go through with
the two big guys to catch the ball at the top. In six seconds you don't have a
lot of time, but that's plenty of time to make a play and not hoist up a
jumpshot. A couple times early in the year I had settled for jump shots in
that situation, but I knew we were in the bonus and I wanted to try to use my
quickness to get in the lane and either make something happen for myself or my
teammates.  
Gave him a fake, and when he left his feet I knew I had a chance to get a
decent shot off. That's what happened. I was able to knock it down.  
  
Q. Coach, with two and a half minutes left in the game, you were up 61 ‑60,
and Brogdon was driving for the bucket. I think it was the only time they were
shooting for the lead. And as he went, I think they knocked the hand out and
knocked the ball loose. Can you talk about that play?   
COACH WILLIAMS: Brice usually thinks defense is what you put around your yard,
defense. But Brice really did slide his feet and get in there that time.
During one of the timeouts we talked about it was NorthCarolina's defense
against Virginia's offense. It wasn't just a guy guarding Brogdon. If he
started driving for everybody to get in and try to close the gap and make it,
and I thought that was a huge play. As you say, probably the most significant
play of the game.  
But as I said, we had some lapses, but you're going to have that in the course
of the whole game. Virginia is so good, you can't have too many or you're
going to lose, but I thought that was a huge defensive play for Brice.  
  
Q. Tomorrow you're going to be playing the fourth game in four days. Is
there a concern about having enough gas in the tank or does the adrenaline
just kick in? And, Roy, as a guy who loves this conference and has been here a
long time and is well aware the history of it, above and beyond playing for
the championship tomorrow, is there anything special about playing in the
final the last time it's going to be in Greensboro for quite a long time?  
MARCUS PAIGE: What was your question for the players?  
COACH WILLIAMS: The exhilaration is carrying them on.  
  
Q. The stamina of playing four games in four days. Is there a concern you'll
run out of gas?  
MARCUS PAIGE: At this point, everybody's tired. The team that we're playing
will be playing a third game, so‑so you have to mentally not think about it
and just tough it out. I played in the ACC Championship game my freshman year,
and we came really close. We played a great game, and we were unable to come
through and win it, so we'll have some extra motivation there. We've had guys
on the roster that were on that team too.  
So we're going to be hungry. At that point once they throw the ball up, you
can't worry about being tired. There is no time for that. Especially for
what's on the line, a championship, a chance to call yourself the best.  
JUSTIN JACKSON: Honestly, there is no excuse. We made it to the championship,
and other teams played games these past couple days. So we're going to rested
up tonight, come out tomorrow whatever time the game is, and be ready to play
them.  
COACH WILLIAMS: Yeah, what time is the game tomorrow?  
  
Q. 8:30.  
COACH WILLIAMS: Tomorrow night? 8:30 Greensboro? It's going to be a long time
so I'm assuming it will be four or five years. I hope to still be coaching at
that time too. There is always significance for your team regardless where you
play. I was completely excited when we won it in Tampa a year ago, but it's
been exciting that we won one. We get to play for it, and there are a lot of
teams that are going to be home, so it would be significant for this team,
very significant for this team. I hope it would be significant for the
NorthCarolina fans who are here supporting us in Greensboro that might have a
more difficult time going to I think Washington next year, and then New York
and Charlotte before it comes back here. I don't have any idea how many years.
But it will be significant for our team. That's what I'm going to be focused
on. These 16, 17 kids that we've got.  
  
Q. The tournament moved forward a day. A lot of the coaches have been in
support of that. How much of a help is it now? I know you have a game to play,
but you have an extra day of rest before the tournament. Is it a benefit
playing Saturday and having Sunday off?  
COACH WILLIAMS: There is no question it's a huge benefit, but guys, I'm not
trying to get on you, but right now we're trying to win the sucker tomorrow.
I'm not too concerned about where we're going later on I always tell my
players, if you look down the road, that's where you're going. Down the road,
going back home.  
We're going to be ecstatic to try to play to win a championship tomorrow, but
there is no question the extra day's rest helps. No question about it.  
  
Q. Coach and Marcus, Justin seems to be a very humble guy.  
COACH WILLIAMS: He's from Humble, Texas (laughing).  
  
Q. Is that the real Justin or do you guys see a different?  
COACH WILLIAMS: I didn't like the way I called it humble, but.  
MARCUS PAIGE: Yeah, that's the real Justin, he's a good dude.  
COACH WILLIAMS: He's got to be humble. He lives with Theo and Joel. Isn't that
right?  
MARCUS PAIGE: That's right. I remember when we were recruiting him, he was so
quiet he didn't say anything. He's opened up a little bit since. He's always
been humble. But I think he realizes his opportunity here, and he's gracious.
We need him to be a big‑time play are and he's starting to be one, so we're
happy.  
COACH WILLIAMS: Proud of the little fella.  
  
Q. J.P. went out with about four or five minutes to go in the game. Have you
gotten a report on him?  
COACH WILLIAMS: No. I don't have any idea. Do you guys have any idea? I don't
have any idea what he did. I was focusing on the guys that were in there. They
told me he was not going to be able to go back in and we focused on the guys
that we have out there, so I have no idea.  
  
Q. Coach, for Virginia to be unbeatable most of the season and then lose
twice in a week, I'm kind of wondering if coaches have figured out that team
going into the tournament?  
COACH WILLIAMS: No. Beating Louisville's not easy. They lost on the last
second play when Mathiang, I think I pronounced his name properly, knocked in
a jumpshot which is not what they would focus on doing. Brogdon made a huge
shot from the corner. This league is pretty doggone good.  
We're not chopped liver, so losing to Louisville at Louisville, and losing in
the ACC Tournament in the finals, doesn't mean you've been bad. I'll give you
this one, I want these guys to change it, but my teams have taken me to seven
Final Fours. One time we won the conference tournament, and we were pretty
doggone good, and we won two national championships when we did not win the
conference tournament.  
So Tony has done a fantastic job. They get those guys healthy, they can win a
National Championship. I'd like to play them again in a National Championship
Game. That would be ecstatic for me.

_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

Notre Dame  74  
Duke  64

  
COACH BREY: Well, I'm really proud of our group. It's a special night really
in the history of our program to get to the semifinals of this tournament, to
beat that program to get to the championship game. One of the things I used to
say all the time when we were in the Big East, let's get to Saturday. We went
to four straight semifinals before we left the league for the ACC, but we
could never get to Saturday. Darn if we're not playing for it tomorrow night,
and I've never been more confident of a group.  
I thought we were really ready to play. We got off to a good start. A good
start in the second half, and it's the second game in a row that our defense
really was the key for us. We're a fun group to be around, and we've got great
Karma about us right now at the right time of year.  
  
Q. So it's 15 at the half of the last five minutes, Duke is coming, Tyus
hits that three. What is going through your mind at that point? Did you think
they would get the gap closed?  
COACH BREY: I think for us, we've weathered, you saw it last night, we've
weathered stuff like this all season and we've found a way to be poised. I
actually said in one of the timeouts, it's just like last night. I think I
said they're not going to win. Let them have fun closing the gap, but we're
going to win this thing.  
Our guys were really confident like that. I thought we had key defensive
stops. These two guys were flat out fabulous, and we had some really key,
strong drives.  
You know what helped us? We were driving and we got to the bonus early,
because we were driving we picked up some hand checks and that helped us.
Because their defense was really good, and the only way we were going to score
sometimes is maybe to get to the line.  
  
Q. You knew the zone was coming and yet Bonzie kept finding the sweet spot
in it. I guess what really worked with that?  
COACH BREY: I wanted him to do that against Syracuse, but he wasn't quite
ready to do that, and that's more my fault than his fault. We got him more
ready, and I thought when he's in there in the middle of that thing he's a
scoring threat. He makes difficult shots, he can pass from there, and he can
make free throws. I think he‑‑ I knew he was going to play well tonight
because he didn't play well last night, and he's a competitive dude. He gave
us a great lift.  
But he's been like an X‑factor for us ever since the Georgia Tech game on the
road when we didn't have Zach Auguste.  
  
Q. Obviously, the last game in Cameron, Duke had something to prove. Is this
revenge for the revenge in the first half?  
COACH BREY: These guys could answer that more. We didn't get into that much.
They played great. We never watched any film of it. I tore the stat sheet up
in practice on that Sunday and we moved on. This was one of those nights.  
But what we did watch today is the last ten minutes of our game in South Bend
where we came roaring back. We got into that mode tonight where we were
driving and scoring and getting big, physical defensive stops.  
  
Q. You didn't double team Okafor very often. It seemed like you just wanted
to make sure that the other guys weren't going off and clearly they were
not.  
COACH BREY: That really was our plan in all three games. You know what? We
just didn't want them to light us up from the three‑point line, to make him
work for everything, and he got 28 tonight, but he worked to get them. I
thought we strategically fouled there under two minutes. Bonzie did a good
job. We said let's put him on the line because he's hard to deal with.  
But what I worry about with them, and that's how they scorched us in Cameron,
when they get going from the three‑point line, then you're not going to score
enough. So we gambled that way, and we're good. We're 2‑1 gambling that way.  
  
Q. Obviously, with UNC their size and rebounding was a big deal in Chapel
Hill. How do you see your team has adjusted?  
COACH BREY: Yeah, we gave up 21 offensive rebounds that night and escaped in
Chapel Hill. I thought they were playing really well. I thought they were
really in a groove. We had our hands full. It was a great game down there. The
key was, like we've done in these last two games, we got off to a great start
there and it made us believe.  
If you look at the games in this tournament, the teams getting off to great
starts are winning, and that other team is playing catch up the whole game,
and can't quite get over the hump. We've gotten off to good starts, two of
them, and we're going to need to do that tomorrow night.  
  
Q. For either player, can you walk me through what your mindset was when
Duke made its run to cut the lead down? Kind of finding a way to respond to
that?  
DEMETRIUS JACKSON: Yeah, we've been through it. We've experienced that a
number of times this season. We know it's a game of runs, so I think we did a
great job recovering from those runs and staying together and having each
other's backs. We just did a great job, and Bonzie did a really great job
tonight.  
BONZIE COLSON: Yeah, I agree with Demetrius. We've been there in that
situation a lot this season. We just had to keep battling throughout it and
keep executing on offense, and getting good, defensive rebounds and we did
that tonight.  
  
Q. We could make a long list of the things you've accomplished in 15 years
at Notre Dame, but a conference title has been elusive. How do you describe
what personal meaning you attach to something like that?  
COACH BREY: Well, there would be no greater achievement in the history of our
program. Again, we were an independent for a long time, but this would be as
good as anything we've done in our history, and it's something, personally,
I've kind of been searching for to get to Saturday night and play for a
tournament championship.  
As I said, it eluded us. I think we went to six semifinals in the Big East and
just had some great games and couldn't get to the next night, but I'm
thrilled.  
You know, for us, I guess it's only fitting that to get it, you've got to go
through Duke and NorthCarolina down here on their turf. I think we'd put an
asterisk by it if we got it and you get both of them in the semis and the
final.  
  
Q. You had various people that hit key shots for you tonight. But once
again, Steve Vasturia hits a three, gets a lay ‑up. Talk about his
contributions?   
COACH BREY: The guy is unbelievable. He's one of the most underrated, unsung
players in the country. Again, he's guarding Winslow most of the night, and
Winslow had a hard time driving by him, especially early. Winslow drove us
early in Cameron and hurt us, that's why we started Steve on him. I thought he
put a chest on him, and then he's really clutch. He wants to take the big one,
just like last night. He's done it over and over again.  
But he's a glue guy. He's just so easy to play with. He's a very confident
player right now, and he's a heck of a lot healthier than he was yesterday. I
think we got him back almost to a hundred percent.  
  
Q. Coach, you've been in a Saturday night championship tournament before.
But it's kind of a new thing for the ACC. How much value do you think there is
in having the championship on a Saturday night where you maybe have that time
to regroup an extra day.  
COACH BREY: Well, let's add the semis in a night session too. We talked about
this, when we joined the league, Jamie Dixon, Jim Boeheim and I all talked
about the energy of a Friday night semifinal and a Saturday championship game
just for the buzz. Everybody around the country was watching our semis tonight
in that night session. You know what? I felt more comfortable coming down here
this year because it was like the old Big East format, quite frankly. We're
accustomed to being up until 4 a.m. playing the late game and turning around
and playing late again.  
But I would think all the coaches would think it's a great benefit. We also
felt, and now that I'm in it, I sure would like another day to get my legs
under me before we go into the NCAA tournament instead of playing Sunday
afternoon. It would be nice.  
We'll get back, you get your legs under you and get organized. I think that
was another big selling point that many of the coaches, especially Mike and
Roy, they really looked at that and said, yeah, I think that would be an
advantage.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 13, 2015

  

### [Tony Bennett](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18257)

### [Malcolm Brogdon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26754)

### [Anthony Gill](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26712)

  
_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

NORTH CAROLINA  71  
VIRGINIA - 67

  
COACH BENNETT: I told the guys at halftime right after the game I said you
know they showed great heart and fight to claw their way back into it, to have
a chance to maybe tie it or extend the game. So I like that. But what we try
to hang our hat on really was porous.  
It kind of unravelled defensively. You see they shot a percentage at shooting
55%, and the easy looks they got. Then they made some good plays. First,
congratulations to Carolina for how charged they were and how ready they were.
They really took it at us.  
But defensively for us to win a game like this, we had to win a much stronger,
more sound, solid effort, and we just didn't. So that kind of stings, but
we'll grow from it. This is one and done, and the next one is one and done, so
you've got to try to get it right.  
  
Q. Malcolm, you knew Carolina was a talented offensive team. But what was it
able to do tonight to shoot that percentage that it did?  
MALCOLM BROGDON: I just think they set the tone. Like Coach Bennett said, they
took it to us, and we played at their pace tonight.  
  
Q. Malcolm, can you talk about the play where you drove down the lane, and I
think it was 61 ‑60, how much contact was there?   
MALCOLM BROGDON: There was contact, but that's basketball. The refs call some,
sometimes they don't, so you've got to play through it.  
  
Q. Anthony, talk about the difficulty you guys had with Carolina's big
men?  
ANTHONY GILL: I think they're talented. You know, they pride themselves
offensive rebounding, and I think that we had some plays tonight where they
got some offensive rebounds and kind of took over in some places that we
should not have allowed them to score on or capitalize on. I think we have to
be better than that and go in and watch film and get better.  
  
Q. Malcolm, you had a lot of shots early in the game that kind of rolled in
and rolled out. At some point you started clicking. What changed for you
offensively late in the game?  
MALCOLM BROGDON: Coach Bennett got into me at halftime and got me going.  
  
Q. Justin Jackson kind of hurt you guys tonight. What was kind of the
scouting report on him and the strategy trying to defend him?  
ANTHONY GILL: We knew he was a talented player coming into the game. I think
that he's very versatile. He can score inside and out, so I think that just
getting at him, trying to be physical with him probably would be the key. But
I think he took advantage of some things where we had lapses tonight, and he
really took advantage of those.  
  
Q. Malcolm, on the possession on the inbounds with six seconds to go on the
shot clock, you were on page on those moves right there. Talk a little bit
about that play coming out of the timeout, and what was the strategy on that
particular play?  
MALCOLM BROGDON: To just get a stop. Paige made a good move. I lifted off my
feet and he scored.  
  
Q. When you look at the stat sheet and see what Carolina shot for the game,
were you amazed that it was even a game at the end like that?  
COACH BENNETT: Yeah, they had some careless turnovers, and I thought we got
back because of our hustle. We got aggressive, real aggressive and just kind
of forced the issue. We've kind of been in that spot the other way when teams
just put their head down and go, and Malcolm was very aggressive driving. We
got to the free‑throw line and we're better.  
But, yeah, that thing could have been separated a lot more. But I think at
least our guys responded with a tremendous second half effort. That was kind
of nonexistent for most of the first half.  
  
Q. What did you see in Justin today? It looked like his ball handling is
still a little bit shaky, but got some good rebounds for you, and had a three
‑point attempt at the end.   
COACH BENNETT: Yeah, it ended up he got a decent look at it. It wasn't a
designed play for him. He was an option. But, yeah, it's rust. I mean, it's
time. How many minutes did he play? He played 14 yesterday, played 12. He
looked like a little better defensively, and we're going to need him. So I
thought those were important minutes that he got. I wish he could have gotten
a bucket to go in whether a free throw or not.  
But it's part of being out for that long. So he certainly brought some passion
and some heart. It was nice to see him. How many rebounds did he have? He had
a couple of rebounds. I thought he was a little better today than he was
yesterday or tonight than yesterday.  
  
Q. As you look towards Selection Sunday now, I know you don't like to look
ahead too much, but do you feel like a No. 1 seed is something that you guys
deserve?  
COACH BENNETT: Oh, 1 seed, 2 seed, that's not for me to decide. We've just got
to get ready to play better than we did in the first half for sure and work at
that. But that's not for me at all to worry about. There are so many good
teams that you have to play. The parity in college basketball is there so
whatever will be will be with that, as they say.  
  
Q. One, I'm taking it you were a little bit unhappy going off the court at
the end of the first half, to put it mildly. Two, is it possible that Justin
will get the bandage off his finger next week? Because it seemed to impede his
ball handling a lot?  
COACH BENNETT: I'm not sure about that. I guess I'm not sure. It would be
nice. Yeah, it is a little bit, but he has to protect it at least. What was
the timeframe they gave? I don't know if it was five or six weeks that it had
to be protected. But we'll certainly look at that. That is to be determined.
The first part, yeah, you're right, I wasn't very happy. Did you ask something
about that or were you just making an observation?  
  
Q. Yeah, it's very unusual for you not to do the TV timeout thing at
halftime?  
COACH BENNETT: I didn't do the TV thing. At least you should have one
privilege if you're losing. Usually the winning coach, whoever is leading does
that interview. So if you're losing you shouldn't have to do the interview, at
least that's what I understand. If we were winning, I'd do it, if we were
losing, I thought that's how it was. That's one benefit of losing at halftime
maybe. I don't know.  
But what I was so disappointed because that wasn't who we were to start. And
again, Carolina came after us. They were charged and just the easy looks they
got, we were on our heels, their pressure really bothered us, and we just
looked‑‑ I don't know what the word is. Our guys have been in that spot, so I
don't know if we were tight or scared or nonchalant. I don't know. But we'll
grow from it, and hopefully be ready when that ball is tipped next game.  
  
Q. Malcolm said you got into him a little bit at halftime. Could you share
what you said to motivate him?  
COACH BENNETT: I just challenged him. That's kind of locker room stuff. Let
our guys know what I thought was acceptable and what wasn't acceptable. That
was it.  
  
Q. Down three twice in the last minute. Went for three ‑pointers on both
possessions. It was one of those borderline clock was close deals.   
COACH BENNETT: Yeah, they got the lay‑up on the one. But that was two
possessions before.  
  
Q. Brogdon missed and Anderson missed.  
COACH BENNETT: Right. You're right about that. The one I thought Malcolm had
made. He had hit a couple threes, and I thought he had rhythm. What we said is
if you can get a clean look, take it because we tried to run that little
action that we've run before. He got a pretty good look, and he had made a
few, so I was okay with that. But both of them, the other one both had, if we
didn't get it, attacks. So it kind of had a three look, clean look, and then
it had an attack look behind it for a two, so it kind of had both on that one.  
The one with Justin, it was actually designed for Malcolm, but they kind of
channelled it the other way, and London just attacked it.  
  
Q. Going into tonight, Justin Jackson was a 26% three ‑point shooter. Makes
four out of five. Is that just shocking?   
COACH BENNETT: No, he's a good player. Someone asked the scouting report on
him. He's good. We were really Delayed or behind the play. Well, first of all,
he moves really well without the ball.  
He's a McDonald's All‑American. He's a talented kid, and you could see that.
He's been playing well and did a good job yesterday. He got some easy wraps
where we had some miscommunication breakdowns and got him going. And some of
his shots we had a little too much cushion on him. He can put on the floor,
but a little late on our closeouts, little soft on our ball pressure. A player
of that ability, those guys get one or two going, and they feel it, and I
thought he obviously showed his talent, and I know he's a great young man too.
I know that. So he took it to us.  
  
Q. You went Evan back to the four spot tonight, which hadn't happened in a
while. That seemed to be a little bit of what sparked your run late. Can you
just talk about that decision?  
COACH BENNETT: Yeah, we were kind of struggling. Evan's smart. We thought
okay, he can maybe get us back. He can stretch it a little more. He's more
mobile, can get some catches, and we try to trap the post if they exploit him
down low. But we thought maybe in the stretch hit a three or even a little
ball handling out there would open it up for some drives from Malcolm, which
kind of did start happening. And I thought he did a good job for the most part
in that spot. Again, we thought we needed to do something, and it did give us
a spark.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 12, 2015

  

### [Rick Pitino](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13748)

  
_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

North Carolina  70  
Louisville  60

  
COACH PITINO: We came here to win this tournament, and we're very disappointed
we're going home. We had our way against man to man and they switched to zone
and we went cold. We had a lot of good looks; we just couldn't put the shots
down, and sometimes it's very simple when it comes down to that. Then we did
not guard their high post very well, so they deserve the victory.  
It was a tale of two halves, and we played very well in the first half. They
switched defenses and we played very poorly in the second half. So give them a
lot of credit, and we'll just sit back and see who we play on Sunday.  
  
Q. You said you went cold when they switched to zone. That's been giving you
trouble all year. What is it about zone that gives your offense so much
trouble?  
COACH PITINO: Well, you obviously see, if you're from the Louisville Cardinal,
that we're not a great shooting team so that's a pretty silly question to ask.
You watched the game, didn't you? So you don't have to be an X and O genius to
figure that one out, do you?  
  
Q. No.  
COACH PITINO: Okay.  
  
Q. What are your options when late in the year you do have to reinvent
yourself to an extent and the other defenses know the three guys are taking
most of the shots?  
COACH PITINO: Well, you're right. You know, we were put in this situation
late, but honestly we were playing very good basketball in the last two weeks.
We played great against Virginia. We had a great first half against Carolina.
Then when they went zone we rushed a little bit. We missed open looks.  
We've been okay against zones. We're not the greatest outside shooting team.
But to be honest, I think I've got to make one change which has nothing to do
with perimeter shooting. I think I've got to make a change at the five spot to
try to get more offense into our five position. Too many doughnuts on certain
nights, so we'll probably have to make a change there.  
But not a whole lot we can do except to do a better job of recruiting some
shooters, because we are who we are right now. We're a pretty good basketball
team, but we weren't as good as Carolina tonight though.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE MEN'S

## March 12, 2015

  

### [Jim Larranaga](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13680)

### [Angel Rodriguez](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23548)

  
_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

Notre Dame  70  
Miami  63

  
COACH LARRANAGA: I think Notre Dame deserves an awful lot of credit. They
played an outstanding first half. I didn't think they were ever going to miss.
They really found the open man and really shot it well. We ended up playing
zone for the last 25 or so minutes of the game, and we haven't zoned, I think,
since Kennedy was president. We just, we haven't zoned, and we made the
adjustment.  
I think our players responded to it very well. At halftime we switched zones
to try to get better match‑ups on their threes. The guys did that. We came
back very, very well. I don't know if we ever took the lead. I know we tied
it, but I think we made that a one‑point lead at one point in the second half,
but they responded.  
They made their free throws. I know it ends up 19 for 27, but I think most of
the free throws in the second half they made in like the last ten minutes. So
they get the credit. I think my guys get the credit for not hanging their
heads at halftime, and coming out and battling and not putting themselves in a
position to win the game and disappointing to come up short.  
  
Q. Coach, it was an amazing comeback in the second half early there. Is the
halftime conversation about X's and O's? Or is the halftime conversation
including fighting for our postseason life?  
COACH LARRANAGA: It was two things. One, we had to talk about the zone because
we hadn't played it in a very long time. We had a talk about our adjustment in
the offense. We needed to establish more of an interior game. We did that. But
my last message to them was we've been here before. We were down big at
Florida early in the season, came back and won. We were down big at halftime
to Virginia, came back and put it into overtime. We can put ourselves back in
the game, but we're going to have to do the things we planned on doing from
the start and that is play much better defense and score the ball better. We
did both things, and found ourselves in a very tight ballgame with five
minutes to play.  
  
Q. Angel, can you give us a sense of where you found your motivation through
injury and everything else with kind of in a way your season on the line?  
ANGEL RODRIGUEZ: Well, you know, it was basically the frustration of not
playing was my motivation, especially late in the season. It's a lot easier to
go through an injury early in the year when you know there are a lot of games
left, but at this point of the year it's pretty challenging and frustrating.
Even though I really enjoyed my team getting two wins in a row without me.  
But as a competitor, motivation basically came from just not being on the
court and not being able to help my teammates play in a game.  
  
Q. Coach, do you feel like fatigue had anything to do with playing last
night and then coming from so far behind that once you caught up that you may
run out of gas?  
COACH LARRANAGA: I didn't think so. We've had some guys with colds. Tonye
Jekiri had been sick on Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday. Started to feel
better actually last night. The exercise and the running actually helped him,
and I thought he was fine today.  
Some of the other guys like Manu was under the weather on Tuesday, but I
thought he worked through it. I don't think fatigue was the factor. We played
a very, very good Notre Dame team who can really score the ball.  
I thought we would shoot the ball much better against them. We shot like 34%
in the first half, 38% in the second half. We were 1 for 10 from three, and
that's not really who we are. When we're not shooting the ball well, it
dramatically impacts our defense.

_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

North Carolina  70  
Louisville  60

  
COACH WILLIAMS: I'd like to introduce you to our two players, Marcus Paige is
the first one, Brice Johnson is the guy that showed up in the second half. I
don't know who was out there in the first half, but Brice was there in the
second half, and that was a huge part of our win. I think I told them at
halftime I was about as lucky as I ever felt in my life to be down five
points, because I thought we had not played as hard as they had.  
We were not as aggressive as they were. I didn't think we had done a nice job
of sprinting back on defense. We had turned it over on silly turnovers. Again,
to just be down five, I told them, I told my staff and I told the players,
that is about the luckiest I've ever felt.  
We got off to a good start in the second half. To be honest with you, I
thought we shot even better than 50%, but we were able to put the ball in the
basket, and then we were lucky too. I don't mind saying that. When we went
zone in the first half about either 7 or 9 possessions, I thought it was good.
But we just didn't do a very good job rebounding out of it.  
But played a lot of zone in the second half and they missed a lot of shots
that they normally would make. But they're a little like us. They're
challenged at points about making shots, and it worked out well for us. But
really happy to still be here.  
  
Q. Coach, you called a timeout there in the first half and were pretty
animated. I was curious, you seemed to play better after that time out when
you got into Brice and J.P. What was the message there?  
COACH WILLIAMS: I think that gives coaching too much credit. I was really mad.
I didn't think we'd hustled very hard, and I thought we made silly turnovers.
I guess I'd had enough at that point. Besides that, it was really hot out
there in the first half, and I wanted to take my coat off. Brice keeps wanting
to wear one of my sports coats. I started to give it to him and let him sit in
the stands there, and he'd feel better at that point.  
But coaching is coaching. You try to do everything you can to try to get guys
to play, but at that point it wasn't a coaching ploy. It was just that I was
extremely frustrated.  
BRICE JOHNSON: Well, it's kind of my fault anyways. I didn't sprint back on a
few possessions before he did snap. I mean, he kind of deserves to do that, so
I really can't say much about that. It's my fault, and I had to pay the
consequences for it.  
COACH WILLIAMS: I like the way you said it the second time. Did you hear what
he said the first time? He said it was kind of his fault. The second time he
said it was his fault. I love him to death. He drives me crazy, but I love him
to death. I thought I was going to have darker hair.  
BRICE JOHNSON: That's not my fault. That's not my fault.  
COACH WILLIAMS: There were a lot of players before you Brice, that's right. He
had 18 points from the second half. He was 8 for 8 from the foul line. He
played a big time game. He messed it up defensively one play about as big as
I've ever had him, for sure, much less anybody else. But he played his tail
off in the second half. I couldn't be happier with his second half play.  
  
Q. Brice, between Roy and the way Harrell was playing, did you feel like you
were challenged today in a way to be a better, I guess ‑‑ did you feel like
your manhood was challenged to a certain extent?   
BRICE JOHNSON: Yeah, it definitely was. My manhood was definitely challenged.
All the coaches were coming at me, even myself. I mean, it's just I just
wasn't playing the way I should have been playing in the first half, and in
the second half I decided to man up and just be able to come out and play.  
  
Q. Along those same lines, what was the key for you in the second half? You
got a few good looks early in the first half, and then kind of vanished and
were much more active in the second half?  
BRICE JOHNSON: Just be a man. That is the biggest emphasis throughout the
entire halftime. Conversation and Coach Davis pointed it out and Coach
Williams pointed it out too. He said it he doesn't care when it comes to
anybody's manhood, so I had to step up and be a big‑time player.  
  
Q. Brice, yesterday you said in the second match up against Louisville they
wanted it more. Do you guys want it more today?  
BRICE JOHNSON: You have no idea. Just the way that we came out and were
killing them in the first half over there, and in the second half we kind of
let up on them, and they decided they wanted to go down without a fight and we
ended up winning. That was one of the things we were emphasizing throughout
last night and this morning. We just wanted to be able to go out there and
give it our all.  
  
Q. Couple things, at 5'11 " versus 6'11", how hard is it to get into Bryce's
face?   
COACH WILLIAMS: He was playing about 5'8" at that point, so I was looking down
on him at that point. No, the other guy that I got after was J.P. for the
turnovers. If you look at J.P.'s line, he's 1 for 4. He had three assists and
three turnovers, and I'm not taking credit for getting mad at him and changing
his play. But he was really big for us. I mean, he really was. The defensive
job he did on their jump shooters, the rebound that he got when it was up
there and it was either a two‑point game or a four‑point game. The steal on
the out‑of‑bounds play, I mean, you look at that and say two points, 27
minutes, he didn't do a lot. But I was really, really pleased with what he did
in the second half.  
  
Q. Your zone offense, it wasn't very good in the first half. What made it
better in the second half?  
COACH WILLIAMS: We got our big guys to move a heck of a lot more in the second
half. You know, I think we made two or three threes. We made one‑‑ I can't
find it. We made three in the first half, two in the second, but we got the
ball inside more. Brice and Kennedy passed it better inside. We got it inside
a couple times by Marcus dribbled, Joel Berry dribbled in there one time,
Justin made a couple of good passes.  
First half I thought our big guys were really sort of hiding behind the zone.
I think I was right, Joel, Kennedy and Brice were like 3 for 15 in the first
half. They were 8 for 13 in the second half. Brice was 5 for 8 because we got
better shots, and we found that open area in the zone in there. But kids just,
I'll use Brice's terminology, they manned up and decided to play better in the
second half.  
  
Q. Coach Williams, you got some big minutes from Kennedy especially down the
stretch. I think you had back ‑to‑back baskets and then a big block. What was
your assessment of how he showed up today, especially through the illness?   
COACH WILLIAMS: Got more out of him than I thought I was going to get. 19
minutes from him, 4 for 9, that's not what you usually get because he's
shooting 56%, 57% for the year. But I think he did some good things. His
passing is important to us. I said to Adam Lucas before the game, Kennedy is
more, probably more important against a pressing team like Louisville than he
is against somebody else because he does make good decisions out of bounds.  
But I think Brice and Kennedy and Justin, Marcus all of them made good
decisions passing the ball against the zone.  
  
Q. Marcus, there have been several games in the last month where the team
has kind of wilted down the stretch and not made the plays they needed to
wasn't the case today. It seemed much more in control. Was there anything to
that?  
MARCUS PAIGE: Yeah, like I said, we've been in so many of those games that
it's good we're starting to figure out how to be more poised in those games.
You talk about the Duke game, the Louisville game. We did a good job in the
Miami game. But we've had some games where we've done poorly and some games
we've done well. Aside from the possession where we ran go late clock and I
missed the lay‑up and they came down and hit a three, I think we executed
perfectly down the stretch. That was the only one. We didn't get a great shot,
and they came out and hit a three right away.  
But we're just more poised and doing a better job of making the defense. We
even got a shot clock violation, but even then it's a dead ball turnover and
you're still killing 35 seconds off the clock. So we're not rushing quick
shots any more as much, and we're taking care of the ball for the most part.
So those are the two biggest things we're doing differently down the stretch.  
COACH WILLIAMS: If you look at the Louisville game, we had two air balls and
two turnovers in four straight possessions because we rushed it. And I think
Marcus is right, I didn't like the shot clock violation, but it did take 35
seconds off and we were able to get our defense set. Also I think Brice and
Marcus and Justin stepping to the free‑throw line and making their free throws
at 64‑60\. I'm not sure if we had‑‑ we may have had one field goal after that,
but the last six points were all free throws, six for six.  
  
Q. Roy, going back to Kennedy, when did you find out that he was going to
play and you decided you were going to play him? And, Marcus, how important in
a game like this and tournament like this where you hope to play four and
four, to have him give you what he gave you today?  
MARCUS PAIGE: It's very important. Every body is important. He had to have
depth at this time of the year. We're playing back‑to‑back to back, so we
needed his minutes to help our big‑ man rotation out. Even if he couldn't give
us full Kennedy Meeks, he's still a big body that can compete and rebound down
low. So whatever he could give us today is what we needed, and he did a pretty
good job considering he's had such limited time in practice.  
Coach said yesterday he hadn't been running or anything. He's just been kind
of sitting around waiting to feel better, and he did a pretty good job. So
it's very important.  
COACH WILLIAMS: This morning at pre‑game at 10:00 the doctors told me he was
medically cleared to play. He came up to my room last night and tried to lobby
before the snack, and I told him I said I've got to get the okay from the
doctors first. Talked to the staff at pregame meal a little bit. And then
thought about it between 10:00 and when we came over here, and decided that I
was going to give him‑‑ and I told him last night, I'm not saying I'm not
going to play you the whole tournament, but he hasn't done one drill since the
Duke game. Not one live thing. Not one of anything. He may have shot free
throws over the side, but I didn't even see him do that. So I thought it could
be three or four minutes, but no more than that in any stretch.  
The first time he missed a lay‑up and then tipped it and tipped it again, and
he was jumping about as high as I jump, so he wasn't‑‑ he's never a high
jumper anyway, but I think he got his legs underneath him a lot better in the
second half, and he was a lot more effective for us in the second half.  
  
Q. Marcus, can you tell me, what did you learn from the first meeting with
Virginia and that defense? And Roy, do teams adjust and adapt the second time
they face that pack line?  
MARCUS PAIGE: I think it was within a one possession game at halftime that we
played at home against Virginia. Both teams were battling and competing. We
didn't think we played great but we liked where we were within the one
possession of the number two team in the country, we were all right. Then we
came out and returned the ball five or six times and rushed some shots, and
then they went on a pretty big run and that was the game.  
So we learned you've got to stay disciplined and stay the course against a
team like Virginia that's not going to beat themselves. They do a great job
getting the shot they want. Taking care of the ball and slowing the tempo
down. So we have to be extremely disciplined tomorrow. That may be the biggest
thing we learned from that game.  
COACH WILLIAMS: I'd agree with him. I mean the discipline factor. It's not
that they just want to wait until they get the shot they really want and we've
got to be disciplined and patient enough to guard and make sure we get a good
shot on the other end.  
  
Q. Coach, what is it about the two teams that lead to such high ‑octane
games? And Marcus, how fun is it as a point guard to play in those kind of
games?   
COACH WILLIAMS: I think it's ability, first of all. Coaches that like to go up
and down the court. I like to play a full‑court game. Coach Pitino likes to
play a full‑court game. They press a little bit more. We tried to do our
pressure in the half court, but both of us like to run the ball. Both of us
would like to make more three‑point shots.  
But I think it's just high‑level players that enjoy competing. Every game has
been so much different. The first game they led basically the whole game and
we stole it at the end. Second game we're up 18 and they played great down the
stretch. Today they're up 10, and we just kept playing. So I think it's just
two groups of kids that like to compete, and I felt very fortunate to be
involved.  
MARCUS PAIGE: Yeah, I mean, it's fun. There are a lot of athletes on the floor
in this game. I talked about it yesterday how big rebounding would be. A lot
of plays were made above the rim today. It's fun for a point guard because we
don't get to do that very much, ever, really, be above the rim. It's fun to
have guys like Brice that throw the ball too.  
In terms of being a guard in this league, this year our guard play was
fantastic throughout the entire league, from Quinn Cook, Olivier Hanlan,
Grant, Rozier, the list goes on and on. So it's really fun to get those
different types of match‑ups every time.  
  
Q. Coach, what went into your decision to play as much zone? How did you
evaluate how you all played it?  
COACH WILLIAMS: Two things. We played it against them at their place. I think
seven possessions or five, and I don't think they scored a single possession
against it. Our man wasn't working very well. I thought Rozier was really just
taking people. J.P. was in foul trouble. So it maybe slows them down a little
bit and makes it easier to find the shooters, makes it a little easier to stop
the dribble penetration because we've got our center in the middle of the
floor there. But I was just trying to find something that worked.  
  
Q. Not to jinx you, but your team is shooting about 41%, 42% from three over
the last seven games. Sorry, guys.  
COACH WILLIAMS: Look over your shoulder the rest of the friggin' night, okay.
Let's understand that.  
  
Q. Is that a matter of getting better looks? Is that a matter of the shot
just going?  
COACH WILLIAMS: It's more selective shooting. I mean, look, guys, we talked
about it in the locker room before the game. The coaches we're I think third
in the league in three‑point shooting percentage, but we've taken the 15th
most attempts. There are how many teams in our league? 15. All right, so we're
taking better shots is what it is. So if we shoot a poor percentage tomorrow
your butt better not come in here.

### [Ralston Turner](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21856)

  
_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

Duke  77  
North Carolina State  53

  
COACH GOTTFRIED: Obviously, we're disappointed, and this is one for us that
we've got to quickly kind of erase from our memory. But I thought Duke was
terrific today. They played sensational in the first half. They moved the ball
quick. They were quicker than we were. We had a hard time defending them, and
it was just one of those days where they had everything going, and we
struggled to get something going.  
So I was proud of the fact that our guys kept battling. They battled all the
way to the end. Obviously we were down in a giant hole, and. But you've got to
give Duke credit. They're the story today. Wasn't us. We obviously didn't play
very well, but they played terrific basketball in the first 20 minutes, just
sensational.  
  
Q. Trevor said that what Duke was doing defensively he just at times had no
idea what they were doing that he and Cat would give up the ball and he was
just kind of baffled. What was it that you guy his so much trouble recognizing
what they were doing?  
COACH GOTTFRIED: I thought what happened was they played match‑up zone and
really put a lot of attention on not letting those two guys have a lot of room
to operate. I think what happened to our team is we didn't move very well. We
didn't move the ball well, and we didn't move our bodies well. We tried to put
a square peg in a round hole. We just kept trying to create some things off
the dribble with very little ball movement, and I thought that really hurt us.  
I thought the second half we started moving the ball, and we got the ball from
side‑to‑side, and all of a sudden things began to open up a little bit. But I
thought early in the game, we tried to do too much by ourselves.  
  
Q. Do you have an update on Cat?  
COACH GOTTFRIED: No, I really don't. I don't know that there's any
determination yet on what his situation is. So I don't know.  
  
Q. Just to follow up on that. Is there any procedural stuff that you guys
have done or plan whether it's concussion protocol or even going to a hospital
or doctor?  
COACH GOTTFRIED: No, he's in the locker room with our doctors, and, again, I
don't think anything has been determined yet. I don't know. If it has, they
haven't told me. Our medical staff is with him. Obviously, the number one
priority is to make sure he's okay. That is the first and most important thing
right now with Cat.  
  
Q. Coach "K" just said that he thought that your team might have been
fatigued after playing a tough game last night. Do you think that played a
factor this evening?   
COACH GOTTFRIED: Oh, I don't know. We looked tired, but I think in a
tournament setting you've got to be ready to play and bounce back after a
tough game. That's the advantage of finishing in the Top 5 seeds. You don't
have to play the first night. You get to rest. But we did look a step slow,
there is no question about it, and they looked a lot quicker early on.  
  
Q. With Cat, did you think he was banged up from last night with his back or
anything else?  
COACH GOTTFRIED: Not necessarily. Before? Yeah, not necessarily. He was a
little sore today at our walk through, but and he wanted to play. There wasn't
any part of that that would have led anybody to believe that he wouldn't play
today. That's just part of the normal bumps and bruises of a game, so, no.  
  
Q. Austin, a couple times this year Duke lost at Notre Dame and blew them
out in the first half at Cameron. Wake Forest gave them the game at Winston
‑Salem. You guys beat Duke. Did you see it coming? Were you aware of any of
what they'd done? Did you know about any of that?   
RALSTON TURNER: If you asked anybody on our team, they would tell you they
knew they'd be ready for us. If they would have beaten us, we'd be ready for
them. That's just how it goes. But you know, even though, you have to give
them credit because they played great. They came out really good. They came
out crisp. We couldn't get stops, so I think that was the game.  
  
Q. Your assessment of N.C. State's tournament credentials?  
COACH GOTTFRIED: I'm not on the committee, but I think we've certainly earned
the right to be in the tournament. We'll find out on Sunday like everybody
else. But I think that we've proven that we're one of the teams in the
at‑large pool that needs to play. I think we've done enough, but we'll see.  
  
Q. Can you walk us through what the protocol is in the event that maybe Cat
did suffer a concussion in terms of just a time line of what it would take for
him to play next week or Thursday?  
COACH GOTTFRIED: Well, the good news is we have basically a week before you
play, and maybe a week and a day, I guess, if you played on Friday. So I don't
know all the exact steps with him. I do know that our medical staff will do
everything that they're supposed to do.  
Like I said earlier, the number one thing that we're going to do is look out
for his safety and well being, and so hopefully in a day or two he's good. If
not, we'll learn that as we go. We'll just wait and see. I don't know the
answer to those questions as I sit here tonight.  
  
Q. When you played them the first time, you basically doubled their points
in the paint. Tonight kind of the reverse. Two ‑part question. First, what
were some of your issues in terms of establishing your offense in the paint,
and then what were some of your defensive issues that allowed them to be so
successful in the paint?   
COACH GOTTFRIED: I think offensively it starts with our lack of ball movement.
We didn't move the ball very well. I thought we were really easy to guard. We
didn't move the ball ask get it from side‑to‑side. So that hurt us some, and
we didn't get the ball around the basket. We just tried to do too many things
one‑on‑one.  
Second part of your question, I thought with Okafor, he demands a lot of
attention. We doubled down on him a couple times. He got the ball out of the
double teams. They made pretty much every shot. As they got the ball out of
the double teams and moved it once or twice, and it's kind of a pick your
poison sometimes with him. You can play him one‑on‑one in the post and latch
on to shooters, and he's tough to guard that way too. So they were on top of
their game today.  
The first half they were on top of it. They played‑‑ like I said, they were
sensational early.  
  
Q. Ralston, your season has had its ebbs and flows. Do you think you have
what it takes to drop this and get geeked up for the NCAAs, assuming you make
it?  
RALSTON TURNER: I think so. We've been in this situation before this year, and
I'd like to say that we've learned our lesson and learned how to let things
go. So I know I'm going to let it go, and I'm pretty sure everybody else is
with me too.  
COACH GOTTFRIED: One thing too, just to remind you on that, I told our team
this, hopefully we get in the tournament. So I'm not one to assume anything.
But if I got this right, I think I am, I think UCONN lost last year in their
conference tournament by 40, 40. They came back and won six straight games.  
So we're going to let it go. Obviously we're disappointed, but, if, in fact
we're chosen to play in the greatest show on earth, we're going to be excited
about playing and we'll move on from here today.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 12, 2015

  

### [Quinn Cook](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25286)

### [Mike Krzyzewski](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13672)

### [Marshall Plumlee](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28561)

  
_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

Duke  77  
North Carolina State  53

  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: We beat a really good team tonight. I thought our guys were
unbelievably ready. They played outstanding defense, and we shared the ball
well. To have six guys in double figures and 14 assists and only five
turnovers. It's just an outstanding game.  
You play State, and they had a tough game last night against Pitt, and they
played great. It's tough to do it two nights in a row. So, yeah, we had an
advantage in that respect. I'm glad that they're going to be an NCAA team.
They deserve it, and hopefully we get a lot of those teams in there. Any
questions?  
  
Q. Quinn, I'm sure after he had that 34 ‑point night containing Cat Barber
was probably a priority. What did you do and Tyus do to make sure he didn't
get any points tonight?   
QUINN COOK: Just make him work. He had an outstanding game last night. His
last ten games he's been averaging 17 points, so he's a hot player. One of the
hottest players in the country, so just wanted to make him work and not leave
him because he's been shooting the ball.  
But you also have to respect his first step. He's one of the tougher guys to
guard. Myself, Tyus, Matt, Greyson, we just wanted to make him work and not
leave him.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk a little about the boost that Marshall who had a
career high and Grayson provided you off the bench? They both provided huge
minutes for you guys?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Yeah, they were terrific. Absolutely terrific.  
  
Q. Mike, in a tournament in which you hope to play three games in three
days, how big was it tonight to get the minutes you got from Marshall,
Grayson, and Amile and your bench?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Good point. Good question. Our eight guys have been playing
well. We played‑‑ when we won our last regular season game during that time at
Carolina, the guys on the bench were on the court. So we've been seeing it
happen. Marshall‑‑ you know, Marshall was very precise in his screening and
rim running. He was powerful when finishing.  
I had concern coming into the game because Quinn's been sick for a few days,
and he didn't practice at all one day, and limited the next. So he gave a
gutty effort tonight, and just got to keep getting fluids in him. But, again,
Grayson has been coming on like crazy. Not the dunk, but the offensive rebound
basket I think was probably for us the best play of the game. Just such a
powerful play.  
  
Q. Again tonight you used a lot of zone. You've done that all year. What is
it about this team that's made that defense so effective for you this year?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Well, they play together. So any defense that you put out
there, we did something a little bit different tonight with the zone press and
the half court. They picked it up really well in our walk through today in our
game preparation. So they've done that throughout this last couple months
whenever we've done something a little bit different defensively. They believe
in it. Look, they make it happen, so thank goodness they're playing that hard.  
We played really hard, especially in that first half and the three‑quarter
court press and back into a zone.  
  
Q. First time you guys played N.C. State, it seemed that you guys were
really looking for an identity. Is this the brand of basketball you want to be
playing especially this time of the year?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Well, the first time we played State we were undefeated, so
that was a pretty good identity. We lost that identity really quick because
they beat the hell out of us, and they played great. What we're doing is
maturing as a basketball team, and you don't do that until really you get into
conference play.  
So, look, State's a terrific team. I think Mark's done an unbelievable job
with his kids. They have good unity. You have those three guys on the
perimeter, they can really score the ball. It's obvious that Cat is hurt. I
think that back from last night, so he probably wasn't a hundred percent, so
we're lucky that he wasn't a hundred percent.  
  
Q. Quinn, could you talk about your defensive play this season and maybe how
much you've kind of embraced that role as a stopper this year?  
QUINN COOK: I just was tired of coach getting on me in film about not playing
defense. So it took me three years to finally realize I needed to play
defense. I mean, it's fun. It's fun. I've learned to enjoy playing great
defense and my teammates have helped me. I'm never playing by myself out
there. Guys like Marshall, Ja, Amile, they're always talking to us. Every day
we're working at it, and we're all getting better, and we take pride in our
defense.  
  
Q. Marshall, your role is such that you do a lot of things that don't get
noticed very much. How fun was it tonight to get a few highlight reel
moments?  
MARSHALL PLUMLEE: It was a lot of fun, and it made for a great team win.
Everyone on the team does a really good job of picking you up when you're down
and being enthusiastic and encouraging one another.  
So even in those moments when I'm maybe not making highlight plays but doing
the right things, I have guys on the bench, guys on the court who are really
encouraging me and keeping my head high.  
  
Q. Coach, you used to play everybody twice. Now you don't do that any more,
obviously. Do you even talk about that any more? Notre Dame, you lost to them
there. You really bludgeoned them pretty good in the first half in Durham. And
you lost to State the first time, and in the first half of this game it looked
like you guys may have been eager for payback really?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: I think we're eager just to be in the tournament. Certainly
if you have a double round robin, they'd have to add about eight games to the
NCAA for our league, but that's how you get a true champion. Those return
games whether you won or lost, are always‑‑ were always some of the best games
in the league. I mean, if you go back‑‑ because everyone's so competitive.  
But our guys, I think, primarily it was we needed to get off to a good start
in this tournament. This tournament means a lot to us. I was really concerned.
I'm surprised that we won the way we did because I think State can beat
anybody. I think‑‑ I like how Mark has put his team together.  
Watching them last night, I'm a little bit surprised we were able to play the
defense we did tonight against them. That's why I think they were probably a
little bit tired.  
  
Q. Marshall and Quinn, you guys were 6 ‑6 in your last 12 postseason games,
and this team definitely feels different than that. What are some lessons
learned or what's different about this year's team?   
MARSHALL PLUMLEE: I feel like we've really focused and prided ourself in
preparation. I think we can attribute tonight especially to preparation. We
had a game plan. In a short amount of time we were able to come together,
listen to coach, and show some discipline by executing it in the game. So I'd
have to chalk that up to preparation.  
QUINN COOK: Preparation. Playing with a sense of urgency, especially the older
guys who have been here. Postseason we didn't play as well as we wanted to, so
we get another chance this year for the guys who returned. Our younger guys
they've bought in since day one. So we're playing with a sense of urgency and
remaining hungry.  
I think we play our best basketball when we have a chip on our shoulder. We're
playing our best basketball right now, and guys keep wanting to get better,
and I know we're not satisfied.  
  
Q. You are either going to get Notre Dame or Miami. That's two of your three
losses. What have you learned from those games against those two teams?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Well, we haven't played Miami in two months, so I haven't
been watching them at all. Notre Dame is one of the most explosive offensive
teams in the country and a veteran team. And I don't know their exact record,
but I think they've won 25 or 26 games now. So either one will be a tough
assignment. We're happy we're playing on Friday. It will be a late game
though. We have to adjust to that.  
  
Q. Mike, why did you go to the defensive tactics? Did you think it would be
something you'd be able to use the whole game?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: We were hoping. Yeah, we just felt we were going to try to
stop their penetration so the three‑quarter court worked in that respect. Then
with the zone we tried to defend their three perimeter guys with our four
perimeter guys, and have Ja or Marshall protect the basket. And these guys did
a good job of talking. So outside of Turner, we lost Turner a couple times,
but the first half was way beyond our expectations, let's put it that way.  
  
Q. Grayson's an example of rapid, late ‑season improvement, but the other
three guys were pretty productive right out of the gate for you. When you look
at them, all four, do you see a lot of things that they do better now than say
back in December?   
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Yeah, well they do everything better. Part of that is just
the experience of you know who you have to play against. The caliber of player
brings out your talents, and it does with other teams in the league. Our guys
are good learners. Our upperclassmen, these two guys, Quinn has been our
captain and he's done that. But Marshall pushes Ja every day.  
When I look at the freshmen developing, I think Marshall over these last three
and a half weeks has really improved. I mean he has such complete focus, and
it's had a big, big bearing on our success, especially in each practice. He
brings this enthusiasm and sharpness that is so good.  
Grayson's a good player. I mean, these guys love Grayson, and he's fearless.
He can shoot and score, and he's just been given more of an opportunity now.
But he's been ready for the opportunity now.  
  
Q. When you guys played them the first time, they basically doubled you in
terms of points in paint, and you guys kind of reversed that tonight. What was
the biggest difference for you guys in terms of keeping them out of the paint
tonight?  
MARSHALL PLUMLEE: We played a team defense that required us to talk. And when
we're talking, we're a better defensive team. So whenever there is a weak spot
in the zone, we talk, we'd compensate, and it was just a lot of movement, a
lot of activity especially in the first half. And we were able to work
together to protect our paint from penetration from low‑post entries, and it
worked out in the end for us.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 12, 2015

  

### [Mike Brey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13733)

### [Pat Connaughton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23387)

### [Demetrius Jackson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28578)

  
_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

Notre Dame  70  
Miami  63

  
COACH BREY: Well, I'm really proud of our group, because they really, we
struggled against their zone, and we couldn't get much of a rhythm after
playing beautifully in the first half against their man‑to‑man. But this group
all year has been really poised away from our building when there's been a run
and the other team takes the lead.  
We won it tonight with our defense though. Our D had to win it for us. They
shot I think 36% from the floor, and I'm really proud of how we dug in and
defended even though we weren't flowing offensively. I think that's where
we've matured a lot.  
  
Q. Coach, you mentioned the zone bothering you in the second half. What
adjustments can you make when they're getting their hands in the passing lanes
and everything that was going right in the first half stalls like that?  
COACH BREY: Well, you don't want to overcoach it either because then you more
paralyze your guys. I thought D and Jerian did a better job at key times
driving gaps. We ball screened the zone a little bit more, and we treated it a
little bit more like a man to man situation.  
Now to open the second half, we had some great looks from three, and we didn't
miss a shot in the first half. You make a couple of those and it loosens up
the whole atmosphere. We miss a couple and now the thing changes and you're in
a dog fight. But driving the gaps and screening and screening probably more
for this guy because he's come so far with his decision making with the
basketball.  
  
Q. Coach, you guys lost the lead there for a minute in the second half. What
was the level of concern in the huddle?  
COACH BREY: You know what? That's where I told them I'm really proud of them.
The Carolina game on the road, we answered charges. Just last Wednesday,
Louisville goes on an 11‑0 run. This group has always been really poised. Our
leadership is good. Demetrius' voice is fabulous in those timeouts. We just
kept coming back to, you know what? We're not in a great rhythm offensively.
We're going to have to defend to win. So let's just keep guarding. We
eventually got some transition stuff because we got stops, and then that gave
us some breathing room.  
  
Q. How much did Steve's three ‑pointer and the drive by Demetrius calm
things out?   
COACH BREY: Those were huge plays. Steve Vasturia was on an IV this afternoon.
He was sick as a dog. To do what he did, make big shots and make big plays and
guarded McClellan most of the night, fabulous. And I thought this guy gave us
confidence. He started the game for us confidently, driving, kicking, scoring,
going to the hole. I told him after he made that drive I should have gotten it
to you more and let you drive it. I said my mistake. I'll be better tomorrow
night.  
  
Q. Jerian in the locker room said that their zone was kind of a weird zone
and something you haven't seen before. What made their zone different?  
COACH BREY: I think it's the bodies that are in a zone. When they're long and
their open stance bothers you, it's hard. They have some length, and then they
have the shot blocker at the rim. When he fouled out, we were able to get to
the rim a little bit more. So, you know, you get it to the middle. You have
the shot blocker back there. They're in passing lanes. It's tricky. It was
tricky to play against.  
Fortunately, he fouled out and we were able to get to the hole. His drive was
huge, and I think that gave us confidence that we could he is scape.  
  
Q. Looking ahead, guys, you had two totally crazy different games against
the team you're playing tomorrow. What do you take away from what you remember
about those games as you think about that match ‑up?   
DEMETRIUS JACKSON: You know, it was a great team. We're going to have to play
and be on our A‑game. But we just want to be aggressive, keep doing the things
we're doing. We did a great job tonight defensively. We did a great job
tonight offensively. We just need to do it more consistently.  
PAT CONNAUGHTON: I think the most important thing for us is stay in attack
mode. On our way over here Demetrius made a great point that we missed a few
open shots and we got a little passive against the zone. When you play against
a team as athletic as Miami, you're going to have some turnovers. The goal is
to limit those and we've just got to stay in attack mode because we could see
some zone tomorrow night against Duke.  
  
Q. Mike, you've been a part of the ACC for a long time. What's it mean to
you to have your team in the semifinals?  
COACH BREY: You know, I told Seth Greenberg coming off the court, I really
feel we're in the ACC now. To come out tomorrow night in the semifinals. Three
long‑standing founding members of the ACC and us, I feel like we're in it. I'm
really proud to come out with my team tomorrow night in this atmosphere, and
playing against a great program.  
You're right, we had two very different games. That had to be the best they
played when we saw them in Durham. But they're playing really well now.
They're confident now. We're going to have to attack a zone. I think they'll
pick up and that's something that they've evolved into and we're going to have
to be good against that. Can we guard? They're really skilled offensively. Can
we guard them? That is the next level challenge defensively for us.  
  
Q. Demetrius and Pat, what impact did that loss in Cameron have on you guys
because it was so overwhelming?  
PAT CONNAUGHTON: Yeah, that loss was something that came out and they beat us.
It was something that from the jump they had a little bit more energy than we
did. But to be honest, I think it's something that's going to help motivate us
moving into tomorrow. Obviously we had a great game the rest of them at our
home, but when we went down there they killed us.  
They really made a statement where most people think that the win we had may
have been more of a fluke than anything. So I think we'll use that as
motivation, and we couldn't be happier to get a rematch against them. And
we're going to have to come out and play our best.  
DEMETRIUS JACKSON: Like I said before, just a great team. We're going to have
to bring our A‑game. Like coach said, that is the next step for us defensively
is being able to guard a team like that, and being able to do it together as
five and continuing to rebound the way we have been.  
COACH BREY: I got Matt in the starting lineup, didn't I? He went off to
Cameron and he's been starting ever since.  
You know what was great to follow up on your question. I was really proud of
this group because we bounced back and won at Clemson right after that. I tore
the stat sheet up at practice the next day. That's one we didn't dwell on very
much.  
  
Q. Demetrius, as Coach Brey said, you came out very aggressively. What got
you in that frame of mind? Your body language indicated that you were ready to
attack at the start of the game.  
DEMETRIUS JACKSON: Just trying to set the tone for my team. I knew we needed
to get out to a great start. So I wanted to help motivate our team and play as
hard as I can for these seniors and this group of guys. That's what we did
tonight. The great first half gave us a little bit of a cushion in the second
half.  
  
Q. Mike, when you were at Duke as an assistant, do you remember Mike ever
playing any zone, and have you said anything to him about backing off his man
‑to‑man?   
COACH BREY: No, I haven't teased him. I will on the road when I see him in
April. No, they play that 12, which is that kind of 1‑2‑2 match‑up. They were
in it a bunch tonight. They're extending it a little bit, but that was
something Mike had in the arsenal while I was there.  
I think one year maybe played it a little more than usual. But that 1‑2‑2
match‑up, and of course they've shown 2‑3 as well. But it's helped them. It
keeps their offensive guys fresh. Keeps Okafor around the basket, and he
doesn't have to mess around with ball screens, so it's been effective for
them.  
  
Q. Pat, just to follow up, you came out really smoking in the first half,
shooting, obviously, very confident. Second half Coach Brey had to sit you
down there for a second. What was your mindset at that moment?  
PAT CONNAUGHTON: Just trying to do the best I can to help the team win. I
think obviously I know the second half wasn't my best performance, but the
first half helped get us that cushion. I think it's not something I can think
too much about. I think maybe it's something that I can stop being on my heels
just because I missed a shot here and there. But for the most part, you've got
to give credit to my teammates for picking me up in the second half.  
I think they did a fabulous job of not only picking me up on the court, but
also getting on me a little bit to let me know there are other ways that I can
affect the game besides shooting.  
I think Demetrius especially has really grown in that category, and got on me
when I came out of the game and I was back in the game trying to do whatever I
could to help us maintain the lead and recover it when we dropped it.  
  
Q. There is a fun piece of trivia that says you're the only former Coach "K"
assistant qualified to write how to beat Coach "K". Is that trivial? Is there
anything meaningful in that?   
COACH BREY: I think that's something they just talk about in Gene Devine's bar
in downtown Durham over a couple of beers. You know, I've said this when we've
had success against Duke, you know, it was like when I got to Notre Dame. When
we could beat Syracuse and we could beat Georgetown, those were
program‑endorsing wins as we were trying to build a program.  
The same thing this year, for us to beat Duke and to beat NorthCarolina, that
makes us look like we belong in this league. But I had a great eight years
there. Mike and I get together when we're on the road recruiting and talk
about it a lot.  
But, again, it's a thrill for me to come out in the semifinals tomorrow night
with our program and these other three programs and certainly to play Duke.
We're really, it's a proud moment for us.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE MEN'S

### [Montay Brandon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=27793)

### [Leonard Hamilton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14060)

  
_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

VIRGINIA  58  
FLORIDA STATE - 44

  
COACH HAMILTON: I think you've got to give University of Virginia a lot of
credit. I thought they came out initially in the game. They were extremely
well prepared defensively and offensively. They made us work on defense. Shot
a very high percentage in the first half.  
I could just tell that they were mentally really engaged in the game because
we dug a hole for ourselves and came back in the second half and played much
better. But whenever you give a team of that caliber that working margin,
obviously, you put yourself in a very difficult situation to have to overcome.  
So I just think that we lost to a team today that was a little bit‑‑ that
played extremely well, and really, really was very well‑prepared, somewhat
rested and played with a tremendous amount of energy.  
I was proud of our guys that we were able to fight back. Defensively I thought
we did a very good job for the majority of the second half. We had the game
within a couple of possessions, and obviously they made a couple plays that
really, really put us back on our heels.  
So I've just got to say congratulations to them. But I was very proud of my
guys. I thought they came back in the second half and made the adjustment more
mentally and emotionally as well as physically, and gave us a chance. But we
came up a little short.  
  
Q. You were assessed a technical foul with a little over five minutes left.
Your team was coming back. Can you talk about that?  
COACH HAMILTON: Are you saying that the technical foul affected the game?  
  
Q. I'm asking your thoughts on it.  
COACH HAMILTON: Well, we lost by 14. Hit both of their free throws. I don't
normally get technicals. I think I may have gotten two technicals in six,
seven, eight, nine years, so I think my record speaks for itself when it comes
down to getting technicals. But I feel fortunate that it didn't affect the
game, if that answers your question.  
  
Q. Montay, they scored on their first seven trips of the game, and then
after that it seemed that they had a hard time doing much of anything against
you guys. What was the difference in the beginning of the game and over the
last 30 minutes?  
MONTAY BRANDON: At the beginning of the game we weren't prepared for their
adjustments. We came out kind of sluggish. The foul there on the floor, we
were letting them catch the ball in spots where they were comfortable in their
scoring options. When we finally picked up our defensive pressure and stopped
what we were supposed to be stopping which is them and their scoring
operations, that helped us guard them a little better.  
  
Q. Bit of a transition for you this year. Do you all hope to play in a
postseason and kind of how do you assess the way the year has gone?  
COACH HAMILTON: Obviously, we've had some challenges that we had to overcome
this year. But I think anytime you're faced with those types of things, you
lose a player and you have some injuries, and we had some moving parts going
on especially early in the season, it can make or break you.  
I think what's happened with this team, we made the adjustments. We've gotten
strong in character, and we've learned how to do more with maybe less depth
than what we've been accustomed to. Which I think, as we move through the
remaining of this season into the future we can be a better basketball team,
as a result of going through the challenges that we've had.  
The true test of your character is how do you handle yourself when you're
under adversity, and I think this team has improved as we moved through the
year. They've handled the adversity that we've had to deal with this year. Not
having our leading scorer, having injuries, and trying to play with not quite
as much depth as we've had in the position, I think our guys have adjusted. I
think that was evident in the second half. Our three guards played all 40
minutes. We didn't have a substitute there in the second half on the perimeter
because of the depth and the experience that we are lacking this particular
year.  
But that's okay. I think we're growing, and I think our guys have gotten
tougher. I think the future is going to be pretty bright for our program. We
only have one senior on our team. We have a pretty decent recruiting year
coming in. So I think our guys will be able to bring‑‑ when the young kids
come in, they'll be able to share the experience, give them the wisdom that
they've gained from going through the challenges that we've had this year, and
hopefully we'll be better as we move through.  
  
Q. (No Microphone)?  
COACH HAMILTON: Yes, we hope to play in postseason. We're looking forward to
playing in one of the tournaments, hopefully, whichever one we have the
opportunity to play in.  
  
Q. Montay and DeVon, same question. What do you take from this year to build
into next year. That's going to be your last season. What do you take from
this year moving forward?  
MONTAY BRANDON: The one thing we take is I guess we can take the way we played
early in the year, knowing that every game matters. We lost a lot of games
earlier in the year that we could have won, and that would have put us in a
better position later in the season, and it kind of came back to bite us in
the butt towards the end. So that is probably the main thing. When the new
guys come, to take no game for granted because it will hurt you at the end of
the season.  
DEVON BOOKERT: What I'm mostly going to take from it is a lesson because we
went through a lot of adversity, and I think our team kept on improving
through the year even to now. So I think we'll take it as a lesson and try to
teach the incoming class the things that we messed up on so they don't have to
go through those type of things.

### [Tony Bennett](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18257)

### [Evan Nolte](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26920)

### [Mike Tobey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26955)

  
_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

VIRGINIA  58  
FLORIDA STATE - 44

  
COACH BENNETT: Certainly I really liked how we came out and played in the
first half. I thought we were very sharp and played with a purpose
defensively. Didn't give them easy looks, rebounded well. Then offensively we
had a good pace, whether at times we broke them down, but we got to the paint
a lot.  
They're hard to just throw it in the post because they're big and they front.
But we got the good looks. I thought Lon deposit got us going, and we got a
great look from Evan. He knocked down some of those shots and looked good. In
the second half there were enough plays that were made for us to be
successful, but we labored. We labored offensively at times and had break
downs defensively, and we had just enough. You know, we've got to get better
in that regard.  
But I think guys with the foul trouble and guys being out for a little bit,
we've got great lifts from really whoever stepped on the floor.  
  
Q. When you can get that kind of contribution from Evan and his shooting,
how much difference does it make for the offense and the team overall?  
COACH BENNETT: Again, they're a good defensive team, and they're physical,
just to stretch it out. He hit the one we really needed. London penetrated
baseline, and it was just a big three for us when we were really struggling to
score. So absolutely. That's, again, different guys, different times. I've
been saying Evan has been so steady for us and it hasn't always showed
statistically. Well, today it showed with him stretching that defense and
making some good plays.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Justin's comeback and what your thoughts were about
how he responded?  
COACH BENNETT: Yeah, I mean, he hasn't played for 32 days he's been out. So I
was so thankful that he could be out there. It should have been a week before,
we thought, if everything went well. But we just wanted‑‑ I told him we're
going to use you some short stints and see what you can do. Of course he
looked rusty, of course, he's going to have certain things. But my hope is
next time he's out there, he's better, and you just kind of have to go through
that. When he got upended and fell, I was concerned for a second, but he said
he landed on his back side so he was okay.  
But that's a month, and so hopefully we can get more and he can continue to
get sharper. That's why it was a good win for us.  
  
Q. Tony, you talked prior to the tournament about your concern about
turnovers recently, and it looked like you had more than you wanted again
today. To what would you attribute that?  
COACH BENNETT: Yeah, we talk about that when our turnovers lead to easy
breakouts especially. If we miss a shot, we're usually better on the rebound
in transition D. But those hurt when you go in there and all of a sudden
they're getting breakouts. We've just got to keep trying to be as sound as we
can while still running our offense. Couple times we drive the pile and it was
tough. Some of those are some offensive fouls, but we know how we say we're a
possession by possession team.  
So those are a few of those take us out of it in terms of getting a good look,
and also they resulted in‑‑ I'm trying to look. It's too small for me. Points
off turnovers it gave them 7 for Florida State that they didn't have to have.  
  
Q. Tony, Rathan ‑Mayes finished with 13 points, but he really had to work
for them. Were you pleased with the defensive effort on him?   
COACH BENNETT: Yeah, Marial gave us a nice lift when Malcolm got in foul
trouble. And these guys were trying to talk and do a good job with all the
ball screens they set for him. But he's a guy obviously we know can get going
in a hurry. So I thought Malcolm picked up some fouls and did a good job for
the most part. And Marial gave us a nice lift, and you need someone like that
with some length that can contest his shots.  
  
Q. I was going to ask Tony about Malcolm didn't score until the last nine
minutes, I think. But down the stretch he hit the free throws. What did you
see in his game tonight?  
COACH BENNETT: Yeah, I thought he was pressing a little bit. He got in foul
trouble, sat out. And he took a couple good shots, they just didn't go in in
the second half. But a couple times I thought he pressed a little bit and
forced the issue.  
I thought that's a fine line because you want Malcolm is wired to be
aggressive, and I want him to be aggressive. We talk about that, but still
have some soundness. But then he did hit the big one where he kind of lowered
his shoulder and got the two pull‑ups or step backs and knocked his free
throws down. So, again, we'll need more from him. He knows that. But he did
make some key buckets.  
  
Q. Evan, that last three was from a few feet behind the line there, pretty
deep. I take it you were feeling good with your stroke today?  
EVAN NOLTE: Yeah, I don't try to pay attention too much from the three‑point
line to be honest. But it was just in rhythm. I think the shot clock was going
down, and when you have guys as talented as we do offensively it gives you a
chance to spread out a little bit. People are in what we call the gaps, and
they have to close out a little longer, and that's why I stepped back a little
more and just let it go with confidence.  
  
Q. Mike, you had some tough plays inside against Louisville where you got
contested rebounds and you did more of that today. Anything different the last
couple games for you around the basket?  
MIKE TOBEY: Just going into today knowing they have a lot of big guys on that
team, so just had to be aggressive around the boards. Just we've been really
stressing that in practice as well. Just every day, working on rebounding, so
that was a big key for us.  
  
Q. Your team has been the best, and probably the most consistent in the ACC
these past couple of seasons. Do you think that you guys get the respect that
you deserve being in a conference with your NorthCarolinas and your Dukes?  
COACH BENNETT: Absolutely, yeah. We get more than enough respect. Again, it's
just us about playing as well as we can and being as good as we can so it
doesn't really matter either way because it's about how you perform. But the
fact that these guys won a regular season championship and then the
opportunities are there to keep advancing. Yeah, I've said that before. We had
College Gameday. We've got people telling our guys congratulations and people
that are proud of their effort knowing that we've got to keep better, but 10%
we get enough.  
  
Q. Evan, how much of your improved shooting recently is due to getting more
arc on the shot?  
EVAN NOLTE: I think it's a lot of it. I think another part of it is I think
the arc coach, I don't know what game it was, but I think my shots were
varied. Didn't have a lot of arc at all. And really having that in my mind
every time and going into shooting it helped me a lot. Having more legs. The
last shot I took I didn't have arc or my legs under it, and I missed it by a
lot, I thought. So it was a big part of it.  
I think also playing and getting a lot more minutes and reps also gets you in
the flow and gets you in rhythm and used to those type of shots in game‑type
settings.

### [Marcus Paige](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25071)

### [J.P. Tokoto](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28484)

_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

North Carolina  81  
Boston College  63

  
COACH WILLIAMS: Well, we feel really good about the outcome. It was hard for
BC to play two straight days like that. It's hard in this tournament. We've
got to put that out of our mind because we get a chance to do it tomorrow, and
it's an opportunity, is the way we look at it. But I think that Hanlan is just
so, so hard to guard. I think J.P. really did a nice job on him.  
Marcus had him some, Joel had him some, but he's a big time, big time player
and our goal was just to make sure he didn't shoot a great percentage. I think
5 for 19, that happened.  
But Jimmie has really done a heck of a good job with his club to have that big
losing streak and then turn everything around at the end and win four in a row
is something that I'm sure the BC people like the end of that. But he's
really, a good, good, good coach.  
Again, you look at it, Aaron Brown has 20 for them, and Hanlan has 18. Those
are their two leading scorers. Again, we were trying to make sure they didn't
shoot as good a percentage. They shoot 37 for the game. As a matter of fact,
(Indiscernible) was 49 too. We ought to get all over Jaye Coleman. If he
hadn't missed that lay‑up, we would have been 50% for the game.  
I thought Marcus with 17 points 9 assists 6 rebounds, J.P. with 4 assists zero
turnovers, 9 rebounds. Brice early was a scoring thing for us. He didn't score
as well. And second half one stretch we missed three lay‑ups out of four
possessions, but the guys kept playing. They got it to eight, and they shoot a
three from the corner and it goes all the way in and comes out. That could
have been a five‑point game. Instead we go down, and Joel Berry gets fouled
and makes two free throws, and Marcus makes a good pass to Brice and we score
again.  
So it was at 8 and we scored again and it was 14, so that was a big moment for
us right there. But we got three straight great shots during that time period
there. Feel fortunate and happy to continue being here.  
  
Q. Marcus, how close are you to a hundred percent now?  
MARCUS PAIGE: I feel pretty good, honestly. Like I said after the Georgia Tech
game, that was the first game I had played without any pain, and then the Duke
game was the same way, and this game I felt really good too. I would say I'm
very, very close to a hundred percent.  
I can't give you a number, but I would say above 90%. So I'm happy I'm finally
able not to worry so much about my foot and just worry about how I can help
the team.  
  
Q. Marcus, kind of going off of that, when your foot is feeling closer to
full health, what does it allow you to do a little differently that can be
more aggressive? How does that change how you play?  
MARCUS PAIGE: Yeah, I do a better job pushing the ball and shooting from the
floor, two‑pointers. Today I guess, yeah, I made some two‑pointers. Usually
when I had my foot injury, I felt myself kind of floating around the perimeter
and not being as aggressive and attacking. It also helps me defensively in
other categories where I can be a little more athletic and not have to worry
about it.  
COACH WILLIAMS: Yeah, you were five for five on two‑pointers.  
  
Q. Coach, what did you say to Hanlan when you stopped for a minute after the
game? And J.P., did you take this as a personal challenge against him coming
into the game since he's the leading scorer in the ACC and a huge part of
their team?  
J.P. TOKOTO: I didn't really take it as anything personal, but I knew if I did
a good job defensively today it would help my team tremendously. So I did go
in with the mindset when I was guarding him to make it tough for him, make his
shots tough. We kind of let down‑‑ well, I let down and let him get to the rim
a few times when I shouldn't have, but overall, I think we did a great job on
him today.  
COACH WILLIAMS: I think he did a great job and blocked the jumpshot from the
baseline in the first half, and I think that always affects a guy because J.P.
is quick enough and long enough that he can do those things. What I said to
him at the end was a little personal thing about how good a year I think he's
had.  
  
Q. Roy, couple questions about Kennedy Meeks. What is your prognosis? What
can you tell us about him? Also, Coach Smith used to say a team can rally
around the loss of a player for a short term game or two, long ‑term of course
it will hurt you. Do you ascribe to that?   
COACH WILLIAMS: Yes, I do. I think that so many times since I've been
coaching, especially when I was working for Coach Smith, I saw that kind of
thing happen. But I'd love to give you some information, and I'll give you
everything I have. We have no idea, guys. We have no idea. The doctors may
have known something because we took him back for some more lab work today,
and they didn't know what the result was before the game. During the game, I
didn't ask them. But my guess is if we find out, Steve will let everybody
know.  
But I don't expect him to play. He hadn't practiced. He hadn't run up and down
the court since the Duke game, not one single time. So I really don't expect
him to play.  
  
Q. Coach and J.P., there are a lot of players and coaches in this league
that have mentioned that J.P. can be one of the best defenders in this whole
league. Yet on your own film grade he's usually not graded as the best
defender on his team for the game. Is there any way to explain both of those
things?  
COACH WILLIAMS: I'm one of those coaches that says J.P. could be the best
defensive player in our league also. You know, it's two or three things. We're
asking him to do a lot. He's got to get to the backboards. He's got to get to
the offensive boards. I think he was sensational there for us today. He had a
game against NorthCarolina State in Raleigh that was as good a defensive game
as I've ever had a player play against a very good player. I think he did a
great job today. He did a fantastic job against BC up at BC, if I'm not
mistaken you were 5‑0 assist ratio at BC and 4‑0 today. So we're asking him to
do a lot of things.  
Now defensively, you have to have a lot of discipline, and you have to be
focused and the whole bit. When J.P. puts his mind to it, he is really, really
good. Sometimes his mind tends to waiver, okay. But I'll let J.P. answer that.
But I have tremendous confidence that he can really be a big‑time, big‑time
defender, and he's shown that he can do that.  
But I think the little things, and again, I'd like to see what he says, but I
think the little things sometimes he lets that slide by thinking he's going to
block the guy's shot by jumping over the trombone in the band.  
J.P. TOKOTO: Yeah, sometimes I do think things are easier than they look. For
instance, I will sag off on a play trying to bait the pass to the wing.
Sometimes I'll get it, but sometimes I won't. Those kind of things I'm working
on cutting out but at the same time, I know if I do get it, it can help our
team out so I take those chances.  
But the bad grades come from that, overplaying and overrunning and stuff like
that. But there are a lot of things that go through my mind defensively
through a game. It's just about making the right decision.  
COACH WILLIAMS: Nice job. He's a Riverboat Gambler on the defensive end of the
floor.  
  
Q. For any of you guys, the game against Louisville, the first two this
season have been thrilling finishes. What are you expecting tomorrow and are
you looking forward to a third game?  
COACH WILLIAMS: I'm definitely looking forward to a third game because that
means I'm not going back and packing my junk up and going home. We have had
two sensational games. They probably should have won the game at our place,
and we probably should have won the game at their place. But it's two teams
that really, really fight like crazy.  
We came back from a big deficit at our place. They came back from a huge
deficit at their place. I think it's two teams that like to compete. They
really man handled us at their place on the offensive backboards especially in
the second half. So what kind of game I expect, I would expect it to be a
hard‑fought game, but I have no idea. You just wait until you get out there.  
MARCUS PAIGE: He pretty much nailed it when he talked about the performance at
our place and then their place. You don't see that very often a team losing a
big lead in two different ways, each team doing it. So I'm excited for the
rematch just because not only is it a chance to go on to the semifinal, but
when you lose the way we did at Louisville, and that was the last one, so that
was the one that resonates for me more.  
You want to have a chance to erase that memory and play for 40 minutes of a
full game. We've got to do a great job on the backboards, because like coach
said, Harrell does a great job of making it tough for teams by pounding the
offensive glass. So it will be fun. It will be a lot of great players in the
gym at one time, so it will be exciting.  
J.P. TOKOTO: Piggybacking off what they said, this is possibly the last game
we can play in this tournament, so why not give it your all? We're going to
look to get on the offensive and defensive backboards, try to hit them first,
come out with more energy than they can. Like coach said, two teams that love
to compete, two great coaches that know how to coach. So it's going to come
down to who wants it more and we've got to be that team. I'm just looking
forward to getting out there tomorrow.  
  
Q. Coach, with Kennedy and Theo out, it seemed that you tinkered quite a bit
with different lineups. What exactly are you trying to look for when you're
doing that?  
COACH WILLIAMS: I'm looking for some guy to make a good play when he gets in
there. I wanted to give Stillman a chance in the first half. I've been
thinking about it, because he's finally getting healthy. You know, we've been
playing all year and Stillman can make some shots, and I wanted to give him a
chance in the first half, and just get his feet wet in case we needed it down
the line because we are thin. The guys with the experience and without Kennedy
and Theo and the other guys that we've already lost, so we'll probably try to
give him another chance again tomorrow. We put him with the first team
yesterday during the time period during practice, and he did a nice job, so
we'll probably try that again tomorrow too.  
  
Q. That's six straight double ‑figure games for Justin Jackson. Now
obviously the shot, especially the three‑pointers are starting to go in for
him a little more. How many more options does that give you offensively? How
different does that make it for you as a coach? Also, Marcus, if there was a
point that you saw where things started to turn around for Justin a little bit
in practice or in games?   
COACH WILLIAMS: I think even today the three misses right in front of our
bench, and it looked like it was going in also. But I think he's getting to be
a more confident player. When he's shooting the ball in from three‑point line
it opens up so many other things for Brice, Isaiah, J.P.'s drives, Marcus's
drives. So it does give us another scoring threat that can shoot a good
percentage from the three‑point line. I can't tell you exactly any game. I
think it's been a steady progression for him the entire season. I'd like for
him to run that streak about nine more games.  
MARCUS PAIGE: Yeah, he's doing a great job letting the game come to him. He
got great shots today, great looks today. It always helps especially as a
freshman, going through the grind of the ACC can be tough. It helps to make
your first shot or get an easy first basket.  
He got a good look from three today, and that kind of set him up. He's been
doing that a lot lately being the benefactor of great ball movement and
knocking down the open three. Because then he can get his floater going or get
a putback on the offensive glass, trying to get out on transition. He does a
great job running the floor. When J.P. hit him the pitch ahead today, that's a
great way to score. He's just settling down. We've always known he was capable
of this, so it's good to see him putting together a good stretch.  
  
Q. Roy, I don't know if you've seen the proposal out of the NABC about early
entry for the NBA draft. The upshot is an invitation ‑only combine for
undergraduates, and a late May withdrawal date to get out of the draft. Your
feelings pro or con?   
COACH WILLIAMS: I'm trying to remember what I was told to say. I think there's
going to be some more information released from it. But I've been very pleased
to be part of the discussion, and I really wish I could remember what.  
We're not supposed to say anything until it's officially released, so I'm
being a bad interview, I just can't tell you anything. I've been part of the
discussion, and I'm very happy that we're working together.

_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

MIAMI  59  
VIRGINIA TECH - 49

  
COACH LARRANAGA: Yeah, actually, I thought the game was exactly like we
anticipated. We played Virginia Tech just a few days ago, and we shot lights
out. We played great. We were ahead by 28 at the half, and ended up winning by
over 20. The way they played last night was a real concern of ours. We thought
they really did a great job of spreading the defense out and driving and
scoring off of those drives. They did the same thing to us.  
I thought our defense was pretty solid in both halves, but I thought our guys,
we didn't execute like we've been. Monday in practice we were so good. I
thought if we play like this, we have a very good chance to win the
tournament. But we didn't play like that.  
But we've won. We're moving on. We've got a big game tomorrow night against
Notre Dame. I thought Tonye and Sheldon were terrific. I thought Deandre
Burnett's three at the top of the key really was a dagger. That was a very,
very important hoop for us. Manu's free throws were also a real key. When you
have a little bit of a lead and then you go to the foul line and you make your
free throws, that is very important. We ended up 14 for 18 from the foul line,
which was terrific.  
  
Q. What made this team so effective in the clutch today?  
SHELDON McCLELLAN: They did a good job being aggressive in the second half,
and they attacked our closeouts and got to the rim, got fouled and got a
little momentum going, but we got stops down the stretch, so that's how we
closed the game.  
  
Q. In the two regular season meetings you led the whole second half and one
‑hand delay. What was different in this game? Why was Tech a little more
competitive this time out?   
COACH LARRANAGA: Well, I think first of all, their win last night had to give
them some confidence, especially the way they won. That game see‑sawed back
and forth down the stretch. One big shot after another. I think when a team
wins a very close game like that, they're feeling really good about
themselves, and we played so good at their place the other day, we couldn't
match it. We were 15 for 25 from three. We made every right decision.  
In this game, in the first five minutes, we had more turnovers than we did in
the entire game in Blacksburg. So we didn't play as well, but our defense was
similar to what it was. But we just didn't make the consistent good choices of
passing and shooting. We didn't shoot the three badly. We ended up shooting
35, 36%. But the other day we shot 60%, and we're making everything.  
  
Q. Going with that, it seemed like the pace of the game was just shot, miss,
shot, miss, it was kind of back and forth. It wasn't really a rhythm. How much
did that affect your team or even both teams and kind of just the pace of
play?  
COACH LARRANAGA: In actuality we've played in a lot of games like this one.
Some games we've shot lights out, and other games didn't shoot quite as well.
What we've always told the team is in order to win the games when you don't
shoot great, you have to play great defense. If you shoot lights out, you've
still got to play good defense to win the game. But when you don't shoot well,
the defense is the answer. I thought that was the key tonight. We played good
defense.  
  
Q. To follow up on that, what made your defense so effective, especially
holding on to just the three three pointers?  
COACH LARRANAGA: Well, I've got a great staff. They've been with me a long
time. My assistant coaches do a fantastic job in preparation of identifying
all the things that the opponent is trying to do. Like we saw last night how
much they were trying to drive. Earlier in the year they were shooting a lot
of threes. Tonight they only shot 15. Earlier in the year they might have shot
30 in a game. So my staff did a great job of preparing the team, and the
players really listened attentively.  
We ran over the same things that we saw on Saturday. We went over them for
several practices to be sure our guys knew if we played Virginia Tech, this is
what they're going to do. This is what we need to stop. To their credit,
despite the fact I didn't think we played great offense today, our defense is
what won the game.  
  
Q. Just the challenge of facing Notre Dame now. Obviously, had a lead on
them in South Bend and just the way they were able to come back, do you expect
a different team or is that a challenge for you guys?  
COACH LARRANAGA: Well, Notre Dame is a top 10 team in the country. They've had
an absolutely spectacular season. They've had answers in almost every game
they've played. When we played them, I thought it was one of the best team
performances by both squads. I thought it was just a tremendous college game.
At that time, we had to make more adjustments than we normally do.  
So I think we'll be a little better prepared having played them once, plus
this team is very good on the road. We're now 11‑5 away from the Bank United
Center. Now that's twice as many road victories as a lot of teams that
supposedly are going to get an at‑large bid.  
So we need to continue to play really well, but this is a neutral site, so
hopefully that will bring us a little closer to being able to play a great
game and maybe bring them down to less than super.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Sheldon's performance tonight?  
COACH LARRANAGA: Yes, he was very good. I don't think I took him out. Did he
play all 40? He played 40 minutes of just terrific basketball. I went to take
him out once, and I turned to my staff and they said no, he never really gets
tired. I said okay, because he's really playing well.  
His three, we opened up the court for him to give him an opportunity to
basically make a decision. Drive or shoot or pass, and he did all three. Made
very good decisions. He was very calm. I don't know how many he ended up with,
but he had 16 points, and that's really like a third of our points or 25% of
our points. He did a yeoman's job today. At both ends, by the way. I want to
say that. He was not only scoring, but he was rebounding. He had six rebounds.
The other day he had five assists. Today I see he didn't. Not because he
didn't share the ball but because we weren't making as many shots.  
  
Q. I was curious, after Hudson's big 32 ‑point game yesterday, what was the
defensive approach to containing him today?   
COACH LARRANAGA: Sheldon McClellan.  
  
Q. Sheldon did not make the All ‑ACC team. Can you tell us how you view him
especially after a game like that that looked All‑ACC in the context of this
league?   
COACH LARRANAGA: First of all, this league has a lot of very good players, and
I think the guys that made the all league team are very, very deserving. But
when I saw that Sheldon was left off, honestly, I was shocked. I don't know.  
Has anybody ever heard the expression he's a 180 guy? So, anybody that's never
heard the expression, it's very, very simple. You combine someone's two‑point
percentage, three‑point personal, and free throw percentage, and if it totals
180, then the guy is one of the most efficient players. In the NBA there are
only like three or four guys a year. Like Dirk Nowitzki was one of those guys
a few years back. I don't know if there is someone in the league now.  
Sheldon's a 180 guy. How can you leave off a guy like that when he shoots the
ball from three, from two, from the foul line, as well as he does. He's one of
the better rebounding guards in the league. He's one of the better defensive
guards in the league. And we didn't win the league, but we beat some of the
teams that had players on the all‑conference team. So, yes, I was shocked. But
as I said, I think the players who were voted were also very, very good.  
  
Q. Have you discussed with your team ‑‑ you mentioned the at‑large bid and
being 11‑5 on the road. What have you told your players about the need to win
tomorrow to go to the NCAAs?   
COACH LARRANAGA: Our focus has been coming into the tournament to win the
tournament. That means you've got to win‑‑ we have to win four games. If we
don't, if someone beats us, then I hope that it will be with us playing our
best. Not having a bad game, but someone outplayed us. But right now we've‑‑
we've won three in a row, all on the road. Our team is confident. They're
playing well. Very, very attentive to detail, and hopefully we'll play a great
game tomorrow night. We're going to need to to advance.  
  
Q. To follow up on that, Jalen Hudson, what was your defensive approach to
containing him tonight?  
SHELDON McCLELLAN: Just make it tough for him. He had a great game against
Wake Forest, and I just wanted to make it tough for him. As soon as the game
was over, I text the assistant coaches and saw the game on TV, and I told
coach I wanted to guard him before the game even started. So my mindset was
just to start him, and my offense would come.  
  
Q. Tonye, can you just talk about how difficult that win was, and how
satisfying it is to win a tough game like that and reach the quarterfinal?  
TONYE JEKIRI: Yeah, it was a tough win for us today. We actually didn't play
as well as we wanted to play. But our defense helped us out. We looked upon
each other, and at one point in time the coaches called us together and tried
to talk to us about what offense they're running, and how they're running and
doing, and their back door they're looking for and stuff like that.  
So we just pulled ourselves together and tried to make a defensive stop one at
a time and rebound the ball. Our guys really helped in rebounding. Sheldon
helped. Manu came in to rebound in defensive. That just helped us to pull out
the win. All credit to them. Today they came out and played really great.
Everyone, after they played last night I could imagine they still have legs to
run fast and try to run us. They did a pretty good job.  
  
Q. When you said your guys practiced so well, it made you believe you could
win this whole event, what could you share about what you saw?  
COACH LARRANAGA: Well, on Monday, we were missing Tonye who has been sick with
the flu or cold or what have you, so he didn't practice. Joel Thomas has been
sick. He didn't practice, so without two key members of our team. But the guys
who did practice, everything was done so sharply.  
We shot the ball well. We passed the ball well. We defended it well. Our
attention to the scouting report and what was going to be the game plan,
whether we played Wake Forest or Virginia Tech, we knew they have a lot of
three‑point shooters. They try to stretch you out and they try to drive you.  
So you have guys like Devin Wilson or Cody Miller‑McIntyre, they're going to
be taking you to the hole. All the players really knew the personnel we were
going to be facing. And I just love the attitude. I think attitude has
everything to do with success, and our attitude was in the right place.

_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

NORTH CAROLINA STATE  81  
PITTSBURGH - 70

  
COACH DIXON: Congratulations to NorthCarolina State. I thought Barber and
Lacey were terrific, and I thought they really hit some tough shots. So they
deserved it with the way those two guys played. Some off‑the‑dribble isolation
plays that they made, some end‑the‑clock threes, and even that zone and Lacey
at that deep three. So really a great performance by those two guys.  
The guys kept battling. We got down. We with stood the three‑point barrage. We
kept trying to change some things up. But we kept battling. Got it closer, but
just didn't have enough in us. So we got some good performances. Thought
Cameron did some good things and played well in his last time in an ACC
Tournament. But we just came up short.  
So congratulations to N.C. State. They're playing very well. We lost to a good
team. We're a good team, but I think we can play better than we played today.  
  
Q. Coach Gottfried mentioned Cat Barber's speed as maybe something that you
guys didn't have an answer for. How did Barber's speed, I guess impact the
game?  
CAMERON WRIGHT: He's a very good player. His teammates do a great job setting
ball screens for him. He's aggressive and hit a few shots early on so he
caught a rhythm. He did a great job getting to the basket tonight.  
  
Q. Coach, your track record for making the NCAA tournament is one of the
best in the entire country. I mean, 10 out of 11 is unbelievable. What do you
say to your guys at a time like this? Because the only other time you didn't
make it you won a tournament.  
COACH DIXON: Yeah, yeah, it's been hard. I mean, we're used to being in the
NCAA tournament. We play for that. But we knew what our challenges were and we
didn't get it done. As far as our guys, I mean, this is not‑‑ it's something
we've been aware of because defensively we haven't been good enough and we put
ourselves in this position. Early on in the year we went through a stretch
where we played well. We got better. We have gotten better. We got better
defensively. Our numbers indicate that, but we didn't see it tonight.  
But it's disappointing. You have challenges, different things occurred this
year, but I thought we kept battling, kept fighting, and we were written off.
We came back, kept doing some things, kept getting better. Even tonight we're
down big and early and we kept fighting. So this team‑‑ I'm proud of these
guys. They've worked hard. They come in and they practice hard, but we just
have not been able to get to where we need to in the past defensively. I mean,
it's been pretty clear to me from the start, we've gotten better, but it just
hasn't happened. So that's why we're where we're at.  
  
Q. Cat Barber has always had speed and can get up and down the court. But
he's expanded his range of late. What do you have to do to slow a guy like
that down?  
COACH DIXON: Yeah, he hit the threes and he's not known for three of‑point
shooting. So he hit those early and that got him going. He went 12 for 12 from
the free‑throw line. So, again, it was a good day for him. He made plays. He
made shots. You know, it was just his night. At times I thought we had him in
the right position where we needed to. Lacey too as well where they made some
shots at the end or got fouled at the end of the clock. That was probably the
biggest mistake we made they kept getting to the foul line. When we had
chances to cut it down and make it a two possession game, some fouls at the
end I think really hurt us.  
  
Q. Jamie talked about making the NCAAs and the disappointment that goes
along with that. How do you respond as a leader on the floor and as a leader
of your team to get ready to play in something that's not going to be the
NCAA? Whether it's the NIT or whatever.  
CAMERON WRIGHT: Whether or not we play in a different tournament or not, I'm
just going to talk to the guys and tell them we still have to keep our heads
up for whatever we do. Whether or not that's going to another tournament or
whether or not that's our off‑season, then obviously I'm a senior, so I'm
done.  
So I just need to try to talk to those guys, keep their heads up and remember
this feeling, I guess, so they'll never feel it again.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

### [Jim Christian](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18217)

### [Olivier Hanlan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24978)

  
_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

North Carolina  81  
Boston College - 63

  
COACH CHRISTIAN: Obviously, early foul trouble hurt our team tonight. We had
to play some lineups in the first half that we hadn't played all season. Both
our four men were in foul trouble. All three of them, actually, so that hurt
us a little bit. I was proud of our guys the way we fought to come all the way
back to eight. Then we just made some defensive breakdowns.  
Give credit to them. I thought they played very, very well. They're very
patient offensively. I thought they got the ball where they wanted to play and
made a tremendous amount of key plays in the late clock situations. I thought
they were really efficient, and that was probably a big difference in the
game. That, and obviously we ran a little bit out of gas towards the end.  
  
Q. Olivier, was it just one of those nights where the shot wasn't falling or
was it something that Tokoto or was it them as a team were doing to you
defensively today?  
OLIVIER HANLAN: Me and coach were talking about it. We got some great looks
offensively. I was getting some great looks. But we had a few in and outs, and
obviously them having so many guys to guard me and being fresh all the time
obviously played a key factor in it.  
  
Q. What specifically did they do defensively to take you out of your
rhythm?  
OLIVIER HANLAN: Obviously coming off the ball screen they kind of stayed with
me longer. Everybody was kind of in the key when I attacked. So I know first
half I was getting the guys some pretty good looks in terms of open threes,
and guys cutting back doing everything like that. But they did a good job as a
team guarding me.  
  
Q. Olivier, after expending the energy that you guys had to expend in the
win over Georgia Tech, what concerns did you have about maintaining pace, and
then when you got into foul trouble, having the manpower to withstand any runs
that they were going to make at you?  
OLIVIER HANLAN: Obviously, coming into the game and them not playing yet, so I
think they had like a week off, so they were pretty fresh. Whenever you come
to the ACC Tournament, everybody's tired and it's the end of the season, so
that's not really an excuse to make. Even if you play two games, one game or
zero games everybody's going to be tired so you have to just push through it.
The team that usually fights through it wins it all.  
  
Q. I know it's the end of the season for a lot of the guys on this team that
you've played with, AB and Dimitri and Patrick as well, but was this the end
for you here at BC? Are you thinking about coming back?  
OLIVIER HANLAN: I don't really want to talk about that right now. Obviously
there is a lot of time to make that decision, so I'll just take it day by day.  
  
Q. They had a pretty decided size advantage inside. What did you hope to try
to do to negate that? And I guess the foul trouble is what prevented that from
happening?  
COACH CHRISTIAN: Yeah, the fouls weren't really on post‑ups. It was more
reaching for outs or over the back or second‑effort plays around the rim, and
that's where Pat got in foul trouble, two quick ones and Eddie too. Obviously
the best thing we could have done is work early, and I thought we did. In the
beginning of the game we worked early and prevented post catches and forced
them off the lane a little bit when they were missing shots early in the game.
As the game wore on, they were getting the ball deeper and deeper.  
It's a hard team to double because they're so long and athletic. If you get
forced into rotations with our team, there is a huge drop off, and we rotate
down. It's not Tokoto to get the ball above the rim. Our guys aren't that way.
So you've got to pick your poison and hope that those guys don't get deep
catches, and those off the lane shots that they were missing earlier were
easier to rebound for us. I thought that was helping us. Then they started
driving the ball.  
When Paige got into the lane and they were running a couple guard to guard
screens and got the ball right on top of the rim and kind of forced us to
rotate, and that's when we got hurt.  
  
Q. They come out early and get it up to 15, but you guys fight back to get
it to within 8. Did you think your team had enough in the tank left to kind of
get it back to even?  
COACH CHRISTIAN: Yeah, I always think we have enough in the tank. I think we
came down and that was the play where I think we came out of the timeout. Ran
a backdoor play for Patrick. I've never seen this before, and it was
unbelievable. Hicks made one of the best plays I've seen on defense. He got
beat back door, right? And then came back and blocked the shot. I haven't seen
it. I was in shock. It was a good ball. It wasn't goaltending.  
Think about how athletic you have to be to get beat back door at the
three‑point line and get to the rim and block the shot. That was the game. I
mean, it was an unbelievable play. It was an unbelievable individual athletic
play. We don't see that in the Mac when I was in the Mac.  
  
Q. Yesterday we talked a little bit about the draft, but the proposal from
the NABC about instituting a combine for undergraduates by invitation only and
moving the withdrawal date for the NBA draft to late May, would you be in
favor of seeing that change for you?  
COACH CHRISTIAN: I'd like to see it all planned out in front of me. I did see
a little bit about it, but I think anything that can help young people make
the right decisions is what it's all about and eliminate the unknown. I think
there is a lot of unknown. I think the more factual information these guys get
to eliminate the unknown is great.  
The late date for us in terms of filling the scholarships if guys leave that's
a little bit difficult. But it's all about the people and whether it's Olivier
or anybody else, the only thing you want to see is factual information so they
can make sound decisions based on as best you can facts. But I think those
situations‑‑ I think everything should be on the table until everybody figures
out what's best for the young people.  
  
Q. Olivier, is Tokoto as good a defender as you've played against this
season?  
OLIVIER HANLAN: Yeah, he's definitely in the top defenders that guard me. But
obviously having a team like UNC with so many good athletes and so many good
players and being able to put two, three, four guys on me during the course of
a game and keeping fresh bodies on me is definitely harder. But he's a great
defender.  
  
Q. I know it's kind of hard to focus and project what will become of this
team next year, but the composition of this roster looks like it will be much
different than what you had. You had the luxury, as you said of having some
senior leadership. It seemed to be that was the thing that you were kind of
hanging your hat on in this postseason, the experience that these guys have.  
COACH CHRISTIAN: I don't think we were hanging our hat on leadership. I think
we're hanging our hat on effort. So I think those things are well in advance
for us. The way we play, the way we approach it, the confidence with which we
play. As I told the guys before the game, these guys in my mind had never
formed a team where they believed in one another and had enough belief to be
in games like this. So that's all there, and that wasn't done because they
were older. It was done because they came together.  
So the thing that came out of this group of guys is the culture is changing,
and it's got to be continued with the next group. But there are a lot of guys
in that locker room that are going to be part of that. The composition, the
pieces, that is secondary if the attitude and mentality isn't primary, and the
attitude now is primary. They understand it now.  
There was a real true belief in our locker room today that we were going to
win this game, and that was a huge step for us. I can look at their faces. I
can look at the way they approached it, and there is a sincere disappointment
that they didn't. That's culture change, and that's where we're about right
now.  
  
Q. You've been at this for 25 years.  
COACH CHRISTIAN: Thanks for reminding me how old I am.  
  
Q. I mean counting your time as an assistant coach. Is this just a weird
experience for you as a coach with multiple transfers, building a roster
quickly, saying goodbye to a whole bunch of seniors? This whole two ‑year
stretch looks about as weird as it gets in major college basketball?  
COACH CHRISTIAN: Yeah, usually you don't take over jobs that have seven
seniors. Because we had no room and it was such a late date to add a freshman,
it's not easy to find freshman to play in the ACC period, and you don't want
to make a mistake and put a kid in the bad situation and somebody that's not
going to be able to grow with the program.  
So we took one high school guy, Aaron and Dimitri, which was perfect for what
we needed. They were older guys and both were going to help our culture. They
weren't just here to get better numbers and build a basketball career. They
were here to help me build it. And we had a lot of conversations.  
The hard part was to coach a bunch of guys that you barely know and they're in
their senior year. That's why I keep talking about their character. It's not
easy to do that. There are a bunch of guys who only played one year, they've
got a brand‑new coach, brand‑new system, and when we start not having success,
to remain to fight and play the way they've played. As I told them, that's why
I love them. I just think they're the right kind of kids. I wish my son would
grow up to be like those guys, because it's not about the tangible results of
the record. It's about the way they approached it every day.  
We were 1‑11 and people would come to practice and be amazed by the spirit of
the team, and that's amazing to me. So that's why I love these guys.  
  
Q. Can you speak to how Olivier helped you change the culture of the
program?  
COACH CHRISTIAN: I just think the way Olivier plays, approaches the game,
works the game. The best player, the thing that stood out the most to me about
him is he never acted like he had all the answers. He wants to get better, and
that's what great players do. Great players just want to get better each and
every day, because our best player was like that, it forced everybody else to
be that way, and that's what's going to make him special.  
Again, at some point, like I told him, my job is to make him stick in the NBA.
This guy has the heart‑‑ I don't know of anybody that has a bigger heart than
Olivier Hanlan. I don't know if anybody's going to be as committed as him, and
that's why he's going to be special. Whether it's now or whenever he gets his
opportunities, this is a special, special guy.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 11, 2015

  

### [Brad Brownell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21640)

### [Rod Hall](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26732)

  
_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

FLORIDA STATE  76  
CLEMSON - 73

  
COACH BROWNELL: Just didn't play well enough to win today. Thought we played
pretty well in the first half, and missed some shots at the rim that you need
to make. Obviously their size was a factor. Just disappointed with the way we
played in the second half. I thought we didn't play very well, and I didn't
think our competitive spirit was where it needed to be.  
Certainly proud of the way our guys at the end fought. We played great at the
end in the last four minutes when our backs were against the wall, and I had
two chances to tie. Just a little bit unlucky. But give Florida State credit.
They outplayed us today.  
  
Q. Obviously, too little too late there at the end, but what you guys did
especially on the inbounds it was clear that that's something you all had
worked on and you got what you wanted to out of that, correct?  
COACH BROWNELL: Yeah, we got a good look. Everybody knows you need three. It's
hard to get a great three, and we had two looks there. Grantham found Gabe
DeVoe off a little screening action, and it was a deep shot, but he can make
those, and it just didn't go in.  
  
Q. What do you think was the difference? Why do you think your guys
responded the way they did late and didn't have that kind of energy earlier in
the game?  
COACH BROWNELL: I think it's just normal, to be honest with you. I think in
the last four minutes of a game when you're up 12 or 15, and the other team is
pressing, it's hard not to get a little tight, especially in a tournament.
When your back's against the wall, you just kind of let go and it doesn't
matter. So you can shoot freer. Guys just attack more. I think it happens in
more tournament basketball than people realize.  
It's hard to hold on to a double‑figure lead late. If one or two things go
against you early in that situation and the other team builds any momentum,
it's tough. Our guys did a good job of fighting. We were active, aggressive.
We trapped some. We fouled appropriately to get some of the shooters we wanted
shooting. Rod did a great job of being in attack mode in those late minutes
and making plays for himself and others.  
  
Q. You had talked about Rathan ‑Mayes many times this season, and your worst
fear in this game is he would go off the way he did today.   
COACH BROWNELL: He's a good player. Rod has done a great job on him the other
two games that we played him. Tonight he made threes, which he doesn't always
do. When he makes threes, it makes it doubly tough. Some of those are guarded
shots, but he's a super player. He made five today, I think, and that's just
entirely too many. He's done that against a bun of teams in our league, and I
guess it was our turn today.  
  
Q. Rod, you had that lay ‑up there that just didn't fall. It was a two‑point
game and you had a chance there. Just how emotional was that not to see that
go down and know this is your last ACC game?   
ROD HALL: It was very tough for me. I wanted to put my team in a good position
to win this game. But I mean, the ball rolled the opposite way I wanted it to.
It just didn't fall.  
  
Q. Changing gears a little bit. The NABC and the NBA have proposed a new
proposal for an invitational ‑only combine for underclassmen and moving the
day of the withdrawal for the NBA draft to late May. What is your assessment
of that?   
COACH BROWNELL: This is the first I've ever heard of it, and I really don't
know that I have a comment right now. This probably isn't a great time for me
to be thinking about it. So I'm sorry, but I don't really have a good comment
on that right now.  
  
Q. Rod, what made it so tough when you got down by so many? What's going on
mentally when you're trying to wage comeback like that? It's like fighting
upstream, isn't it?  
ROD HALL: I think the tougher thing is just getting everybody to believe.
Basketball turns on a possession. Any possession anything can happen. It was
just tough trying to keep everybody going, but in the end my teammates didn't
give up and they kept fighting. I'm proud of them for that.  
  
Q. What did you see from the defensive standpoint? Were they just constantly
making shots or do you feel your guys didn't bring the same amount of energy
they usually do?  
COACH BROWNELL: You know, I don't know. I think it was a combination of
things. I thought their post players made some big‑ time plays. Their two four
men, Smith and Cofer both made big threes. I know it only sounds like one
basket each, but that's six points, and they don't normally do that
consistently. One of those or two of those happened late clock when we kind of
guard them for 20, 25 seconds, and really guard them the way you want and you
end up giving up a shot that's a three to those guys and they capitalized.  
I just thought they had good mix to their game today. Mays was special, and
they got enough from other players. Cofer and Smith both played well, a little
bit from their center position, and we were struggling a little bit. So just a
combination of a lot of little things certainly Mayes' 30 is the big thing.
But they got some good baskets from other players that supplemented their
offense.

_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

FLORIDA STATE  76  
CLEMSON - 73

  
COACH HAMILTON: We went up 18, we thought the crowd would get bored, so we
thought we'd allow the game to be interesting so people would stay in their
seats. And I can sell you some swamp land if you believe that.  
Honestly, I thought up until we got to the 14, 15‑point lead I thought that
our guys had done a very good job from a defensive standpoint, and we felt
that traditionally Clemson had not been a great three‑point shooting team, but
we'd slow it down and try to play some zone defense which we very seldom play.
But that's when they seemed they shot and became very accurate from the
three‑point line. I didn't think we did nearly as good a job contesting the
shots and you've got to give them credit for making them and from a lot of
different people.  
I thought our guys for 32 minutes, I thought we did a very good job managing
the game, moving the ball, making the extra pass, and getting everybody
involved. Obviously, at the end, you've got to give Clemson credit. They
caught fire. We went to our zone defense, and they knocked down threes and we
missed some very key free throws and made the game very interesting at the
end.  
  
Q. Leonard, little disappointed how your guys handled, are you talking about
the defense but how your guys handled the inbounds play there in the final 30,
40 seconds?  
COACH HAMILTON: Well, I thought we did a very poor job of throwing the ball
close to the baseline. I thought that as the pressure got on our guys cut
slower as opposed to faster. We struggled with Louisville last week, so we did
spend quite a bit of time this week working on it. We didn't necessarily turn
the ball over with the exception of that much little situation. We just didn't
do a very good job of getting the ball deep on the out of bounds play.  
But you have to give them credit. I thought they did a tremendous job of
defending us. Sometime it's always easy to say what you didn't do. But
sometimes you have to give a team credit for what they did do. I thought they
did a very good job of defending us. I thought that we missed a couple of key
free throws and they made some threes. Had they not made those threes, they
probably would not have been in that type of situation.  
But you've got to give the team credit. They did a very good job of coming
back, and you have to give them credit. Sometimes that's just the way it goes.
Unfortunately, there's been a lot of those types of games in the ACC this
year. But I can't go back and look at the negative. I understand for 32
minutes I thought we played a very good game of basketball. What we've got to
do is learn from those mistakes, advance and move on.  
  
Q. For both the players, you guys have faced Virginia and that pack line
defense. Does it help to have seen it once before you go play a team like
that?  
MONTAY BRANDON: It definitely helps us knowing that we have to move the ball
against them. Definitely since we played against them once, we know if we
don't move the ball we won't score, so that definitely gives us the experience
we need for tomorrow.  
XAVIER RATHAN‑MAYES: I think Virginia does a very good job in their pack line
defense. They make you move the ball and you have to shoot really good shots.
We've worked on that a lot in practice, and moved the basketball and taken
high percentage shots. It helped playing them the first time, and we know what
to expect when we see them tomorrow.  
  
Q. You guys have shot around 46% on the season, but tonight you shot 54, 55%
from the field. Going into the Virginia game in a tough defense, how do you
keep that momentum? How do you continue to shoot the ball well?  
COACH HAMILTON: Well, in the first place, I think that our guys are sharing
the ball. We have had a tendency to turn the ball over in key situations this
year. I thought against Virginia there is no secret they're one of the best
defensive teams in the country. The possessions are important. You cannot
afford to have a rash turnover, and you've got to move the ball and make sure
you have good shot selection. This traditional type defense that they've used
is one of the best systems and is proven year‑in and year‑out that unless you
really make a decision with the ball, they can stimey you. They've held people
to 12, 13, 14 points during the half.  
So we have a tremendous amount of respect for them. In order to be successful
against Virginia, we're going to have to have a lot of different guys
contributing. We've got to move the ball to make good decisions. And then
we've got to defend them as well, so they do a very good job of executing
their offense as well.  
  
Q. Montay, can you talk a little bit about or describe what was going
through your mind as Clemson was coming back? Was it a difficult thing to keep
your composure down the stretch as the game got closer?  
MONTAY BRANDON: The one thing that was going through my mind they were making
tough shots, as Coach Hamilton said. They were making extremely difficult
shots and sometimes we were playing great defense, and we were just trying to
weather the storm and try to just keep talking, keep each other going, and go
out there and try to finish out the game.  
  
Q. Leonard, to follow up on what you were talking about with Virginia, last
time you played them you had the lead with 10 minutes to go, but I think you
had four points and no baskets the rest of the way. What do you need to do
better or differently in the rematch?  
COACH HAMILTON: If I remember correctly, we had good shots, and possessions
are precious when you're playing against a great team. We had a period there
where we had, I think, four lay‑ups that we didn't finish. We had a couple of
wide‑open jump shots that just didn't go down. It was as much us just not
finishing our plays and a combination of them playing really good defense.  
Emotionally I think sometimes you get caught in those situations, but you've
got to step up with your confidence and knock those shots down. That was very
disappointing. I thought we had played a solid game of basketball, but the
game is 40 minutes, and we can look back and say we played well for 32
minutes, but we came up short those last eight. I looked at it over and over
and over, and I was extremely disappointed. Not necessarily in the execution,
but we just didn't have the confidence to make those plays when they were on
the line. I think on the other hand, as the pressure got on and the game was
on the line, I thought Virginia's maturity, their confidence, and their
ability to finish games off really showed. And I thought that's where we
faulted.  
  
Q. How do they change with or without Justin Anderson? I guess there is no
word yet on if they'll have him?  
COACH HAMILTON: Well, they're a very good basketball team. They're an
excellent basketball team with him, and they're a very, very good basketball
team, maybe just a little dash down without him. I don't believe they've lost
but one game since they lost him.  
I understand what it's like. We lost our leading scorer at the beginning of
the year, so I know what it's like when you're trying to make that adjustment.
But I think they've done a mighty fine job making the adjustment without him.
They're a good basketball team. They have a system, and I think that they're
not a one‑man band. They have a system that when all the players get involved,
and I think what's happened is that each player has picked it up a little bit,
and I think they've been able to fill the gap from where they've lost with
him.  
So I'm not real sure‑‑ at some point I know he's going to come back and that's
going to make them even more dangerous.  
  
Q. Xavier, 30 points for you today. What enabled you to have such a good
offensive game today?  
XAVIER RATHAN‑MAYES: I was just taking what the defense gave me. My coaches do
a really good job of putting us all in positions where we're able to be
aggressive. Coach gives me confidence to be able to take good shots within our
offense. I was just knocking down shots early, and my teammates kept
encouraging me to keep being aggressive and keep looking for guys. So that's
what happened.  
  
Q. Leonard, a lot will be made about the last three or four minutes, but up
until that point, first 30, 35 minutes of that game, is that as well as you
guys have played this year offensively?  
COACH HAMILTON: I thought we shot a high percentage. We shared the ball. I
thought we made great decisions with the ball, and we were able to hang on
there to win. I just thought they did a very good job of making shots that I
don't think anybody in this room‑‑ or I know we didn't‑‑ that's why we went to
the zone defense because that seemed to have been the challenge for this team.
They made their shots. You've got to give them credit.  
I'm not concerned. I'm just glad we won and move on. That's the way the game
of basketball is. It's a chess match. Sometimes teams just play better than
you expect them to. They shot the ball much better than we expected them to
from three‑point land. You've got to give them credit for that.  
  
Q. The NABC and NBA have come up with a proposal to move the withdrawal date
for underclassmen for the NBA draft to late May and allow underclassmen to
attend an invitation ‑only combine in mid‑May so they can learn whether
they're draftable. Are you in favor of that proposal or what do you think of
it?   
COACH HAMILTON: I absolutely am not in favor of that proposal. Now if we're
going to import that, we need to have more scholarships. In other words what
you're saying is I have a kid in April that decides he wants to go into become
evaluated. So I have a team coming back the next year, and if he decides not
to come back, then how do I fill the void?  
In other words, there has to be some way that we can come up with a procedure
that will not impact or allow youngsters to pursue their goals and not impact
the team. It has to be some way to do that as opposed to creating a negative
for one and maybe an opportunity for another. It would be so unfair to the
team that's returning, the school, and everybody else involved. So we have to
find a way.  
Now why is it we have all these different rules for football, for baseball and
basketball? And if it's good for baseball and it's good for football, why
can't we use the same scenario for basketball? But all of a sudden, all our
games are on TV. We have 25 or 30 scouts at every game. So why is it now we've
got to go through the season with all the film that's available, all the
statistics that we come up with to evaluate, and then we've got to have
another combine at the end of the year and then the school is sitting there
holding its breath saying, okay, I want to have a scholarship available so if
a youngster comes back, he has it. But then if he doesn't come back, all the
kids have already signed and they've gone on and you can't recover.  
So we need to come up with some way to make this work for everybody. Number
one, in baseball they can go straight from high school and that seems to be
working for baseball. In football, you have to stay in school for a certain
period of time. So we've got to come up with something that works, a
philosophy that makes sense that doesn't impact anybody. I think the whole
scenario needs more thought. I think we need to bring everybody together. I
think we need to have more discussion so that we can give a youngster an
opportunity to pursue whatever he wants to pursue.  
I mean, if you're an engineer, if you're a musician, if you're an entertainer,
you can go right from high school and pursue your dreams. But in basketball,
you've got guys going to school for one year and then moving on, and you want
to give youngsters the opportunity to pursue their dream, but we've got to
find a way to create some type of scenario that works for everybody. Does that
make any sense?  
  
Q. Today you tied the school record for all ‑time wins by a men's basketball
coach. I know it's not quite the time for reflection, but could you speak on
that accomplishment just a little bit?   
COACH HAMILTON: Well, I really didn't know that until last week or so. But our
goals are just not to win basketball games. It's build a program of
significance. We're in the number one basketball conference in the history of
college basketball, and we want to be among the elite programs in our league.
So we have a lot more work to do.  
We have high goals. Over the last ten years I think only Carolina and Duke
have won more games than we have in the ACC, but we're not satisfied with us
being third.  
We feel we have a lot more growth. Our administration is doing a great job of
giving us the resources that we need, improving our facilities, and so what
we're focusing on as a staff is wanting to have the best basketball program in
the ACC. And that's our goal. We're not there yet, so that's really how I feel
about that.  
I'm just fortunate I have good players. I have a great staff. I have guys that
have been with me 18, 16, 17 years, and we have a decent system. But in order
for that to be meaningful, we need to turn it up a notch and move to another
category as a basketball program, and not necessarily focus very much on the
number of wins, because that's insignificant in the big picture. Only thing it
does is maybe give you a plaque or something, but other than that, it's not
going to get us where we want to go, and that is to move ourselves up to be a
program that is of significance in the ACC. We've got some of the greatest
traditional, successful, rich programs in our league for us to try to catch up
to.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE MEN'S

## March 11, 2015

  

### [Christian Beyer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28517)

### [Buzz Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19411)

  
_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

MIAMI  59  
VIRGINIA TECH - 49

  
Q. What about Miami's defense made it a tough shooting night for you? Also,
why were you able to be much more competitive throughout this game than in the
first two meetings?  
COACH WILLIAMS: Yeah, you would probably know this, I think it's the least
number of threes we've made all year in a game. We didn't get to the bonus
either half. Because of our makeup, we really need free throw makes, as I've
said all along, and in large part that was a huge difference in last night's
game. To never get to the bonus really hurts us and puts even more pressure on
our perimeter to make shots.  
So I thought the difference in why it was a game in comparison to the previous
two games, I thought our staff, their adjustments were superb, and I thought
the execution of those adjustments by our players arguably was as good as it's
been all year defensively. Hold those guys to 43% after the three of the four
halves they have had, that was the lowest that they had in the four halves
that we had played. Only gave up four offensive rebounds. One was a team
rebound. Our turnover rate was too high, but it was still under 10. So when
you get to postseason play, that is how thin the margin is.  
  
Q. Buzz, as disappointing as the result is this evening, how satisfying was
it for you as a coach the last two days to see Christian play as well as he
did as he closes out his career?  
COACH WILLIAMS: We lost because I didn't play him enough.  
  
Q. Jalen obviously didn't have close to the kind of game he did last night.
Did Miami do something to take him away coming off the bench, or was it just
sort of more of the same kind of inconsistency from him that you mentioned
last night?  
COACH WILLIAMS: Well, I think we'd be foolish to think that he would score 32
points in 28 minutes again. I would say that the scouting report probably
changed by Miami relative to how they wanted to guard him. I thought he played
fine. We haven't all year in the 33 games I don't think we've been dependent
on one guy. What we've been dependent on is all of our guys being as good as
they possibly can be.  
Ahmed was saddled with foul trouble in the first half. Jalen was saddled with
foul trouble in the first half. Both of those guys had two fouls before the
ten‑minute mark, I believe. So, again, that shortens our rotation. Tried to
play Ahmed spot minutes just because we don't have enough guys to endure two
guys just freezing out on the bench because they have two fouls.  
He did a good job in those spot possessions that he played. But, again, we
need to have everybody at full ability to use them however we think is best,
and that changed things a little bit.  
  
Q. I've never seen a coach, I don't think, during a timeout coach up a fan
shooting a free throw. Why did you decide to do that?  
COACH WILLIAMS: Well, I want to have fun. I know you guys think I sweat and I
don't have fun. I'm having the time of my life. It's just what you nerds think
is fun isn't what everybody else think is fun. You guys think sending out a
tweet and talking about a blog, that's not fun. That's just it gives
entitlement because you can send out a tweet or a blog.  
The only reason I wanted to win, not because it was for Virginia Tech
quarterfinal game or whatever game that was. I want to be around these two
guys, and I want those guys to keep playing. So there is nothing that I'm
going to say in a timeout that they haven't heard me say. It's just say the
same stuff over and over.  
  
Q. Buzz was mentioning adjustments in terms of the first couple Miami games
versus tonight. What adjustments do you feel you did pretty well to make it a
more competitive game tonight?  
CHRISTIAN BEYER: The ball screen coverage. Today we did basically kind of got
pressing under with a big. It's a one‑man removed. Before we were yelling the
ball screen in our previous games and they would just drag us out and force us
into rotations. As we like to say they were just hitting practice shots.  
But today we were really focusing on keeping all their guards in front of us.
If it got to the point just forcing it in to Jekiri and making him beat us on
the post, because we didn't think he had the skill set in order to beat us. So
obviously, it was the guards previously that did the most damage.  
I think it was the ball screen coverage today, keeping the guards in front and
making sure that we didn't force rotations. That would also help out on the
defensive rebounding.  
COACH WILLIAMS: Sounds like a doctor.  
  
Q. Christian, growing up in this state you know a lot of kids dream of
playing in this league and playing in this event. Can you feel right now any
kind of storybook feeling because you basically played a 7 ‑foot scholarship
player to a standstill, and I don't know, it feels like a fairy tale story.   
CHRISTIAN BEYER: It is really cool growing up in Coastal Carolina. If you had
told me this would be the situation a couple years ago I would have laughed at
you. It's awesome. I think it just shows what walk‑ons can do. Everyone
considers us just to be practice guys. Johnson here is one of the hardest
working guys I've ever seen.  
So walk‑ons all across the country are busting their butts, giving it their
all just to show that they belong. It is cool to show that I can contribute. I
can stand my own in my home state at the biggest level. I mean, this is the
biggest level I've been on and it's just been a blast being able to play in
it.  
  
Q. You finished with 22 losses. But do you feel like you maybe got what you
wanted accomplished in year one in terms of laying a culture, establishing a
culture, laying a foundation, getting some stuff to build on for year two?  
COACH WILLIAMS: I'll have to think about that. I think there are always ways
that you can improve. I think too many times maybe it's just society. You
think that there's going to be an event that's a turning point. Right? And I
think our egos, coaches, people, players, your ego is fighting when is that
event going to occur that it changes? I've learned a lot, and so I want to
answer that question better in a couple of weeks when I avoid your texts. But
I think it's a process not to be Nick Saban, but it's not an event. You have
to work with a passion level and an energy level that the turning point is
this minute. The turning point is this possession. It's this practice. It's
this film session. It's this road trip. I'm so thankful for how the five kids
and coaches have accepted all of the new coaches and new players.  
Very thankful for how all of the new people accepted all of the old people.
There was never any division whatsoever, spoken or unspoken. I think we had an
energy level that came pretty close on a daily basis of hitting our ceiling,
some of which is limited.  
But the thing that I respect the most about all of us in the group is we were
all very transparent in each of our skill sets relative to what our ceiling
was. I think sometimes it's not "Did you win the game?" It was, "Did you
decrease the level of mistakes that then gave you a chance?" You didn't lose
it.  
This is, I think 354, day 354, and I've learned more in that time period maybe
than I have in any other year as an a difficult, not just as a coach. I've
learned so much from these kids as far as being a better husband, being a
better dad, and it's not just the kids. Our administration has been incredibly
supportive, and I'm kind of a hard guy to get close to purpose. But they
haven't infringed on that.  
There's been a lot of really good stuff. And I hate that it's over because I
think the turning point had not happened, but the trend was going in the
highest angle that it had been going in thus far.  
So somehow we've got to figure outcome Monday how to get it ramped up to the
same level that we just finished with.  
  
Q. You said this is day 354. Do you have a plan for day 35? Do you let
yourself relax, get some rest? Or what do you do when a season ends?  
COACH WILLIAMS: Yeah, I'm really depressed, just to be honest with you. I
don't handle it very well at all. That's not because it's year number one.
You're just‑‑ you function on such a premium level of emotion, and your brain
and your body is functioning at a very high clip. I'm not very mature at how I
handle beginnings or endings. I don't like saying hello. That's why my first
impression is typically bad, and I don't like saying goodbye, and that's why I
don't give hugs when it's over because I don't want it to be over because I
want to keep fighting.  
So I don't handle it very well at all, just to be very Frank. Not a pity
party. Just that's the truth.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 11, 2015

  

### [Cat Barber](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28498)

### [Mark Gottfried](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13796)

### [Trevor Lacey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23364)

  
_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

NORTH CAROLINA STATE  81  
PITTSBURGH - 70

  
COACH GOTTFRIED: The biggest thing was Cat's speed. I thought they had trouble
containing him and stopping his penetration. And then we got ahead and they
tried to press us. At that point it becomes really difficult to contain Cat.
So, great win. I thought collective by everybody, played well. So we're
excited about it.  
  
Q. Cat, when you played pit back in January, you only had nine points. What
was the difference today?  
CAT BARBER: I think the difference is today I was more aggressive. Teammates
and coaches were telling me to be confidence that I'm going to put the team on
my back, and that's what I did.  
  
Q. You knew with a win you guys would play Duke, and you obviously had some
issues with that Boston College game getting caught up there and all the stuff
that was going on the schedule. Did you have any worries today of looking past
Pittsburgh? And how quickly did you feel your guys were in the right shape?  
COACH GOTTFRIED: I really never felt our guys look past the game at all. I
really didn't. Our practices the last couple days, I thought our players were
focused in on this one game, and I thought they did a great job with that. So
it's not something we've talked about. It's not something that, hey, if we
beat Pitt we then get to play Duke. We've never mentioned it one time, and I'm
not sure they have any. So they handled it the right way.  
  
Q. Cat, you had one field goal attempt in the second half until Trevor went
out with some foul trouble. What was the thought there? It seemed you really
turned it on once he went out of the game. Did you feel like you had to take
over there?  
CAT BARBER: I think, yes. The first half I had it going, and the second half I
didn't come out as I was in the first half. And Trevor came in and made some
big shots, so we were giving him the ball. When he went in he was hitting big
shots, so when he went out we knew it was time for me to step back up. But
with Trevor in the game and I'm not going, I know him lost then somebody else
would be going.  
  
Q. When Trevor has the ball, how have you made yourself a better offensive
threat for him as a passing option to kick out to you?  
CAT BARBER: When Trevor has the ball I try to get in the open spot. I know
he's one of the best when somebody's on him, he can create for himself. So I
kind of just try to fill in in the spot. If he drives, I try to fill in in
another spot where he can give me the ball. But normally in my head I'm like
that's a bucket, so...  
  
Q. Trevor, in the stretch in the first half when everything was going really
well for you guys, Cat spun past some Pittsburgh players, dribbled under the
basket, and bounce pass out to you, you take the three, doesn't go in, you
slap the floor. Why were you so angry at that point? Was it just that things
were going that well?  
TREVOR LACEY: No, I mean, I'd never seen a play like that before or been a
part of one of those plays. The way this game was going for him, that's a play
that would have been with him for a lifetime. If I would have made that shot,
that would have been one of the plays for him for the rest of his life, so I
felt like I messed that play up for him.  
  
Q. Cat and Trevor, the last three, four minutes of the game it was a
situation where you could have pulled the ball out and run some clock. You
guys didn't do that. You attacked in transition. Was there ever any thought to
pull back and run time or was it just go, go, go the whole time?  
TREVOR LACEY: I think we learned from previous games where we had leads and
kind of got complacent and stayed aggressive. We let teams get on a run and
get momentum. So we've learned from that and we just keep our foot on the gas.
We're not going to go in and make crazy plays, but we're going to take
advantage of the opportunities we do have, and that's what we did.  
CAT BARBER: I think in that situation we had times where we had like the
advantage to score the ball, so I mean, we took it. We didn't try to hold the
ball when we had the advantage. We had people out running, get the ball, go to
the pass to the big man. So I think for us in our eyes we weren't going to
turn down the opportunity to be aggressive the whole game.  
  
Q. Coach, you had a pretty good performance from your three in bigs in your
rotation. But I think you had a fair advantage in the paint. How important is
that when you have Okafor tomorrow?  
COACH GOTTFRIED: Well, it's important for our team for our big guys to
contribute offensively. And sometimes that's scoring basket, sometimes that's
passing, sometimes it's rebounding the ball. We thought a big point of
emphasis tonight was Young and Artis. More than anything, they had to guard
those guys.  
Obviously, tomorrow night we've got a big job with Okafor, but we need those
guys to contribute. We've had a lot of scoring from our guards throughout the
year, but when our bigs have scored and done some things, it's really made our
team better.  
  
Q. Coach, six wins in the last seven games, kind of coming on the heels of I
think it was six out of eight losses. What's the team done differently that it
seems to be peaking at the right time?  
COACH GOTTFRIED: I think we've gained some confidence peaking. I think we've
gotten better defensively. I think when we inserted Lennard back in the lineup
at Louisville, it gave us a better defensive team on the floor, and I think
that's kind of helped our team all the way around.  
You know, I look at Cat, and he's raised his game to another level. Trevor has
been sensational all year, Ralston has been really good. So BeeJay's playing
better, Cat's playing better. We're getting good play out of Lennard in there.
Our team is just beginning to gel. I think we can improve a lot still, but we
are playing some good basketball right now.  
  
Q. Cat, Trevor, a lot of fans have been asking for gray uniforms. What did
you think of the new digs?  
TREVOR LACEY: We like them. We say you look good, you play good. But you know,
we stay on our KBS, our equipment manager. We just come out ask we're just
going to play. We like them. Yeah, we like them and we're going to keep
playing in them hopefully and wear them out.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE MEN'S

## March 10, 2015

  

### [Danny Manning](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23674)

### [Codi Miller-McIntyre](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=27803)

  
_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

Virginia Tech  81  
Wake Forest - 80

DANNY MANNING: This afternoon was a very hard‑fought exciting ballgame.
Virginia Tech made a few more plays down the stretch than we did. Jalen Hudson
had an outstanding ballgame, and we couldn't slow them down, and having said
that, I thought down the stretch we had a chance, and we just weren't able to
capitalize. But give Virginia Tech credit; they went out and made plays.

Q. Danny, what was it about Jalen that made him such a tough match‑up and
allowed him to get into the lane so much?  
DANNY MANNING: Well, he's a talented player but we have to do a better job of
staying in front of the basketball.

Q. Cody, what did you know about Jalen? He did not have a big role in the game
in Winston‑Salem. What did you see from him today?  
CODY MILLER‑McINTYRE: He was extremely aggressive. Once he got his few points
he just kept on attacking, attacking the rim, made 10 for 10 from the
free‑throw line. That was the biggest thing; he saw that he could get in the
paint and he continued to do that throughout the game.

Q. Danny, 60 seconds to go what was the play you Drew up there at the end of
the game? What were you looking to get?  
DANNY MANNING: Well, we wanted dean owes coming off and then we had some
action on the tail end and dean owes got a pretty good look and it didn't go
down and we got a couple cracks at offensive rebounds and weren't able to put
it in the basket.

Q. Cody, I know you had a crack there at one of those tip‑ins, just your
thoughts on the shot just not falling for you?  
CODY MILLER‑McINTYRE: I guess it wasn't meant to happen. I was in the right
position, got a hand on the ball, but it just rolled out.

Q. Coach Manning, one thing that has been consistent with your Demon Deacon
team is that they've always played hard. How would you describe your first
year of coaching here?  
DANNY MANNING: You know, obviously we'd like to have a better record than we
ended with, so that's something that you like to see a little bit better. I
think these guys have gone through a lot of change. I think change is hard for
teenagers. I think these guys have handled it very well. We've come in and
we've done things a lot different than what they're accustomed to, and they've
handled it very well, and we just have to continue to work. But to answer your
question, I wish we were better off than we are right now, but I do feel we're
moving in the right direction, not as fast as I would like or we would like,
but we're getting there, and I think our foundation is almost down and intact,
and we'll continue to work on that and build on it.

Q. Danny and Cody, I had you with one stop of your last eight defensive
possessions. Why, and how bad did that hurt you?  
DANNY MANNING: Jalen Hudson. We weren't able to stay in front of him. He had
the ball in his hands most of the time, and he made plays. He made plays, and
we weren't able to stop him.  
CODY MILLER‑McINTYRE: Weak side help. We didn't do a good job at helping each
other out and talking. A lot of his points was just straight down the middle
or straight to the rim after he got by the first person, there was no help. As
a team we have to play better team defense because he was a tough player
tonight. We shouldn't have let one person beat five players on the court.

Q. Coach Manning and Cody, what are the most valuable lessons for foundational
purposes that this team has learned this year, playing hard, getting
competitive games? I know right now it's probably not the best time to ask
this question, but what are the most valuable things that you've set in place
in this first year?  
CODY MILLER‑McINTYRE: I believe competing and playing hard are the two main
things. I believe if you look at the losses on the road throughout the few
previous years, it was completely different, and even this year there was a
few flashbacks to that, but it's a process, and we have to be patient with
that and learn that it's going to come. I think those are the two biggest
things, just playing hard and compete like we did tonight. We were down 11 at
halftime, fought back, and from then on we was in a dogfight. That's something
that‑‑ those two things are the biggest foundations that Coach Manning has
brought to the program, I believe.  
DANNY MANNING: I think for me, we talk about doing things. It's a new era for
Wake Forest basketball. We're asking these guys to do something they've never
done before and they've handled it well, but I think for me the biggest center
piece at this point in time of the year is how you feel after games like this.
This is supposed to fuel you when you're working out in the summer. This is
supposed to fuel you when you're in practice and the season gets long and you
get tired, remembering this feeling and not wanting to have this feeling. So
that's something that we'll continue to talk to our young men about and let
them know that, I mean, we have to continue to work.

## March 10, 2015

  

### [Ahmed Hill](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28466)

### [Jalen Hudson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28465)

### [Buzz Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19411)

  
_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

Virginia Tech  81  
Wake Forest - 80

Q. Buzz, what did you like about your team's offensive execution in general,
and for both you and Jalen, can you discuss what enabled Jalen to have such a
good game today?  
BUZZ WILLIAMS: I'll answer the second question first. I've said since
Thanksgiving that Jalen was our most talented player, but he didn't play hard
enough to be that every game. He knows that. He's as smart as Christian Beyer
is. When he plays hard, he's really good, and when he doesn't play hard, he's
just a 6'4" guard that doesn't play hard.  
He's growing up just like the rest of the freshmen are. I don't think that we
strategically did not run a play that we haven't ran in the last three games.
It was just the mentality of how we ran the play.  
JALEN HUDSON: Like Coach Buzz said, it wasn't really a play, it was our
mentality. We all played hard, and coming into this game we had a great week
of practice and we had to do our own scouting report, so we knew everything
they were going to do before they were going to do it and even better.
Basically our mentality was just to play hard, leave it out on the floor. We
have two seniors that we love, and we just tried to extend their season a
little bit longer. That was about it.

Q. You guys had a similar scenario at the end of the Duke game and didn't get
the fall called when Jalen went to the rim. Were you concerned about that
scenario?  
BUZZ WILLIAMS: It was not the exact same play that we ran against Duke. It's
very similar action at the start of the play. The ball is to go to Jalen. His
mentality versus Duke at that time was the same mentality that he went with
today, and I'll leave it up to you if you thought he was fouled.  
JALEN HUDSON: Like Coach Buzz said, it was a very similar play. It was to get
the ball to me and turn it downhill and if I didn't have an open shot then
there was a man in the corner who had another open shot. This time I tried to
free myself up so the player wouldn't get a chance to foul me, so I kind of
learned from the Duke game because I know in the last second like that refs
don't want to put the game in their hands. I just tried to finish by avoiding
some contact, and I did, and I was able to finish.

Q. Jalen, you scored 12 of your team's last 15 points. Where did that come
from today?  
JALEN HUDSON: It was just my confidence. Buzz gave me confidence all week and
he gave me confidence today, and I was able to just play hard and the last
couple plays were actually for me, so I just decided to make a play for my
team, help my team win.

Q. Jalen, have you been able to identify why your effort level fluctuated
throughout the season? If you hear what coach has been saying for a long time,
it seems like you might be able to get performances similar to this more often
had you been playing as hard? Do you know why‑‑  
BUZZ WILLIAMS: Because he's 18, and this was an overwhelming experience, and
if it was that easy to do every single day, then everybody would do it. He's
not going to answer that question. He'll figure it out. He's a great kid. I
love him. He knows that. I coach him really hard, and sometimes that's really
hard to endure my coaching and to execute what I'm asking you to do.  
But he did it against Duke, and that gave us a chance to win, and what he did
today is his mentality, you can tell, because he was 10 of 10 from the line
and going into the game I think he was shooting 63 percent from the free‑throw
line in ACC play.

Q. You guys will face a Miami team that beat y'all by 21 points just a few
days ago. How do you take this moment into that game, and what do you think
your keys will be in order to get the victory?  
BUZZ WILLIAMS: Well, we were down 29‑26 at Miami at halftime, and I think they
outscored us 27 or 24 in the second half. It was never a game. I got a
technical, my only technical, at the 12‑minute media time‑out. It was never a
game in the last game on Saturday. They were 10 of 15 from three in the first
half, 5 of 10 from three in the second half. That's incredibly hard to
overcome.  
The mentality of our team in the second half, we started four freshmen and a
walk‑on. It was better, but it was better because Miami was winning by 25
points and they probably weren't as hooked up in the second half after the
demolishing of the first half. I know they were there watching the game.
They're playing for an NCAA Tournament at‑large bid, great coach, Final Four
experience, two sit‑out guys that have had a phenomenal effect, the leading
rebounder in the league, playing at a very high clip, and we will have to
figure out a way somehow over the next 27 hours to figure out how to slow them
down if we can.

Q. Jalen, you had 10 baskets today. What was your approach in terms of how you
wanted to get your points, attack that Wake defense?  
JALEN HUDSON: I mean, I really wasn't thinking anything like that. Like Coach
Buzz said, it was our mentality, it was just to bring it down their throat.
That's kind of what we were doing all game. I had some good chances to take it
to the basket, which I was able to finish. That was pretty much it.

Q. Buzz had you guys do the scouting report for this game. It's a little bit
unusual. What was that experience like, and do you think it played an impact
in the way you kind of focused in tonight?  
AHMED HILL: Yes, it played a big impact. It made us realize the hard work that
assistant coaches do to get the scouting report and everything. When we did
it, we realized what we needed to do and how much time and effort the
assistant coach put in, and we just tried to execute everything we wrote up.
That was about it.  
JALEN HUDSON: Exactly what he just said.

Q. I know that your concentration is 125 percent tomorrow. Is it possible to
just peek into the future? Next year your leading scorer is coming back and
four of your next five players are sophomores and freshmen. It must make you
smile.  
BUZZ WILLIAMS: I've had the time of my life coaching these guys, not because
of my ego. I don't want to win for myself. The kids have worked incredibly
hard every day regardless of the tumultuousness of what we've been through,
and that speaks to who raised them for them to be so young and handle it in a
such a mature way. We are two former walk‑ons that are on scholarship, and we
have guys that are on scholarship that haven't been a part of our team in
conference play. We've played 57 percent of ACC minutes by freshmen only. We
started four freshmen today.  
So from an investment standpoint for the future, you can say, well, everybody
is coming back, or you could say everybody is coming back and you won two
games. So is that good enough. So our spring and our summer and our fall will
probably be the most important three seasons of their career because it will
dictate/determine where our future is going to be, because these kids along
with other freshmen will end up having to be a leaders of our team because
we'll have five sophomores, we'll have three freshmen, so again, 65 percent of
our team will be comprised of underclassmen. We'll only have two seniors on
the team, Shane Henry and Adam Smith. We'll have three juniors, but two of
them are sitting out. So when you look at the decisions that were made in
April, May and June when we got the job, we designed two freshmen, 'Med and
Satch, don't know if that's smart. We signed‑‑ we kept Jalen and Justin who
the previous staff did an unbelievable job recruiting. They're two of the
better freshmen in the league, but they didn't receive a vote for any sort of
category, nor did any other player on our team. And then we signed two sit‑out
guys. So there's six guys that are brand new.  
So if you look at next year's team, there will only be three guys on the team
that were on the team the day that I was hired. So long‑term I hope it's the
right decision on the decisions that we've made. I've had a lot of fun because
I've learned a lot, and I've learned a lot because of the resiliency and the
perseverance of how their parents raised them, and so it's helped me as a dad.

Q. Following the question you were just answering, how important was it to
your program to come down here and get a win in the tournament after the
regular season?  
BUZZ WILLIAMS: Well, I agree with what Jalen said. I don't think you could
find two walk‑ons on the same team, and if you add Greg Donlon, the three
walk‑ons on the same team. I asked them 10 days ago to write down in order
individually, sign your name, individually rank our 13 players, that counts
our walk‑ons, No.1 being who cares the most about winning, and No.13, who
cares the least about winning. And our three walk‑ons, two of which are on
scholarship now, were in the top five of every single player's list.  
And so I agree with Jalen. Those kids had not experienced an ACC win since
Will Johnson was a freshman, and so I'm glad that the taste in their mouth
will be different when they leave Blacksburg specific to that.

Q. What was your assessment of the play that Beyer and Shane Henry gave you
off the bench today?  
BUZZ WILLIAMS: Obviously what Jalen did is a complete game changer from start
to finish, but if Jalen is playing at that level, and I thought he did
throughout the game, I thought what Shane did was the difference in the game.
Three offensive rebounds, four points, four total rebounds, two blocks in 14
minutes, you'd have to look it up, but I mentioned it in the locker room ‑
sorry for being late, I wanted to shower ‑ I thought his speed and his
quickness, even though Devin Thomas demolished all of our guys, just the speed
and the quickness that he gave us in transition, offensively and defensively,
so, so happy for him, because he's the guy that nobody ever mentions,
least‑played guy, JuCo guy, but he works just as hard as anybody in our
program.  
I'm really happy for him because his esteem fluctuates probably more than
these kids because these kids think that they're going to do this the rest of
their life, and Shane is smart enough to know that as of now he has however
many games left, plus one more year.

Q. Can you tell me kind of what was going through your mind in the last five
seconds? They get three looks at the basket, kind of freaking out inside I'm
guessing?  
BUZZ WILLIAMS: Yeah, well, it's allowed me to hire a couple more positions
than they've ever had, and I think it's probably always a question as an
administrator why do you need so many guys. And I think part of the way that
we teach, mostly the way of how we work, the responsibility of each person is
incredibly important. Part of it is because of how I function mentally.  
One of our administrative assistants this year, every week I have asked him
since week No.1 of the season, every time there's a Division I televised game
that ends with a put‑back win, we don't say blocking out like your high school
coach said if you played. We call it taking up space. So most teams are really
good at defending the first shot. But then what happens is when the shot, last
second, they're like, I wonder if it's going in. And because there's no other
possession remaining, everybody is charging the rim.  
So I think we've shown it six times throughout the season. Obviously it's a
six‑second clip possession here or there, but we've done take‑up‑space game
winners, and so the only thing that I was talking to our team about amidst
whose ball it is was this is a take‑up‑space game winner. We know their
out‑of‑bounds plays. You guys know how they're going to defend it. We'll be
fine on that shot. But it's the next shot.  
Another example of how fragile the line is, that they got three, two of the
three point‑blank lay‑ups, one by the guy that dominated the game in the post.

Q. For the players, it's been a tough season for you guys, been a tough
several weeks for you guys, so what does it mean to you to come in here and
turn things around and win a game in the ACC Tournament?  
AHMED HILL: It means a lot. You know, we've got two seniors, so we just want
to extend their season, keep them rolling, and just to come in here and play
harder than anyone else and have incredible energy. It means a lot, and that's
all we're trying to do.  
JALEN HUDSON: That's it.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 10, 2015

  

### [Brian Gregory](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19617)

### [Charles Mitchell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28461)

  
_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

Boston College  66  
Georgia Tech - 65

  
COACH GREGORY: Our guys battled hard and obviously a little undermanned with
the injury to Marcus. We really wanted to emphasize getting the ball inside
and really controlling the glass. I thought we did a good job of that.  
I mentioned before the game that Boston College over the last couple of weeks,
outside of maybe the top two or three teams in the league, were playing as
well as anybody. And they started out the game exactly that way, making shots
and really moving the ball. And I thought our defense played better as the
game went along and you get into a one‑possession game and they're a hard team
to be successful in that because they've got a guy that can get a shot at any
time and it's usually a pretty good one. I thought we defended the end of the
game pretty well. And it's unfortunate that their last nine points, five of
them came on free throws‑‑ one where we make a hustle play and get a turnover
on it and then the last basket.  
But as I've said before, our guys competed throughout. We just made a couple
bad decisions there at the end with the ball in our hands. And unfortunately
in this league, against this type of competition, that's going to come back to
get you and it did today.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. Coach, is this kind of like a microcosm of a lot of what you guys have
dealt with throughout this regular season, just the close losses and stuff
like that?  
COACH GREGORY: Yeah, you know, it is. I don't know what that is. Our tenth or
11th in‑league play, one‑possession game. I thought Tadric and Charles, we
wanted to get those two guys on the same side at the end. Charles set a really
good screen which freed up Tadric for that middle drive that put us up by 1.  
So many times we haven't been able to get that basket. So I'm thinking to
myself, okay, we just got that one, maybe for the first time in two months,
we're going to catch a break and obviously there's still time left on the
clock and Hanlan made a good play on that.  
You can't point to one single thing. It was a missed free throw from an
85percent free throw shooter that ‑‑ it was‑‑ we've done a good job of
containing Hanlan all night long. And obviously the layup, he's the one who
hit the layup off the turnover, right? You can't really put that on the
defense.  
He gets two free throws, which, when we're up 6 on that particular play. And
then he makes the game‑winning shot. You have to make‑‑ it's just one play.
You gotta make one of those plays there at the end. You either can't turn the
ball over there, you gotta‑‑ when you get the offensive rebound, you've got to
not turn it over there.  
So, unfortunately, when you look at it, so many of these cases you're one play
away. Sometimes, as I said all year, that gets even more frustrating. It's
even more frustrating, and it's even harder for the guys because each one of
those guys knows if they didn't do one play, well, you know, you're competing
and that's a tough situation to go through.  
  
Q. Coach, coming out of that last timeout, what was the plan for you guys
and did things unfold in the way that you didn't expect or the way you
expected? What was the plan sort of coming out?  
COACH GREGORY: Coming out with us on offense or on their offensive play?  
  
Q. On your last offensive possession.  
COACH GREGORY: We ran our action that we like to run in those situations and
try to get a drive from Travis with some shooters in the corners. And we got
our trail man‑‑ we're in a little difficult situation just due to the fact
that without Marcus in the game at that time. But we had them spread out,
which is what you want to do. When you get them spread out, then you want to
attack the basket.  
And Corey had made two big offensive plays in the second half already. They
did a good job defending it. Give them credit, because Travis is usually able
to get into the lane on that particular play. He wasn't, made a good decision,
played with some poise there, and Corey was able to get all the way to the
basket. And you gotta take your chances on a play like that, if you can get to
the rim.  
  
Q. I think with about six minutes left, you're up 54 ‑51 and I think there
were four possessions in a row, you came up empty. Quinton had some 3s. I
guess did you see that as kind of a turning point? And second, were you okay
with the shots that Quinton was taking?  
COACH GREGORY: He had nine pretty wide‑open 3s. And I thought out of the 12
shots he took, probably 11 of them were really good shots, you know?  
On one of those particular plays I wanted to go inside to Chuck. And obviously
with the game, the flow of the game, I couldn't tell if that play was open.
Our second look is Quinton coming off a couple of screens for the 3. And he
shot the 3 on that one. And that was after he missed the first two.  
You can question that, but I thought that was a big stretch right there where
we had some opportunities to stretch it a little earlier and we weren't able
to capitalize on it. But I think if you take a look at those shots, they were
all pretty good looks.  
  
Q. Charles, you guys kind of had your way on them on the boards. I think you
played a little more this time than the last time around with BC. What gave
you guys that edge on the glass?  
CHARLES MITCHELL: I mean, knowing that was one of the keys to the game to
attack the defensive and offensive glass. That was going to get us the
advantage on the defense and give us second‑chance points on the offensive
glass. And thinking that it's game by game you have to give it all for the 40
minutes that you play, so just going out there and giving pure effort on the
glass and trying to get the best chance of our team to win.  
  
Q. Charles, obviously there have been a lot of close losses like this this
season. Anything moving forward to take away from this that you can learn from
the future?  
CHARLES MITCHELL: We were always taught to keep fighting and never give up
there's always a chance, never give up, keep fighting through. There's going
to be ups and downs and there's going to be obstacles you have to get over.
But keep fighting day‑by‑day, you can't give up.

## March 10, 2015

  

### [Jim Christian](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18217)

### [Olivier Hanlan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24978)

### [Patrick Heckmann](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26635)

  
_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

Boston College  66  
Georgia Tech - 65

  
COACH CHRISTIAN: I thought it was just an unbelievably hard‑fought basketball
game. It's what conference tournaments are like at every level. I thought they
came out really ready to play, Georgia Tech. Had a great game plan and
rebounded the ball extremely well. But the resiliency of our team the last
three weeks is what I'm really proud of. I've said it before, especially the
seniors, they're helping me change the culture of this program day‑by‑day,
because they just continue to compete, fight, stay together and obviously at
the end of the game, put the ball in the hands of a special player and he
makes a play and you're lucky enough to win the game.  
As I told our team you don't have to play great to advance in conference
tournaments. You just have to advance.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. Coach, is there anything from your first meeting with Carolina that you
learned that you might be able to take into the next game?  
COACH CHRISTIAN: I think we weren't the same team we are now either. So I
think obviously they really hurt us in the paint. Just like Georgia Tech did
today.  
We have to fix that. It was really impressive the first time we played them is
a guy like Hicks who had not started I don't think until that time. And he
seized his opportunity. I talked to the whole team about it. He stayed ready
and worked incredibly hard and when he got his opportunity. The shots he was
hitting they were not easy shots. They were 12‑foot jump hooks.  
They score the ball in the interior from a lot of different ways. So obviously
it's a lot similar to the way Georgia Tech played. We have to keep them off
the backboard and try to neutralize them.  
And obviously we have to have some energy left. When you play a game like
this, it's kind of draining. So we've got to get ready to go.  
  
Q. Olivier, tell me just about what it is about playing Tech you always seem
to bring your best against those guys.  
OLIVIER HANLAN: I try to approach every game just being physical. But I think
we match up good against them in terms of guards and especially me, just
matching up and just trying to get easy looks. And obviously Coach Christian
has been doing a pretty good job of trying to get, trying to get me easy looks
on offense and just different looks because Georgia Tech is obviously not the
first time they've played me. So they're kind of getting used to me. I started
the game a little slow. But I just try to bring it every day.  
  
Q. Olivier, you've played in the ACC tournament before, obviously. Does
today still feel like an ACC tournament game the smaller crowd and all that,
or will it like tomorrow feel like the tournament's really getting started for
you?  
OLIVIER HANLAN: It's like a new season. Everybody is on the same terms of
everybody's 0‑0, but definitely tomorrow playing against UNC and UNC being so
close, definitely feel like a road game but definitely feel like a pretty good
ACC tournament game.  
  
Q. Coach, Kennedy Meeks will be out tomorrow but it will be still be a tall
task playing Carolina especially here in Greensboro. How are you going to
contain them in the post? You struggled that a bit today?  
COACH CHRISTIAN: We did struggle. We had been much better as of late in our
post defense but I felt we gave up too much deep position today. We're letting
them, the catches were getting into the post too early, when we trapped the
post it was late. So we'll probably have to watch some film and see how we
need to adjust that and just try ‑‑ and again it's a tall task. We're not very
deep up front, not much size. I think we have to work harder than we did
today. We let them take the fight to us.  
As much as it was post‑ups it was offensive rebounding that hurt us tonight. A
couple times in the post but more it was, like, I thought their second effort
to the ball was greater than ours and we can't let that happen.  
  
Q. What was the thought process when you guys were down 6 with a minute and
a half to go and Olivier what did you see on your shot that could you walk me
through that sequence for you?  
OLIVIER HANLAN: We set a double ball screen from the wing and the whole game
the guard that was guarding me was staying with me but for some reason they
switched it and I think I had Sampson on me and I immediately recognized it
and just tried to attack him like I was going to the basket and I hit him with
a step‑back, just to create space, and had to shoot over.  
  
Q. Patrick, your thoughts when you were down 6?  
PATRICK HECKMANN: We have to play on offense like we did all game. We had to
get some stops. We were getting looks. Coach was giving us good plays to run
and we just had to execute and get some rebounds on defense.  
  
Q. Patrick, the last several weeks you guys have strung some wins together
and really played a lot better. What in your mind has been different, what are
you guys doing a little bit better?  
PATRICK HECKMANN: I think believing in us now when we go into every game. We
know we can win and we've proven that. We've shown character. And I think now
everything's come together a little more and that's what's helping us.

VCU  71  
DAYTON - 65

  
COACH ARCHIE MILLER: I want to congratulate VCU on a tremendous tournament
run. I think Shaka has done a great job of having to balance losing Briante
Weber and dealing with some injuries with Treveon Graham; a lot of people
started to say they weren't this and they weren't that. I think they just
needed to some time to re‑figure themselves out, get some confidence; and this
tournament I really felt allowed them to do that and they really played
fantastic. They really earned the Atlantic 10 Championship sort of the hard
way.  
I thought we played extremely hard. I thought we battled for three days. You
know, I'm not sure what it's a tribute to, but we are a pretty good shooting
team. And I thought we had some open shots that if they just go in a little
bit, the game could have been different, but it wasn't the case. Our guys
really battled. They battled very, very hard in the game and I'm very proud of
them for the way they came up and played.  
  
Q. The free throw line ‑‑  
COACH ARCHIE MILLER: It's what we've done all year. I think coming into
today's game, we were ranked second in the country in free throw rate, which
is an awesome statistic to have at your disposal. We are a rugged team. We are
a physical team. We made 21; they attempted 21. That's sort of how we play.  
But their 3‑point shooting was the difference in the game. It's so unbalanced;
they made 10 and shot 37 percent. Uncharacteristically in these last three
games, we have really got dinged from behind the line and hopefully we can get
better at it as we get ready to play our first‑round game this week coming up.  
  
Q. Three games in three days with your bench, do you feel like that may have
had an effect? Looked early on like maybe Pollard was a little slow.  
COACH ARCHIE MILLER: I think that's natural with our team because we played so
many heavy minutes that you're not going to be as fresh every game as you can
three games in three days.  
But I thought we had a lot of hard plays made all over the three days. Yeah, I
think the bounce around the basket and the shots from deep, of course, I think
that that sort of plays a factor in it a little bit.  
But that's why VCU is good. They have got some depth. They have got some guys
that are used to playing their roles in those type of minutes every day. I
don't know, we'll watch it. We had good looks. These guys, they have battled
hard all year. It's hard to say we didn't ‑‑ we're finally tired. I didn't
think we played tired at all.  
  
Q. Coming out of the time ‑out at 1:13, they go to the 1‑2‑2, first time
they showed itall weekend. How did that effect ‑‑   
COACH ARCHIE MILLER: Under the two‑minute mark when they went zone, is that
what you're asking?  
Yeah, they flipped it right there. They went zone. It the was a good decision
on their part to flip defenses. We had a play called, didn't work and they got
a big steal out of it.  
I think they played it one more time and we ended up, Kendall got a bucket
right underneath the basket. It was a game‑changing play, a little bit just in
terms of getting a two‑possession lead. We had the play called. Just didn't
execute it.  
  
Q. Scoochie had a very good game today. In this year, what ways have you
seen him improve overall?  
COACH ARCHIE MILLER: He's become a really good point guard for us. He runs our
team as well as it's been run all year. To play three games in three days and
have the tempo and the push that he had all weekend was a big key in why we
were able to win games.  
Today he had to do all the ball handling in the halfcourt. We put him in high
ball screen situations and he started to really deliver. He got downhill, he
finished, he got fouled, and I think he may be the one guy that I look at and
say just from a legs perspective, he had some really good looks and he was
short on all of them.  
Hopefully we can get Scoochie back. But he's turned into a terrific player. He
was by far and away, a lot of these guys had great weekends, but Scooch was
really, really responsible for in a big way how we had some success.  
  
Q. Obviously you wanted to win this one, but you guys are pretty much in the
tournament. Can you talk about having this loss to carry into next week?  
COACH ARCHIE MILLER: It hurts. I think I told these guys in the locker room,
if you me at the beginning of the season you'll play for the regular season
title and the conference championship title, would you take it? Yeah,
absolutely, and we were in those positions.  
Today and last week against La Salle be the building blocks to getting through
the wall, so to speak, to win the Championship of this league. That's what we
want to do. That's why these guys come here. But to go to back‑to‑back NCAA
Tournaments; Jordan coming to Dayton and being a part of back‑to‑back
tournaments; Kendall being recruited here to become a perennial, every‑year
tournament team, that's what we are trying to do.  
To build two in a row is awesome; to play in the tournament is going to be a
great feeling. This will Sting. Selection show will re‑energize us I think.  
  
Q. Jordan, what are your emotions coming so close in the regular season and
again today? Are you still proud of this team?  
JORDAN SILBERT: Absolutely. We've accomplished a lot. People didn't think we
would get this far; they doubted us as soon as we lost our players.  
I'm extremely proud of these guys. I know we're all frustrated about the loss.
Everyone wants to win. I'm extremely proud of these guys. We never gave up and
I wouldn't trade these guys for anything.  
  
Q. You ended the first half on momentum, picked it up in the second half,
and then Jordan had that strip, Treveon in the corner. What's going through
your mind? Are you thinking things are switching at that point in time?  
COACH ARCHIE MILLER: Momentum had changed. We talked about it when you play
VCU, 3‑point shot in the press and the crowd, can feel like eight points,
10‑points and it really isn't. We knew we would go through runs during the
game.  
They were really shooting the ball well, though. We were closing out short.
They were confident shooting the ball in the first half. I think the last one
in particular that went in was a dagger. Didn't feel good going into halftime.
They even came out in the second half and again they made some open ones, and
finally I thought our pressure picked up.  
I thought our ability to cover the three‑point line was better. Being able
to‑‑ 11 steals, it shows we were active again. I think in the conference
tournament, if I'm not mistaken, our team had over 30 steals or close to 30
steals. Our activity off the ball, our quickness, being able to get defensive
stops which leads to offense, is usually when we are at our best. I thought it
changed momentum.  
We had our opportunities. We were right there in a one‑possession game,
two‑possession game. Just to me, just a couple open shots, a breakaway layup
that goes wrong; you need those things to go well for you when you are going
for it all.  
  
Q. No bench points tonight. Moving into the next tournament, do you think
that will be a problem?  
COACH ARCHIE MILLER: That's not a first. Bobby did a great job in this
tournament and Darrell did a great job in this tournament. Darrell had some
really good looks, and I would tell him to shoot that ball every single time.  
Bobby did a tremendous job in this tournament. We wouldn't have played for the
championship without him, and he also played 15 hard minutes and got three
good rebounds, two offensive rebounds.  
So their job is to hold serve. We are not that team that's built with the
productivity or firepower off the bench. Their job is to come in, hold serve,
stick to the script, and they did that. I think that was a big part of it.  
Looking at the game, shot 27 free throws and only turned it over ten times.
Second‑chance points, maybe a little bit. But to me, the 2 for 12 from the
three, that's probably the difference in the game.  
  
Q. Kendall, can you talk about you won the paint points tonight. Was the
game plan more to try to post ‑up or attack the paint from the outside down
low?   
KENDALL POLLARD: For me it's alwaysto attack the paint. Yeah, we just tried to
take on the side and ‑‑ just finish. Didn't do a good job.  
  
Q. Could you take us through that play and your decision on the trap with
Treveon in the corner; what were you seeing?  
JORDAN SILBERT: You talking about the steal in transition? Well, when we
scouted, Coach just kept saying, make sure jump to the ball and just be in
help and try to help each other. They passed it back, and I just wanted to
just make sure I was just there in the gap just to help Dyshawn just in case
he got by. It wasn't like a set play we ran or anything. I was just trying to
help Dyshawn out, and he dribbled right into me. It was a good play and it
kind of gave us a little energy.

_BROOKLYN, NEW YORK_  
  

VCU  71  
DAYTON - 65

  
Q. Treveon, can you describe the feeling after you had it locked up?  
TREVEON GRAHAM: Just relief, all the hard work that we went through this
season, all the adversity we had to go through. When Bri was out, everybody
had to get a new role and everybody had to step up, and just the satisfaction
to know that all hard work paid off.  
  
Q. Is your leg okay after the hop down the court?  
BRIANTE WEBER: Right now, my left leg will probably be stronger. I told the
guys, when I come back to practice, the next time, don't jump with me; I'm
going for posters.  
But my left leg is definitely getting stronger and stronger by the day. My
right leg right now, it's a work‑in‑progress right now.  
  
Q. You seemed very, very emotional after the game. What was going through
your mind and how proud are you of these guys?  
BRIANTE WEBER: Words really can't explain how proud I am of these guys. It's
been an emotional roller coaster for us both; when Amico (ph) h went out with
an injury and then us winning, losing, everybody hopping off the bandwagon and
so forth.  
But just know behind closed doors we had our talks and all our emotional
stuff; when we step in between those lines, from March to the last bit of
February, we kind of found ourselves again and that's what we need to keep
building on that right now.  
  
Q. Do you feel like you possibly played your best basketball of your career
in this tournament?  
MO ALIE‑COX: I guess you could say that. I played real good when I was in
Brooklyn last year, also. So I just tried to build on that. And coming into
this week, Coach was telling me he's going to give me the ball a lot and he
always tells me I'm one of the best players in the conference. So I just try
to come in here and play like this.  
  
Q. What does it mean to be here now, rallying together for Bri?  
TREVEON GRAHAM: It means a lot. We told Bri when he went down, we were going
to do it for him. The rest of the season was for him. We dug down and
everybody had to find themselves. JeQuan and Johnny had to step into their
role. And coming into this tournament, Johnny really stepped up being a
freshman, he really attacked and he really believed in himself and I think
that really helped us and help JeQuan get to where he needed to be. Bri was
always there for us, his enthusiasm, his energy is always there. It's great to
be here now.  
  
Q. You guys come out of that time ‑out about 1:13 and go zone. Was that the
first time you went zone all weekend?  
TREVEON GRAHAM: Yeah, we had one play zone against Davidson just to throw them
all. They kept going to the basket and getting fouls. We needed to do
something different‑‑ we practiced zone right before going into the tournament
in case we needed to throw it out there. It worked. Just throw it down, run
the clock out.  
  
Q. Tradition has it that usually the coach cuts the last piece of the net.
When did they tell you you were going to do it, and what did that feel like?  
BRIANTE WEBER: When I went out, January 31st, they all came together and said:
"Bri, we going to cut down the net, and you know who is going to be the last
one holding the net?"  
They told me it was going to be me, and I believed them. And now we get here
today and I was the one cutting down the net, that made me very emotional.  
  
Q. You guys faced a lot of doubters since Briante went down. How do you keep
proving everybody wrong and how are you going to try to do that in March
Madness?  
TREVEON GRAHAM: We have to believe in ourselves. We can't worry about what
other people think. We all believe in each other and everybody has to step up.
Mo, one of the strongest people in the country and everybody knows it; Melvin,
one of the best shooters; JeQuan, one of the fastest guards in the country. We
believe in each other and we just have to play ball and play VCU way. If we do
that, it's hard to beat us.  
  
Q. When you at some point maybe saw Briante hopping around at mid court, did
you get a look like, hey, is he okay, what is he doing out there?  
TREVEON GRAHAM: If you go back and watch, you see me try to grab him to make
sure he was on the left leg instead of the right leg. Trying to make sure he
was safe.  
  
Q. Are you all used to being in a position, even though this may have been
somewhat of a down year, less ‑than‑expectations year for you all; are you
used to competing for championships and playing at a high level?   
TREVEON GRAHAM: Yeah, since I've been here my freshman year, we played the
championship game from freshman to now. We know what to do when we get to the
championship. The last two years we lost. We built off that and we knew we had
to respond when things didn't go our way.  
Last two years, I think we didn't know that as much. This year we sat down,
and when they went on their runs, we just sat down and played our ball.  
  
Q. You shot 80 percent better from three point range here than at home.
Would you like to play your home games here?  
TREVEON GRAHAM: Just got to keep shooting. Melvin, he shot tremendous this
whole tournament. You've just got to keep shooting and got to believe in
yourself and we going to believe in you, as long as you shoot with confidence
and you think it's going in.  
COACH SHAKA SMART: I never wear hats but they gave us one for winning the
Championship, so that doesn't happen every day. Just really, really proud of
our guys. Want to say, first of all, how impressed I've been with Dayton all
year long. Obviously they have been under‑manned and haven't had a lot of
guys, and the way they battled and played together and the job that Coach
Miller and his staff have done is phenomenal.  
They were a really, really tough opponent today. Really neither team deserved
to lose. We were just fortunate that we were able to make a couple more plays
at the end. But they are a championship‑calibre team.  
Also want to say I appreciate our fans for coming up here. Our fans were
terrific. For those that came up and were part of all four games, it showed a
lot of faith in us, with us being the five‑seed and knowing we're going to
have to win four games to win a championship, and I'm glad we were able to
reward them with that.  
  
Q. Basically the first game you played against Richmond, did that help
prepare you for the run you made coming into today's title game?  
COACH SHAKA SMART: That was actually our second game here, and that was a
really important one, because they had beaten us two games earlier in the
year. You know, they were coming off of a bye and we were coming off of a
pretty hard‑fought win over Fordham.  
So for our guys to be able to battle through and come back and win that game;
that gave us some momentum. I really think the momentum that we got from
winning the Fordham game and then the Richmond game, that carried us into
yesterday. Yesterday was the best we've played here, and then today, our guys
really fought and battled against a really terrific Dayton team.  
  
Q. Coming out of that time ‑out, you go zone. How many times did you go zone
this weekend? What was your feeling going into that possession?   
COACH SHAKA SMART: We played zone less than five times all year. There's a guy
on our staff named Jeremy Ballard who I think is terrific. He's a way better
assistant than I ever was. He hates zone. So whenever I think about going
zone, he talks me out of it.  
Scoochie was ripping us up in in the pick‑and‑roll action and scoring at will,
so we had to change something up. We worked on zone on Monday and Tuesday of
last week, because we knew we were going to have to play four games in four
days, and we thought maybe we could play some zone to conserve some energy. We
didn't really play this much this weekend. I think we played it one other game
for a possession or two.  
But that's not who we are. That's not what we do. But it did allow us to get a
crucial stop.  
  
Q. How proud are you of the youth on this team with Johnny stepping up big
yesterday, Terry stepping up big today?  
COACH SHAKA SMART: Yeah, I thought Terry really came of age up here in New
York and it just so happens he's from here. You know, he's got phenomenal
potential, we all know that. But he played with the maturity that we haven't
seen consistently, and he did it all tournament long.  
So he was terrific. And then Johnny gave us a big, big lift. We needed him. We
told our guys, we got two point guards and they are mostly playing one, so
let's take advantage of that. And I thought Johnny at times was able to do
that, but again, I've got to really mention again how good Scoochie Smith was
on really very, very little rest and how good he was attacking.  
  
Q. Talk about your first moment with Bri after the win.  
COACH SHAKA SMART: Well, Bri is a very emotional kid. He's been through a lot
this year. It really, really kills him every time he can't take the court and
his team does take the court. His attitude has been so good and he's been so
great in the locker room with our guys on the bench. And he gets hit with
waves of emotion‑‑ and I knew he would after the game, win or lose. I told
him, we would not have done this without you, and he knows what I meant.  
What I meant was, we would not have done this without him after he got hurt.
I'm not even talking about what he did on the court for us; and he's an
all‑league‑calibre player. But after he got hurt, that's no way we are able to
win this championship without him.  
  
Q. You came up here last year, you played Saint Joe's in the final, you
lost, seemed a little flat and a little down after that game. The team went
into the NCAAs and you were sort of flat playing in that first round. Is this
game going to help you going forward; do you think the different outcome?  
COACH SHAKA SMART: We'll see. I hope it does. I think not just this game, but
really, this whole tournament, we've had to have a level of resolve and stay
together, because all four games have been really challenging games. Even the
Davidson game yesterday, the final margin was a lot, but at the same time,
they made that game really, really hard.  
So hopefully we can build on that. You mentioned last year. You're right; I
didn't think we were in a great place going into the NCAA Tournament. I don't
think it was so much because we lost to Saint Joe's. I just didn't think as a
team we were as connected as we needed to be, and one of our best players was
out in Melvin Johnson as he got hurt up here. One of our best players was out
this year, but hopefully we are more united around each other, and hopefully
we can go do some damage.  
I'm really excited to see what the Atlantic 10 is going to do here in the NCAA
Tournament, because obviously the league has a great history of success in the
NCAA Tournament, and there are some very, very dangerous teams in our
conference.  
  
Q. Briante had said that really, right after his injury, the team promised
him that this net was going to be his. Was that something that you prompted
and started, or was that something his teammates ‑‑ do you recall how that
went down?   
COACH SHAKA SMART: I don't know where it came from with the guys, but I told
him, I told him we were going to cut down the nets and he was going to kind of
snip the final part of the net and get a chance to put that net around his
neck.  
I was actually talking about the regular season when I told him that. And that
didn't work out for us. You know, we had some close losses and Dayton came
into our place and beat us, and La Salle did, and we went to Richmond and
weren't able to finish one off.  
Teams in this league are really, really good. It is a highly, highly
competitive league, and you know, we weren't able to win the league. I think
for our guys to be able to come and produce this opportunity for Bri to cut
down the nets says a lot about our team and our connection with him.  
  
Q. Archie talked about your team's ability to gather momentum when he can
when he can when you hit a three, it feels like an eight. How do you do that?
Do you feel that yourselves?  
COACH SHAKA SMART: It's kind of the flip side: They say, never too high, never
too low. Our team, and it's been this way‑‑ I don't know if it's me or the
people that we have brought into our program. But we tend to get too high
sometimes, and there's been times where we've gotten too low.  
I talk all the time about poise and having poise in response to whatever
happens. But I think one of the positives of that is when we do make big
plays, our guys do get excited for each other, and it can lead to some
momentum. Just you can't get too high because you have to be focused on the
details of the process, and I think the guys did a good job of that today.  
  
Q. In a conference that is vastly improving, how do you continue to be one
of the top teams each and every year?  
COACH SHAKA SMART: Well, I don't even want to think about it now, but it's
going to be a heck of a challenge going into next year because I think the
Atlantic 10 might be the strongest it's ever been next year.  
It's pretty scary to look at; you can just rattle off the teams and how many
underclassmen they have and how many guys they are going to have returning to
Dayton, Rhode Island and GW and the list just continues. Hopefully our young
guys can get better and we can be really good next year.  
It's going to be a heck of a challenge. In this league, like any other good
league, teams beat up on each other. No one escapes through the league
undefeated. Teams go through ups and downs. But I think as our conference
continues to raise its profile and get big wins in November and December, that
only is going to help us down the stretch.  
I mean, think about it, last three years ‑‑ and we've only been in the league
three years going into this year: Atlantic 10 has received 15 NCAA Tournament
bids. That's more than a lot of leagues.  
Hopefully our conference can continue to get a lot of attention, media
attention. We really appreciate being here at the Barclays because there's no
bigger stage than this. Just glad that our guys were able to pull out the
championship today.  
  
Q. Can you contrast the feeling where you get to the final and you do not
win two in a row and what you felt then and what it's like being a part of
this?  
COACH SHAKA SMART: That's a good question. Certainly, the goal, when you come
up here to Brooklyn, is to win a championship. We were the 2‑seed each of the
last two years. We really liked our chances. We felt good about our
opportunity.  
But we came up short. And I think in both those games, the other team
out‑played us, Saint Louis and Saint Joe's the last couple of years. The one
thing we wanted to fix and do better was have a higher level of resolve and be
able to respond within the game. I thought we did a better job of that.  
Last year when we lost, it's a tricky situation, because it's Sunday, you're
about to find out who you're going to play. You have to turn the page quickly
and you can't be down about the loss for too long because you have to move on
to the NCAA Tournament. This year we won and we are extremely excited about
the win. You want to cherish championships, and we are so happy about that.  
But at the same time, we have to turn the page. We are going to find out in
less than two hours where we play, where we're going. We're going to get on a
flight and go back home. We're going to rest our bodies and we're going to
prepare, because we're not done. We want to go make some noise. We want to
continue this season. Hopefully our guys can learn some lessons from today and
apply them wherever we go in the NCAA Tournament.  
Thanks to everybody.

_BROOKLYN, NEW YORK_  
  

DAYTON  56  
RHODE ISLAND - 52

  
COACH ARCHIE MILLER: Well, that was a really hard‑fought game, anybody who
watched it probably didn't enjoy it as much as the players and the coaches in
the game, because it wasn't the prettiest of things.  
But I thought two teams who really competed; I thought Rhode Island really,
really battled hard. They were ready, in particular on defense. That was the
defensive team we expected at our place. It was just a little different
playing in our arena. But our kids battled, too. We had a lot of guys step up
and make a lot of different plays.  
The difference in the game really was probably the turnover margin and our
ability to maybe convert some of them at big times. Every basket was
hard‑earned, and we are very fortunate to win. But at this time of the year,
it doesn't really matter how you get it. You've just got to get it.  
  
Q. This is a very tough defense you guys faced. How did you overcome their
ends to make those shots in the end when they really mattered?  
SCOOCHIE SMITH: We just stick with it throughout the whole game, trust in one
another, trust in the coaching staff and plays. We just played defense harder
than they did. We made plays when they counted at the end of the game.  
JORDAN SILBERT: We basically know that our defense is what fuels our offense.
So towards the end, we tried to pick up our intensity, tried to pressure a
little bit more, and kind of got our offense clicking towards the end.  
  
Q. After yesterday, do you feel tired about playing a back ‑to‑back game
with having only seven guys?   
JORDAN SILBERT: No, we don't get tired.  
SCOOCHIE SMITH: Can't afford to get tired. It's not in us when we got a chance
to try and win.  
  
Q. You had I think ten turnovers in the first half two in the second half.
What changed?  
SCOOCHIE SMITH: Just know coming into the game you can't start with ten
turnovers and try to win the basketball game. The focus at halftime was just
take care of the ball and play defense and get stops and let that fuel our
offense.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about that steal you had at the end of the game, about
a minute left and got pushed ahead to Jordan for the big ‑time lay‑up; can you
talk about how big a play that was for you personally?  
SCOOCHIE SMITH: I knew they had a little fast break advantage, so just tried
my best to get a stop. I think that would have gave them a lot of momentum. I
got the stop and then we got a basket, so I think that just helped us out a
lot.  
  
Q. Can you talk about how you guys contained Martin, he really struggled in
the paint. What did you guys try to do to slow him down tonight?  
JORDAN SILBERT: Just tried to crowd the floor. Try to make him feel crowded.
Credit to Kendall, Dyshawn and Bobby. They did a great job just being physical
with him and making it tough around the basket for him.  
  
Q. If somebody told you you would be 2 ‑of‑13 from the three, and the only
two were by Bobby, do you think you would win? And how big were the two by
Bobby?  
JORDAN SILBERT: They were huge. Bobby came out and played great today. He had
great intensity, great confidence. It's a team thing and Bobby is a part of
this team and he does a great job whenever he gets out there and we needed
those and he stepped up big.  
  
Q. Poor shooting night for both teams; how do you manage the game, what you
can control personally as a coach, tell the guys?  
COACH ARCHIE MILLER: I mean, offense isn't going to be there at times in the
postseason. I thought today's game was going to be one where the players won
the game because there just wasn't any easy baskets. There wasn't anything
easy around the paint on both ends. There were some bunnies that were missed
on both ends.  
We just stayed with what we do. Part of it is we know we have won games a lot
of different ways this season. Some of them we shot really well and offense
just clicked. Some of it's just been we have grinded it out and found a way to
just be there at the end and make a few winning plays, like tonight or last
night, or a few games back when we had a big road win at VCU.  
You have to win different ways and I think we are built to win different ways
because of our versatility. But I'm happy just in general, defensively we were
able to play 40 minutes the way we want to play, hard, and our defense was
able to give us a chance. Part of their turnovers probably had a little bit to
do with our defense.  
But we didn't do everything perfect. I mean, right now, we have really lost
our three‑point defense, in particular, the two games here in Brooklyn we have
really got dialed up. VCU is shooting the ball really well right now. So we
have got some things to work on and think about.  
  
Q. Second half, did you change anything defensively to ramp things up?  
COACH ARCHIE MILLER: Pressure was up a little bit. We just felt like they were
moving the ball way too easy. Where they caught the ball was way too easy. Our
ball screen coverages had to be mixed up in the game. You know, I thought we
flew around. That's what we have to do.  
I mean, if you look at the games we have been successful, when they are
dogfights or they are really good teams, part of it is you just look at the
steal column. Last night was ten steals. Tonight was 11 steals.  
Some of our biggest wins, our activity off the ball, deflecting balls,
two‑on‑ones, three‑on‑twos; that's how we have to play being at our size. That
probably saved us as much as anything was the points off the turnovers.  
  
Q. Dyshawn struggled for a large part of the game, but all of the sudden he
was possessed there in the second half. Did you say anything to get his
spirits up?  
COACH ARCHIE MILLER: For the first time in a long time, I think you saw the
scowl on his face that you're normally accustomed to seeing when he really
wants to put his head down or he really wants to make something happen.  
Our last game and a half, in particular, our last game and a half, he sort of
let the action kind of take him out of the game. The game is physical right
now. They are not letting him do what he wants to do and he's missing some
short shots.  
But I thought at about the nine‑minute mark, when things really started to get
physical, he really raised up. He had a couple great moves, he had a couple
great finishes. And the fact that he finished with 10‑9, that's a heck of an
effort for him because he was really battling through it. He is who he is.
He's one of those guys that can really get going in a big way and we need him
to.  
  
Q. Martin led the league in field ‑goal percentage. What did you guys do to
contain Martin and not let him get those easy buckets?  
COACH ARCHIE MILLER: First of all, I thought he missed a couple that he
normally makes. Normally he smashes through the rim or he knocks them in. He
didn't make a couple that he normally makes. I don't think we had a lot to do
with it. But.  
The big thing was there was a lot of contact around the basket, whether he had
it around the basket or we had it around the basket. I just thought there was
enough physicality they were going to let us play; that you're going to have
to make them; you're going to have to hard earn them.  
He made a couple. But I thought, No.1, keeping it out of there, not giving him
the normal looks, the normal catches that he got. I don't think he got a ton
of just great catches. When he did, we challenged things at the basket.  
In general like all guys, you play two games in two days, every once in
awhile, you lose your legs. I could say the same about Kendall tonight.
Kendall wasn't anywhere near the finisher tonight that he was yesterday.  
  
Q. This is your first time to the championship game as a head coach. Back in
2002 you had a really nice run ‑‑  
COACH ARCHIE MILLER: We had a great run. We lost by about 50 (laughter). It
was an awesome run though.  
  
Q. Do you use that experience as a teachable moment to kind of try and
explain to these kids ‑‑  
COACH ARCHIE MILLER: What we talk about this time of year is advancing. We
have some seniors on our team, at least one in Jordan and guys who were part
of our run last year, know how special it is to stick around every time you
get a win. Whether you can stick around in your conference tournament or the
next one, it's the greatest feeling in the world, going back to that hotel and
watching other games and knowing you're still alive to play.  
That's the thing we try to talk about the most: This is advance time of the
year. To be playing for a championship about 12 or 13 days ago, and really not
getting the job done, I'm happy for them that they have another opportunity
tomorrow. But tomorrow is not going to be very easy, either.  
  
Q. You mentioned about VCU shooting very well. How do you see your guys
matching up with them and what will be the key to beating them?  
COACH ARCHIE MILLER: I think any time you play VCU, first thing is take care
of the ball. You have to take care of the ball, and that sort of can at least
help you a little bit in defending the easy looks.  
Then, you have to defend. You've got to guard. You've got to guard the line.
You've got to guard the ball. You've got to be able to protect the paint, and
if they are going to make threes, you just want to make sure that they are the
ones that you challenge. I thought in the first game, they probably missed
some ones that they are making right now. But we'll have a very difficult prep
to play them.  
Shaka does a great job. Watching those guys finish through the games that they
finish in this tournament in general, just shows the culture that they have.
This will be a heck of a matchup. I'm excited for our guys to be on the floor
with those guys tomorrow.  
  
Q. Taking away Bobby's two threes ‑‑ talk about Bobby coming off the bench.
  
COACH ARCHIE MILLER: Bobby did a great job. He was very aggressive. I know the
first one banked in, but he was open. He took it. That's what you like to see.
The second one was a side pop where he banged one from the corner which is
good. I think Jordan dumped one off to him; he had eight points.  
The big thing is when Bobby is able to play 20 minutes and get four rebounds
and he's able to hold serve while Kendall or Dyshawn is in foul trouble, he's
done that a number of times for us. And told him in the elevator, sort of
either last night or this morning, these guys, we are not going 160 minutes
with five guys. You have to be ready to go when you get in there, and I
thought he did‑‑ right when we asked him.  
Darrell, as well. Darrell is a freshman, playing in some big, big games. Some
freshmen are not playing at all right now. To have those guys being able to
contribute to another great run has been good. Every one of them has
contributed. We played 32 games. We have won 25 times and it's been a team
approach.

# [ATLANTIC-10 CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=ATLANTIC-10+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 14, 2015

  

### [Tyler Kalinoski](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28593)

### [Bob McKillop](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18277)

### [Brian Sullivan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28629)

  
_BROOKLYN, NEW YORK_  
  

VCU  93  
DAVIDSON - 73

  
COACH McKILLOP: I think it was Lou Holtz that said, nothing is as good as it
seems and nothing is as bad as it seems; the exuberance of the locker room 24
hours ago versus the sadness in the locker loom today, quite a contrast.  
Despite it all, congratulations to VCU, and I couldn't be more proud of the
magnificent Atlantic 10 that Davidson College and these guys, these leaders,
have had for us.  
  
Q. Brian, what was the main difference today than it was nine days ago at
Davidson?  
BRIAN SULLIVAN: I think at home, we did a better job dictating tempo of the
game. We didn't surrender control for really any stretch of that game. And I
think here, we let that happen. We let their defensive pressure dictate our
offensive flow. And I think that's really the biggest difference.  
  
Q. Tyler, talk about the pace of the game, how it maybe wore you guys out or
the confidence and stuff.  
TYLER KALINOSKI: You know, when they went on their run in the first half, the
main thing why they went on that run is we didn't get stops. They made
baskets, their full court press, it kind of pressures us and we took some bad
shots offensively, which led to them getting good shots. I mean, we knew it
was going to be an up‑and‑down game. We knew it was going to be a street
fight. We knew they were going to make a run. We knew we were going to make a
run.  
  
Q. How difficult is it when they are scoring and defense ‑‑  
TYLER KALINOSKI: Yeah, they did a great job pressuring the ball, speeding
teams up. Like Brian said, I thought when we played them at home, we did a
great job of handling that pressure, slowing down, taking good shots.  
And especially in the first half when they went on that run, they kind of sped
us up. We were taking some bad shots which led to them running out and getting
some open looks and then they knocked them down.  
  
Q. When you cut it to five in the second half, what were you thinking? 16 ‑0
run to keep it going, how tough is it?   
BRIAN SULLIVAN: With these guys, it's not that tough, with Tyler and Ali being
our seniors and just seeing the way that they fight every day.  
I mean, I'm 21 playing college basketball. It's not that tough. Just bring
energy the whole time. At that point, had a lot of confidence, because we've
had a couple pretty impressive comeback wins and I thought here we go, we're
going to get another one. But credit to them. They held us off.  
  
Q. Now that this is over, you've got another big tournament looming for you.
Talk about why you think you deserve a berth in the NCAA Tournament.  
TYLER KALINOSKI: I think we have shown that we can play in a great league like
the Atlantic 10. We can compete. We played in North Carolina, Virginia, we
competed against them. Just the way we play, how we fight every game, no
matter what the score is; we always believe we have a chance to win, and just
how we ended up in the Atlantic 10 and how we finished there, I think we
definitely should.  
BRIAN SULLIVAN: I think he said it all. I don't really know how it all works,
but I think over the course of the season, we definitely showed we're one of
the Top 64, or however many at‑large bid teams, in the country.  
  
Q. What were you thinking when you were making this comeback in the second
half again and got it down to five, and why were you not able to come all the
way back?  
COACH McKILLOP: We mixed up defenses. We made shots. We got stops. And Treveon
Graham hit a three from the right guard spot, the right alley spot, and I
think it was Jonathan Williams made a drive through the crack of the zone and
made a runner from the foul line. I think those two shots kind of got them
feeling a little bit more confident and it loosened our zone up.  
Again, we have to take the ball out of the net, grab it in off the backboard.
That disrupts your flow and your rhythm and that's what happened when they are
running the first half. We didn't get stops.  
The reason we didn't get stops I think was because our quick decisions with
shooting the ball was not the way it was a week ago, two weeks ago. We let
them dictate in the game of decisions.  
And it is a game of decisions, not mistakes, and we made some quick decisions
in that eight‑minute period, and as a result, they got out running; and there
was nothing we could do to defend them in transition, and many of their shots
occurred in transition.  
  
Q. Talk about the grueling nature of this game. There was 25 fouls called
against each team, 31 fouls in the second half and it was really hard to get
any pace going.  
COACH McKILLOP: That clearly is one of the handicaps against us is we need
rhythm and flow. And I think it's a game of flow, whether it's Davidson
playing or the Virginia Commonwealth playing. It disrupted us and we got no
feel for it, no rhythm.  
  
Q. Down 55 to 33, you take Gibbs out at that point and replace him with a
combo of Oscar and Andrew. Was there anything that your research numbers
showed you that these two would give you a better opportunity?  
COACH McKILLOP: I'm more into guts than analytics (chuckles). And my gut was
that Jack was trying to hit home runs and we needed singles at that point. We
were trying to eat an elephant in one bite and we need to do it bite by bite.  
  
Q. Coming from a conference where you had a strangle hold on teams in
tournament play, what's it like coming to the A ‑10 and competing at such a
high level, and how does that help you develop your players even further?   
COACH McKILLOP: Well, the first thing is, you're on a stage that's incredible.
This is a Broadway stage. The direction of leadership, the administration of
this conference is extraordinary. Bernadette McGlade is a superstar.  
It all filters down from her. And you feel like you are in a majestic theatre
on Broadway. I mean, that's the way we feel. I think that elevates your
energy. It inspires you, tests you. It gives your players an experience that
they will remember forever. This will be a cherished experience for our entire
roster, our managers, our coaches. It's a joyful experience to be part of
this.  
  
Q. After that, I feel like this is kind of mundane. Your thoughts on Alie
‑Cox's game and what Treveon Graham gives VCU every game?   
COACH McKILLOP: Of course I know Treveon because I coached him on USA
Basketball university games. He started for us. He was our best player, and
there were some first‑round picks in that game. I have the utmost respect and
Treveon and I have a great relationship, and he played like I knew he would
play. He's a great player, and he made all the big plays when they had to be
made.  
Mo Alie‑Cox, I mean, what he did from the standpoint of offensive rebounding
and making foul shots today, that broke our back.  
  
Q. Now that you can think about it, do you think you all belong in the NCAA
Tournament? What's your mind ‑set?   
COACH McKILLOP: Well, my mind‑set right now is we are the winners of the
Atlantic 10 Conference. We have a body of work that's pretty impressive.  
It's not the tenth‑ranked conference, it's not the ninth‑ranked conference, I
think it's the seventh‑ranked conference in the country: You win that for the
duration of the season; you play pretty darned good basketball as you close
ought the season to win 10 of your last 11.  
Yes, we did lose to Carolina and Virginia, but I think our Virginia game got
people's attention. I think clearly with 24 wins, a conference championship
and getting to the semis in the conference tournament, I think that's a pretty
good statement about where we belong.  
  
Q. You're in a position you've never been in, just in terms of with
Davidson, it was auto bid. In the past few weeks, as you were building out the
resumé, did you ever kind of discuss the importance of just racking up the
wins, given the opportunities you missed in the non ‑conference‑‑  
COACH McKILLOP: You're exactly right, and as David and Scott know, I
discipline myself not to think about that, but I would be lying if I said, I
don't see it on the periphery. I really try to compartmentalize and see
totally what's in front of us.  
A year ago at this point, we lost in the semifinals to Western Carolina. We
had a magnificent season and went to the NIT. There's no heartbreak of a
feeling than that. This Atlantic 10 has given us like a new birth. That's I
think one of the reasons why we're in the Atlantic 10.  
  
Q. Piggybacking off of all of that, preseason what were your expectations
going to a higher ‑level league?   
COACH McKILLOP: Well, I always have this expectation: We will have the
beautiful team that plays the beautiful game and has a beautiful season. We
have fallen far short from that. But Browning said it best: "A man's reach
should exceed his grasp, or what's a heaven for." We are always reaching for
heaven.

_BROOKLYN, NEW YORK_  
  

DAYTON  56  
RHODE ISLAND - 52

  
COACH DAN HURLEY: Tough loss obviously. Obviously lost a little bit with
inexperience, 21 turnovers, giving away that many possessions obviously hurt.
And you've got to give them credit. Obviously for us, knowing with their
limited roster, scholarship players, playing seven guys, our game plan was
obviously to try to attack the paint as much as possible. I think we have 55
paint touches in the game.  
You know, they showed tremendous‑‑ I guess they showed tremendous discipline.
We commit 11 fouls and so they did a great job defensively of not fouling us
with that limited roster.  
It was a tough loss. We obviously had chances. Up in the second half, under
eight minutes. It was a tough loss but obviously thrilled with the season
we've had to this point. Felt like we were right there.  
  
Q. What can you say about your three years here?  
GILVYDAS BIRUTA: I enjoyed my time, especially playing for Coach Hurley; to be
part of this program that is rebuilding and just to see how far we've come
since the day I came on campus.  
  
Q. You had five points in a row yourself ‑‑ what happened in that stretch
from the 13‑minute mark to the three‑minute mark in the receive half?   
E.C. MATTHEWS: I would say turnovers, too many outside shots. A lot came into
play. WE went cold for a little bit, but I would say ‑‑ too many outside shots
and needed to attack the paint more, got everybody else involved.  
  
Q. You guys obviously are a young team. What can you take from this game
toward next season?  
E.C. MATTHEWS: Just motivation. We wanted it really bad, so it hurt, hurts
real bad. So just carry over to the summer and to next season and we'll get
better and be more experienced and have a better season next year.  
  
Q. The way that they were able to score last time when you were out at
Dayton, this was a very different game and obviously you defended them much
better. Is this the type of game you guys felt you needed to play to beat
them?  
GILVYDAS BIRUTA: I don't know, I'm just following the plan. (Laughter).  
COACH DAN HURLEY: I don't know whether to laugh or cry. Not giving one‑word
answers so that was good I guess. (Laughter).  
  
Q. Coach says you can chalk up the loss to youthfulness, what can you guys
do going forward with experience or what do you make of this?  
E.C. MATTHEWS: We start the two freshmen, two sophomores. We are a young team
and I think we have better days ahead of us and we can only get better. You
know, just lack of experience.  
  
Q. If Gil declined to answer it, I would ask you the same. Was this the type
of game that you felt you needed to play to potentially beat them?  
COACH DAN HURLEY: I felt like it was going to be a similar game to the game
that we played obviously last night. This was a really physical game. It was a
really physical, tough, defensive struggle. The difference in the game was
obviously I think their maturity, their maturity and our immaturity. We turned
the ball over I think by the first media time‑out like five times, and we just
got‑‑ we kind of‑‑ it was such a big spot for us.  
I think our guys felt like coming into the game that if we got the game, that
we would have a chance to get in the Tournament with the win. You know, we've
been discredited for not having the Top‑50 win, even though we have
consistently from the beginning of the year had a consistently great year,
Top‑10 in the country and defensive efficiency; longest losing streak of the
year was two games and that happened once, and we won, and we're 13‑5 in a
great basketball conference, one of the top six or seven in the country.  
So I think all of those things at play: The crowd, the atmosphere, semifinals,
I think it just got a little big for us today. Our guys, in particular, our
guards, just tried to do a little too much. They didn't share. They weren't
being selfish, because we don't have selfish kids; we've got winners and tough
kids that want to be successful. I just think we tried to do a little too much
on our own and it hurt us.  
  
Q. What's the big picture perspective on a tough loss, obviously, but going
forward? What's the perspective on it?  
COACH DAN HURLEY: It was a tough loss. We're obviously disappointed. Felt like
obviously could have won that game. We feel like big picture, you take our VCU
game, take our Davidson game, take our Dayton game here on a neutral court; a
Jack Gibbs three basically beats us at the buzzer; relinquished a lead that we
had for 36 minutes against VCU with Weber at home, and they were able to beat
us at a real close game.  
And obviously here, it was a toss‑up game from beginning to end. We probably
looked like two teams that could compete on the same level. So bottom line for
us is we are very close to the top of the league.  
  
Q. Stopped (ph) your most efficient player offensively, and today 2 for 7
and some easy missed shots ‑‑ was it the legs today or was it anything
physical or what did you see?   
COACH DAN HURLEY: They were definitely being physical with him. He got fouled
a couple times and they just didn't call it. I think he's tired. We asked him
to do a lot. We've asked him to do a lot at both ends of the court. He plays
hard minutes, you know. Some guys just play 35 minutes; he plays hard minutes,
that kid. And your heart breaks for him, because for me, he's first time all
conference player this year, and the last two days, he just didn't have any
pop in his legs, and your heart breaks for him.  
  
Q. A lot of people didn't expect you to be in the semifinals, so what do you
think this has to say about the way the team has progressed this season being
so young?  
COACH DAN HURLEY: It's great for our program. It's great for our program. It's
great for our kids. It's great for our fan base. Moving forward, this is where
we expect to be, playing in these championship rounds.  
  
Q. How big will it be for the remodeling of your program to get an
invitation to the NIT?  
COACH DAN HURLEY: Yeah, you know, if that's where we end up landing, then
we'll be thrilled with that. Obviously going into the year, so many young
players, if you had told me we'd be 22‑9, you know, I'd be pinching myself.
But then you get a little greedy because ‑‑ we excel. The hardest games to win
during the course of the year are conference games in a good conference, and
ours is a really good one.  
So to go 13‑5 in our league, it almost ‑‑ we'll be thrilled with whatever
postseason tournament we're in.  
  
Q. You were able to play here last year and admitted it was a very different
mind ‑set when you came here last year and this year you came here to win and
you were able to win a game. How significant a step?  
COACH DAN HURLEY: It's just a big step. Last year you could probably have
counted the amount of fans we had here on your hands and your feet. And this
year, to come out and see all that blue out here, and to have these great
young players, and the guys we have coming in, we're just getting started.

_BROOKLYN, NEW YORK_  
  

VCU  93  
DAVIDSON - 73

  
Q. Treveon, Davidson is a great three ‑point shooting team and you held them
to 26 percent today; how did you guys do that?  
TREVEON GRAHAM: We just wanted to run them off the three‑pointer. We knew they
needed threes, that they like to shoot a lot of threes. So we tried to run
them off as many threes as they can. In the second half they started to make a
lot of threes and we just wanted to get back to what we were doing in the
first half, running them off threes.  
  
Q. They gave you a few zone looks in the second half. Jonathan gets into the
zone with a dribble. How important was that for breaking it down?  
TREVEON GRAHAM: It was real important. We worked on that a lot in practice,
him getting into the lane and making a play so they can't really affect when
he was in the game, come through the zone and make the right play.  
  
Q. You had to come back early in the first half and then hold off their
comeback in the second half. Do you feel like you absorbed two body blows and
handled them well?  
MO ALIE‑COX: That's what we work on every day. We have a drill in practice
called poise or panic, and it pretty much gets us ready for game situations
like that when we go down, how we are going to respond and come back. That's
something Coach always preaches to us is response, ability to focus on the
next more important thing and that's what we did today.  
TREVEON GRAHAM: Not really, I mean, what mostly we always work on, so it's
nothing new to us when that happens.  
  
Q. Very different game. Nine days ago. How much of an inspiration was that
result from today? You had plenty of incentive anyway, but did that also give
you some incentive?  
TREVEON GRAHAM: Yeah, it did. It was humiliated when we were down there. So we
just wanted to come out and play our game. When we played at Davidson, we
wasn't playing our game, it was impressive, stayed down pretty much. So wanted
to come out here and really just attack from the get‑go.  
  
Q. You had your ups and downs since Briante went out. Do you feel like you
fully adjusted without him?  
TREVEON GRAHAM: I think we adjusted to what we have. Nobody's going to take
the place of Briante. So we just have to use what we have. Johnny and JeQuan
really has been coming through at the point guard position. So we are trying
let them become better point guards.  
MO ALIE‑COX: Yeah, just going on what Tre said, Coach said we needed to do
three things better and we would pretty much be successful, have a little more
talk, energy and enthusiasm and those are things Briante does very well. So he
said if the rest of the team brought a little bit more of that, he said we
would do well, and I think we started to bring a lot of that stuff.  
  
Q. The foul really beat up Davidson down low. How much did you know coming
in you were going to have to be a big factor?  
MO ALIE‑COX: I had the same exact looks against Davidson, last time we played
them, I was 1‑for‑6 from the line and I missed a dunk and two easy layups. I
got the same look today and just made sure I finished. Going along, we saw
Steve Zack get a lot in the paint, also. Coach just told me to go in there and
attack them, they can't guard me. Coach called a lot of plays for me to start
the game.  
  
Q. Talk about the pace of the game. There was one point where they started,
they were on a 16 ‑4 run and you were on a 40‑12 run and they went on a 16‑0
run and then in the second half after that last run, there was like 31 fouls
called so it was hard to get a pace going. Talk about how that affected the
attitude of the game.   
MO ALIE‑COX: We just tried to stay focused. Coach, he had us in huddle, I
think they had cut it to 12‑‑ media time‑out, he said, we're good, we're good,
just focus on the next thing and control what you can control, and we just
tried to go back into attacking mind‑set because it kind of went zone and
threw us off a little bit and Johnny made plays.  
  
Q. Tre said yesterday you were in the process of getting back to who you
are. Looked like today you were back to where you are. Y'all were playing at
your pace and your style.  
TREVEON GRAHAM: We played with a lot of enthusiasm today. We wanted to go out
there and attack from the get‑go like I said earlier. We had our ups and downs
and we responded pretty well today and we're going to have to do that the rest
of the season.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the locker room, after the Davidson loss, what was
said and what needed to be said?  
MO ALIE‑COX: Five people sat heads down ‑‑ JeQuan was the main person talking.
He started telling us: Don't keep our heads down. The season is not over. Just
focus on the A‑10 Tournament. That's all we can focus on coming up. We
couldn't control our destiny anymore. So we just focused our attention to this
tournament coming up, and we've been doing pretty well.  
  
Q. Can you first talk about what Mo did today and what you've seen in him
coming in these last few weeks? And there was a spot, like 5:41, they were in
a zone, you really wanted the ball, you called for it, called for it, finally
got it, you shot it and you made it. Did you feel like you needed to score at
that point or just needed to score the rest of the way?  
TREVEON GRAHAM: About Mo, we want to be aggressive no matter what. When he
gets in the paint, I don't think nobody in the country can stop him if he uses
all his muscles and strength, and that's what he did today. And that shot
right there, I felt like I was open; and if I'm open, I'm confident I can make
the shot. Didn't have to be me that had to score. We just had to score at that
moment.  
  
Q. VCU is in the final for the third great year. What's the determination
now to finish the job and finally win the title?  
MO ALIE‑COX: Just try to focus on next game. Try to go 1‑0\. The past couple
years, we've been playing so tight, just wanting to win real badly. This year
we just play VCU way, ACO (ph) and I think we should do well.  
  
Q. Your senior year you make it to the championship game again. Has it hit
you yet? How do you feel?  
TREVEON GRAHAM: Coach and teammates have been helping me a lot with my senior
year. Just seems like a couple days ago that they were saying that the rest of
the season was for the seniors, so they really helped me get through the rest
of the season, just attacking and everybody believing.  
COACH SMART: It was a great game. I thought obviously the final score really
doesn't illustrate how competitive the game was and how hotly contested it
was. Davidson is obviously a terrific team, as evidenced by the way that they
beat us nine days ago.  
I do want to say that, I think what they did in the Atlantic 10 regular season
is historic and truly amazing. Somebody asked me a week or two ago if I was
surprised, and I said no, because I know how successful Coach McKillop and his
teams have been.  
But we researched it; when we came to the Atlantic 10 a few years ago, nobody
has really ever done what they have done in terms of going from a conference
ranked in the 20s in the RPI to a top seven or eight league in the country and
in the first season, won it.  
What's really impressive is nobody has really talked about lately, they did it
without Jack Gibbs for, I don't know, six or eight games. Take my hat off to
them and says a lot about our guys that we were able to come out and beat them
today. And now we're excited about moving forward to tomorrow.  
  
Q. You mentioned yesterday that the game against Richmond was a big game for
you confidence ‑wise. Is today's game what you meant by that?  
COACH SMART: You mean the way we played today? Yeah, I think the Richmond game
yesterday really helped us today. Hopefully today's game will help us with
tomorrow.  
But Richmond had beat us two straight games. The second one was really, really
tough one to take because we were up three with seven seconds left, and we
just didn't finish it out.  
So for us to be able to come back when they were out for most of the second
half and beat them, I think that gave our guys a level of belief.  
Bri really has provided a swagger for us for three and a half years, and when
he went out so abruptly, we had to kind of find ourselves again. Not so much
in terms of how we played, but in terms of who we are and our identity.  
So these two games have been big in helping reshape that.  
  
Q. How important was it to have Jonathan get inside that zone off the
dribble?  
COACH SMART: Yeah, it was big. I thought it was a really good adjustment by
Davidson to go zone, and it threw us off for a few possessions. He got a
little stagnant. It's always a tricky situation where when you have a lead,
how aggressive you want to be, because you certainly don't necessarily want to
shoot in the first five, ten seconds of the shot clock. But at the same time,
you want to be aggressive.  
Johnny I thought overall gave us a huge, huge lift. JeQuan was in foul
trouble, so Johnny came in and played big minutes. The most impressive thing
he did, actually, was on the defensive end. He didn't play perfect but he
really defended their guys, for him, really, really well. He's had issues with
alertness in the past and staying aware and ready. Today was a good game for
him in that respect. And then the way that he went to the foul line and made
free throws was huge.  
  
Q. Nine days ago you got down early and weren't able to respond. Today you
were down 16 ‑4 and answered with a 40‑12 run. Talk about what was different
this time around.   
COACH SMART: Well, I think our guys have more of a steely resolve to keep
playing and keep fighting.  
The game also wasn't in their arena. That game down there, it reminded me‑‑
their crowd, their team, their energy, reminded me of some games that we've
had later in year where you can just feel it and there's not much the other
team can do.  
So this one obviously was on a neutral site. And I want to say thank you and
how appreciative I am to our fans for coming up here, and hopefully they can
be just as loud if not louder tomorrow.  
  
Q. How would you rate Mo's performance today?  
COACH SMART: I thought Mo was terrific. Mo's had a great year. You know, he
came into our program as a guy that we knew could be really good. But we knew
the biggest step for him was just confidence in himself and assertiveness, and
he's grown in leaps and bounds in those two areas.  
He still doesn't think he's as good as I think he is, but today was a big step
in that direction. This was‑‑ I think his career‑high was coming in today was
12 points. He's just been solid and really good all year long, but this was
from a scoring standpoint a breakout performance.  
The way La Salle was able to score inside against Davidson, I told our guys,
we have to go into Mo and at least really, really try to pound it in there.
Not only did it help us put some points on the board, but it kept Aldridge in
foul trouble, and he's a really good player, so it limited his minutes.  
  
Q. What would you say the biggest difference is between the game nine days
ago and today?  
COACH SMART: I think we played with better energy. We defended their motion
much better. Certainly we were far from perfect. But Davidson is a team, if
you're just a half step off, defending their motion, they make you pay and
they make you look really, really bad. And they did that to us nine days ago.
They cut us up with lay‑ups and slips and wide open threes, and Sullivan is
catching and eyeing us down and banging threes and smiling. They were on a
roll. They got going early today. I thought the way our guys gritted their
teeth and said we can be better was big, and we were able to get more stops.  
  
Q. There was a point, 5:41 left in the game, Davidson is in the zone,
Treveon was calling for the ball, calling for the ball, got it, made it. Is
that what you expect from your seniors in that situation?  
COACH SMART: Yeah, I was actually screaming for them to throw him the ball,
too. Because the way they were playing that zone, they would get a little bit
distorted and if we could just make that one more pass to a good shooter, we
could shoot it in. So that was a big, big shot, because I don't know exactly
what the score was at the time, but Davidson certainly was mounting a charge,
and for Tre to step up and make it‑‑ really, all the threes he made today were
back‑breaking shots. You know, that's why he's a really, really good player.  
  
Q. You're right, it wasn't just Treveon making threes. Jordan dropped one in
and seemed like everyone had more confidence today. Was that because Davidson
was really willing to run with you or just you guys coming around?  
COACH SMART: I think seeing the ball go in yesterday a few times was big for
our guys. And the other thing, I know I sound like a broken record, but we got
a lot of high‑quality shots.  
So when you get high‑quality looks from outside, and it's a good shooter,
then, you know, you plan on those things hopefully going in a decent amount of
times. So that was probably why we were able to shoot 50 percent from three.  
  
Q. Now that you've been to the championship game three straight years, which
it will be tomorrow, how do you approach that game, playing with guys who have
been there two straight years and have come out on the losing side?  
COACH SMART: Yeah, I think the only thing that we really focus on as it
relates to the last couple years is learning from maybe what we could have
done differently; not so much basketball‑wise, but with our mental approach.  
I think today was a really, really good lesson for us going into tomorrow. We
had to respond. We got down. We had to stay together. We had to buckle down on
defense. And those are some of the things that maybe the last couple years, we
didn't do as well in a championship game.  
But you know what, we lost to good teams, too. It's not just about your team.
It's the team that you're playing against. But we are not dwelling on those
two years. I'm sure everyone else will, but we're in a moment; we came up here
to try to win four games, and as Tre or Mo said, we just want to go 1‑0 in our
current game and we did that today and that's our goal for tomorrow.

### [Dion Wright](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28607)

  
_BROOKLYN, NEW YORK_  
  
DAYTON  75  
ST. BONAVENTURE - 71  
  
COACH MARK SCHMIDT: It was a great game. Frustrating in how we lost at the end
but I thought, give our guys credit. Going into the game, Dayton had dominated
us two games this year, you know, one at home and one away. They had outscored
us 69‑9 from threes. So going into the game, we knew if we were going to win,
we had to do a better job protecting the three‑point line and we had to do a
better job of attacking them.  
I thought Dion couldn't have played better. Marcus couldn't have played
better. We had guys step up, and it was back and forth. We need to do a better
job in transition defense. We would score; they would come down and attack us.
Dayton is a good team.  
But really proud of our guys. Disappointed in how it ended but I can't
complain. Can't complain about the effort of our team. And it's disappointing,
with Youssou and Chris, and then how it ended. I thinkit hurts, but I think
it's a great learning experience, a great lesson for our young guys that you
really have to execute at this level to win, especially the last two or three
minutes. Dayton I thought did a better job in that area.  
  
Q. You get into a groove like that, starts early; are you thinking at some
point in the game, I just might not miss a shot the entire game?  
DION WRIGHT: My teammates found me in good position and I just caught the ball
wherever I was. I just tried to make it a basket.  
  
Q. Can you take us through the final possession, what you saw out there.  
MARCUS POSLEY: Seeing the gap, thought I could get to the basket.
Unfortunately he got his hand on the ball. Unfortunately it didn't pan out the
way we wanted it to, but proud of the guys. It was a great effort today.  
  
Q. You guys put yourself in position to win the game from start to finish
until the very last second of the game. Not a whole lot of bad you can say
about it all. But just how tough is it that that effort just kind of went
unpaid in the end?  
MARCUS POSLEY: It's definitely tough. Coming into the game, we knew the game
plan like Coach said. We knew we were going to have to shoot the ball a lot
better than we did the first two times we met them and depend the three point
line a lot better.  
I think we had a great team effort tonight, but at the same time, Dion got
hot, that helped us out big. That execution down the stretch was a must.  
Coming into the game, we wanted to do it for the seniors. Unfortunately we
couldn't pull off the win for them, but it was a great year we had for them.  
  
Q. When you are playing that well, you did just about everything single
thing you could do: You shot well, played great d, rebounded well, stayed in
it till the end. What is going through your mind there at the very end. You're
like, you have a chance here, and then to watch it slip away.  
COACH MARK SCHMIDT: Yeah, you try to coach each possession, and you're not
looking at the end result. You just try to figure out what we're going to do
next both offensively and defensively and really don't get caught up in the
moment and looking ahead. You just try to get guys in the best position for
them to be successful.  
You know, it's disappointing‑‑ when it's all said and done, when it's over,
then it's frustrating. It's disappointing. And most disappointing for the
seniors because you know it's the end and how much work they had put in, Chris
for two years and Youssou for four years, and you just build up such great
relationships with them.  
You know how disappointed they are and with all of the hard work that they
have put in.  
  
Q. We know Dayton is a really good defensive team and obviously they gave
you guys troubles in the first two meetings. Today, you really shot over 60
percent the entire game, really good offensively. What was different about
‑‑  
COACH MARK SCHMIDT: We had a bit of mentality, we were attacking. Whenever you
knock down shots, it makes your offense look better. I thought we had shots in
both games against Dayton that we missed. We were I think three‑for‑25 in
those two games, and a number of those shots were open shots that we missed,
and today we knocked down some shots. Dion shoots ten‑for‑11, that really
helps your offense, too.  
But we attacked. We got the ball into the paint and that's what we needed to
do.  
  
Q. Youssou was hobbledthere. What happened there?  
COACH MARK SCHMIDT: Yeah, supposedly he got hit knee‑on‑knee I guess, and he
had been bothered all through the year with his knees. So, yeah, but that's
part of the game and he came back.  
Yeah, it loosened up I guess, but yeah, he was blocking shots and doing what
we needed him to do.  
  
Q. We mentioned Dion, but just another thought on what he was able to do
today. He was 1 ‑for‑8 from three coming into the season, and then to get four
out of five today.   
COACH MARK SCHMIDT: Sometimes when you start shooting the ball and a couple go
in, the basket looks a little bit bigger, when you have this confidence and he
played extremely well, and hopefully that can carry over to next year.  
But he's had a tremendous three years, and he's one of the most improved
players I think in the country. He's going to be a big part of our team next
year.  
  
Q. Obviously it's a tough way to end but such a great effort in this one,
and again, to close the season, 18 wins, certainly exceeding expectations
again from the outside, again this year. Just cycling through Twitter on my
way in, just a lot of congratulatory stuff. What can you say about having kind
of done that again with this group this year?  
COACH MARK SCHMIDT: Like I said, I haven't won a game, I haven't won a game in
30 years. Players win games, and I thought our guys really responded when Jay
went down. I thought it really showed the character of our players to be able
to handle such a big loss the way we did. Took a couple games to readjust but
I thought our guys really were unselfish; changed positions, learned new
positions, won five of the last seven games. So really proud of them.  
You never know going into the season what type of team you have. But I always
believe that from a coaching standpoint, you want your team to improve from
the very beginning to the end, and I think we did, and that's a credit to our
guys and my assistant coaches working with them daily; being able to go from
an unfinished product to what you saw today.  
  
Q. Will you consider any of the small postseason tournaments?  
COACH MARK SCHMIDT: Yeah, I'd love to play more. I think it would be great for
our seniors. I think they deserve it. Win 18 games and to go 11‑9 in this
league goes a long way, and I think they deserve it and hopefully we can.

_BROOKLYN, NEW YORK_  
  

DAYTON  75  
ST. BONAVENTURE - 71

  
COACH ARCHIE MILLER: Great game. Really hard‑fought game. Thought St.
Bonaventure really did a great job, and playing them already twice this
season, for the third time, they were really ready. Made some adjustments and
they were sharp. Kept us on our heels. Our defense really had our work cut out
for us most of the night.  
But we found ways. We had ten steals in the game. Guys stepped up and made
some big plays; in particular, I think these two guys made some of the biggest
plays down the stretch for us. But all in all, it's a great team effort for
us. We are very fortunate and happy to win the game.  
  
Q. Career ‑high 26 today; is there a feeling they didn't see you as much and
you wanted to show them what you had?   
KENDALL POLLARD: I just wanted to go out and be aggressive. Last game I
suffered a concussion, so didn't really play too much.  
  
Q. Can both of you talk about the final play by St. Bonaventure, what you
saw and how you defended it?  
JORDAN SILBERT: We just wanted to try to get the ball out of Posley's hands.
He did a great job all game and we wanted to try to key in on him. Credit to
Kendall who did a great job of getting into the passing lane and getting that
steal.  
KENDALL POLLARD: Just tried not to foul. Just played good defense and just
came up with a big play.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about those free throws at the end of the game? Same
thing as VCU.  
JORDAN SILBERT: Just looking at my teammates, just telling me, you know, just
shoot the shot, telling me that we need them. I think I missed two; I don't
really remember. Just my teammates and my coaches just giving me the
confidence to go out there and shoot and embrace the moment and step up to
make shots.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little about Kendall, just the way hecarried you guys
early in the game?  
JORDAN SILBERT: Kendall did a great job of being aggressive. I think they did
a great job of pressuring us and making the game tough, and he handled their
aggressiveness extremely well. He led us today and we just tried to piggyback
off his energy and it was great for us.  
  
Q. Can you take us through that go ‑ahead three that you had? Seemed like
you were a little quiet down the stretch but then in that big moment, seeing
your shots.   
JORDAN SILBERT: I don't really know exactly what the play was that we called,
but I know Kendall, he had a great drive through the lane and he kind of went
in the air and I was just trying to get to an open area. I think he and Kyle
were open, but Kendall did a great job of finding me.  
It was just a shot that I shoot all the time. My coaches always tell me, if
you're open, shoot the shot. And they believe in me; my teammates believe in
me. So when I had that opportunity, it was a normal shot, and it was great to
have my team uplifted by it.  
  
Q. What was it like going against a big guy in there? You really had to work
for your points.  
KENDALL POLLARD: It was challenging. Just tried to use my quickness and
aggressiveness to get around him and make tough shots.  
  
Q. You had a lot of close games in March last year; with a lot of new guys,
does that help you in a situation like this?  
COACH ARCHIE MILLER: There's not really that many new guys. The heartbeat of
the team are the five returning guys. That's the pulse; that's sort of the
core, and that core played in a lot of big games together all year.  
They have done it through March and they did it all year long this year. They
have logged a ton of minutes and played a lot of games together, and they have
been in some tough spots.  
I think every game at this time of year sort of feels like this. And they have
expected that. I don't think there's anything easy.  
So we have been in the moment. I think Darrell did a great job tonight; young
guy, first conference tournament game, was able to play 15 minutes. He banged
two threes. And Bobby, in his six minutes, was able to get us a bucket, as
well, and sort of hold serve.  
We'll see how we do moving forward. We need those two guys to sort of help us
a little bit more, but we are not going to get shaken up a whole lot.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about how difficult it is in general to beat a team
three times in a season?  
COACH ARCHIE MILLER: We didn't talk about it. I think when you talk about
things, it starts to get in people's minds, and it's like games, we never
discussed it. I think the one thing about beating a team twice in a regular
season, in my opinion, you can do it again, because you've already done it
twice. So that's the way we looked at it.  
But we didn't really talk a whole lot about it. We were very nervous about the
game. I think St. Bonaventure is coached by one of the more underrated coaches
in all of college basketball. Coach Schmidt does a phenomenal job; he always
has.  
Those guys were spaced well today. They shot the ball extremely well. Dion
Wright, in particular, from three, that threw a monkey wrench into what we
were doing. He hadn't done that coming int. And this is the first time that
Marcus Posley had really gotten off on us all season.  
So we got to see the best of those two guys, and they were a very, very strong
one, two punch and Cumberbatch really improved, as well. He was able to make
some big shots tonight and he had played well coming into the tournament.  
I feel bad for St. Bonaventure because in my opinion all freshmen point
guards, one of the best point guards we've seen in the league for a while as a
freshman wasn't able to finish the season for them. When he comes back next
year, they are going to have a nice backcourt with him and Marcus.  
  
Q. Only eight turnovers.  
COACH ARCHIE MILLER: Last Saturday, we were uncharacteristically beat
ourselves in a lot of areas at La Salle and I think as people watched La Salle
today, you can see. Why they are very tough to score on. But we turned the
ball over way too much. We had not been turning it over leading into the game.
That was a big part of not giving the game away today.  
And Scooch was great. He played like a true point guard. His pace up and down
the floor was terrific. He got a couple big free throws on pushes. Just in
general, he played really well I thought.  
The key for him is going to be his recovery. I don't necessarily know if he's
going to be able to do 37 more minutes the way he did it tonight.  
  
Q. The teams that had played the day before against teams that had not ‑‑
seemed like they had a little bit more jump. There were some great games that
maybe you wouldn't expect. Do you think that had any impact at all?  
COACH ARCHIE MILLER: Absolutely. I love playing and getting a win, because you
feel so good about being able to advance and stay overnight, and you get
another day to prepare. To me, it's the best feeling in college basketball is
this time of year when you're able to win and stay. You don't want to win and
go home.  
I really believe that maybe that doesn't work out well for you in four games
in four days, maybe five in five days. But that first win can really give you
some confidence. Looking at the teams that have been playing and won a game,
they are accustomed to getting out on this floor; they played on it last
night, and I think that's an advantage.  
I also think the team that earned the double bye or got a bye, they have an
advantage, too. You have to be willing to take that first punch from a team
that's already gotten on that floor and sweated a little bit.  
  
Q. Obviously you'd like to win by ten or 15 and breathe a little easier but
to win in this way how much does that help in a survive and advances
tournament?  
COACH ARCHIE MILLER: I'll win by one. 1‑0, you give me 1‑0, I'll take it. They
feel all the same. You're not going down and breaking down film. You're not
getting down on performances this time of year. It's so hard to get a win.
There's so much at stake for so many people, players and coaches, and I think
this venue is terrific. Our guys were very excited to play here, and they will
be very excited to play another one here.  
I mean, we're in the semifinals, Saturday semifinal. Couldn't ask for anything
better right now.  
  
Q. Did you get hit by some beer as you left the court?  
COACH ARCHIE MILLER: Something came out of the stands. Not sure what it was,
but it hit right in front of us or on some players on the way out, and I think
it was addressed in a quick manner.  
  
Q. You talked about Pollard's play tonight, the way he gave you energy and
grit, especially at the start of the game.  
COACH ARCHIE MILLER: I've been saying it for a long time, and he was voted the
most improved player in the league, which I'm very proud of for him. He's very
proud of it. But I also think he's one of the best players in this conference.
He's been an ironman for us. He plays inside; he plays out. He goes against
guys like Enduewa (ph) and he just competes.  
He's a soft‑spoken kid but he's very competitive. He loves to win. He's been a
part of a lot of winning before he got to us, and he's a big reason why we've
been able to win so many games since he's gotten here. But he's got a lot of
room to keep growing, but tonight, I mean he put us on his back. He was a
true‑‑ he was a warrior tonight.

## March 13, 2015

  

### [Melvin Johnson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21984)

### [JeQuan Lewis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28596)

### [Shaka Smart](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21504)

  
_BROOKLYN, NEW YORK_  
  

VCU  70  
RICHMOND - 67

  
COACH SMART: That was another great basketball game between VCU and Richmond.
I think these games are obviously really exciting for the fans and everyone
that watches. But that win was really big for us because we've had some close
games that we have not been able to finish and pull out. So to be able to win
a close game means a lot. I'm really happy for our guys and for our fans
because I know how much they wanted to win this game.  
  
Q. Down the stretch, the last seven or eight minutes, you were trailing and
looked like the guards got you moving and into the paint. How did you see the
comeback?  
MELVIN JOHNSON: Honestly many they were up 45‑48 there was slight down but at
the same time, a little bit of confidence. Coach said, you just have to fight.
JeQuan hit a big shot, numbed the pain a little bit, and from that point on,
we were able to get to the line, and Coach brought some great plays and to get
the ball in our best player's hands, and Tre delivered down the stretch.  
  
Q. Talk about the play of Mo late in the game, he had five offensive
rebounds, especially one very late after a couple of shots on one possession
that led to a big bucket which gave you guys the first lead in a while.  
JeQUAN LEWIS: That was clutch. Mo is good at coming through for us when we
need a rebound and when we need a bucket on the inside. That right there gave
us a little more comfort.  
  
Q. Can you talk about just finding Doug Brooks for that late three that gave
you the lead?  
MELVIN JOHNSON: I pat myself on the back for that one honestly (laughter) I
don't mean to toot my own horn, but I think I came a long way because I was a
knucklehead. And with that offensive rebound, I would have tried to hit a home
run and shoot it myself.  
But I saw we were outnumbered. I saw Deion Taylor coming and I just one more
pass; and I had a lot of trust in Doug. So I thoughtto Doug ‑‑ I was actually
proud of myself; at the same time I was proud of him because that was a big
shot.  
  
Q. How has this team been different emotionally over the past month since
losing Bri and what does a game like this do for you guys to get that swagger
back?  
MELVIN JOHNSON: I mean, put our backs against the wall and just redefine our
identity, probably best defender in the country and of course we needed that.
But at the same time, we had to do what we can do. So over time, we just been
battling, get healthy and battling.  
  
Q. How do you deal mentally with being in foul trouble and then come in at
the end and have some clutch place?  
JeQUAN LEWIS: The past few games, I wasn't taking it very well. Then Coach
actually sat me down yesterday and said, you can't control what the refs do.
You have to keep a clear mind and stay into it and being at a point guard, I
have to be in a good place at all times no matter the circumstances.  
Today I was just into it. Coach said my time was coming, so he was right. So
followed the plan.  
  
Q. You guys were 16 ‑of‑19 at the foul line; talk about going to the line
and knocking down those shots.   
MELVIN JOHNSON: That's back to November. In order to go to a different segment
in practice, there was pressure free throws and you had to complete it with a
free throw. That was actually the first thing that came to mind when it was
time to step up to the line there.  
We've been practicing pressure free throws for six, seven months now. So I was
definitely comfortable. At the same time, I'm a confident shooter. All that
together, I felt confident (ph).  
Yeah, you step up to the line, it's just about confidence. That's the only
formula you can go to when you go to the line is you're either confident
you're going to make them or not.  
  
Q. After that injury, did you say to yourself: Gee, this is my team now;
I've got to do this ‑‑ did that ever go through your mind?   
JeQUAN LEWIS: No, because actually the might prior to Briante's injury, he
called me to his room about 12:30. So we sat down and talked for like 30
minutes and he was just telling me, you know, he's hit but he's not going to
be on the court anymore, so he needed me to mature and grow up a little bit
and be the vocal leader that he knew I could be. So I took pride in that,
because I look up to Briante like a big brother, and so he's been there with
me every step of the way.  
  
Q. You have Davidson as you move ahead. Can you talk about that a little
bit, and the last game, obviously.  
MELVIN JOHNSON: I think our legs are not going to be a factor because they
just humiliated (ph) us on ESPN a week ago. I think this is where we mature
and say we don't care about how our bodies feel. This is just one of those
games you have to step up as a competitor. That's a great team, so I feel it's
going to be a good game.  
  
Q. If you don't mind, could you explain that pressure free throw deal again?
You said you have to make pressure free throws.  
MELVIN JOHNSON: Throughout practice, especially different things we do
throughout the course of practice, whether it's playing five‑on‑five or
executing plays, in order to get to the next thing, you've got to make free
throws, and if you don't, you run.  
So there's times where we ran about 20 sprints just off missing free throws.
After awhile, we literally started making 14 in a row and at that time became
a pretty decent free throw shooting team.  
  
Q. What changed in your estimation from 48 ‑40 Richmond till the end?   
COACH SMART: Well, I think we were able to get a little bit more aggressive on
the offensive end, and get in the paint. We changed our scheme a little bit.
Went to more of a dribble, drive type offense, if you will, where we were just
trying to drive off of one another, get to multiple drives.  
And we were able to put the ball in the basket a little bit better. We got off
to a really slow start through the second half, and then the stops we were
able to get in the latter part of the game, that allowed us to get a slight
lead and then hold onto it.  
  
Q. Talk about Mo on the offensive glass, and your team has 11 offensive
rebounds in the game.  
COACH SMART: Mo is one of my favorite players that I've ever coached. His
future is really, really bright as a player. Unfortunately he's really hard on
himself. So if a play doesn't go his way, he gets so upset with himself.  
So we are just trying to get him to focus on, as we say, choose to see the
good. And when there's a lot of good to see in Mo, on and off the court. He
gave us a big lift.  
I kept thinking, well, I need to get him a break because he looked like he was
fatigued out there. But he just couldn't do that because Richmond is so good
at making you pay when he's off the floor, when Tre is off the floor.  
I have to take my hat off to Richmond. We played them three times obviously
this year. I think they are a terrific basketball team. And Kendall Anthony is
one of the best competitors I've ever been around. I've been coaching for 16
years, and he's terrific. I'm just really glad that we don't have to play
against him ever again because this is the ninth time we've played him, and I
think eight out of the nine times, he's played phenomenal. Just so impressed
with him and their whole team. I think they have a really well rounded team
and Coach Mooney and his staff have done a terrific job.  
  
Q. What is different with Melvin right now?  
COACH SMART: I think he's playing with a clear head. You know, Mel had a great
start to the year, but then after that, he's had some ups and downs. He's done
some stuff off the court that maybe you guys might not know about and all
those things maybe combined to cloud his head up at times over the course of
the past couple months.  
He hasn't played terrible. I mean, he's averaged 12 points a game for us and
he's had some games; he's really, really been a terrific player. But he hasn't
been as consistent as he wants to be.  
But these last couple games, he's playing much more with a clear head. I don't
know exactly why; maybe it's coming off the bench. Maybe it's because he
finally got to the point where he said, forget all those other things, let me
just do what I can do to help my team, and he's definitely helping his team.  
  
Q. Could you elaborate on what else was going on with him mentally?  
COACH SMART: No.  
  
Q. How's the team state of mind been the last month after going through some
adversity and where are they today, as opposed to a couple days ago?  
COACH SMART: I think when any team goes through multiple setbacks; if you go
back, we lost to Richmond, and Bri played in the first game against Richmond.
They beat us with Bri. He got hurt with I think three minutes left.  
That was just a tough loss, and then obviously with the injury. If a team
that's I think 7‑0, we were at that point in the league; if an undefeated 7‑0
team, as much as it can be set back by one day between the loss and the
injury, that's how much we were set back.  
And then after that, in the course of the next, I think, month or five weeks,
we lost four really close games that two of them without Tre, where we really
battled and did a lot of good things.  
But Marcus Posley hits a buzzer beater, La Salle gets into double overtime and
beats us. Sometimes when you're team is a little younger or you're missing a
key guy or one of the other key guys is a little hobbled, you struggle to
finish those games. That did affect our confidence as a team, there's no
question about it.  
I think we are still in the process of kind of rebuilding and getting back to
who we want to be approach‑wise and mentality‑wise. This was a big day for
that because our guys respect Richmond and how good of a team they are.  
  
Q. You had talked yesterday about how the double over time game, how fans
were telling you it want exciting game and how it was a different perspective
for coaches and players. This was certainly an outstanding game. Do you enjoy
this game because you won or is the stress and pressure still make it
impossible to really ‑‑  
COACH SMART: That's a great question. That's something that I'm really, really
working on personally. Because the conventional thinking in coaching is, if
you win, you're happy; and if you lose, you're upset.  
What that can do as a person is take you on an incredible roller coaster
through the course of the season that isn't necessarily good for you
emotionally or for your family.  
So I've been trying to work on that. I'm not going to lie to you and say I
felt good after that last Richmond game or I don't feel good now. Tournament
setting is a little different because we play Davidson in less than 24 hours,
so you don't really have time to get too excited.  
But yeah, I think from an outside standpoint, these Richmond games have been‑‑
Richmond / VCU games have been really exciting. Both teams have fought like
crazy and battled and they have been, you know, great moments on both sides.
There's been terrific individual play by guys like Anthony.  
I just throughout the game, I'm just trying to hang in there and do the right
thing for our team and not try to get too caught up in why we are down eight
or we went up or whatever it may be. That's a process.  
  
Q. How important is it to have Briante traveling with you?  
COACH SMART: Yeah, there's nowhere else for him to be (laughter). We're on
spring break. He wouldn't have it any other way. I mean, actually, the two
games he missed, he missed, let's say, our Dayton game and then the game at
Davidson. It definitely‑‑ not blaming the games on that, but it definitely
hurt not having him there in terms of his impact.  
He set the tone for our team as a player. He was the one guy on our team that
kind of like a couple of the guys that we had in the past, guys that played in
the Final Four team, he thinks he's better than everyone in the whole country.
We don't really have anyone else like that.  
So he can rub off on the guys a little bit with that from the bench. Obviously
it's not the same as him being out there on the court.  
  
Q. You were 3 ‑for‑20 and 3‑for‑19 from the three‑‑  
COACH SMART: That was the difference. Let's be honest. Everybody thinks if you
win, you played well; if you lose, you didn't play well. But the difference
was three‑point shooting. I think we were six‑for‑49, or 39, whatever it was,
it was like 15 percent in those two games.  
I sat up here yesterday and told that you at some point, shots are going to
fall and fortunately in the first half, a lot of those balls were able to go
in. And then Doug's three was as big as any of them from the corner.

_BROOKLYN, NEW YORK_  
  

DAVIDSON  67  
LA SALLE - 66

  
COACH BOB McKILLOP: I thought John Giannini and his team put us on our heels
with an outstanding effort, and it's sad that a team that is winning for 39
minutes and 59 seconds has to go home and lose, my heart feels for John and
his team.  
I've been with team, six, seven months, and after all we've been through, I'm
still shocked to have a performance like we had today, come back like we did
today, still shocks me. These guys will forever be shocking me with how poised
they are, how selfless they are, how team oriented they are, what
extraordinary teammates they are. So we are thrilled with this victory.  
  
Q. Tyler, take us through the last play.  
TYLER KALINOSKI: You know, it went by really fast. We brought the ball up.
Jack did a good job attacking. Got it to Brian. He passed it to me and when I
looked up, there was about four or five seconds left. I just told myself, you
know, attack the rim, because if I attack‑‑ I can catch an open shooter.  
Then I made a move, saw the lane open, saw the shot‑blocker coming over and I
knew I just had to get it high enough to get over him and give it a chance to
go in, and luckily for us it did.  
  
Q. Jack, you guys were down 13 coming right out of halftime and they make
two buckets and you hit those two threes which really started the friend for
you guys to break it back into single digits. Just talk about the mentality of
coming out in the second half.  
JACK GIBBS: We always think about coming out second half as momentum. We want
to get the momentum of the game switch to our end. We had not had it for much
of the first half. Coach tell us to run our offense and if we hit singles,
we'll get open shots, and we got open shots and we were lucky enough to make
them.  
  
Q. Tyler, the ball lands awkwardly on the rim ‑‑ were you going for glass or
were you trying to scoop it in? Did you feel it right as it was coming off
your fingers? How certain or uncertain were you?   
TYLER KALINOSKI: I don't know if I was going for glass or not. One thing we do
in practice a lot, Coach always tell us to shoot it high, because if you shoot
it high, you give it a better chance to go in the basket. When I saw the
shot‑blocker coming over, I definitely knew I had to get it as high as I
could.  
But yeah, I don't think I was going for either one. When I shot it, I knew it
had a chance to go in, and luckily it did.  
  
Q. When you get the rebound, any thoughts of the time ‑out? Coach didn't
call it but late in the shot clock you were out pretty far. Any thoughts of a
time‑out at that point?   
TYLER KALINOSKI: Yeah, I did have some thoughts. Just trusted Coach would put
us in the best situation to win the game. When Jack was bringing it up and he
didn't call time‑out, I knew we just had to attack and that's what we did.  
  
Q. At any level, have you had a game winner?  
TYLER KALINOSKI: I have. The last game winner I think I had was middle school,
so it was a while ago.  
  
Q. And was it even remotely comparable?  
TYLER KALINOSKI: I don't think so. I don't think so.  
  
Q. Do you remember it at all?  
TYLER KALINOSKI: Yeah, I mean, it was in our like little city tournament in
the semifinals and it was just a putback. You know, it's pretty special, but
I've been on a lot of teams, and this is probably one of the most special
teams I've been on. This one's pretty special.  
  
Q. I'd like you to go through the sequence on ‑‑ you guys had a five‑point
possession, could have been a six‑point possession but you made the three
after Tyler's miss. You had some free throw issues today but managed to fight
through.   
JACK GIBBS: Yeah, we got to the line, made one. Jordan came up big with the
rebound and then we went into a time‑out and Coach drew up a play. They went
under the screen, so I popped back and saw the guy closing down. And lucky
enough I was able to go out over his outstretched arms and lucky enough to go
in.  
  
Q. Going back to the non ‑time‑out call; is that a philosophy of yours, or
do you just play it by ear?   
COACH BOB McKILLOP: The way they were defending us, we were having a lot of
time to create offense, and when you get a team in transition backpedalling,
no communication from the bench because it's far away; our guys are talented
enough that they could make plays.  
With Jack on the court and Brian on the court, and Tyler on the court, I had
to trust in them, and that's probably the biggest word, trust; that I trusted
something was going to happen.  
  
Q. You said it a couple of times this season, you just said it now, that
this is a special group. When did you first begin to sense that, and why?  
COACH BOB McKILLOP: When we were‑‑ it happened in late November and in early
December. We had games in a one‑week span against Central Florida at Central
Florida, and Montana at Montana.  
Now if you look at the records of those two teams, they didn't have banner
years. But we had outstanding performances in very difficult environments.
Montana was two plane trips. And in both of those games, those teams came
after us and knocked us to the mat hard and we responded back, blow‑for‑blow,
and then went and fought, got them on the ropes and kept them there.  
I came back from Montana, and anyone who ever heard the post‑game press
conference at Montana on the radio, I was exhilarated. I was exuberant. I was
just out of my mind with how thrilling our guys were. We put 110 points on the
board and they made great plays, Montana. They just hit us and hit us and hit
us. And we come back and make a great play; and then they make one; and then
we make one; and it went back and forth. I said, wow, these guys are pretty
special.  
Then we go to Charlottesville two or three weeks later, and we went blow to
blow with Virginia. And we didn't have Jordan in that game. He had a
concussion. Jake Belford had just tore his ACL, so he was out. We bent blow to
blow with them for about 32, 33 minutes.  
So as we turned the new year into conference, I thought, we might have
something pretty special here.  
  
Q. Everyone is going to remember Tyler's shot but for the final 4:51 you
hold them without apoint. Could you talk about the defensive effort?  
COACH BOB McKILLOP: Yeah, credit our assistant coaches. They were masters at
changing defenses and getting the right match‑ups in there. My assistant
coaches are extraordinary, absolutely extraordinary.  
  
Q. What were you able to do early on throughout most of the first half? They
obviously wanted to go down low with their big guys.  
COACH BOB McKILLOP: We came out in the second half and we played the post
entry a little bit differently. We had played on the top shoulder of the post
and then we sat behind his butt after that. So that if we did catch it, at
least he wasn't in a position where he was sliding off of us. We had to
actually put a wall up so that his only option was to turn into the paint,
rather than drop baseline.  
I think that Andrew McAuliffe came off the bench to use his bulk and size to
really be a force doing that.  
  
Q. Why has this small lineup been so effective for you guys?  
COACH BOB McKILLOP: Because all five of them can make plays. You see Jordan
can put it on the floor and really get to the rim. Peyton Aldrige can handle
close to a guard and can shoot the ball from three. And of course, the three
other guys are point guards, shooting guard, body guards, lead guards,
whatever you want to call them.  
  
Q. How big was the shot at the end of the half?  
COACH BOB McKILLOP: I think the two possessions at the end of the half got us,
I think it was back‑to‑back threes. We went into the locker room, and we have
this thing called "Big Mo." We want to go into the locker room in that last
minute and really dominate that last minute.  
So I walk into the locker room, and I'm, "Yay!!" And they walk into the locker
room (indicating grumbling/barking).  
What kind of halftime talk are you going to have? Well, mine is going to be
pretty uplifting. What's theirs going to be like? (indicating grumbling sounds
of frustration). That's our whole theory.  
  
Q. How do you write that? (Laughter) You went 1 ‑3‑1 at the end‑‑ did the
assistants come up with that?  
COACH BOB McKILLOP: Yeah, in fact, on our last possession, we were going to go
man, and Matt and Will, the three of them just said, well, 4‑1, let's stay
with the 1‑3‑1\. It was completely the assistants' call. And there's the trust
factor again. I'm trusting these guys and it's extraordinary to have that
relationship.

_BROOKLYN, NEW YORK_  
  

DAVIDSON  67  
LA SALLE - 66

  
COACH GIANNINI: That's one of the better games I've ever been involved with.
Both teams deserved to win. I was surprised that shot went in. I thought that
we had them out of rhythm a little bit and it looked like the ball was thrown
towards the rim and not shot as well as they normally do, and it just kind of
took a couple bounces and went in.  
Our seniors were absolutely amazing. The stats show that. Your eyes could have
seen it. They played with incredible effort and pride and togetherness, and
they displayed everything that a coach appreciates and admires. Of course,
they have been great all four years.  
So you know, I can't say enough about them or our effort or the effort of both
teams.  
  
Q. We'll start with the first half, were you surprised how well things were
going? You turn around, you're up 18 out of nowhere. What led to that in the
first half and how you guys were able to take advantage?  
JERRELL WRIGHT: Just being aggressive inside. Me and Steve knew that we can
get the ball inside and score over their bigs. So the first half, we just want
to just be aggressive and look for each other down low.  
  
Q. Were you surprised with how long they stayed with that small lineup?  
STEVE ZACK: Not really. They only have one center. If you look at the roster,
that's the game they play.  
  
Q. On the final play, did you feel like it was maybe a little bit of an
awkward shot and it was going to be short? What was your vantage point? And
did them not calling time ‑out throw you off?   
STEVE ZACK: We weren't even thinking about them calling time‑out. We were
thinking about getting back in transition.  
  
Q. What does it feel to put an offensive display in the final ‑‑  
STEVE ZACK: I can't think about that right now. Just my career is over on a
buzzer beater and we had a chance to win. That doesn't matter right now.  
  
Q. Were you expecting Davidson to not be in a time ‑out? What did you tell
your guys?   
COACH GIANNINI: Absolutely nothing. They were getting back on defense the
whole game. They took on a very difficult shot. It's not like they didn't get
a great shot because they didn't call time‑out‑‑  
  
Q. Were you expecting ‑‑  
COACH GIANNINI: No‑‑  
  
Q. ‑‑ they penetrated, were you expecting a drive to the hoop in that
situation?  
COACH GIANNINI: I expect them to do what they normally do which is to take the
best shot they can get and be aggressive.  
I think you're ‑‑ that there's some overanalysis is there.  
  
Q. With 1:20 left, there was that free throw missed that both teams went
for. Did you think there was maybe a quick whistle for the time ‑out for
Davidson‑‑  
COACH GIANNINI: I wasn't down there. Those guys are great officials. To me,
from 70 feet away, it looked like it was a tied up ball and I was confused how
they got the time‑out, but I was 70 feet away.  
  
Q. And the horn that went on, do you think that caused a little confusion
for players on the court?  
COACH GIANNINI: At what point?  
  
Q. The shot goes off the rim ‑‑  
COACH GIANNINI: The jumped ball?  
  
Q. The horn sounded for a second and seems like some of the players ‑‑  
COACH GIANNINI: I didn't notice that.  
  
Q. I know you've said it before but how would you characterize the senior
class?  
COACH GIANNINI: Well, first, I'll tell what you people don't know. I mean,
everyone knows they have been to the NIT and NCAA Tournament and everyone
knows they put together three winning seasons out of the four year and really
we were a play away from making it four out of four good winning seasons, in
terms of being so close last year.  
But what people don't know is how great they are to coach and how great they
are to have as teammates, and how they are just wonderful and they are just
great kids and they are never in trouble, and they have great personalities
and they work hard and they want to be good.  
They are more than basketball players. They are good students and they are
loyal friends, and they are just about as good as people as I could hope to
coach‑‑ in fact, no, they are; I can't hope to coach better people.  
  
Q. Could you reflect on the season as a whole, how you feel about the
season, also the week as a whole?  
COACH GIANNINI: Well, first, us, I think our last two games showed that we are
capable of more than what our final record indicates. And I don't know why we
didn't perform a little bit better at times, because we do have good kids
would want to be successful. And I do think that we work them and taught them
as best as we could.  
So whatever we were lacking in, it wasn't attitudinal or in terms of the work
we put in. We are certainly lacking of something; the things that we were
lacking I'll probably keep to myself. But, these last three games, that was a
really good teams Dayton, UMASS and Davidson. That was a good team. We matured
into that team. We are the tiniest of differences from still playing. But
yeah, these last three games was the kind of team that I really thought that
we could be.

_BROOKLYN, NEW YORK_  
  

RHODE ISLAND  71  
GEORGE WASHINGTON - 58

  
COACH HURLEY: Great regular season for us coming into this game. We were
obviously excited about the opportunity to play in the quarterfinals, get some
rest, because we knew the quality of team that we were going to be playing
here. Obviously strong feeling that GW would be able to advance and meet us
here on Friday.  
I thought our defense today was as good as it's been, especially in the second
half of the game, as it's been all year. You know, huge credit to our players.
I thought our young players were brilliant today. I thought E.C. was
brilliant. I thought Jarvis was brilliant.  
It was a great win for our program, and now we get an opportunity to play on
semifinal Saturday here, which it's a great thrill for us. Obviously Dayton is
obviously a tough, tough, tough opponent.  
But for our program, it was huge to win today and get to Saturday.  
  
Q. I think it was 39 ‑39 and four free throws and you counter with an 8‑0
run and seems like the defense went to another level. Did you feel a change
energy‑wise on this team at that point?   
E.C. MATTHEWS: I apologize for the technical foul. Yeah, Coach was preaching
that we had to get stops and it was going to come on the offensive end, and we
feed off making stops.  
So, you know, Hass, T.J., everybody else on the floor, they did a great job of
rebounding, and we went from there.  
  
Q. It's been a long time coming for you guys. How does it feel to not only
win this but being the two guys to step up when it mattered?  
JARVIS GARRETT: Just have to thank my teammates. My teammates helped me do it.
They kept giving me the ball when I was open. They kept trusting in me.  
E.C. MATTHEWS: Like he said, this was a team win and everybody had a part in
it. It wasn't just us two. I'm happy we get to play another game and I get to
play with these guys here; I love 'em.  
  
Q. Tough stretch in the second half, like you were saying. How do you battle
through that, battle through the foul trouble, battle through the
frustration?  
E.C. MATTHEWS: Just keep composure. We've been there before we've been to a
lot of tough games. I've got good teammates and good coaches, but just keep
telling everybody, going to be okay. They are going to make runs but it's how
we respond and we stay together, and we got stops.  
  
Q. Seemed that the pace of game was very scrappy, especially when you got
the technical foul, seems like it could have done either way. How do you keep
your teammates from keeping composure and ultimately come out with the win?  
E.C. MATTHEWS: Yeah, it was scrappy. Both teams want to win badly so we can
advance in the tournament.  
But like I said, just kept our composure and they was going to make runs and
we responded well, and our defense won it for us, making free throws?  
  
Q. Last year the game against UMASS, you guys are in the second half and the
heat got turned up similarly. Turned into a very physical, defensive game.
This year, you guys had the answers. What was the difference?  
E.C. MATTHEWS: Been there before. We were freshmen last year; we're sophomores
now. We have great freshmen and we have got T.J. who is a great leader, and
Gil, and Coach Hurley. So like I said, just keeping our composure. We are
going to win the gameif we got stops and we did that, and free throws.  
  
Q. At the end of the first half, you had two big threes and a couple free
throws. What were your thoughts? You guys were down six at the time.  
JARVIS GARRETT: I hit those shots and kept believing in myself. First three
didn't go in but everybody kept telling me, just keep shooting. If it's there,
just shoot it.  
  
Q. Last year, very similar environment against UMASS in the second half and
this year you come good. What was the difference?  
COACH HURLEY: We're a better team. We're better, obviously, than we were last
year. We've developed during the course of the year, obviously coming into the
game with 21 regular season wins, our team has a belief in themselves that we
haven't had the past couple years because we just haven't been a very good
team. We've been building to get to this point.  
I thought Jarvis, you know, we had that stretch‑‑ forget the technical foul
stuff in the second half. I just thought Jarvis there, we were taking water in
the first half. We had major foul trouble and multiple key players with two.  
Those two threes he hit in the first half, I think for me, what were the
difference in the game, even just two shots like that in the first half, just
kept us close going into halftime. And then we played that lockdown defense.  
  
Q. You said all week defense was the focus. Was this the kind of effort you
were looking for?  
COACH HURLEY: Yeah, sometimes when you're in‑season and you're playing
sometimes three games in six days, you know, you get late in the year; two
brutal conference games a week in this league. The quality of this league is
hard. So you end up practicing less as the season goes on. Your fundamentals
on defense get worse.  
By the end of the year, we were just trying to hang on and keep the guys
rested. The fact that we were able to have a great regular season and get the
bye all the way to Friday allowed us really, starting on Tuesday, Monday into
Tuesday, to start doing a lot of the fundamental defensive drills that we had
not been able to do just because you can't practice real long late in the
year.  
  
Q. How great was it to have your dad in the crowd? He gives that you
emotional lift I'm quite sure ‑‑  
COACH HURLEY: Probably more my mom. She was yelling stuff when we were missing
free throws. I heard her a lot.  
It's a neat thing for me. I got raised in the game. This has been my life and
I know he's proud of his sons, not just‑‑ I don't think just obviously the
winning, but the way we run our programs, the way our players compete for us.
I'm proud that he's a proud dad.  
  
Q. Could you talk a little about the quick turnaround for your team now?  
COACH HURLEY: Quick turnaround, obviously tomorrow is an exciting opportunity
for us against Dayton. Obviously there's going to be a ton of emotion, a ton
of energy for us. It's semifinal Saturday. You know, I don't think that that
turnaround will be any type of factor for us.  
The bigger issue for us is how good Dayton is.  
  
Q. The two T's, any team could have unraveled at that point. What kind of
mental toughness did your guys show?  
COACH HURLEY: Two things. I'm obviously an intense coach. My technical, I felt
like, you know, I wasn't obviously pleased with the call, and I was really
walking away from the play. I'm not going to sit here and tell you I tried to
get that one. I didn't want that one; I was trying to head in the other
direction.  
Listen, conference tournament time, I watched these games on TV. This is an
intense time for coaches and players. There's a lot at stake here. We're very
emotional, we're very intense. These games are played at a life‑or‑death type
of feel to it.  
So the technicals were obviously disappointing. We wish we didn't get them.
But I love the way our team, I think they reflect me and they reflect each
other with just how hard they play, how all‑out intense they compete. I'm
proud of them.  
  
Q. Bobby got a technical tonight, too.  
COACH HURLEY: Did he? Again, I watch‑‑ I've been watching these conference
tournaments. I watched the game last night. These are intense games. The
coaches and the players have a lot on the line, and I think that that should
probably be considered a little bit. Both our teams won, too, right.  
  
Q. On that note, with Bobby having gotten to the championship game, if you
were to advance, as well, what would it mean for you and your brother to both
potentially make the Tournament together?  
COACH HURLEY: Obviously it would feel great for us. But I think we think more
about T.J. Buchanan and Gil Biruta, what it would mean to them; Gil having
been at Rutgers, and then leaving that situation. T.J., having 29 total wins
in his first three years, I think about those two and what it would mean to
them.  
I think about what it would mean to our university, our state, our community.
And a fan base that I think has been dying for a program that can really
elevate and create this type of excitement.

_BROOKLYN, NEW YORK_  
  

RHODE ISLAND  71  
GEORGE WASHINGTON - 58

  
COACH LONERGAN: A tough loss for us. Thought we were in pretty good position,
like ten or 11 minutes left, we had a little bit of a lead, not too much foul
trouble. Then we struggled to score, one for 16 from threes. Thought we missed
some easy shots. They did a great job of taking away our inside game. A lot of
our missed shots led to run‑outs and baskets by them; and huge momentum
swings, we tried to take a charge and they got a three‑point play.  
So give them credit. They are a very good defensive team. They played very
hard. Just couldn't put the ball in the basket the last ten minutes.  
  
Q. You had the lone three today, and after a big game yesterday, what wasn't
working for you guys?  
JOHN KOPRIVA: A couple of them rimmed in and out. I thought we were getting
good looks still. Unfortunately we were 1‑for‑16 or something like that. Like
I said, I don't think that was 16 bad shots. I thought we got some good looks.
They just didn't go down.  
  
Q. You guys clearly had pieces that could do damage moving forward. What
positives to you take from a game like this?  
PATRICIO GARINO: I think we play hard and we never give up. We didn't make the
shots we were supposed to make, but we're still won the rebound battle. We
just try to fight every possession we can, and maybe today wasn't enough.  
JOHN KOPRIVA: I'm excited for these guys. Wish next year I could play with
them again. They have a lot of talent and not just the junior class. The
junior class is one of the best classes to come through GW and they are a
great group of guys that they have some talent behind them, as well. Yeah,
wish I could play with them next year.  
  
Q. Foul trouble hurt you guys a lot. How did it affect your style of play,
especially in the second half?  
PATRICIO GARINO: I think in the first half when Joe has twoand Yuta, I think
it kills our momentum. We didn't take advantage of our opportunities then, and
at the end, we just had to foul. But definitely at the beginning, it was very
necessary to have him on the court.  
JOHN KOPRIVA: Yeah, it's tough when you have to sub with fouls in mind and try
to manage a game with guys in foul trouble early.  
We knew it was going to be a game that was going to be a tough fight, playing
fouls, however the refs were going to call, it was going to be tough and a
battle and unfortunately we got a couple guys in foul trouble.  
  
Q. Do you feel any pressure on yourself to play more safe defense with the
rest of the guys having foul trouble?  
PATRICIO GARINO: No, I was still trying to play tough defense. Matthews was a
tough matchup. I was still trying to do my own thing. I knew that we had
players in foul trouble, but at the beginning of the day with the scout, I
knew I didn't need to be that aggressive and go for the steal. I think the
last game I got a couple, but I was still trying to play tough defense.  
  
Q. With 44 free throws, how did that affect your guys and the style of play
you were trying to play?  
COACH LONERGAN: You know, ten of them, we fouled at the end, but our game plan
was to don't foul. We were at the free throw line way too much. They have some
strength and Yuta gave up two three‑point plays early. They were smart; they
just went right at him; he's not strong enough yet. But we have to give harder
fouls, so we allowed him to get ‑‑ three‑point play.  
We couldn't get to the line. Every blocked call seemed like it went the other
way. I thought the technical really hurt us. It gave us a couple free throws,
but I thought it hurt us as far as with the whistle. So I guess it was a good
technical.  
But give them credit. They were tougher than us and mental toughness, too,
hurt us. We had veteran players that kept getting silly fouls, running,
offensive rebound. And we don't have a bench with too much depth. So we can't
afford to have our veteran players getting silly fouls that keeps them out of
the game.  
  
Q. Even though you didn't get the result that you wanted, how great was it
to have the support to come up from D.C., to make the short trip up to New
York and cheer on your team?  
COACH LONERGAN: We got terrific fan support. A lot of the people that are here
are alums from GW, they have undergrad degrees, masters degrees. There's a lot
in the New York area‑‑ I should know that, but they are terrific. Last night
they had a reception at the 40/40 Club, sold out, I think 500, 600 people.  
So I really appreciate them and our players do, too. We're disappointed. We
came here to win four games and we came short.  
I'm hoping we go to NIT. I don't know how all that stuff works, but
20‑something games, 21 games, we beat some pretty good teams this year and we
definitely struggled in February. So I'm hoping for John that we can make the
NIT and if not, going to really try to work hard on our weaknesses hopefully
we have a really strong year.  
Hopefully our juniors bounce back and really be committed this off‑season as a
group. We had some guys that had bad years, and I had a bad year. So we have
to do a better job coaching and our juniors have to be really motivated. Teams
are made in the off‑season. Got to be in better shape. I thought they were in
better shape; tired legs.  
  
Q. Speaking of tired legs, how do you think yesterday's game affected
today's in terms of jump shooting?  
COACH LONERGAN: I don't. Stakes where are a little higher today, whether we
were tight or whatever. Going five games in a row, I think‑‑ (inaudible) ‑‑
really become a three‑point shooting team. Tonight, we didn't have it. Layups
short. I don't know, I just think our mental toughness kind of got‑‑ some of
it's our defense. We definitely, we had a wide open look at the top of the
key, really good play, cut it to five.  
We just didn't make plays. I thought our guys put themselves in position to
try to make the right plays but didn't. Separation just became too great.

_BROOKLYN, NEW YORK_  
  

VCU  70  
RICHMOND - 67

  
COACH MOONEY: I thought it was a great game, really well played,
highly‑contested game. Wish we would have been able to do a little bit more,
but congratulations to VCU as they move on.  
I'm very proud of my guys and how they have competed all season, and
especially tonight. I thought we were tough and we competed and just didn't
have enough to win tonight.  
  
Q. The first half of the second half, you were very difficult to score on
and that changed as the game went on. What did they do to sort of loosen up
offensively and score more?  
TREY DAVIS: They hit shots. Made a lot of open shots, shots that we had not
been giving them the first few times we played them‑‑ winning streak that we
had.  
  
Q. Just talk about defending them early in the first half, they were
knocking down all their threes ‑‑  
SHAWNDRE' JONES: We wanted to limit the open looks they had in the first half.
In the second half, I think we were kind of playing back a little bit too much
like we wasn't supposed to. Second half we tried to get a hand‑out, and like I
said, that kind ofbothered them a little bit but then he made a big shot at
the end of the game.  
  
Q. Several times you went into the paint, made shots from angles that when
you are almost parallel to the floor, when you go in, are you thinking what
you had to do, or do you just get into the mix and do what has to be done?  
SHAWNDRE' JONES: I don't go into the game trying to shoot those shots. Just
something that ends up happening during the game. I just try to do whatever I
can to help us win. Unfortunately I didn't do enough tonight.  
  
Q. Looking at the stats, you had a lot of advantages shooting ‑wise, fast
breaks, turnovers in the paint. Are you kind of wondering how you all didn't
win this game?   
SHAWNDRE' JONES: It was a tough game. We used a lot of energy. They used a lot
of energy. We battled tonight. Unfortunately they scored three more points
than we did at the end of the game.  
  
Q. Same question. Kind of wondering how you didn't win this game?  
COACH MOONEY: Yeah, we had a big advantage in a lot of the important
statistical categories. Our field goal percentage was super high. Our points
in the paint, we outscored them by 30. Fast break points was 19‑2.  
So a lot of‑‑ statistics can be a little bit misleading. They don't always
tell the whole story, but I thought the discrepancy, and they made 16 free
throws; we didn't make any. That obviously is one big advantage that they had
in their statistical line.  
  
Q. Without getting into any inflammatory comments, it wasn't so much that
you didn't make any; they also shot 14 more than you did. Were they more
aggressive to draw more fouls?  
COACH MOONEY: The other stats wouldn't suggest that since we had more fast
break points and more points in the paint. I don't know the answer to that but
the other statistics wouldn't suggest that.  
  
Q. In the first two games, they were like 6 for 39 on threes and ten for 21.
What was the difference?  
COACH MOONEY: I think early in the game, they made a few and really got
confident. Jordan made one in the corner. Melvin Johnson made a couple. I
think that really helped them.  
I think Doug Brooks made one at the end of the shot clock in front of our
bench. So I think the confidence; they really had not been shooting great
recently. But when they got out there and had the confident of seeing a few go
in, they are good shooters and they made them tonight.  
  
Q. What did you tell your guys afterwards in the locker room?  
COACH MOONEY: Really, that I was proud of their effort; how we have
represented Richmond all year, I think, hey, I'm just really proud of them and
how much I care about them. We are looking forward to playing again.  
Obviously the guys are pretty devastated but so far, we have accomplished some
things and I think we have some good basketball left.  
  
Q. I was going to ask you for an elaboration on that about continuing the
season somewhere and some way. Are you fairly confident that's going to
happen, and if so, would that be the NIT?  
COACH MOONEY: Yeah, I would think so, I would think we are pretty solidly in
the NIT and we'll be excited to play.  
  
Q. This was quite a game. Is it difficult to enjoy it when you come out on
the losing end of it, or during the game, are you not thinking what a great
game it is, just thinking what you have to do to get your team in a position
to win?  
COACH MOONEY: I think partly you can understand how good of a game it is, how
well the players are playing to make the plays they are making. I think I can
recognize, you know, it's very ‑‑ it's a big rivalry. It's a great rivalry and
it's very intense. But I do think that we recognized how some of the great
plays that both teams made, and just how hotly contested the game was.  
  
Q. Kendall was spectacular, as usual, against VCU. Can you elaborate on his
play and what you told him?  
COACH MOONEY: Yeah, he's just tremendous. He is so competitive, so tough, and
he's asked to do so much. Even though he's played well against pressing teams
throughout his career, he's even gotten better in terms of controlling the
ball and making great decisions, scoring the ball, of course, when he has to.
He's tremendous. He's had an incredible impact on me personally and on our
program.

### [Marcus Posley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28556)

### [Mark Schmidt](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23402)

  
_BROOKLYN, NEW YORK_  
  

ST. BONAVENTURE  60  
SAINT JOSEPHS - 49

  
COACH SCHMIDT: I thought the first half, we didn't play the way we were
capable of playing, especially offensively. I thought our defense was critical
in the first half. We could have been down by 15, 20 points if we didn't
defend, that's how bad our offense was.  
But I thought the second half, we really responded. We kept up and we played
even better defense, especially on Bembry, which was a big key going into the
game. He's the known, a terrific player; if not the best player in the league,
one of the top two.  
And Dion, and all the guys, we switched everything. They did a heck of a job
on him. We let Miles go off a little bit, especially the first half. But we
defended, and we started hitting some shots in the second half, and that was
good to see.  
The first half, it was very sluggish, but our guys really responded.
Physically they did a really good job. We were down, I think we were plus one
in the first half rebounding and we ended up plus 15. The game is a game, to
me, the most physical team is going to‑‑ and I thought our guys did a
tremendous job, especially in the paint.  
So proud of our effort, and now we move on.  
  
Q. Marcus, you had a slow start. When you see Youssou, he has such a bad
start offensively, you didn't make a shot early, are you thinking, 'Uh ‑Oh,
this could be a problem here' with the way the game started.   
MARCUS POSLEY: No, I just have to‑‑ starting at the point guard spot now. So
my main thing was to stay positive, two‑up, and to keep everything rolling.  
  
Q. As Coach said, not a great first half for you guys. What did you say to
yourselves as players that gave you the spark going into the second half to
take control of the game?  
MARCUS POSLEY: Just to keep attacking. We were getting, you know, decent shots
and good looks. We just had to knock the shots down. But unfortunately they
didn't fall like the way we wanted to the first half. But the second half we
sparked it up defensively a little bit. Just found our rhythm.  
  
Q. You said you were switching Bembry and Dion on him. What else did you to
keep them this check?  
COACH SCHMIDT: We tried to switch out and limit his touches. I learned a long
time ago, you can't score if you don't have the ball. So we tried to limit as
many touches as we could. We tried to switch out so we couldn't get open
looks. We played team defense. Every time we had the fall, we tried to get
feet around him.  
He's just such a tremendous player. He didn't shoot the ball well from threes,
and that gives you a better chance of guarding him but we kept him off the
offensive backboard, which he killed us in the first two games. But we just
committed that he wasn't going to beat us. Make somebody else beat us.  
  
Q. Talk about the play of Denzel Gregg, 15 rebounds. He was just
unbelievable.  
COACH SCHMIDT: Tremendous. Tremendous. Really active. It's funny, everybody
gets caught up in points, and here is a kid, he has two points but has a huge
impact in the game, both defensively and offensively on the backboard, and for
our three man to play 34 minutes and get 15 rebounds, that's a heck of a
performance and that's one of the reasons why we had the success we had.  
  
Q. Maybe wasn't going great offensively in the halfcourt. In the second
half, that run allowed to you take control and you were able to get out in
transition and get a lot of easy baskets. How important was it to be able to
‑‑  
COACH SCHMIDT: It's really important. We weren't executing well. We weren't
playing good halfcourt offense and you want to try to get easy baskets and the
best way to get easy baskets is to get it off your defense. We got some steals
and some dunks, and it got us going, you're right.  
Our offense has to get better if we're going to have any success tomorrow. But
our defense, if we can continue to play defense like we did, we have a shot.
But we have to do a better job taking care of the basketball and executing
better on offense.  
  
Q. One of the concerns you had yesterday when we spoke was whether or not
Jay could be thrown into this situation. Obviously he wasn't. Now the
situation gets even tighter with every game that you have. So it's a tough
‑‑  
COACH SCHMIDT: Marcus is doing a heck of a job. If you really know basketball,
to take the two guard, who has a scoring mentality, and put him at the point
guard and tell him to run the team, that's a hard job. And he's doing a heck
of a job both running the team and scoring.  
He's our heavy load and he's done a tremendous job in the last five or six
games. It took us a couple games to try to get our rhythm. But he's done a
tremendous job and that's such a big transition.  
  
Q. If I can follow that, do you have any plans now because of the situation
with Jay to toss him back in?  
COACH SCHMIDT: We'll see tomorrow.  
  
Q. I know you kind of talked about defending Bembry already, but in two
games now, the last one in Philly, as well, you were really able to shut him
down there, too. What has allowed you to really kind of take in some people's
eyes the best player in the league out of the game two times?  
COACH SCHMIDT: You know, he didn't shoot the ball. He had some open looks and
he missed. But look, like I said it was an emphasis of switching out on him
and not giving him too many open looks and any time he had the ball, take an
extra step to him. Treat him like he's the best player on the court and that's
what we tried to do. Our guys were really successful and, like I said, he
missed some open shots, but I think our defense had something to do with it.  
  
Q. There was a year you guys obviously didn't qualify but still, you guys
are 6 ‑1 in your last seven A‑10 tournament games, gotten past the first game
all three times. What is it about your teams, especially recently, that has
allowed them to have the success?  
COACH SCHMIDT: I wish I knew. We'd be 7‑1 tomorrow if I had that magic.  
I just think our guys are playing with some confidence. We came in with some
confidence, winning Florida, five games. To me, when the ball goes up, no
matter what happened yesterday or last month, it's a whole new game. It can
swing either way. We were playing well coming in and then we stunk in the
first half. As a coach, you wonder why. So, who knows why.  
I'm glad we're, whatever, 6‑1 the last seven games. Our guys are playing with
some confidence but we know we've got a heck of an opponent tomorrow that
we're going against, a team that's playing really well, and a team that's well
coached. They gave us fits the first two games, so hopefully we can play a
little bit better.  
  
Q. If you can talk about the first two games against Dayton; what do you do
the third time?  
COACH SCHMIDT: Hopefully we play better. They are just good. They space you
out. They have got really good guards. You know, Pierre, I think, in my
opinion is a first‑team all‑league player. To me, he's the key to their team.
He does everything.  
But they are a team that spaces you out; a team that when they shoot the three
well, they are hard to beat. And hopefully we can defend them better than we
did in the first two tries that we had.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=ATLANTIC-10+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 12, 2015

  

### [Tom Pecora](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26625)

### [Bryan Smith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26626)

### [Mandell Thomas](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28542)

  
_BROOKLYN, NEW YORK_  
  

VCU  63  
Fordham - 57

  
COACH TOM PECORA: Well, proud of our effort. Held them to 30percent from the
floor. Some of our game goals we achieved.  
The one thing we did talk about was their ability to hurt you on the offensive
glass. They had 18 second‑chance points and we had 12 and a six‑point game. I
think that kind of speaks to‑‑ their 20 offensive rebounds hurt us a great
deal.  
But we played and we competed, and I think a couple of the guys were gassed.
Christian Sengfelder was gassed. And also, you're a freshman andgoing to be ‑‑
he's such a good player, Treveon did a great job for them as Melvin did.  
Their veterans really stepped up and did a good job; as our one senior did,
here, Bryan, and obviously bittersweet. I just talked to him. A lot of guys
would love to finish their career playing ten minutes from home in a big‑time
arena and he was able to do that.  
Like I said before, I'm indebted to him for coming to Fordham. There were a
lot of other options and we weren't the flavor of the month. But it's a bit
easier for guys to come now because they see that the future is bright‑‑
(inaudible) ‑‑ our throwback to Branden Frazier and to Bryan, because they
helped us build this thing.  
You know, if you said to me, hey, you're going to hold VCU to 30 percent from
the floor and you're only going to have 16 turnovers, I would say, we're going
to win the basketball game. But the difference maker was them on the boards
and Graham‑‑ Rhoomes battled with them.  
  
Q. Bryan looked back and realized ‑‑ maybe even you're compared‑‑ how much
more gratifying is it now?   
BRYAN SMITH: I mean, it is very gratifying but honestly, wish we would have
gotten the win. Me and my brothers, we left everything on the court. We
competed the whole game, so only thing more gratifying was if we got the win
today.  
  
Q. Mandell, you take over the point guard spot about a month ago. Just how
much have you matured in that position and how excited are you to get better
at point guard when you start your senior season next year?  
MANDELL THOMAS: It's helped me to mature a lot. I've got to be a more of a
vocal dude on the court, and next year, I'm going to be the senior like Bryan
Smith was this year. It will help me be a better leader on and off the court,
and to work on my skills as a point guard, get to the next level.  
I think I'm going to be a point guard, not a shooting guard and I think that's
one of the reasons Coach put me at the point guard position. So I think it's
helped me to be more of a vocal leader.  
  
Q. You heard what Coach said about this program turning the program. A year
from now when you turn on the TV and see Fordham basketball, three years from
now, five years from now, what will it be?  
BRYAN SMITH: It will be a great team. We are headed in the right direction, a
lot of young talent, it's going to be a great year next year I'm pretty sure.  
  
Q. Looked like the second half, seemed to take the ball up front, penetrate
and tried to get a shot in the paint. You seemed to penetrate okay. What
happened once you got inside?  
MANDELL THOMAS: We wanted to drive the ball, force to pick the guard
(indiscernible) layup, fake it to a body, get some fouls or kick off for a
three, that's our best offense.  
BRYAN SMITH: Just got to stay aggressive, especially against a team that
presses all game.  
  
Q. As the point guard, not having Eric Paschall there, the A ‑10 Rookie of
the Year, to be able to still compete and have those three guards and be able
to play at a high level, how much confidence does that give you guys going
into the future knowing you still play three guards and also play with Eric on
the floor as a force?   
MANDELL THOMAS: I think it gives our team a whole lot of confidence. I just
said he's Rookie of the Year. It also gets other people on the team to step
up. Close games like that, we're one of the top teams in the country, we
competed the whole game, gives us a lot of confidence.  
  
Q. Why did you believe in Fordham basketball when you came here and why do
you still believe in them going forward as a program that it's going to turn
the corner?  
BRYAN SMITH: I believe in Fordham because when I was getting recruited here,
it was a bunch of honesty. The head coaches and assistant coaches was very
honest with me. And right now, Fordham basketball is in the best state. And in
the future, they told me in the future, we're going to come here and turn the
corner, me and Branden and everyone else who was here at the time. As you can
see we're headed in the right direction with that young talent.  
  
Q. Manny was one of your big contributors, down low, playing defense,
shooting ball from the outside. Went through a stretch this year where he
didn't play for six or seven games and now being a big contributor for you
guys, what does the future look like for him?  
COACH TOM PECORA: I think it's great. He's playing with a broken hard, too.
His aunt, who is basically a second mother to him, passed away Sunday evening,
37 years old. She had a sudden heart attack and so it's been an emotional week
for the guys and for him. You know, those are the things that people don't
see. As a coach and as a teammate and as an assistant coach that you deal
with.  
From a basketball standpoint, Manny has always had great talent. It's just a
matter of his maturation process, but I'm very pleased with the way he's
played the last couple weeks. He's really responded, had a meeting with him
probably three weeks ago and just talked to him about his maturity level in
preparing. And not even preparing for games, but I'm talking about preparing
for practice every day.  
And that's what young guys, they don't realize how intense practice is going
to be, and then, you know, you're going to get what you earn, not what you
want. You're going to get what you deserve and if he has a good practice,
you're going to get minutes; where he's been playing well in practice, and in
turn he's gotten some minutes and I thought he's responded. I'm excited about
him. He's a freshman. He's big and long and he can make threes. Gets a couple
blocked shots because of his timing. I think he's going to have a big, spring,
summer and fall and he's going to be a major contributor next year.  
  
Q. You talked about turning the corner. Is this the type of game where you
can see that growth?  
COACH TOM PECORA: Yeah, I mean, look, earlier in the year, people know more
wins and losses and all that nonsense. When you're building a program, there
are stages of winning. One of the things that we did this year that we've
never done, and I don't think it's been done for quite a while at Rose Hill is
we didn't get blown out of many games in the A‑10\. We lost a lot of games
that we were in right down to the nitty‑gritty.  
As I said, I believe yesterday, we lose to Rhode Island by one possession two
times. We go to Richmond and lose by three. You know, they always say, if you
lose by less than five, it's the coach's fault, so I'll take it. So I can see
the talent and I can see them moving in that direction, and that allowed to us
have the ability to close out a game at Mason.  
And then to win another game like last night, I mean, look, Mason‑‑ like I
said yesterday, I have a long history with Mason but I don't think we've lost
to Mason since they have been in the league.  
So I can see it coming. I can feel it coming and then when you have these two
bookends, and they are puppies; they are 18 years old, 19‑year‑old, him and
Christian, Eric and Christian, you're going to be locked up that the three and
four spot. And then you have Rhoomes and Canty playing great in practice and
they will compete at the five spot, and Mandell back at the point and guys
will see what we can get out of the shooting guard position next year with
various guys. I feel really good about this team. I'm excited.  
  
Q. When you played them in January, 28 turnovers, plus they had Webber, a
lot different this time around. Cut it down to 16, plus he wasn't in the
lineup. Did you see ‑‑ did you make the adjustment on your end to help combat
them more on a bit of pressure?   
COACH TOM PECORA: A little bit of both. Webber is a dynamic player. I hugged
him at the end there. Poor kid is on crutches, I told him how hard I was
rooting for him and get himself healthy, and he'll play a lot of professional
basketball on some level. He's a tough kid not to root for because of the
intensity and the way he carries himself. I'm a big fan of Briante Webber.  
But I think moving Mandell to the point helped us a great deal because we were
playing with two freshmen point guards early in the year and that became an
issue. I'm not easy to play for in you're a point guard because I just make‑‑
there's a lot of demands on it. It's like being, in my opinion, it's like
being college quarterback and I've had some great ones, so the bar has been
set pretty high.  
I think Mandell has really done a good job. Against them today, he made a
couple mistakes that a veteran point guard wouldn't make and I think this time
next year he won't. He turned his back to the basket and had a turnover late
in the game and a couple other minor plays like that. I just feel good about
it.  
I'm bummed I'm not going to practice tomorrow. There's a lot of guys who are
like, "Thank God that's over." I've been doing this a long time, there's a lot
of coaches that are like, "Hey, man, I couldn't wait till my season ended." I
do not feel that way. I feel I'll be lost tomorrow from 11:00 to 1:30.  
  
Q. I asked Bryan the same thing; to have him play some of his best
basketball down the stretch of his career, as his career winds down, how much
more gratifying is it for you to have watched him grow for four years?  
COACH TOM PECORA: It's been great. Like I said, I love him. His father is an
alum. His dad didn't play ball at Fordham but he's class of '81, big‑time
family, classy family, went to Midwood High School. I saw him score 67 points
in high school. I kidded him his freshman year. I said, "You're not 67 all
year, kid," and we used to laugh about it.  
No matter what, he stayed steady. He's just legit, so many ways and when he
has bad games, he feels it. It's a family thing. He feels the pain. And like I
said, he had a lot of opportunities and believed in all of us at Fordham, and
I don't think he has one regret.  
And as I've said, you know, more than once, what we tell kids when we recruit
them is: This is not about four years; it's about 40 years. And if you come to
Fordham, you will be hooked up for the rest of your life because you are going
to have a Fordham degree. And I cannot tell you, I've been to seven
universities; the alumni base at Fordham University is so impressive the way
they take care of their own and kids get a wonderful education. So when they
come out they are prepared to be successful whenever they are done playing
ball. He's going to be big time. They both are. You can see that.  
I've been in press conferences with teams over the years and you're just
cringing wondering what they are going to say and that doesn't happen with our
guys. They are good men at Fordham.  
  
Q. Against George Washington ‑‑ inaudible‑‑ there seemed to be almost‑‑
inaudible. Could you pretty much equate that to having a point guard like
Thomas?   
COACH TOM PECORA: Well, I think that‑‑ I think the maturation process, even
though they are not playing, we have seven freshmen. That has a huge effect on
your practices every day and the way you go about your business some of them
are practicing hard and some of them aren't, and you have to be on them for
that.  
And I think the schedule was brutal. I was kidding with Drew. I said I want to
be involved next year. Out of the gate, VCU at home without students at our
place; then we have Dayton at home who went to the Sweet16; we had GW, a team
that was projected to have a big year this year. The January schedule was a
bear.  
I knew if we didn't lose our faith and we continued to work hard and we
continued to believe in each other, we would have a pretty good February. I
was hopeful of that. And we let a game slip 28th of Januaryat Rhode Island by
a possession that I thought we could have had. And then we let at home slip
with Rhode Island. We were up one with two seconds left and they made a play
late in the game.  
But I could see, once again, I could see it coming. I think Mandell, and I
think just the incoming tide, the positive effect of Ryan Rhoomes working hard
every day, Christian Sengfelder, for a freshman, he became a force every day
in practice because if he didn't play hard, he hurt you. So darned hard,
driving on the floor, it's contagious.  
And then obviously Eric, we'll do things at times where we will all just look
at each other in the gym and say, wow, did he really just do that.  
So I think it all started to build and it really has to do with maturation.
And the other thing is usually in February, they stop listening to me, so we
usually play a lot better in February.  
  
Q. Today's game, talk about your strategy in the second half. It seemed to
be bring the guards out, let them penetrate and make something happen. Do you
play all the time or against VCU ‑‑ and Johnson has been struggling with his
shooting and got it back today.   
COACH TOM PECORA: Yeah, I wanted him to get it back tomorrow.  
  
Q. Did you know at some point he was going to get it back?  
COACH TOM PECORA: Yeah, and he got really wide open. The term we use is X'ing
someone. That means we are going to stay close enough to him where he doesn't
get any looks. And Melvin is an automatic X, and we obviously didn't do a
great job of that because he's 4 of 7 from three. And especially that one down
the end there, where he was wide open and we were splitting back into our
zone.  
The tempo of the game was good. I liked the tempo. I wanted the game to bein
the 60s. Games in the 80s are no good for us. So I didn't mind us taking some
time off the clock and getting it up the floor. Then running an iso‑cut late
in the game and spreading them out defensively, one of the things that's
difficult, they are so good and unpredictable that they are‑‑ we call them
blitz packages, the way that they double‑team the basketball. It could be
dictated by a player; it could be dictated by a location on the floor; it
could be dictated by a number of passes; it could be dictated by movement,
ball screen, dribble handoff, all those things.  
By spacing the floor, their slides to come blitz you are longer; it gives you
more time and better time to react. And then when you want a high ball screen,
today they were switching them. So when they do that, I like the idea of our
guards driving it on their bigs, even though they are very big and very agile,
and that was kind of a game plan.  
But I wanted the score to stay 50, 60s, I was thrilled by that and you know,
once again, if it gets in the 80s like this, we're not going to beat them.  
  
Q. Jon, when he hit that 25 ‑foot three, and then I came back and blocked
the shot and screamed at the basket‑‑  
COACH TOM PECORA: I see him scream a lot. I didn't know that he screamed at
the basket.  
But yeah, look, Jon can be a very competitive kid, and I think that this is
the right environment for him to do that. We obviously needed him to make some
shots today and I thought he did a good job. Not only making a couple threes,
but penetrating and drawing‑‑ when we were having a hard time there in the
first half, there was a stretch where nobody was getting to the rim except
him. And by doing that, those are kind of like body blows. They soften up the
defense a little bit so I thought he did a good job.  
  
Q. Looking for the third score, today you had four in double figures. Do you
think now the conference will finally know that you have pieces now, and now
you have may have three, four guys and people will start to take notice that
Fordham is on the rise?  
COACH TOM PECORA: I don't worry about that stuff quite honestly. That's great.
I think that if you looked at this team and you didn't think that there was a
bright future, you'd be crazy, because of the youth and the enthusiasm and the
veterans that are coming back and then the addition of Ryan Canty.  
Yeah, but once again, first of all, what's happened in college basketball are,
the conferences are so damn big, I don't know who the other guys are
recruiting. I don't know who comes in.  
So when they tell us to do these polls, guy to Joe and I'm like, Joe, help me
with this‑‑ (laughter). I was going to say, I call Lenny, but you're a pro guy
now.  
But this year, I saw Davidson at 12 and I just started to laugh because I
worked for Bob McKillop. I didn't think they would win the league but I knew
they weren't coming in 12th. There's just too many teams to know and keep
track.  
There was a story a few years ago, one of the guys in our league saw Paul
Hewitt on the road and he said, "What conference are you in now?"  
And he says, "Yours." As coaches, we can't always keep track of teams coming
and going and who is with who.  
Yeah, look, I think we're going to be fine, and I feel lucky to work at
Fordham to work in the university that's got an academic reputation. That's
what brought me there. I thought the combination of athletics in the A‑10 and
the academics could make it a special place if they were patient and they have
been patient.  
I think they know we are going to turn the corner here and it's going to be
exciting. It's going to be exciting when it happens. I'm a New York guy, man,
I'm not going anywhere. I'm thrilled to still be here.

# [ATLANTIC-10 CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=ATLANTIC-10+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 12, 2015

  

### [Derek Kellogg](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23395)

### [Cady Lalanne](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26823)

  
_BROOKLYN, NEW YORK_  
  

LA SALLE  76  
UMASS - 69

  
COACH KELLOGG: Well, that's it. Season's come to a close. I think Cady and
Maxie and the team for a good year, one that had some ups and downs. Didn't
quite end like we wanted it to, and I thought today was a pretty good college
basketball game. Pretty hard fought. A few times I thought we had an
opportunity to pull away and didn't make some plays.  
And then we cut it to, one, when we were playing well, making some shots, and
the kid, Lewis, made a huge three in the corner. Again, 22 percent from three
once again has been one of our Achilles heels. We hit the boards pretty good,
I thought forced some tempo. That's a tough way for us to go out with a team
that I thought had a chance to advance here and could make some noise.  
  
Q. As well as you started the game what changed that allowed them to sort of
get back in and take over?  
CADY LALANNE: Lot more shots and a lot more aggressive on the offensive end
and started taking a lot more shots to the team(Indiscernible).  
  
Q. You guys, very physical game, a lot of banging and hard hits. Is that the
kind of game you feel you had to play tonight to show a little oomph and push
some guys around and try to get in like that?  
CADY LALANNE: Few times we played like that in a physical game(Inaudible)
coming into it.  
  
Q. What did they do specifically on Cady after the hot start? I don't think
he had a point for ten or 15 minutes.  
COACH KELLOGG: Like most games this season, it's been just crowd him. The weak
side guard, just kind ‑ he wasn't getting in the paint.  
But I also thought Cady got tired a little bit in that stretch because we got
him the ball two or three times right underneath the basket and they were able
to take it out of his hands so it was a combination of both things. He
probably played a little bit too much there in that first half and I thought
they did a better job of getting back on defense and kind of slowed them down
some.  
  
Q. C.J. played big minutes at point guard; were you happy with the way he
handled himself and the composure he had in this came?  
COACH KELLOGG: Yeah, I thought C.J. showed some great things. Especially in
the first half where he exclusively played the point for us and was getting in
the paint, making plays. Has good size at his position and can get to his spot
on the floor.  
Some of it was maturity and me trying to play some of those other guys in the
second half and maybe he could have played a little bit more there. But he
showed some good fight and good toughness in some of the things that I was
looking for.  
  
Q. The number of plays down the stretch ‑‑ did you feel like it's starting
to turn‑‑  
COACH KELLOGG: I thought we were going to win honestly. And then the play that
was kind of a gut‑wrenching punch in the face, stomach, whatever you want to
call it was the three in the corner with the shot clock winding down. Some
years, those go your way. We've had that happen for us many, many times this
year and even in the past, and sometimes when you're on‑‑ when you're not
playing, winning as many games as you would like, those seem to be the
opposite way. That was a killer and then missing that many free throws down
the stretch was tough, too.  
  
Q. After the GW game, you talked about whether or not you guys wanted it. Do
you feel like the way guys went after rebounds and balls, they came playing
like they did want it today?  
COACH KELLOGG: Yeah, I thought we won hustle points or the toughness points
for the most part. We out‑rebounded them. Really killed them on the board for
a while. Came up with some loose balls. Both teams are kind of going head‑up,
but I thought the plays that were important to me as a coach, we came up with.  
Now, you know, missed shots and some of those things, we might not have done
that. But the toughness plays and the effort plays, I thought we did a good
job tonight. The guys came in like they wanted to win a game and tried to win
a championship.  
  
Q. You lost Jabarie in like 12 seconds of the first half, how much did that
take you out of the flow of what you wanted to do with that second unit?  
COACH KELLOGG: He ended up playing 13 minutes in the second half so normally
he would play 13 in that first half. Gave us one more scoring option, some
speed and ball pressure, that helps us some. Kind of mixed up our rotation
some.  
But I thought it gave C.J. a chance to play and he did fairly well. Maybe they
would have played together, I'm not sure. Didn't really have much time to
think about that particular situation, but he's a big part of what we do. And
when we've played all at times, he's a guy that's scored the ball and made
plays.  
  
Q. This was Donte's second 23 ‑point performance against La Salle this
season. Was it a conscious thing to get him more shots than usual against La
Salle?  
COACH KELLOGG: It's been a conscious thing for me for a while to try to get
him going, because I think he's a kid that has a good upside and can really
score the ball, somebody who should be some double digits most of the time.
And he's starting to really get that hunger and that toughness and that desire
to do that.  
You know, today I told him to be really aggressive on the offensive end of the
floor and when he does that, you'll see 23 points and six rebounds and things
of that nature.  
  
Q. Other than the late three, was there a play or maybe a series that you
would like to have back? And then second question would be, would you guys
accept a bid if an invitation comes from one of the other tournaments?  
COACH KELLOGG: That's a twofold and a good one. There's a couple runs where we
were up seven, one or two in the first half that I would like those particular
scenarios back because I thought we kind of‑‑ guys played by themselves for a
little while there.  
We took some tough shots and guys played one‑on‑one and then they got a couple
easy baskets. In a tight game, those four‑ or five‑point swings can be
killers, and I thought that was kind of the one of the points where we maybe
lost the game or could have pulled ahead.  
I think obviously if the NIT invites us, we would go to that, but I think if
not, we'll call it a year and get those other guys ready for the future and
help Cady and Maxie get on with their careers.  
  
Q. You talked about Donte, but were you happy the way he was getting to the
basket and able to get in the lane and get some of those putbacks?  
COACH KELLOGG: What I was really happy to see was the offensive rebounding in
his putbacks. That was something he hasn't done and then some of the drives he
made in tough plays was nice to see. He was probably our best offensive player
hands down for most of the game. When he plays that way, he's pretty tough on
the offensive end of the floor.  
  
Q. You crashed on Jerrell; was it a pick your poison thing between him and
Price?  
COACH KELLOGG: Yes, and Jerrell Wright has gotten much better since the last
time we played him at passing under the double teams. We left one time, and it
was kind of ill‑advised and they got a layup out of it. And actually that
scramble where Khalid Lewis hit the three was a broken play a little bit
because we had trapped him and the ball bounced all over the place and he
picked it up for a three.  
Yeah, I think when he can score and be effective down there, that gives him
like one more option to go with Price.  
  
Q. How do you wrap up what Maxie and Cady meant to this program?  
COACH KELLOGG: I'm positive, although I'm a realist, like I'm a guy, that we
would like to have done more and taken advantage of where we were a couple of
weeks back. That did not happen.  
But the one thing I'll say about Cady and Maxie is they will be sorely missed
when they are gone, like a lot of players who have come through. Those guys,
they have won a lot of games here, 20 games their first three years and almost
20 this year with the seventh‑rated non‑conference schedule in the country in
a very tough league that I think is as tough as any out there.  
Those guys have been special and really become part of our family, the UMASS
community. They both graduated. I told the team after the game, although we
did not win as many games as I'd have liked and maybe not gone as far as I'd
would have liked, because I would like to be in a certain spot every year,
because that's what we are as competitors; those guys and the guys on our team
are good kids and they have graduated.  
The other guys are all in line to graduate. They take care of business in the
community and the classroom, and I said, now we just have to win a little bit
more, and I like you guys, but they are good kids and Cady and Maxie are both
great kids that have been great to be around. I'm happy for those guys that
they graduated, and now they can go train for the next part of their careers,
which I think they will both be able to play somewhere professionally.  
  
Q. I think you guys have won four fairly close games in a row against these
guys. What happened then that didn't happen today?  
COACH KELLOGG: That's a good question. I think we made a few of those late
shot clock heroics in those other games and today it felt like they made them.
We got to the free throw line quite a bit more in the first‑‑ Game1 or Game2
and we forced a few more turnovers in those games.  
Our Achilles' heel, we go back to the beginning of the year, 4‑for‑18 from
three, every time we looked at that, we were either in a dogfight or lost.
That's a number that just can't happen. You have to be up around high the 30s,
mid 30s to have some success at the level with as many threes as we are
taking. They make seven; we make four; that's nine points‑‑ I know, I'm just
teasing.

_BROOKLYN, NEW YORK_  
  

VCU  63  
Fordham - 57

  
COACH SHAKA SMART: Got to give a lot of credit to Fordham. They have gotten
better and better over the course of the year, and those young guys are really
making strides.  
We talked about it as a team; that Severe was going to be able to do a whole
lot more than he did yesterday. I think he only played four minutes and took
one shot yesterday, and he certainly was aggressive today.  
Our guys, we got some good defensive stops in the latter part of the game,
last six minutes and that was the difference.  
  
Q. Melvin, you looked very comfortable out there; are you in a groove and do
you like playing in New York City?  
MELVIN JOHNSON: I don't think it's the arena. I think it's just focus. I was
ready to play. He had the game plan, we knew how dangerous they were
offensively. I think just locking in more on the defensive end, science of the
game.  
  
Q. What's going through your mind when Severe makes that long three, after
several closeouts by the defense?  
MELVIN JOHNSON: Looked at Coach and he just put his hand up. That was a deep
shot. But again, on the play, he's a tough guard and he can really score the
ball. He doesn't really care where he is. That was definitely my bad. And when
you guard a player like that, you definitely have to know personnel.  
  
Q. Pretty complete game, nine out of 20, nine rebounds but eight offensive,
two assists, one pass I think to Jonathan. Would you talk about how complete
your game was and when you were doing on the offensive boards? And mention Mo,
because he had five offensive rebounds.  
TREVEON GRAHAM: He's one of the type of guys that he's going to take some
shots, he's going to miss some, make some. Wanted to get him on the boards and
me and Mo were over the boards.  
As for everything else, I just wanted to be aggressive, came out aggressive.
And there was a point where I wasn't as aggressive as Melvin and Doug and
everybody on the team told me to stay aggressive. Toward the end of the game,
I just tried to attack the glass and do what I need to do for the team.  
  
Q. For those of us up here who don't get to see VCU, Richmond, that rivalry,
give us a sense, what's that like.  
MELVIN JOHNSON: It's like the city campus versus the private campus. We're
about nine miles apart. It's like a different world when you cross that side
of town. I never see their fans. They never see our fans. But our fans
generally dislike them. Their fans generally dislike us.  
But it's just a game to us. It's just another opponent and you have to lock in
and not over think it and we don't put too much emphasis on rivalries, etc.  
TREVEON GRAHAM: Same thing Mel said. No matter what we're it is, it's going to
be a good game when we step on the floor because we're competitors, both of us
are competitors and when we get on the floor, we want to win, so it should be
a good night.  
  
Q. You guys both shot great but the rest of the team really struggled,
especially in close. How frustrating is that when you're getting good looks,
missing, and you made it up by getting on the boards, but did that get a
little frustrating at a certain point, getting good looks and close looks and
missing?  
TREVEON GRAHAM: I mean, it can, but you have got to respond. You're going to
miss shots, and the days were you miss shots, you've got to do other things
that help us as a defense. We wanted to really get stops. And we get stops‑‑ I
mean, we don't score, we have a better chance. So we just wanted to worry
about other things.  
  
Q. You talked about the Richmond game. In the two previous ones, what do you
think you have to do better to win the third one?  
MELVIN JOHNSON: No pressure now. I think both times, we just weren't locked in
on certain assignments. I felt as though we won the game at their place, and
of course, Coach went over their players, said they might do this, get some
offensive screens, get some layups in. That was just being on edge and not
knowing their personnel.  
For the most part, we just have to compete and lock in on their personnel.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the no ‑look pass to Jonathan? Did you see him coming
down the lane, and would you mind talking about Fordham's strategy that seemed
to be beat you with their guards by penetration?   
TREVEON GRAHAM: When the zone, he was open, I believe and Johnny come down the
line and I saw him and pass it to him knowing he's a great finisher.  
We knew going into the game that they were going to be in attack mode so we
wanted to keep him in front as much as possible. He's also a good shooter, so
it's going to be a tough matchup going into the game, and‑‑ all of our guys,
attack.  
  
Q. Tough stretch down the end ‑‑ can you talk about how much being in your
home‑‑  
MELVIN JOHNSON: I mean, yeah, sometimes you get into your own head and start
fighting yourself and nobody to answer but yourself. Just have to get it. The
next couple weeks is senior week, so the least I can do is just play with my
head down and try to get some wins for our seniors.  
You can't miss a shot you never take, so I'm going to try to be as aggressive
as I can possibly be and try to win some more games for Treveon, Jarred and
Bri.  
  
Q. Was there a point where you felt the momentum swing and you really got
things going?  
MELVIN JOHNSON: When Mo went to the free throw line, they were up to five and
we were able to cut it a little bit and from that point on, our huddles got a
little more tighter, and our leaders stepped up and pretty much said we got
more stops and guys responded. And Jonathan he played a huge part. He came in,
pressured the ball, found the open guys and that was the big push for us.  
  
Q. You guys are used to sitting out Thursday and watching. Is this an
advantage for you having a game under your belt taking on Richmond tomorrow?  
TREVEON GRAHAM: No advantage, they got the advantage. Right now we've just got
to advantage. It was different. Unfortunately we couldn't get a bye but got to
do what we've got to do now.  
  
Q. We talked a little about this the other day. So much has been talked
about you guys transitioning or learning to play without Briante, but you're
also just not shooting very well. And that might ‑‑ does that have to do with
Briante not playing, or is that just a slump that you can't seem to shake?   
COACH SHAKA SMART: We're going to shake it. It's just a matter of when that
dam is going to break. And today, Melvin shot the ball well. But overall as a
team, somebody pointed out, if you take Tre and Melvin out, the percentage is
really low.  
But yeah, Bri being out had something to do with that. He's really a good
facilitator and a great assisted turnover ratio, was able to get us into
offense. But, he's not playing. Something we've got to continue to get better
at.  
  
Q. What did you think of the crowd today? When you guys got on a roll, they
really got loud and cheering.  
COACH SHAKA SMART: Yeah, our crowd is terrific, and our fans, we're always
appreciative of them coming up to Brooklyn and supporting us. I don't know
what the numbers are but it seems like every time we come up here, we have as
many fans as anybody, or more.  
So I think that just says a lot about the people that support us and them
being behind us and you know, obviously some people probably made plans to be
up here for the first game being Friday; some people adjusted their plans as
we did, and we are appreciative of that and excited about playing on Friday
against Richmond.  
  
Q. When you got down five, it seems the intensity picked up on your end,
especially on the glass. Did you sense anything with your guys or did you say
anything to them at that point?  
COACH SHAKA SMART: Did I say anything to them? Yeah, I said a lot to them.  
But it's not really about what I said. It's about their decision to play with
more aggressiveness it. You know, Fordham, really every time we play Fordham,
they play us really tough. Usually somewhere early in the second half, we're
able to break away, but today, that was not the case, and they made some shots
and hung in there with us. But I thought our guys did a good job of being the
more aggressive team the last six minutes.  
  
Q. Did the guys in your locker room ‑‑ is playing Richmond a third time
significant or insignificant?   
COACH SHAKA SMART: It's significant‑‑ well, not really the number of times,
but just that we're playing them right now.  
We had a really tough loss there a couple weeks ago. That one for our guys was
a tough one to take because one of those games where they out played us for
most of the game, and at the end of the first overtime, we felt like we had
stolen the game and then they stole it back.  
So it's interesting, I heard from a lot of fans after the game, that was just
a fun game to watch. As a coach or a player, it's a little bit different. But
we're excited about a chance to play them again. They are a really good team.
I think they have gotten better and better as the season has gone on, and
should be a great game.  
  
Q. Would you mind talking about the job Mo and Tre did on the offensive
boards, and Melvin's shooting stroke?  
COACH SHAKA SMART: Yeah, I think Mel's a great shooter when he goes out there
with a clear head and just shoots the ball the right way and honors the
process.  
I thought he did that today for the most part. There was one that he rushed
when we got down a little bit, but other than that, they were really, really
good looking shots, and lo and behold, a lot of them went in.  
In terms of Mo and Tre, and I would add Terry on the offensive glass; those
guys were really, really aggressive. We need to be that way because we did not
shoot the ball particularly well from outside or even from two.  
So it looks like we missed 41 shots, is that right, Drew? And we got 20 of
them back. So we talk about rebounding percentage all the time, and if our
offensive rebounding percentage can be 50 percent or close to 50 percent,
that's phenomenal. 40 percent is really good, so ‑‑  
DREW DICKERSON: 41 is correct, the math.  
COACH SHAKA SMART: Thanks. I won the math meet in seventh grade (laughter)
seriously.  
  
Q. You talk about Mo's impact at the right time. Going to the foul line, he
got a big blocked shot and dunk and impacted at the right moment.  
COACH SHAKA SMART: Yeah, Mo really, really cares and sometimes almost to his
own detriment, when a few players don't go his way early in the game, he gets
a little bummed out. So it was good to see him bounce back and get to the foul
line a couple times and also finish with that dunk.  
Then I thought the block that he had on Severe, not exactly sure what the time
was, but I thought that was one of the most critical defensive plays that we
had because it allowed us to get a little bit more of a cushion.  
  
Q. You talk about Melvin needing a clear head. Did you talk to him or did
you just leave him alone and let him shoot his way out of it?  
COACH SHAKA SMART: We talk about that every day with all of our guys. To me
that's the foundational building block of playing basketball or doing anything
at your best is being able to have a clear head.  
We talk about it, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's going to happen. I
thought Mel did a good job, just once he got out there, playing free, not
really worrying about the last play or the score or what might happen moving
forward.  
  
Q. You heard me ask the kids this. Everybody knows about Indiana/Kentucky
and Carolina/Duke. But what does it mean to have rivalries like
VCU/Richmond?  
COACH SHAKA SMART: I think rivalries are what makes college basketball what it
is. I don't get into the whole ranking of the rivalries and whose is more
intense and severe. I've worked at six different schools as a basketball
coach, and if you're fortunate, you have a really good rivalry that you're a
part of.  
We are fortunate to have that with Richmond. When I first got to VCU, we were
in separate leagues. It was a big deal for about a week or so leading up to
the game, and then the game itself and then everyone kind of moved on.  
Now, it lasts longer because we're in the same conference and we play multiple
times; in this case, three times. We played three times last year.  
So I think it's great. You know, when both programs are highly competitive,
when both programs are competing to be in the postseason, I think it means
even more because obviously the games this time of year mean so much more.

# [ATLANTIC-10 CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=ATLANTIC-10+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 12, 2015

  

### [John Giannini](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21943)

### [Jordan Price](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28527)

### [Steve Zack](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28528)

  
_BROOKLYN, NEW YORK_  
  

LA SALLE  76  
UMASS - 69

  
COACH GIANNINI: We are obviously thrilled. We beat a team that is a very good
team and one that's hard for us to matchup with. Their physicality is not easy
to play against.  
But I think first and foremost, we gave great effort. That shows up
defensively. We were strong and tough with the ball, only eight turnovers.
That last, long play that almost really hurt us was more on me, even making
that as an option, probably should only throw the ball long in that situation.
So we should probably only have seven turnovers.  
So when you play defense and you don't turn it over, you have a real good
chance. And obviously Steve gave us great leadership and rebounded the ball
wonderfully, had zero turnovers, and especially guarding Maxie Esho, who is a
terrific player. If you look at defense and rebound and passing, it's hard to
play much better than what Steve did today.  
And of course Jordan came up with big plays. I thought it was one of Cleon's
best defensive games he played. We made big free throws, so we did a lot of
things to win a close game against a very good team.  
  
Q. In a game like this, it's kind of hard to narrow it down to just one
play. But they come out and had that little spurt after halftime, you take a
time ‑out, run a set play, get that jumper. How important is it you come out
of time‑outs and be able to count on a bucket like that?   
JORDAN PRICE: We don't focus on just coming out of time‑outs like that. Just
in the time‑out, we were focusing on defense, because if they went on the run
or whatever. So our main focus was defense. We know we are going to get the
shots, open shots, and had to knock them down.  
  
Q. Jordan, can you talk about you're down nine the first half; what was it
you thought turned it around for you guys?  
JORDAN PRICE: Getting stops, just multiple stops in a row. That's what we
basically focused on, is if we can get three stops in a row or more, that's
good for us. You know, defense leads the offense and that's what happened
tonight for us.  
  
Q. Talk about the matchup inside with Esho. You were banging all game long
with him. Talk through what was going through your mind on those possessions
on defense?  
STEVE ZACK: I knew I had to keep Esho in front of me. He's a quick four man
that can drive you; if you relax, one big right by you. And Cady, that guy's a
monster. I have the utmost respect for him. Battled all night. Only way he
couldn't get the ball was if I down and around in front of him. So we're
battling through, they got it a couple times, but stayed in front.  
  
Q. Jordan had the first nine points of the game and I think it took you
eight minutes until somebody else scored a basket. How important were his
minutes and his ability to let everyone else get into the game?  
STEVE ZACK: We know Jordan can score. Everyone in the country knows he's a
scorer. He does a great job. If he has shots, he knocks them down. When they
start posting on him, he finds an open guy all the time. We feed off each
other's energy. One guy gets going and gets amped up and that brings the whole
team right up with it.  
COACH GIANNINI: Also, I just noticed Jordan being our second‑leading defensive
rebound; Steve with six defensive rebounds and zero turnovers. When you're a
guard and scoring and you don't turn it over and you get rebounds, there's a
lot of credit for helping us win this game. Forget about the points, just the
rebounds and the passing alone are a big deal.  
  
Q. If you guys can talk about the challenge tomorrow and the job they do in
spacing.  
CLEON ROBERTS: It's very important, especially in transition. Most teams like
to get to the cut‑‑ they like to space out for three‑‑ that's important.  
STEVE ZACK: Like you said I know we are playing a three‑point shooting team.
Can't allow them to get open looks.  
  
Q. Cleon, can you talk about the three ‑pointer you hit from the corn right
after they cut it to one?   
CLEON ROBERTS: Yeah, confidence shot, I haven't been hitting as many shots
lately‑‑ had to keep my mind that the shot would go down.  
  
Q. You were aware of the shot clock at the time? Was that a shot you would
have taken normally in the rhythm of things?  
CLEON ROBERTS: (Inaudible) take the shot.  
  
Q. Same shot. How big was that, given it looked like they had some momentum
going.  
COACH GIANNINI: It's a big shot, a really big shot at that time. But again,
Cleon, that's a normal shot for him and he's good shooter. He's been missing
more than usual lately but I just believe in the laws of averages and I want a
guy like Cleon to keep shooting the ball.  
  
Q. What initial adjustments made on Lien, he had a pretty big start to the
game ‑‑ what adjustment was made‑‑  
COACH GIANNINI: Like Steve said, he's a monster and he made some big baskets
late. He's a problem. He's a very good player. And probably the only thing you
can really do is just try to stay in front of him, make it hard for him to
catch the ball. You can't score when you can't catch. I think both Steve and
Jerrell did a good job limiting his touches.  
It's just old school basketball: Have a guy in front and have a guy on weak
side helping and trust your fundamentals. I think it's as simple as that. But
that's a lot of work trying to stay in front of a guy that big and strong.
Steve and Jerrell deserve a tremendous amount of credit.  
  
Q. Doing all that work on Cady and Maxie, and then comes Donte Clark. What's
going through your mind?  
COACH GIANNINI: They are a very good team. You're used to it in this league.
I'm just amazed sometimes at the absence of anything remotely close toan easy
game in this league. So everyone has really good players. This is one of the
top six leagues in the country for a reason and every team is going to have
good players.  
So they are tough. They are tough. But what's bothered us most in the past,
and we did a better job of in this game, is their physicality. I thought we
turned it over more and got bumped off‑balance, and when we got to the rim we
were avoiding contact. I thought, again, the physicality really bothered us in
the first two games.  
In this game we got to the free throw line more because we were going through
the contact. We were just playing a little bit stronger. We didn't turn it
over as much because we were just physically stronger with the ball in our
hands against the pressure. That's what's bothering us the most. Of course
Jerrell struggled against Cady again because it was physicality. In this game
I think we were a little more physical and a little tougher.  
  
Q. How important were the free throws down the stretch, especially when you
see UMASS miss some free throws in the last stretch of the game?  
COACH GIANNINI: You know, free throw shooting is such a huge factor in winning
basketball games. And unlike many of the other things in basketball, you can't
make more by trying harder. You can't make more by drawing something up on a
clipboard. You can't make more by game planning.  
So, you know, hopefully you have good shooters with some poise. Again, we have
lost some games at the free throw line this year and today it really helped us
win.  
  
Q. You talked a lot today about their physicality. Tomorrow you're playing a
team that not just makes threes but they make the kind of threes that are a
dagger; you played them very well earlier and they hit a couple. Did they
present more of a challenge mentally that you always have to stay focused with
them?  
COACH GIANNINI: Every team has a different mental challenge. But I will say
this: They are not good offensively; they are not very good. They are great.
They are really elite. I think the Ken Pom (ph) has them something like the
third most efficient team in the country.  
I'll tell you some of the things that make them special. They score a lot of
points; No.1 scoring team in the league. But when you play fast, you're bound
to have some turnovers. They are a team that plays fast and never loses the
ball. They have five, six, seven guys who are legitimately good three‑point
shooters, so I think they have way more good shooters than anyone else. They
play as fast or faster than anyone else.  
They are able to do that and make good decisions at high speed, which almost
no one does. And then, you know, Coach McKillop's offense is unbelievably
spaced with great options and a lot of movement.  
And then No.5, I go by numbers myself more with opponents. The one guy that
doesn't shoot threes is like an impossible matchup. He's too strong for guards
and too athletic for bigs. No matter how you slice it, they are a nightmare
offensively, whether it's their aggressiveness, their shooting, their
execution of their halfcourt offense, their number of shooters or the tough
matchup at both the center and power forward slot because their centers shoot
threes, which not many people have, and their power forward is just so dang
quick and athletic.  
So, listen, they won this league for a reason, and they are‑‑ I tell people,
look at national college basketball. You look at how unbelievably great
Virginia's defense has been this year. Well, Davidson is like the offensive
version of them.

_BROOKLYN, NEW YORK_  
  

GEORGE WASHINGTON  73  
DUQUESNE - 55

  
COACH LONERGAN: Pleased to get a win tonight so we can advance. I thought both
teams shot the ball very well from the outside. We did a really good job
rebounding the ball. I know they still got some points, but I thought we
really made Colter work for his shots and Mason shot a high percentage.  
Happy for our guys. Important game for us. One of our tough losses was at
Duquesne this year, didn't play real well, so I think they really wanted to
play them again. Try to get home and get prepared for a really tough road
island team.  
  
Q. Talk about what playing so well on the big stage means for you and
everybody who is watching you from overseas?  
YUTA WATANABE: Yeah, I just try to play hard and I had a good game against
UMASS, so I got confidence. I just tried to keep shooting and I think that's
it. That's why I played very well. I think I got three offensive rebounds
which is very good for me. I'm going to keep working hard and I'm going to
keep improve myself.  
  
Q. How much of the last game at Duquesne was on your mind during this
game?  
JOE McDONALD: I think we just played with a chip on our shoulder, especially
myself. I didn't play particularly well against my match‑ups last time we
played Duquesne (off mic).  
  
Q. What was it like guarding Mason and how did you try to stop him? What was
your game plan?  
PATRICIO GARINO: We know he's a big matchup and he gets hot really quick. He
really knows how to shoot. We watch a lot of film and we learn basically all
their plays and we walk through how he (ph) plays, but I knew he was a big
matchup for me. Even though he got 22 points, we contained the whole team. I
think one of our goals was to contain Mason and Colter. Basically the Mason
matchup‑‑ but by containing Colter, we knew we could get the team win.  
  
Q. Turnovers were a big problem the last time you guys played Duquesne. What
did you go into this game thinking about?  
JOE McDONALD: Well, we're in the two‑three zone, Coach is always preaching, we
shouldn't really have to turn the ball over when they are in zone. I was just
making crisp passes. In the beginning, made a couple sloppy passes, but after
that I think we had our confidence going. A lot of it, it builds from our
defense.  
When we can get out in transition, we don't have to worry about forcing a pass
inside, or just jacking up a late shot. We didn't really handle that pressure
late with their little three‑quarter score press, but we will get that
addressed for the next time.  
PATRICIO GARINO: I think it was focused kind of thing. In the beginning we
were a little out of it, a couple passes that weren't crisp enough as Joe
said. But through the game, we knew in we needed to contain those turnovers by
maintaining that focus through the game. We made better passes, and again, our
confidence got higher and higher, and then reduce those turnovers through the
game.  
  
Q. Yesterday Duquesne tied the tournament record for blocks in a game. They
had 12 and they won the points in paint battle by a lot and now you guys
dominated points in the paint. What was the game plan after watching the game
last night?  
PATRICIO GARINO: Well, we are aware of those‑‑ we knew we needed to avoid
that. 54, Lewis, is really big, but we think he was a little slow so we had to
go around him. He had seven blocks yesterday, so we did a great job today. He
only had one.  
We know that we can out‑muscle them, by going around them, we could take the
advantage.  
  
Q. You just talked about playing with a chip on your shoulder; almost like a
carbon copy tomorrow night with Rhode Island. Can you go to that well again,
playing with that chip on your shoulder?  
JOE McDONALD: Without a doubt. We've been looking forward to this when we saw
the bracket come out. Obviously we didn't want to overlook Duquesne, because
the last time we played them the outcome wasn't what we wanted. We are just
glad we got this win and just want to continue the momentum.  
I think the biggest thing tomorrow against Rhode Island is taking care of the
basketball. Our defense will be there; our intensity will be there, because we
are going to have to match Rhode Island's intensity. We can take care of the
basketball and just get shots. Like Coach says all the time, shots not
turnovers, I think we'll be fine.  
  
Q. You both shot the three ‑ball very well in the first half. How do you
keep your confidence so high from the last game?   
YUTA WATANABE: Well, I'm practicing like every night by myself. So I got
confidence, like every time, so I just take shots. Yeah, that's it.  
JOE McDONALD: I just think it's shot preparation. Our assistant coach,
Maciariello, has done a good job of just keeping our confidence high with the
shot. He always said, you know, be shot ready. So make sure we continue that.  
  
Q. Seems like this is a home away from home for you all. You make the short
trip up here from D.C., seems like your fans here that were very vocal ‑‑ how
does that help you build confidence being that this is a one‑and‑done type of
situation?   
PATRICIO GARINO: I think at home we have a great advantage. We have a really
big fan base at home. But I think we have a lot of alumni here in New York. I
know the people that travel from D.C. was key for us. I think it gave us more
confidence and we really appreciate the job they do. They get really loud and
they get into the game and they gave us confidence at the end of the game, and
it's impressive. Not every team has that many fans and we appreciate
everything that they do.  
  
Q. When you started traveling, what was the advice he gave you?  
JOE McDONALD: Well, he was one of our best shooters, clearly, so we just tell
him to keep shooting and be confident with the shot. He's got a nice stroke.
He's a lot taller‑‑ when he plays the three position, he's a lot taller than
the other guards he goes up against. So he has a height advantage to shoot
over them. Just be confident.  
PATRICIO GARINO: Yeah, definitely, confidence, but I think through the games,
different teams scouted him better and knew he was a shooter and maybe he was
taking a little contested shots. So maybe taking shots that were open through
the games helps him a lot and builds up his confidence.  
  
Q. Can you talk about in the second half, you were up by as much as 15 and
they kind of cut it to something like four, you guys were up by four. Then you
guys got on that 11 ‑0 run after John got the N1 (ph). How did the team
weather the storm?   
COACH LONERGAN: I probably should have called a time‑out. We had a couple
ten‑second violations, which is kind of shocking. We work on it all the time
and worked against our press today. We know to look at the shot clock, when it
gets down to 27, you have to get it over or call a time‑out. I was just kind
of caught off‑guard where we were kind of casual and got caught there. That
was disappointing. And then we missed a couple free throws.  
But they made shots‑‑ give Mason credit. He's a tough match up and Garino is a
great defender but he hit some shots. I didn't realize he shot that well. You
know, that's what he does. But for the most part, I don't think they scored a
bucket off the bench, and Colter had to really work for his. One guy got his
point, that's fine. We knew they would make a run. Basketball is a game of
runs. So I'm glad we survived it.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the game plan going into it with the battle in the
paint after seeing that Duquesne had blocked 12 shots last night?  
COACH LONERGAN: It's crazy, scouting report watching that game last night was
they were second‑lowest shot‑blockers, whatever, in the league. The big guy,
Lewis, last night, he just blocked somebody by putting his hands up. He was so
confident last night, he started jumping and blocking shots.  
So our kind of theme was we were going to go around him and not through him.
That's what we did. They got their confidence up, they had five blocks today.
I think they are averaging two and a half, if that, on the season. So I give
them credit, they played hard. Like I said, their coach gets them to play
hard. But we really wanted to attack.  
You know, Kevin, if he's tired‑‑ he went in there a few times and didn't
score. They did a good job on him. He didn't score a basket in the second
half, and I think he got tired. We weren't really that worried about their
shot blocking because we felt, just try to go around them instead of going
through them.  
  
Q. What's the difference in the three ‑ball in the past couple days? Is it
just you guys are making shots? Are you getting better looks?   
COACH LONERGAN: We were shooting so poorly‑‑ early in the year we were playing
great defense and rebounding and we weren't a great shooting team. But then
when February came, we stopped guarding as well and not playing, even
rebounding.  
So to get out of that, we just kept working on our shooting, too. It's hard.
It's hard to rely on defensive rebounding all the time, especially guys that
are not shooting well and scoring, naturally don't play D as well. So I think
it's three, four games in a row now we have hit double figures in
three‑pointers. Even our loss to Davidson, I think we made ten or 12.  
So that makes things a lot easier, that's for sure. I mean, against a 2‑3
zone; at Duquesne, same team, we were up by 38 at our place and hit maybe 14
threes, and we were 2 for our first 20 shots with two airballs.  
So our team, sometimes we get a little tight when things don't go well. But
lately, we've gotten our confidence. Part of that is Yuta. He had a lot of
games where he's 1‑for‑5, 0‑for‑5, and now he's bounced back. And when he hits
shots early, he was terrific. That gave us team confidence. I was actually
asking Joe to step up and try to shoot some more threes.  
  
Q. When they went on that run and cut it to four, and you guys responded
with a run of your own, what were you telling Patricio guarding Mason, the
other guys giving them help what were you telling them to adjust?  
COACH LONERGAN: We were supposed to be hedging out there. I think some of our
bigs got tired and we don't come out and they do a good job screening. But
then I felt that, you know what we got to start scoring again.  
So we were trying to say, hey, let's try to break this press and try to score.
I thought a big play was Patricio had a two‑on‑one with John, inside‑out move,
didn't charge, and then scored, all right. Johnny scored. I thought that was a
big basket just to get some separation.  
I told our guys, we're not playing slow‑down. We want to break this press. We
would have numbers. But press caught us a little bit off‑guard for whatever
reason, and give them a lot of credit. It got them back in the game.

_BROOKLYN, NEW YORK_  
  

GEORGE WASHINGTON  73  
DUQUESNE - 55

  
COACH JIM FERRY: Give a lot of credit to George Washington. Really thought
they came out and were locked in today. They really came out aggressively.
They were hitting on all cylinders offensively early, hitting threes. They
were shredding us at the basket. They really hurt us on the offensive glass
when they did miss.  
I thought we made some pretty good adjustments at halftime, and I thought our
guys really, really played hard and fought back and played with a lot of pride
and passion. Big play, I think we cut it to four and then they made an end one
(ph) which changed momentum a little bit. I thought these guys really fought
to the end.  
It's been a really resilient group. We've gotten significantly better from the
beginning of the season to the end. I was telling these guys, I wish we had
two more weeks left prior; the tournament started a little bit later, I think
we would have been a better team.  
I'm proud of my guys. The guy sitting to my right, I'm just extremely proud of
what he's become as a basketball player, as a leader and as a person. He'll be
a part of this program forever.  
Micah, obviously he's really improved. He's the leader of this group for next
year. We have a lot of guys coming back. Obviously wanted to win this
basketball game, and I think we gained a lot of experience from this trip.  
  
Q. Can you talk about when you first came to Duquesne up until now, how
you've changed not only as a student but as an athlete?  
DOMINIQUE McKOY: Pretty much when I first came, I was not called upon to be a
leader as much because there was already a senior on the team, OB (ph) last
year, he was really our senior. So we listened to him and went to him on a lot
of stuff. But this year, just stepping up and being a leader and sharing my
experience with the young guys and just being there for everybody.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the way you were having to work so hard to get some
open looks tonight and maybe just the returning around wearing you guys out
later in the second half.  
MICAH MASON: Yeah, definitely, George Washington is a good team. First half I
was rushed a couple times. That's why I kind of missed a couple shots. Like I
said, they are a tough defensive team, and couldn't really get what we had to
do.  
  
Q. Actually it's funny because last night we talked about how you all being
like in the Pittsburgh area bring that toughness and that scrappiness each and
every night that you play. Basically, how do you go forward, tell your team,
like even though you didn't come away with a victory ‑‑ I guess you would be
happy as long as you left it on the floor.   
COACH FERRY: Yeah, we spoke about that as a team in the locker room. We were
down 13 at the half and obviously getting out‑played, and we just talked about
playing with toughness and passion the second half. And if they can do it, we
can do it. That's why I said, I give these guys a lot of credit. They have
been resilient all year. We struggled to play on the road this year.  
At home, we were dynamic at times. I thought we came in here this in
tournament, we really fought. I thought last night's game was a real physical
battle against a real big, physical team and so was today. I thought some of
them (were) fatigued. But that's what happens when you don't finish tenth; you
finish at 11th, you have to play an extra night.  
But the biggest thing with this group right now is actually starting to look
forward after this game. Okay, we are disappointed but we got a lot of guys
back for next year. I think we have some of the best backcourt guys in this
conference to build on so we just have to improve from this point.  
  
Q. In the second half it seemed like you really picked it up after your
halftime talk. You were down I think by four at one point. What do you think
happens with your team, like what changed and then what caused you to lose
that lead?  
COACH FERRY: Again, there's always two teams on the basketball court, and
sometimes fans don't understand that; why are you down‑‑ well, there's two
teams playing.  
They came out and they jumped us. They did a really good job of it. I think
our guys kept their composure, it was only 13 at the half but kept their
composure. We made a couple adjustments within the zone and offensively, and I
thought the guys really executed. They really believed in each other and
trusted each other. Played really hard. Our time‑outs, our huddles were great.
Guys believed in each other, even when they went back up, and then we still
came back and cut it down again.  
But then it gets to a point where cut it to four, they get an N1 (ph). We
struggled scoring around the basket. We missed a bunch of layups, and then it
gets to ten or 11, and now we have to press and they finished off the game
like a good team does.  
Again, I thought that was really more of a 10‑point game than it was an
18‑point game. Just they executed down the stretch and they made their plays.
I thought our guys fought to the end. Disappointed getting beat on the glass
like that, but some of it was having to play last night.  
But again, that's part of not finishing in the Top‑10\. And we missed that by
a free throw, a buzzer shot, things like that. We could have been a ten seed
and not have to play the night before. But we did, we came in, we won a game,
and then we got beat in a hard‑fought game tonight.  
  
Q. What were your expectations of GW's 3 ‑point shooting?   
COACH FERRY: You know what they are not a team‑‑ they are good shooters. They
are just guys that take the three‑point shot secondary. Not like Micah who can
fire threes, you know.  
They are very disciplined what they do. They try to get the ball inside but
they do have capable 3‑point shooters. Over the last two and a half weeks,
they have been shooting the ball fantastic. But, when you are a good team like
that, you have to choose our poison. They scored 70 percent of their baskets
are scored inside the paint, okay.  
So going into the game, statistically, and all you analytical guys out there,
you've got to try to take away the paint. Understanding what we did at our
place, we took away the paint and was able to contest the threes better. They
made the proper adjustments.  
Again, the second half, they only made one and then they banked one in
obviously with seconds to go. So I think in our adjustments, we did a decent
job with that. But take it away‑‑ that's a good team when you have a team that
can beat you from inside and out, that's a good team and that's why they have
21 wins.  
  
Q. When you were here in October, you said one of your goals was a national
postseason tournament. What has to change for you guys next year to get to
that point?  
COACH FERRY: Well, we've got to get better. We've got to get better. We have
to add a couple more recruiting classes. This is only our really true second
recruiting class. We got here and took the program over, it was empty. There
wasn't many players here.  
I am disappointed. I thought we should have winning record this year. We lost
so many games: Rhode Island by one; overtime at Saint Joe's; missed 21 free
throws on the road and lost a close game; lost a close game at home where we
got a 3‑pointer blocked at the end and could have won.  
What changes winning seasons and losing seasons are close games like that; I
think so. We have to get better. Everybody has to get better. Our better
players have to get better. Our younger players have to get mature. We have a
really young front court this year. Domo was the only senior in our group.  
We had nine players in our program that were either freshmen, sophomore or new
to the program, and that's a lot. That's a lot, and it took us awhile to
really figure out our identity of what we are and who we are. Now we have a
lot of these guys back and I think we know what our identity is going to be
going forward. Hopefully we can take the proper steps and improve.  
  
Q. Do you see any other comparisons in trying to rebuild here?  
COACH FERRY: I see a lot of comparisons. It takes time. It takes time. When
you're in a monster league like the Atlantic 10 and you see the type of
players other people have and the facilities what you're up against and
coaches and great players, it takes time. Recruiting classes, we have had two
legit recruiting classes, and we are going to need two more to really solidify
the program and what we are going to be. We.  
Are absolutely heading in the right direction. Our players are getting better.
We are getting better as a team. Obviously like we talked about, we need to
continue to get better but it's a process. If you're going to do it right and
you're going to build a program, you have to have some patience and do it the
right way. We're not going to quick fix it here. I'm not one of those guys
that's just taking a bunch transfers every years and a bunch of JuCo guys
every year. We are going to do it the right way. Now we have a foundation set
and you build it from this foundation up.

# [ATLANTIC-10 CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=ATLANTIC-10+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 12, 2015

  

### [DeAndre' Bembry](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28557)

### [Phil Martelli](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16280)

  
_BROOKLYN, NEW YORK_  
  

ST. BONAVENTURE  60  
SAINT JOSEPHS - 49

  
COACH MARTELLI: Well, you know, it's always, in my humble opinion, it's been a
numeric game, whether you are at the top, middle of the league, bottom of the
league, it's a numeric game, and we are sitting here going home losing a game
where we gave up 40 percent field goal, good defense, but the offensive
numbers, we just didn't have it.  
I just told them; I apologized to the team. Should have had more. We actually
spent our time working on offense Monday and Tuesday, but we didn't have it.
Not lack of trying. In some ways, it was very good defense. We missed some
tight shots and got tighter and the room got smaller on us.  
We've got to walk out together, because we walked in together, and started in
September together. It's unfortunate. The toughest day of the year is tomorrow
as a head coach, because you want to believe that you can fix everything if
you just have one more day, and now we don't have one more day. Appreciate
their efforts and look forward to watching a great tournament over the
weekend.  
  
Q. What was it about the way you were shooting the ball tonight that you
never really got going?  
DeANDRE' BEMBRY: Yeah, I was making it very difficult for myself, a lot of the
lanes, floaters, a lot of fadeaway jump spots. I didn't really get my legs
under me on most of them, and a lot of it was contested, as well. Just made it
very difficult.  
  
Q. How difficult is it for you to be in that game when you're not making
shots?  
COACH MARTELLI: Well, it's more as a player. I said it all year: When the ball
doesn't go in the basket, when the ball doesn't go in the basket, you question
yourself as a player. And the ball didn't go in the basket.  
And, you know, even though the number was low, the turnovers, like we had the
lead in the first half, I think ten, and then we had three of our five
first‑half turnovers. They took the lead on a kind of a broken play. James got
the ball and he has played progressively more aggressively during the year,
and on that play, he played passively and threw the ball backwards.  
But when the ball doesn't go in, and I mean this in the most respectful way;
assistant coaches are telling me‑‑ and our defense was predicated on the ball
going in. Every time we scored a basket, we were playing a two‑three zone and
it worked in the first half.  
But in the second half, we came out and had‑‑ I mean, really, we had 17 points
in the second half. We shot, what did we shoot‑‑ it's hard. It's hard. But I
still should have done more for them. Maybe called a different set. It's a
hard game when the ball does not go in the basket.  
  
Q. Not the note you wanted Chris to end his career on, but talk about his
time.  
COACH MARTELLI: Yeah, he's going to graduate in May. He went to three
post‑seasons. He's got a championship ring. And I just said to him, the
highest of the guys‑‑ we're in the same locker room when we played last year
in the championship game. You know, he had the highest of the highs and now
the lowest of the lows. He's not going to be judged on this game. Obviously
this is not a very good game for him.  
But we have all of our locker room and on our boards: "Act like a champion."
It's going to sting. Go into hiding for a couple days with spring break, and
Monday he's got to start with the rest of his life. But he's going to be
successful.  
  
Q. Does that change the game in the second half for you guys ‑‑  
COACH MARTELLI: No, I just think that the basket got smaller. To begin the
second half, we got, we had a nice flow and we missed two layups and missed a
foul shot before the first media time‑out. And there was a little angst. There
was certainly angst.  
And one of the things we talked about is we have been in that situation. Up at
Bonaventure, same game, we had the lead. At Duquesne, we had the lead. You
know, I could rattle these games off; at La Salle, we had the lead at the
half. You judge it, take everything into account.  
But tonight, it was that stretch right away in the start of the second half.
And the looks, some of the looks were hurried. I thought DeAndre' hurried
tonight. And some of the looks were good. But if you shoot a ball in this game
and don't think it's going in, it's not going in. And I think that you could
tell by body language and facial expressions, that we were shooting hoping to
make it, not thinking it was going in.  
  
Q. Obviously field ‑goal percentage numbers are probably the biggest reason
why your team wasn't successful, but do you think Javon found foul trouble,
and then Jai, four first‑half fouls had any impact on the game?   
COACH MARTELLI: No, Jai played how many minutes‑‑ I mean, we are not going to
get many more than 13 over a 40‑minute stretch. And Javon in the second half
didn't have fouls‑‑ no. The referre'ing didn't have anything to with it. Their
number of foul shots didn't have anything to do with it. Plain and simple
offense, plain and simple.  
  
Q. I believe they were plus ‑15 in the second half, or plus‑16\. Does the
pace contribute to that on the glass?   
COACH MARTELLI: No, I don't think the pace did. You know, we are going to look
at it, because like I was just saying, we've had a number of games like this.
I think more mental than anything else‑‑ and then I'll go back and say, okay,
so today we did a walk‑through in the hotel, was that too much, and I have
them off their feet more.  
Everything is in play. Everything is in the conversation. But they played
downhill and we played sideways early in the second half.

### [Tom Pecora](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26625)

### [Christian Sengfelder](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28496)

### [Bryan Smith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26626)

  
_BROOKLYN, NEW YORK_  
  

FORDHAM  71  
GEORGE MASON - 65

  
COACH TOM PECORA: Well, very similar to the game we played down there a few
weeks ago. We were challenged. We knew Eric wasn't going to be 100 percent.
That's 18 points a game for us so one of the guys had to step up.  
I think it's quite fitting that Bryan being a senior and being a few miles
from home in Brooklyn, Midwood High School and all of those things. And being
our lone senior for him to make the play‑‑ I told him I loved him so much
after he had that crazy turnover, still ran a play for him after that on press
offense to get the ball. And Christian, because this is very close to Munich,
as well (laughter). German restaurants to go to around here.  
You know, once again, we're a young team with seven freshmen; but Bryan Smith,
the job Bryan has done throughout the year, whether he's played well or he
hasn't, he has always been a steadying force. He's been tremendous in practice
and he's been great in the locker room and the job he has done has really
allowed Christian and Eric to mature a lot quicker than some of our freshmen
have in the past because they have had great leaders with Bryan Smith, and
Ryan Canty who is out for the year but will be back next year as a fifth‑year
senior.  
Just one of those games where we couldn't get that separation. We talked about
playing better defense but in the second half they were drilling some shots.
We always‑‑ one of our game goals is always to win the battle of the boards;
and we did by two, and Thompson, he's a beast, man.  
So he's really, really difficult to prep for, and we threw three or four
different defensive schemes at him with different people going and doubling
him, doubling him on the catch, doubling him after he dribbled, doubling him
big on big, guard on big. So we just kept him off balance and I think that was
a key for us today.  
  
Q. Bryan, you've been through some ups and downs. How satisfying is it to
get a tournament win for the second year in a row?  
BRYAN SMITH: It's satisfying, we played the same team two years in a row and
to get them both times is a great feeling. We work hard to get wins. We had
some wins that we shouldn't have had and we lost close games but this is very
satisfying.  
  
Q. You and Chris have had chemistry all year round, did you see a
performance in a big game coming from a guy like this who wasn't highly touted
but you noticed from the beginning this kid was going to be special?  
BRYAN SMITH: Definitely. Chris, he works hard every day. That's his demeanor.
He's always a hard worker. He's a good guy. I knew one of those games was
going to happen sooner or later.  
CHRISTIAN SENGFELDER: I appreciate it.  
  
Q. You were driving the basket early in the game and you made 10 out of 13
field goals. Tell us about your shooting game.  
CHRISTIAN SENGFELDER: Could you say the last part again, please.  
  
Q. Just about your game, shooting the ball tonight.  
CHRISTIAN SENGFELDER: That ball, I just want to make some baskets, help the
team win. If I shoot ten out of 13 and we win, I'm happy. I don't know, if I
shoot 5 out of 11, that's fine, too. I'm just trying to help the team win.  
  
Q. Was your first Atlantic 10 Tournament everything you thought it would be,
and maybe even more?  
CHRISTIAN SENGFELDER: I mean, it's great to win an A‑10 game and then to win a
tournament in the Barclays Center and NBA stadium, it's a great feeling, I'm
happy to be here. I'm blessed to be here. I like it.  
  
Q. Did you feel any additional pressure knowing Eric would not be 100
percent tonight?  
CHRISTIAN SENGFELDER: I'm trying to go into games without having pressure at
all. Just try to take the pressure off me. We played the last two games
without Eric and we lost both games so it was a little bit of pressure on me,
and the team, as well, to compensate with Eric out.  
But as I said, I tried to get through the game without pressure, without any
thoughts in my mind. Just play the game.  
  
Q. You have a great game, scored 27 points but how do you turn this around
and prepare for VCU tomorrow?  
CHRISTIAN SENGFELDER: Watch film, talk to coaches. I'm work with Coach Morton.
I work with him, as Bryan said, after practice and we talk about how the
opponent is, how I can play him. I talk to Coach Pecora, Coach Parrotta,
everybody, find weak spots maybe, I don't know. We'll figure it out.  
  
Q. As the elder statesman, what do you tell the freshmen about tournament
play? What's different than your regular A ‑10 game?   
BRYAN SMITH: I tell them that it's much more intense, from tip‑off to when the
clock hits 0:00. That's much the difference right there, I tell them.  
  
Q. As a Brooklyn native, being a local guy here, doing it again and getting
a nice win in your hometown, what is that feeling like?  
BRYAN SMITH: It's a great feeling. I have a lot of friends and family here
cheering me on and cheering the team on. I'm get I get to win in front of
them, especially ten minutes away from where I live.  
  
Q. Two years in a row now with an A ‑10 tournament win, what does that say
to some of the critics that feel the rebuild was a little slow?  
COACH TOM PECORA: Look, it is what it is. I think when you look at Eric being
Rookie of the Year and Christian being on the all‑rookie team, you have
bookends at the three and four spot. We have Canty and Rhoomes coming back
next year to play the five; Mandell, who has basically been playing the point
guard spot for about a month. He'll have a whole spring, summer, under his
belt and fall next year as he prepares. So you'll have a senior point guard
and then Bryan, the only one leaving.  
So I think the future is bright. But that's the way I've always looked at
things, no matter how this season goes with teams. Very rarely have I come out
of a season and said, you know, this team is in trouble for next year.  
What I compliment them on, and you heard me say this before: We had our 88th
practice yesterday and they had three bad practices all year.  
So for a group with this many young people, to just go out and compete like
that every day and not lay an egg, it speaks volumes. They just never quit.
They believe in themselves. They really do.  
And a lot of it comes from these two guys, from Mandell Ryan Rhoomes,
energetic. But I just can't shake Mason. It's like, you know, I've been with
them for so many years with my years in the CAA and everything we went through
in 2006 and then to continue to play them, it just seems like every year in
the A‑10 tournament, we'll get them; we've gotten them, rather.  
So now, we'll just start preparing for VCU is and we'll be up watching film
and be ready for that when we get back here.  
  
Q. You said recently that Eric and Christian have a great relationship. How
fitting is that that Christian stepped up and picked up his injured
teammate?  
COACH TOM PECORA: It's awesome. Once again, you hear it about a lot of kids.
He keeps getting better and better. We have hard, physical practice. I come
back out 20 minutes later and he's out shooting with one of the coaches. He's
just got tremendous attention to detail, work ethic.  
I recruited him like a football coach. We watched him on film, and then after
watching like three or four films of him, I sent Tom Parrotta over to Germany.
And he called; he sent back a picture of him standing next to him to show me
how big he was. And Tommy is almost 6‑6\. "He's big and he's good."  
I said, "Well, bring him, bring him to the Bronx." We were able to get him in
on a visit and it's all worked out. But I'm excited to coach him. He's a lot
of fun to coach.  
  
Q. What's your strategy preparing for back ‑to‑back games with VCU, and you
know they full‑court press all the time.   
COACH TOM PECORA: It's interesting, we haven't‑‑ and I'm probably jinxing
myself, we had some games where we had a lot of turnovers against them but the
key when we have played tight, good close games you is just can't have live
turnovers, can't turn the ball over on the backcourt, can't turn the ball over
when it's live and they can go the other way.  
I'm sure they are all fired up. They have been through a little bit of a rough
patch and I know Shock will have them well prepared. It's mid March. We know
what we have to do and we know how we have to execute against that kind of
pressure, and then we've got to punish them for it. You have to make some
plays on the offensive end after you get by the first wave of pressure.  
  
Q. How different is your team, you lost to them early in the year; how much
more have they matured?  
COACH TOM PECORA: Much better. When I saw the league schedule come out, I was
like, come on, Drew. We open right out of the gate; I know we have a young
team, in January, it's tough. We played VCU and Dayton, the first two home
games, and then we got a GW team in there and our road games were tough.  
But we're more mature. We're playing with a different point guard now with
Mandell. I think Christian's skill set at the four can be very helpful when
you're attacking teams who press. So hopefully all those things come into
play.  
  
Q. A few weeks ago you said you were worried Chris was becoming too much of
a three ‑point shooter but today he was efficient. Talk about how it worked in
his favor today.   
COACH TOM PECORA: I think what he did a great job of in the first half, he
slipped a few screens and he got them off balance with that, got a couple
layups instead of setting his screens.  
So by doing that it really softened them up around the basket. Were concerned
about that, and in turn, he was able to pop and get a couple good looks. It's
a good thing he doesn't really force many shots. I don't remember him,
honestly, I don't remember him getting a three‑pointer blocked this year
because he's got a great feel; if somebody is going to contest it, he's not
going to take it. I think his shot selection is exceptional, as well.  
  
Q. Can I ask you about Mandell's steal? Kind of kept you on a run and that
gave you the edge there.  
COACH TOM PECORA: Yeah, I was shocked he didn't make the all defensive team
because obviously he's not Webber but he was second to him in steals in the
conference. He's a real good defender. He has total freedom to do that. In the
course of what we do, I let him read the quarterback, so to speak, and see if
he can jump a pass and go the other way.  
So that was a big‑time play. At Richmond, about three weeks ago, in a tie game
with a minute to go, he tried to jump one and he missed it by that much and we
lose the game by three. I told him after that, you know, you've got free rein.
His instincts are great and that was a big play for us because we were
struggling at the offensive end. You miss some free throws and we are the best
free throw shooting team in the conference, we are up in the 80 percentiles
there. That hurt us a little bit there.

## March 11, 2015

  

### [Paul Hewitt](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14139)

### [Isaiah Jackson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28497)

  
_BROOKLYN, NEW YORK_  
  

FORDHAM  71  
GEORGE MASON - 65

  
COACH PAUL HEWITT: Congratulations to Tom and his team. Wish them luck
tomorrow night. I thought we battled pretty hard. The young man, Sengfelder
played a terrific game, played a great basketball game.  
Prepared for their ball‑swinging attack. I thought we did a pretty decent job
on them but they made some shots. We did some things in the first half to try
to break their rhythm a little bit; it worked early. The latter part of the
half, they sorted to solve it a little bit but again they still have to make
shots. It wasn't a case of making layups all the time. They knocked down some
shots to stretch our defense.  
Congratulations to Tom and his team and I wish them luck tomorrow night.  
  
Q. Can you talk about what they were doing to make the difference? They
forced some turnovers down the stretch. What did they to do make the
difference and get the edge?  
ISAIAH JACKSON: The last steal, ball was stolen off a pass, switched it, is
what they called it, so they kind of switched the screen. Blew through the
pass and I guess I didn't throw a strong enough pass. Kind of just throw it,
went down there, seemed like got an easy dunk. Kind of that was a big swing in
the game, late in the game. That's about it that I know.  
Four straight for Fordham over George Mason. Anything special they do or just
a matchup?  
COACH PAUL HEWITT: They do a good job there with those ball screens,
especially the one where they set at a different angle, called an angle screen
and five play.  
But at the same time, in the first half, we had some turnovers that really put
us in the hole. We had eight turnovers in the first half. I thought we played
pretty decent, shot the ball well, shot over 48 percent, or at 48 percent. But
the ball screen defense is the thing that we still didn't do a good job with.  
  
Q. The end of another pretty tough year and there's been a fair amount of
speculation where you stand. Do you have any thoughts about what your job
security is? Have you had any discussions with your boss about whether or not
you'll be back next year?  
COACH PAUL HEWITT: Obviously I understand your question but it's not something
you think about during the season. You think about winning the next basketball
game. At some point I'm sure we'll sit down and talk.

_BROOKLYN, NEW YORK_  
  

DUQUESNE  61  
SAINT LOUIS - 55

  
COACH JIM FERRY: I thought that was just a really intense, physical A‑10
battle. That's what it was. I thought they really came after us defensively.
Both teams guarded really well and grinded out. I'm really proud of our guys.
I thought our guys really stayed true to who we are and what we are going to
do. Defended really well, rebounded when we needed it and played really
unselfishly. I thought it was a great win for our program.  
  
Q. You came out of the locker room, hit two threes and you were part of two
back ‑to‑back threes, then you hit a couple. What's going through your mind
coming out of the locker room?   
MICAH MASON: Just to stay aggressive. Make sure I have confidence in my next
shot and that's just the main thing. My teammates had me in good spots tonight
and I knocked them down.  
  
Q. In the second half when there's that play when the pass to you was over
your head and you kind of saved it behind your back, and there was another
pass saving from going into the backcourt, was that a big spark at that
point?  
MICAH MASON: Yeah, I thought it was over my head for a second. We just had to
make big plays like that if we wanted to win this game. Saint Louis came out
and it was a war from start to finish, and we're just glad we came out on top
tonight.  
  
Q. Both of you played 40 minutes full game, how do you recover going into
tomorrow?  
JEREMIAH JONES: We've just got to go back to the hotel and get some rest. Our
trainers will take care of us. Our coaches will make sure we do a good job
staying off our feet. This isn't the first game we've played this amount of
minutes, although we haven't played many back‑to‑back‑‑ well, not any
back‑to‑backs. We'll get some rest and we'll be ready to go tomorrow.  
COACH JIM FERRY: Come on, you're 21 years old.  
  
Q. What's it like, Derrick scores ten points in the last ten minutes. What's
it like when he gets going?  
JEREMIAH JONES: Oh, man, well, he's a great player, and he got off to a slow
start. But, you know, with him, it's only a matter of time before he gets
going. We really needed that spark to help us win.  
MICAH MASON: I think he covered it pretty well.  
  
Q. Was this game kind of a continuation of the two games you played against
them in the regular season?  
COACH JIM FERRY: I tell you what, this was significantly more physical than
the prior two games. When you look at statistics, it was almost the same score
at their place as it was at our place. It was, you know, same amount of
baskets, rebounds.  
So I knew it was going to be tough just the way we matchup with each other. I
think Jim is one of the best coaches in the country, and I knew he was going
to have those guys ready to defend, and they really did. This game was just
significantly more physical.  
It wasn't the same because they got up double digits on us at their place; we
got double digits on them at our place. It was really difficult and kind of
nip and tuck the whole way here.  
  
Q. In the first half, the team shot 1 ‑from‑9 from the three. When you saw
the long‑range shot wasn't falling, the team was running fast breaka lot,
pushing the ball; was that a concerted effort?  
COACH JIM FERRY: That's what we do. We play at a high tempo. I think we are
the second‑fastest team in the conference next to Davidson. We play at a high
tempo. We wanted to get out in conversion and we wanted to challenge them.  
We are also the second‑best three‑point shooting team in the conference. When
we started 1‑for‑9, I thought the guys got a little bit tight. But just told
them, relax and just play, and they did a great job of it. I thought they
really responded, both Micah and D.C. and Jeremiah.  
  
Q. You've won two in a row away from home now. How does it feel?  
COACH JIM FERRY: I'll take them anywhere. You win them, doesn't matter. This
was a neutral site. I always look at neutral sites significantly different
than away games. This time of year we could be playing at Tillery Street Park
right now. It really doesn't matter.  
  
Q. You talked about your team finding itself quite a bit this year. There
were a couple sequences there where you have a great defensive stand and turn
it over. Is it gut ‑wrenching to think how close you are to really putting
that game away?   
COACH JIM FERRY: Yeah, but it's still the experience of being on a big stage.
I thought we played fast, we were trying to push it, kind of threw the ball
away. And let's credit them defensively. They are an outstanding defensive
team and that plays into some turnovers, as well.  
  
Q. What are your thoughts on playing GW tomorrow to split the season
series?  
COACH JIM FERRY: I think it's going to be just like this. I think it's going
to be a physical battle. Mike does a great job with that team. They are big,
they are physical. The thing about GW is they know who they are and they don't
vary from what they do. They try to pound you on the inside.  
Joe McDonald is a great point guard. That's a really good team with a lot of
experience. Having gone to the NCAA Tournament last year, I think it's going
to be just like this. I think it's going to be a battle. I'm going to get
these guys back to the hotel, got to get them fed and rested up and get them
refocused for what's the next task at hand.  
  
Q. What did the seven blocks by Lewis mean?  
COACH JIM FERRY: It was shoot, literally, he would shoot. I thought it was
great. He gave us such a presence on the back line of our zone that allowed us
to guard more aggressively. So when anyone went to the basket, they were
things being challenged around that. I thought he was tremendous today.

_BROOKLYN, NEW YORK_  
  

DUQUESNE  61  
SAINT LOUIS - 55

  
COACH JIM CREWS: Well, I thought these guys, our guys, did a good job of
preparing for the last three days. We had three good days and two good days of
practice. We didn't practice Sunday but three really good days and I thought
they competed really hard. Thought we executed well offensively. We handled
the ball well.  
I thought we got good looks. We knocked some good looks in and we had quite a
few that went in and out. Inside was problematic at times. We didn't quite use
the angles or make the extra pass and we were able to get some blocks from
that standpoint. You know, these two guys did an exceptionally good job, I
thought tonight both defensively and offensively, and that was good.  
So due cane, give them credit, they got on top and we couldn't quite stop
them. I know the first time possessions in the second half, got 13 points and
five for five out of 13 points and that got us off to a rocky start. Our guys
hung in there but just couldn't quite get over the hump at the end the last
couple minutes.  
  
Q. Obviously it was a tight game. What did you feel it came down to at the
end?  
MARCUS BARTLEY: We just didn't get the right stops when we needed to and that
just goes along with executing what Coach wants us to do and we just missed
open shots. So just got to come back stronger next year.  
MIKE CRAWFORD: Yeah, we just didn't execute on defense, and at the end, and
shots just didn't fall.  
  
Q. Where do you draw hope for the future?  
MARCUS BARTLEY: It's been a tough season. We didn't have the season that we
wanted to have but we are just going to learn from it, we are going to, would
harder and we are definitely going to come back really strong next year and we
are going to always have this feeling in the back of our minds whenever we are
working out this summer. So we are going to be hungry.  
MIKE CRAWFORD: Yeah, pretty much just reiterate what he said. We are going to
come back. This year wasn't the best and wasn't what we wanted this year but
we are going to come back next year, work all summer, work all spring and
compete a lot better next year.  
  
Q. Inside strike a big factor; was that the overriding factor?  
COACH JIM CREWS: Probably was. I thought that we got the ball in there deep,
and Lewis in particular, did a great job of‑‑ good timing and well disciplined
with it. You have to get angles on him; or use a shot fake and he goes for
that, that's great; and if he doesn't go for it you have to make an extra pass
and you can't just go in there and try to shoot over a guy with that length.
We did that too often.  
  
Q. Talk about the energy leading up to this game, players talking to each
other more out on the court. Did you see that more this game than the past
two?  
COACH JIM CREWS: Yeah, I think we've grown in that. We have some guys, it's
interesting, we have got some quiet guys. But also at the same token, as I've
told them, if they were around the dinner table or we are in the bus, they are
pretty engaging and pretty lively and high‑energy personalities.  
On the court, we are not like that in terms of communicating, like you said. I
think they have grown a little bit and gotten a little bit better. I think
Davell Roby has done a good job in the early stage of being a leader. He wants
to be a leader and try to be a leader, and is making the extra effort to do
so, so that's been encouraging.  
  
Q. Is there hope in that, and is that part of the problem in a way, that you
are dealing with as a team?  
COACH JIM CREWS: Well, we had a lot of freshmen. We had a lot of sophomores
and guys who are juniors, seniors, have not played, so everyone on our team
was inexperienced. When you have that, there's a lot of different issues that
you're dealing with constantly throughout.  
First, everyone is competitive and they want to play and they are just trying
to‑‑ I don't want to use the word "survive," but they are trying to get
through it and manage. And when you do that, sometimes you lose a scope of the
team. And that's just a little bit of human nature, not that they are selfish,
but they are just trying to figure it out themselves.  
And so at the same time, most situations, when the guys are trying to figure
it out, they can look to the left or right and there's someone that does have
it figured out. And then we don't have that, because just the situation,
that's just how it is. It's not a negative. It's just what it is.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 20, 2015

  

### [Bruce Weber](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14492)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Coach Bruce Weber of Kansas State. Coach,
welcome, and your thoughts on the upcoming season?  
  
COACH WEBER: We're excited. I think we have a new group, a lot of new faces.
For our staff, it's been a fun summer and fall into practice.  
  
Got a group that works very hard, very coachable, and play hard. I think our
biggest obstacles will be so many new faces, the inexperience, and then just
the injuries. Getting somebody back like D.J. Johnson coming off a couple foot
surgeries and being out 16 months, it's going to take him a little bit of
time.  
  
Carlbe Ervin, one of our new guys who is coming off a little procedure, it's
taken him a little bit of time. So staying healthy, just getting that
experience.  
  
And then kind of mixing it together, our older returning players from D.J.
Johnson, Wesley Iwundu, Justin Edwards, Steven Hurt, mixing in the new guys
and finding a nice balance and good group that I think will be very
competitive.  
  
Q. Coach, typically coaches like to use their shortcomings from the
previous season to work with the group and motivate the new group. But when
you talked to us at K-State Media Day last week, you said you were trying to
distance yourself as much as possible from what happened last year. Why is
that and what is the new motivation you're using with your team?  
COACH WEBER: I think the biggest thing is we don't need negativity. Part of
the good positive energy focused on what's at hand.  
  
Last year is over, it's done with. It's been well-documented. We had our
struggles and we had some really nice moments also. But at the same time,
let's focus on today, tomorrow, just staying positive and coming together as a
group that enjoys each other and is coachable, as I said. You can't do
anything about what happened in the past. But you can control what you do at
practice today, what you do tomorrow, a week or two weeks from now in an
exhibition game and be ready for those.  
  
Q. Can you kind of define Steven Hurt's control? Does it change at all?
He seems like a guy that's drifted outside some on offense, but does he have
to be a big rebounder for you inside?  
COACH WEBER: I think the biggest thing for him, just like Justin Edwards, it's
an adjustment. Big 12 basketball, best conference in the country, RPI the last
couple years. Every game you're playing against high-level coaches, you're
playing against high-level players. It took them a little bit of time to
figure it out.  
  
Also, we had to figure it out. Last year a lot of our stuff was geared on
Thomas Gipson going inside. That's where he was good.  
  
Now I think Steven, his best attributes on the offensive end are definitely
his shooting, facing up, shooting the 15, 17 footer, even out to three. So
we've got to find ways to get him baskets, get him open so he can shoot the
ball. At the same time, we've been on him, he has to be a presence on the
defensive end inside. He is our big body. He's going to have to deal with the
contact, clog the lane up. He's going to have to rebound.  
  
The other day, in the scrimmage, he was our leading rebounder, which is a
positive thing. He's not one of those flying around guys that are going to be
getting these dunks and all these rebounds. But he has to be solid and do his
job on a daily basis, and that's going to help us.  
  
Q. Coach, you mentioned Steven and Justin. How much more after their
first year at K-State, how much more can you expect from them the second year
after that learning curve?  
COACH WEBER: I hope a lot. I know they expect that. They've had, again, some
nice moments. Steven Hurt at Oklahoma last year, huge game, did some big time
things.  
  
Justin, games against Kansas, Iowa State down the stretch. These are top
teams. These are Sweet Sixteen teams, and top teams in the conference and they
played well. So they use that as a positive motivator. They knew they had to
work a little harder to compete. You're competing against some of the top
players in the country. That work ethic, getting your bodies right, putting in
the time. I believe that they're going to take a nice step forward.  
  
Q. You had mentioned on Saturday that you liked this group or you love
this group, and you believe that they can be competitive and maybe shock some
people down the road. What kind of opportunity is this for you to do that with
ten newcomers? And do you like this role, so to speak?  
COACH WEBER: Well, I like the team, as you mentioned, and it's fun to coach
them every day you go. They haven't been perfect by any means, but I'd say
nine out of the first ten days we just coached them. We didn't have to beg
them to go hard or get after them to go hard, so that makes it a lot easier.  
  
Now you can worry about the stuff you're supposed to worry about, you know,
setting up the angle on the screen, the defense, getting in the right position
or how you're going to guard something and you're not wasting at much time.  
  
I think the injuries are a big thing. I've said all along, we get experience,
we get healthy and stay healthy. Then you've got to win some close games.  
  
I think we saw it with our football program. You lose two heartbreakers and
it's -- you know, you worry about your team going one way or another, and then
you have a big letdown, like they did the other day. Now they've got to
rebound from that.  
  
I think that is the key. You win some games early. They can be ugly, but you
win them. You start feeling good about yourself, and then that goes a long way
as you get into the season.  
  
Q. Coach, we just heard from the coordinator of men's basketball
officials about quite an extensive amount of rules changes. Freedom of
movement, hand checking, the elimination of the five-second count. What are
you and your coaching staff going to do to help the players adjust with so
many different changes this year?  
COACH WEBER: It's something we've addressed since our league meetings back in
May, and talking with Curtis, and talking to him throughout this summer.  
  
For me, with the shot clock, just watching NBA games, watching the flow of the
game, I don't want to have bad shots at the end of the shot clock. I want to
have good shots. We're going to have to work harder earlier to get those good
shots and have good flow to our offense.  
  
The defensive part, we've always taken a lot of pride in being physical, being
aggressive. It's going to be that fine line. I think with a young team and
inexperienced team, we've got to be more of a team defense, helping people. So
it will be interesting to see how it all unfolds.  
  
I've already had officials come twice to practice. We're going to have it
another time this week and a couple times next week when we've got an
exhibition game. So I hope we're helping the guys adjust to it.  
  
I think we're going to watch the video as a staff. We watched it with the
officials, and then the new officiating video. Then I've never done it with
the players, but I've thought about doing it with the players also. This is as
much as we can help them and tutor them and help them understand earlier, I
think it will benefit our staff and the players.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 20, 2015

  

### [Tubby Smith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13960)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Texas Tech coach Tubby Smith, coach, welcome, and your thoughts
about the upcoming season?  
  
COACH SMITH: Well, good morning. We're excited about this coming season as we
usually are. It's doing what we love to do. We've got a great group of kids
returning. It will still be a very young team, but we have improved a lot.  
  
Q. What is the biggest area of improvement you've seen in your five
sophomores so far?  
COACH SMITH: Well, strength. Obviously just a year of conditioning and weight
training. I think that's helping. The experience of playing in the Big 12, and
I think the foreign tour we took helps us realize that their maturity level,
that they've improved in all areas pretty much.  
  
Q. We just heard Curtis Shaw talk a bunch about improving the game,
making it more watchable, that sort of thing. There's been some talk about
schedule shifts, maybe trying to push things back a little bit and not compete
as much against football. What is your thoughts on any of that as it relates
to scheduling specifically?  
COACH SMITH: Well, everything is evolving. It's always changing, and we have
to change with the times. There was talk about changing the seasons years ago
because it's a two-semester sport that crosses over into -- and you always
want to think about the student-athletes when we make these decisions.  
  
I think the rule changes that they want to implement are to help to improve
the game, speed the game up some, but also to give the players more freedom to
express themselves and play the game the way we wanted to see it played.
Because we are in an entertainment field, as well as an educational field, so
we know that.  
  
But all of the things that they're trying to explore or change should be --
the student-athletes well-being should be kept in mind, and we're heading in
the right direction in that regard.  
  
Q. What is the biggest challenge for you in trying to rebuild this
program in such a talented league?  
COACH SMITH: Well, believing. When you've struggled so long to win, like we
have at Texas Tech, just changing the mindset and the culture. Although we
have great fans and great student support on our campus, and in Lubbock in
general, there are a lot of great fans, we still have to continue to grow the
program when it comes to recruiting to keep improving, whether it's facilities
or other areas. We know that the competition is stiff no matter where in
trying to influence or persuade down the middle to attend the university.  
  
But always, Kirby Hocutt, our AD, and Duane Nellis, our president -- our
school is growing. We have the largest freshman class we've ever had, over
35,000 students. All those things are pointing us in the right direction.  
  
I think in basketball in particular, men's basketball, we're on the right
track. We have the right kids on board. It's just a matter of time and
continuous improvement from the skillset.  
  
It helped with access to the players last summer. We went on a foreign tour.
Those things have been beneficial. So I think it's going to be much more
competitive this year.  
  
Q. Earlier this year you were part of a group of coaches who developed a
new association for minority hirings. I wonder if you can give us an update
six months on about how that is going. Also, by my count, I think more
minority coaches lost their jobs and left their jobs that were hired again
this season. Just your thoughts on that trend?  
COACH SMITH: Well, it used to be the BCA, the Black Coaches Administration,
which I'm proud I was one of the charter members when we first started it back
in '85, '86, and it made a difference. There were a lot of changes taking
place. There were very few African-American or minority coaches at the
Division 1 level. Assistant coaches at the time, I was an assistant coach at
Virginia Commonwealth University at the time. It was a little uneasy.  
  
But as far as what we were trying to achieve, I think John Thompson, Nolan
Richardson, and Don Cherry were guys that were pioneers and kind of paved the
way for many of us native African or minority coaches. So we want to continue
that trend.  
  
I know the NCAA has programs to try to -- the NBA, the NFL, there are a lot of
programs that have been implemented to help minority coaches prepare
themselves, and that's where this program is, preparation, and preparing and
addressing some of the issues that may affect our student-athletes. Not so
much hiring or firing of coaches, because we know it's more than just a
dollar. There is a lot that goes into those circumstances and those
situations. But you have to be able to have a voice and be able to speak for
-- that's what this organization is about.  
  
Norvell and Ricky Lefft are two people that are heading up this program. We
have a number of coaches that have joined. So I think it's going to be
beneficial. It's still in the infancy stage and it's going to take some time
to address a lot of issues, especially the most important one that we're
trying to address is how the new academic eligibility and standards will
affect minority students.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 20, 2015

  

### [Shaka Smart](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21504)

  
_Irving, Texas_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Coach Shaka Smart from Texas. Coach, welcome,
and your thoughts on the upcoming season?  
  
COACH SMART: Good morning, everybody. Excited to be here in Kansas City, and
really, really excited about being the head coach at the University of Texas.  
  
Practice is about two and a half weeks gone so far for us. We're really
excited about what's coming. Our guys are getting tired of playing against
each other. But they've been terrific in practice. They've worked really hard.
I think they've been extremely receptive since day one, on April 3rd, when we
arrived in Texas.  
  
Now the next step for us is putting that in place against opponents, against
other teams. We haven't had any games yet, so we're champing at the bit to get
on the court. I believe it's 24 days until our first game.  
  
Q. Coach, welcome to the Big 12. What do you see as your biggest
challenge or primary challenge in your first season at Texas?  
COACH SMART: I think your biggest challenge in your first year is always
implementing your philosophy, your way of doing things. People want to use the
word "culture", your culture, because whether you're taking over a veteran
team or a younger team, whether you've brought in new guys or it's mostly
returning guys. Everyone is new to what you're going to do at that new
institution. So the biggest challenge is getting on the same page, players,
coaches, everyone that's part of our program, and us being connected around
one goal, connected around a process for accomplishing that goal.  
  
Q. The other day pace of play, and I was wondering do you have a
statistic in mind or metric in mind that you judge that, yes, this is a
successful pace that I want to go at?  
COACH SMART: Not necessarily. We do look at a lot of different statistics. To
be honest with you, we have statistics up to our ears. Sometimes I think you
can get bogged down by that stuff, so you've got to be careful not to become
obsessed with them. But I think they can give you an indication of the way a
game's going.  
  
Certainly possessions in the game is one statistic you can look at. I think
points per game is obviously an important one. You want to be putting points
on the board. How many points you're giving up is obviously relative to how
much you're scoring.  
  
But for us, we also look at how quickly we're shooting, and how quickly the
other team's shooting, the shot clock. It's going to be interesting with the
new shot clock how that changes not only the way that other teams play in
general, but the way that they try to play against us.  
  
Q. In the past your teams have been smaller and you've had that pace of
play. Now you inherit a Texas team that last year had one of the biggest
(indiscernible) in the country. So how has that adjustment been?  
COACH SMART: It's been interesting. I think one thing that's maybe a misnomer
about our teams at VCU is that we didn't have good players up front. We had
some really good players. In fact, every year our starting four or five led us
in scoring in the six years I was there. But we just played a very fast-paced
style where the guards really made a lot of plays in the open floor.  
  
At Texas, we're fortunate, in this first year, we have a lot of big guys that
we think can be really good players for us and contribute to success. Then we
also have a lot of perimeter guys that we can play with, with great depth. So
if those guys, again, can buy into the system of playing with great
aggressiveness and enthusiasm, togetherness, then we'll have a chance to do
some big things.  
  
Q. You mentioned getting guys to buy in, and you've got a couple of
veterans in Isaiah, especially. Is it easier to get guys to buy in when you
have veterans or is there a benefit to having older guys who maybe have been
in another system and you're inheriting them?  
COACH SMART: Well, I'd rather have older guys than younger guys. We have one
of the more experienced teams around, not just in this league, but I think
around the country.  
  
At the same time, there are a lot of experienced teams in this league. But
sometimes guys that have been playing for a while maybe have a certain way
that they think is going to create success for them. A big part of a coach's
job, I learned this from Billy Donovan, is to clearly define and hold
accountable what goes into winning. So that's our job as coaches is to get
these guys to understand what we feel is going to go into our team being
successful and our guys individually having success.  
  
Q. You came from a very tough conference where you can get a tough game
night in and night out. You come to the Big 12 where from top to bottom anyone
can beat you. Does the mindset change going into the conference season knowing
that there are no easy outs on any given night?  
COACH SMART: No, it doesn't change because that's the way you feel about your
team whatever league you're in. I think if you ask coaches around the country
in any conference, they're going to tell you their league is hard. Now clearly
this is one of the best and it's one, as you mentioned, it's not one of those
leagues with 14, 15 teams where there's a few teams at the bottom that you can
count on beating, whether it's at home or on the road. This is such a
challenging league. It's a true round robin.  
  
But to be honest, our focus primarily is on our non-conference schedule
because that's what comes first. We've got to do a great job establishing who
we are in November and December. And then if we can continue to get better, I
think the same things go into winning when you're playing a non-conference
team that go into winning when you're playing in league play. Obviously, the
stakes are higher, the crowds are more loud, they're more into the game.  
  
And certainly, as a new coach in the Big 12, I'm going to have to get to know
what this league's all about, particularly on the road.  
  
Q. You just talked about what you learned from Billy Donovan in terms of
instilling the winning. Just curious, this was a team that last year had
trouble closing out games. Struggled down the stretch, losing a lot of close
games. How do you get them over that hump? How do you instill that confidence
at closing time?  
COACH SMART: To be honest with you, we're not focused a whole lot on the past.
I think you can learn from the past. It's something to grow from. But our
focus is moving forward.  
  
How do we instill a winning atmosphere, winning mentality? Again, I think it
starts from being highly connected around having the same goal and the same
process for reaching that goal. You can't have that unless there is a genuine
love and appreciation and care for one another. Now we're talking about deeper
stuff beyond even basketball. As a basketball program, we need to get to know
each other. We need to develop that bond. The last six months have been
terrific in that way.  
  
But we have faced very, very little adversity in the off-season. Now we get
into the season and we play against teams that are really talented and want to
win just as bad as we do, that's when you start seeing adversity and now you
have to respond.  
  
To be honest, the adversity is what allows you to grow even more. So we do
have some guys and a lot of the older guys have been through some challenging
times at different times in their career. Hopefully they can use those
experiences and grow from them.  
  
Q. You've got a lot of guards that kind of combo-type guys that can
handle the ball. Obviously Isaiah's going to play a lot of point guard minutes
for you. Who do you see filling that secondary point guard role for you, and
how important is that going to be in your half court?  
COACH SMART: Yeah, it's going to be big. Actually, Isaiah finds a way to get
off the point guard position quite a bit in practice. And again, that's
because as you mentioned, we have some other guys that can handle the ball and
play that point guard position. He'll start there, unless something crazy
happens.  
  
Then we do have some other guys that I think will play in addition to Isaiah
at that position. Javan Felix has a lot of experience playing the point spot.
Demarcus Holland, although his primary position is off the ball, he can
certainly play some point guard. And Kerwin Roach is a freshman that's played
in practice quite a bit. I'd say 90% of his reps have been at the point guard
spot. Though when he is in there with Isaiah or Javan, he's very capable of
playing off the ball.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 20, 2015

  

### [Curtis Shaw](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25991)

  
_Kanasa City, Missouri_  
  
CURTIS SHAW: The new style of play, the new rules, I know it's something
you're asking questions about. In my 30 years of college basketball, this is
by far and away the most important year I've ever seen. The Men's Basketball
Committee, the NABC, the NCAA, and the new men's oversight committee all said
our game has to change for all the various reasons that we know, whether you
want to say it's scoring, whether you want to say it's style of play, whether
it's fan interest, it really didn't matter. This all came together to bring in
the most changes I've ever seen in college basketball.  
  
I was actually the representative to the Rules Committee this year from the
coordinators, so I was in the room for two days and heard everything that went
on that was talked about, how we discuss things. And truthfully they came in
with an agenda we have to change.  
  
We also decided that in order to change, the new rules help us start that, but
truly it's going to be about the way the game's officiated. So we came up with
what we call the five major changes in basketball. Everybody's going to
understand the 30-second shot clock instead of 35. I will tell you all the
data we had. Coach Huggins kind of just said it. That five seconds did not
make a lot of difference. It raised the number of possessions by like 0.6 a
game per team. So it wasn't really enough to matter.  
  
What will matter is the style that we are now going to officiate the game,
which allows teams to get off better shots. You heard Coach Huggins say
something about just more bad shots. We have to allow our players, as great of
athletes as they are, to have the ability to get into their offense and get a
good-looking basketball shot.  
  
So really everything the Rules Committee did, and we as coordinators did after
that, is to allow our players to play basketball. We somehow lost focus on the
fundamental skills and we're going to try to bring that back.  
  
We also understand this is going to be a painful process. The NCAA is doing a
media blitz that will come out as the season goes on, talking about we
understand this could hurt early. This may look ugly at times and it may take
getting used to. But for the first time, they're willing to stomach it and
live through it.  
  
I heard somebody asked Coach Drew about a couple years ago, we started this
and we kind of stopped, and we did. Because midstream we kind of changed our
rules and interpretations. We now understand we cannot do that.  
  
I talked to the NBA, which in the early '90's had to change their game, and
the NBA said, hey, we had 30 teams and only 60 referees, and it took us over
two years to change our game. We've got over 800 Division 1 referees and
300-something schools, why do you think you can fix it in two months?  
  
So we know this is going to be a painful process, but the more we do like this
-- I go around and visit all the schools. I'm actually going to be at the West
Virginia-Temple scrimmage. This is where we're going to get the work done so
by the time we play and get into the conference season, hopefully it gets
better.  
  
So let me show a little video about the five major changes, give you some
ideas of what we are going to do and then I'll take questions.  
  
[Video playing]. The perimeter hand checks game in two years ago and we
started out pretty well. Lot of fouls early, but players started to adjust.
Two hands, forearm, a body bump, any of these things, it's a defensive player
initiating forward into the ball handler, we're going to have a whistle.  
  
Yeah, that means no more hot stove. What we're going to do, is if the
offensive player is stationery, and you're coming out to measure up on defense
with while they're stationery, we might let you get their space. As soon as
the offensive player starts to move in any direction, there is no hot stove?  
  
Here's an example of where we've allowed a player to put a forearm on a ball
handler right there and ride him all the way to the basket. We found out
through watching lots of video that that forearm knocks the ball handler just
off balance where he can't turn the corner and then execute the shot. So any
long contact left on the player who beat you will be called.  
  
Again, as soon as the player tries to turn the corner, defense into initial
position and initiate contact into the ball handler, we want an automatic
whistle.  
  
Hold the tape just a second. At times we talk about, well, we're disrupting
them, what if we've got them beat and they can go for lay-up. Unfortunately,
we've seen over the years, we try to hold our whistle, let them finish the
play, and if something happens at the rim and they don't finish the play, then
the coach ends up mad that we didn't call it earlier. We have told the
referees, contact initiated by the defense, call it immediately, and let the
players adjust.  
  
The second part is the same type of contact, players off the ball, cutters,
different players in the post, trying to post. But we've got to stop this kind
of contact so we allow our offenses to run movement. There it was right in the
post.  
  
In the center of the lane you see, as the cutter goes through, the defender
steps out and chucks him. It's a thing that's been taught, it's a thing that's
been accepted, and it's a major change for how we're going to referee the
play, and the players have to learn to defend it. The only way you can stop a
cutter who is illegally cutting through is beat them to the spot with your
body and stay in front of them. In no way you can initiate into them with an
arm, a hip, anything. You have to be legal.  
  
Again, the player away from the ball. Cutter trying to go down the middle of
the lane. 25 just steps out and chucks him off his drive. Again, he's not
legal. He's never in legal guarding position. He's sliding sideways and
initiates the contact. Even though the ball is not involved, we want these
plays called. Even if the ball is 40 feet away on the other side of the floor,
our players have to be able to get in their offense, so we want these plays
called instantly.  
  
You can see the guard out front with his hands up, that's a great ploy they
learned to do. Look, my hands are up, we're chesting, riding the players out
with our body. Right now, he goes forward, drives the player backwards, never
in legal position. This is a foul.  
  
Watch the player come in, sticks the left hand out and then initiates with the
body, that's going to be automatic. The players got really good two years ago
at leading with a low forearm, thinking they were getting away with it. That
is a foul now.  
  
Part three is post play. We don't want mosh pits, and unfortunately, that's
what we got to. We lost the art of boxing out legally, and we have to get that
back. You'll see a good example here of where they're trying to do --
actually, this is just posting up play, not rebounding. If an offensive player
makes a legal post-up, which means they're in this position and they get the
defense pinned on the back side, and they can move their back side to maintain
it, we're not going to let them use a knee, a swim stroke or any other
movement to get around.  
  
I've had coaches going around saying, well, how do we defend the post? I said
you've either got to front, beat them to the spot, double team or play from
behind. You cannot, when you lose position, just displace the player who has
gotten in legal position.  
  
Great example with the knees and with the chest, the players throw their hands
out, but then watch the knee in the post here. Left knee, rides him out. Left
knee again. That's never legal. Hence the call. Even though the ball's not
involved in the play, we're going to call these immediately.  
  
What we allowed the defense to do that we've never done before to offset this,
because our lane truthfully isn't wide enough, when a player can get the ball
on the low block, he's only about four feet from the rim. So if we allowed the
offensive player to catch the ball and the defender had to back off, he took
one back dribble and he's at the rim. So we put in the rule that allows a
defensive player to use a forearm bar in the back against an offensive player
with the back to the basket in the low post area.  
  
The post area is defined as three feet wide of each side of the lane all the
way to the free-throw line. So any player in that area with or without the
ball, back to the basket is considered a post player. So you are now allowed
to brace on defense. That doesn't mean shove them off, doesn't mean pop them,
but brace, so that when a player catches the ball in the post, you have a
chance to defend without him backing you down.  
  
This is going to do two things. It will stop the wrestling, and number two,
we're hoping it helps our post players learn an offensive move. If somebody as
big as Rico, for example, gets posted up on somebody my size, I've got no
chance if I have to do this. But if I can do this, I can brace him. Then what
we've learned from NBA players are the good offensive players learn to use the
pressure to know which way to spin and make their move to the goal. So we're
hoping this will help our players learn some offensive post skills and not
just physical post skills.  
  
The other thing we looked at in the post is so many times we were allowing the
first player to come down, displace and hit, and the second player retaliate.
So we worked hard all summer and following our clinics on finding that first
contact. Whether you're offense or defense, if you make the first illegal
contact, you want it called.  
  
Right here on offense, 55 steps out and just displaces it. We don't get that,
so we come across the lane and it's going to get worse. Again, it's not about
the bigger body winning. It's about playing basketball, beating your opponents
to the same spot, and maintaining your position.  
  
Watch the post play here. Pretty good so far. Now the offensive player decides
he wants to get around the league with the defender, he's going to do the old
swim stroke and can't believe it's a foul. But we want this called every time.
We have to get the first player. That's perfectly legal defense. That's a
swim. Automatic call whether the ball's involved or not.  
  
Post players have to learn if they're in legal position, they're great. If
not, you cannot use an illegal move to get there.  
  
Again, offense is in the post. He saw 55 when he came down. The first move he
made was stick his arm straight up. We have talked to referees. When a player
posts up with his arm out, that's an immediate red flag. The defender then
tries to come through that arm to guard, it's got to be a foul on the
offensive post. You cannot allow them to hold you here or here, because as
soon as you do that, the defensive player is going to fight through and we end
up in a wrestling match and usually get the second guy. This is an automatic
red flag to watch for the foul.  
  
Here's the rebounding part I started talking about, this has to clean up. You
have to learn to get in front of the player, legally box with your butt and
hold them off. If you do that, we're not going to allow the player from behind
to displace you. You'll see on this one, it's pretty obvious. He's beaten to
the spot, so he rides them out like a football block. Those are automatic
fouls. We have to clean up this foul of rebound.  
  
The second part we want to do is eliminate the face-up chuck, turn and box.
That is not a legal box out. If I run into a player to box him, and initiate
and then turn, I've created a foul because that's just an illegal screen. So
we're going to eliminate the face check to box out in basketball.  
  
Here's the little play that the guards are great at that we worked hard on
teaching officials to watch the reaction but don't get fooled. One little hand
makes all the difference in the world. When you see a rebounder's legs kick
out in front of him, that ought to be a pretty good sign you missed something.  
  
Again, clean it up, the rebounding part of the basketball game is important.
This is the most important. When you're shooting a free throw, you've got a
wide-open, 15-foot shot that you ought to be able to make the majority of. We
don't shoot them well, but that's the problem. If you've got that wide open
shot, your teammate in the second space is not supposed to get the basketball
unless the inside man doesn't bend or the ball maybe bounces long.  
  
Rebounding plays have gotten disgusting. We allow the guy in the second lane
space to make the first move down under, and if you're bigger, you win. That
is going to stop immediately. We're going to tell the players that you're
allowed to step straight across or run an X play or whatever your coach wants.
As soon as you touch and displace inside players, it's an automatic foul. If
the first free throw goes in, such as on a one-and-one, and you can step in
and say, hey, 52, you have to step straight across. If you initiate contact,
we're going to call a foul. Okay.  
  
But if the free throw is missed and the ball comes off and you're displaced,
automatic foul. You have to learn to make the free shot, not just physically
get the second shot, okay.  
  
Probably the biggest thing we saw in watching film was illegal screens. We
went to the NCAA Tournament and the Final Four, and a rough number was
probably 50, 60% of the screens are illegal. We lost the art of setting the
screen. The handoff dribble is a perfect example. Our players don't know how
to set a legal screen anymore.  
  
Back in the days when I played, you were taught to come up and set a jump stop
to set the screen. We now allow the screeners to be moving at all times. So we
put in definite guidelines for the players and the coaches.  
  
If the screener is moving, he can never be legal. So the first thing the
officials are going to look for is the guy who is setting the screen, does he
move? If he is, he's not legal. On a handoff drive, you are a screener. You
are no longer a ball handler. Therefore, once you let go of the ball, if
you're still moving, you're an illegal screener.  
  
Here's a perfect example. I'm no longer a ball handler. I slide into the
player trying to guard the ball handler, that's an automatic foul. We talked
about how do we run the pick-and-roll? Let's pause it a second. A legal pick-
and-roll means I have to set a screen. The defender has to make contact with
me, so now we both have right to the next position.  
  
If I never let the defender make contact with me, and I roll first and he
tries to go under, I'm setting a legal screen because there was no screen ever
set. So that's what we're trying to teach the players. A lot of the onus is on
our guards to set the screen up. They don't know how to set the screen up.
They don't wait long enough for their big man to get there and make a legal
screen.  
  
So we're really pressing to our coaches and our players and the preseason
stuff, guards, you have to let your big men get there. Big men, once you get
there, you have to be stationery. If you're moving in any way, it's an illegal
screen.  
  
Once you get set, you also can't adjust if the players' going to go around. If
the guard doesn't do a good job of coming right off the screen, you can't now
slide out, extend your leg. That's all illegal.  
  
Part two of our screening problem is not only screens being stationery, but
it's what we call the blind screen. Our rules read that a screen set in your
field of vision, which means if I'm guarding Holly, my field of vision is
right here, anything behind my hands is considered a blind screen. If you're
going to set a pick from anywhere back here, you not only have to be
stationery, but you must give your opponent a full step to turn and change
direction.  
  
We don't do that. We run right up, set the back pocket screen, set the
misdirection screen. We take the one side, come around, set on the other.
These are illegal. This is going to be the biggest play that's going to affect
us early. I've seen some scrimmages so far, but we didn't set a legal screen.
Players don't understand it because we've allowed it in the past. That is the
major change we have to teach them.  
  
Here's an example of the screen. It's a blind screen. It's not the field of
vision. Number one, he's not stationery. Number two, he's definitely blind. So
he must give him a full step to turn for contact or it's an automatic foul.  
  
Here's another example where we don't do a good job. Screen's coming from the
back pocket, I call it, so it's a blind screen. Therefore, he not only has to
be stationery, he has to give him a step. He's not only not stationery, but he
definitely doesn't give him a step.  
  
It's a major change for how our kids have played. They're going to have to
adjust to it, and we have to adjust and get it every time so they can make the
play.  
  
Here's a play where we set two screens. The double screen, he steps in, now he
comes out. Again, back pocket, blind screen. Never gives him a step, extends
his knee. These are automatic whistles, whether the ball is involved or not.  
  
This is the type play we've allowed to occur again on screens. Set an illegal
down pick, wide open three-pointer, and I've got a rebounding foul. We have to
stop the physical activity.  
  
Okay, you can stop it. That's enough.  
  
I think the biggest thing that I said at the start, which is the whole key to
this, we cannot allow the defensive player to initiate contact illegally.
Vice-versa, we're not going to allow the offensive player to initiate contact
on a legal defender who may be retreating, who may be straight up and down,
and bail him out with a foul. We did that two years ago. We had too many guys
just ducking their head, driving the basket, initiating contact, throwing
something up and we were calling a foul. But we've worked hard to discern
between the two. If we're not going to let the defense attack you, we're also
not going to bail out the offense. It's going to be major changes.  
  
I will tell you, at a scrimmage I was at last Saturday, there were 62 fouls.
That was an (indiscernible) scrimmage, which is sometimes worse and because
they know what they're doing.  
  
But our players and coaches can all adjust. Every one of the players I've
talked to have said we can do whatever we need to do as coaches, you just have
to prove to us these are the rules you're going to call, and you're stick with
it. I think that is the big onus on us for this season.  
  
Q. (Inaudible)?  
CURTIS SHAW: You can, but you can't talk to players to avoid calling, for
example, what we just saw. Like I said, on the free throw, the one and one,
the first one goes in, he shoved him under, we make them talk to him. If they
initially post up, if it doesn't really displace one or the other, we can see
they're getting physical, we may get to them the first dead ball.  
  
And I don't want it to seem like dooms day, but we have to change the game.
It's going to take drastic effort on behalf of the referees, the coaches and
the players to do that. Our players are great, our coaches are great. They can
do it if we're consistent in what we enforce.  
  
It will be ugly early. A lot of non-conference games are mismatches in terms
of talent anyway, it makes it even harder. I think as our players learn to
play legally it will get better up and down the line.  
  
Q. (Inaudible)?  
CURTIS SHAW: Absolutely not. The end goal is to make our game a basketball
game, and it really has lost track of that. Our focus has to be on athletic
skills, allowing the freedom of movement, to allow our great athletes to score
and play the game. We're not necessarily looking for more shots, what we're
looking for is the opportunity for our players to get better shots, cleaner
looks at the basket without being in illegal contact.  
  
We've talked to the NBA a little bit about the changes they went through, but
not with a goal to be like the NBA. It's a whole different business, but it's
still a basketball game.  
  
Q. The blind screen, frequently with pressure trying to break it against
the press, you'll see someone stand up forward in the back court and run the
defender and knock them down. That goes away now?  
CURTIS SHAW: That goes away, because if I'm standing there and, for example,
you're guarding the ball and coming down blind, I'm now legal. I've given you
a step to turn. The fact you didn't turn by the time you got to me, your
teammates have to say, hey, back pick and you've got to adjust.  
  
When it's illegal is when I ride up right behind you. I came to you instead of
running you into me.  
  
Q. I see. As long as he's stationery, your teammates have to help?  
CURTIS SHAW: Absolutely.  
  
Q. Can you talk about some of the experimental rules you'll be doing
with the six fouls?  
CURTIS SHAW: We're not doing any of that.  
  
Q. You're not going to do that?  
CURTIS SHAW: No, it was put out there if a league wanted to do it, they were
allowed to. We're not doing it in any of the preseason exempt events. We're
not doing it in any leagues that I know of. They may do it in the postseason
NIT, but I don't think that's been decided yet.  
  
I will tell you, I refereed in the Big East in the '90s, and we put in the
sixth foul rule one year, thinking if we've got more fouls it will keep the
better players in the game. It didn't. It allowed the other eight guys on the
bench to all have an extra foul, and the number of fouls actually went up with
no increase in the style of play. So it didn't work when we tried it before,
and I really don't think we're going that way.  
  
Part two of that is we play 40 minutes, so five fouls in 40 minutes is one
every eight minutes. Okay? The NBA plays 48 minutes, so six fouls for 48
minutes is one every eight minutes, so our ratios are really the same as far
as the number in terms of minutes played. So just adding a foul I don't think
will help our game.  
  
Q. Has there been any feedback or push back? It seems it's starting to
become more prevalent where guys are leaning on, hey, I can go to the monitor.
Has there been any discussion for changing the way plays are reviewed to the
monitor or anything like that?  
CURTIS SHAW: We're always discussing replay because it's a vital part of the
game. I think our systems for replay are catching up with the replay issue. We
now use in this league and a lot of the country a company called DV sports
where the referees can actually go to the monitor. They've got a toggle switch
and they can find their own plays. We're not at the mercy of the guys in the
truck or finding the right look. So that's better.  
  
Referees are always told you have to make a call on the floor before you go to
the monitor. So, no, as far as the referees talk about, hey, we can always go
look at this, no. You have to referee the basketball game like you would have
before there were ever monitors. Then if a play occurs that you're allowed to
go, you can go to double check what you've got.  
  
Q. So two years ago, the emphasis on the freedom of movement kind of
died once conference play started. Why would this time be different?  
CURTIS SHAW: Because two years ago I truly think that some people in the
hierarchy panicked. And I think some power coaches got to them and said, oh,
you're killing us. We can't do this. We allowed a few people to alter their
thinking so they put in a couple of rules interpretations, lack of emphasis,
however you want to say it, in January which changed the whole way we called.  
  
Now the NCAA and everybody under it has come out and said we understand we
have to stomach this. We understand that this may take two or three years to
do. But in order to fix it, we can't back off because maybe the style of play
and two or three coaches or their opinions. We have to do what's good for the
game.  
  
Q. I certainly understand what you're talking about increasing points
and freedom of movement and things like that. Some would say you're now in the
NCAA and the committees are now trying to do that by simply eliminating
defense, what would be your reaction to that? Certainly you would have to
agree that offense now has -- I don't know if built in is the right word or
not, but certainly an advantage.  
CURTIS SHAW: And the word eliminating defense has never come up. We're not
trying to eliminate defense. What we've done over the last 20 years, if you
watch video from 20 years ago, they played defense. They played it by moving
their feet to maintain position. Illegal defense never had to do with the
defense initiating contact. Somehow that became playing defense.  
  
How many coaches have we heard saying get up into him, pressure him, get up.
You see two defenders run into the guards. That's not eliminating playing
defense. That's eliminating playing illegal defense.  
  
If you go back and read the original 13 Rules of Basketball, it's pretty
amazing. It says a player shall not push, shove, kick, trip, hold or impede an
opponent. Wow, novel idea.  
  
Seven years later we're trying to do the same thing. We're really trying to
get basketball to where we've allowed it to slip over the last 20 years. It's
not changing it. It's getting it to where it was originally supposed to be.  
  
Thank you very much. And if any time during the season you need information
about what's going on, please get in touch with Rob Carollo, and he can get
questions to me.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 20, 2015

  

### [Bill Self](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13713)

  
_Irving, Texas_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, welcome, and your thoughts about the upcoming season?  
  
COACH SELF: Good morning, all. We're excited. I think everybody's excited this
time of year. Everybody's undefeated and everybody has high hopes and
expectations, and certainly we do as well.  
  
So I like our team. I thought we got off to a pretty good start this past
summer in South Korea and the World University Games and hopefully developed
some valuable experience and gave some guys some minutes that will definitely
be beneficial moving forward. But it should be a fun time. We've got a group
of competitive guys, quite a bit of balance. It will be an unbelievable league
again, just like it has been. Maybe as good this year as it ever has been.  
  
So certainly whoever is fortunate enough to be the last one standing will have
to be very consistent and play well for a long time.  
  
Q. How do you think the World Games experience will carry over into this
season?  
COACH SELF: I think the biggest thing that we probably got out of it, we
didn't take Cheick and Sviat, because obviously they're international players
and Brannen Greene and Devonte' didn't play because of injuries, so we weren't
whole over there.  
  
But Wayne Selden, I think emerged as not a good college player, as a great
college player over there. He was terrific.  
  
I think Hunter Mickelson got minutes that will make him a viable player in our
league. So there were some key players that I think needed to get developed
and get minutes that did. And I think that will probably help those guys as
much as anybody else.  
  
Frank and Perry, it was fun and all those things, and they played in big games
and had success, but those other guys needed that.  
  
Q. How much do you perceive playing Devonte' Graham and Frank Mason
together this year, and what are the potential benefits of that?  
COACH SELF: If you really studied our team, the last two years we were very,
very big on the wing. You play Wiggs at 6'8 at the three, you play Kelly at
6'8 at the three, and then Wayne is your big two guard. And that was great in
some ways, but we lost a lot of play-making playing that way.  
  
So I plan on playing -- I'm not saying that it will for sure happen, but as of
now, Devonte' and Frank will start next to each other, and then we'll play our
big guard at the three, whether it be Wayne or Sviat, probably Wayne if he's
able to get healthy with his ankle. But I think he gives us more play making.
I think it gives us more speed, and we'll create more easy baskets for our big
guys because we'll have better passers in the game.  
  
Q. Tell us a little about the new non-conference scheduling. How do you
all work to balance out going and playing road games, neutral site games
especially and your home games? What's been your philosophy and mentality with
that?  
COACH SELF: Well, Larry Keating does our scheduling, and he's terrific at it.
But you get an opportunity to play 13 non-league games, and for budget reasons
or whatnot, we know we need to play at least eight at home. So we'll start
with that.  
  
Then there are several games that are scheduled for us before we even get
started, whether it be the SEC-Big 12 Challenge, whether it be the Champion's
Classic, whether it be Maui. There are several games scheduled for us before
we get started. So we kind of look at big picture and then go backwards.  
  
One thing I think we've done is we've tried to play a nationally competitive
schedule, and one in which even the games you look at as guaranteed games or
bye games, it's against teams that are the best teams in their respective
leagues. So it's been really good for us and that's one thing that we'll
always try to do, especially for trying to build up our strength of schedule.  
  
Q. When you take these trips like the World Games trips, outside of
practices and games, what are you wanting to get out of the players off the
floor in terms of team building and all that stuff? And how do you judge
whether it was a success?  
COACH SELF: I have -- the thing that was great about this trip, more so than
anything, people in Gwangju were nice. Can't say quite the same about the
food. But, no, I'm sure it was good if you had that taste. But it was a 17-day
trip. It was too long. There was actually -- not once did guys complain. I
trusted them.  
  
I was just telling a group earlier, coaches micro manage, we all do, and over
there, there was none of that going on. I trusted them. They did their job,
and it was one of those times that I think our guys were probably as close as
they'd been since I'd been at Kansas as far as kind of rallying around the
cause and having fun doing it.  
  
So I think I learned a lot as a coach, not only with the rule changes, with
the short clock, with all these things going on basketball-wise, but also
maybe how to treat your guys and how to give them more freedom as long as they
don't abuse it and things like that, which I think in turn made them probably
"happy" is probably not the right word, but more energetic to do their job
when it was time to do their job.  
  
Q. I know you mentioned about the rules changes. One of the big rules
changes is that the shot clock goes from 35 to 30 seconds. How does that
dictate what you guys do out there on the court, getting in your sets? Are
there any changes that you guys are doing specifically with that?  
COACH SELF: I don't think there's a lot of difference. I think if we'd have
taken 30 seconds to get a shot off, the last several years, I think all our
fans would say we're playing ridiculously slow. I think that 35 to 30 is going
to be a real factor in the last five minutes of the game.  
  
You see very little shot clock violations in the first 35 minutes of the game.
You do in the last five to seven minutes because teams are milking the clock.
So they're not trying to score until the last ten seconds of the shot clock,
and then, of course, sometimes you struggle getting a look when you're only
trying to score in the last ten seconds of the shot clock. I think that will
still be the same.  
  
But I don't think it's going to be a big difference. Some coaches do. I'm one
that I think coaches and players will adjust and figure out how to move the
ball a little quicker and get the ball to the second or third side faster, so
that way we can still do what we're trying to do.  
  
I think the emphasis on how the game will be officiated will play a much
bigger factor in the look of our game rather than the shot clock.  
  
Q. You always are looking for that point guard to be that bulldog. It
seemed like Frank really took that on toward the end of last year and even
here at The Sprint Center and South Korea. Where he came from, are you shocked
at all how much he's changed over a year and how much command he's taken over
this team?  
COACH SELF: I don't think shocked. I'm real pleased with him, but I thought
all along when we got Frank and after he's been in practice two or three weeks
I thought that this would be what he would become. It took him a little while
to get comfortable enough to do it. But Frank's a much better player than he
was last year. He's going to continue to get better because the understanding
of the game is going to get better. But I'm real pleased with him.  
  
I think what Frank is, he's not a true point guard. People think he's a point
guard because he's not very tall. But Devonte' and him together, I think
you'll see Frank playing a lot off the ball. Devonte' in a lot of ways is more
of a true point than Frank, and I think that will free Frank up to even score
more.  
  
Q. Back on the rule changes, I know officiating is going to determine
it, but there were a lot of rule changes beyond just the shot clock. Have you
done anything throughout the summer or practice to teach the guys some of the
other changes?  
COACH SELF: Not really as much as what you'd think. I think the biggest thing
that we're going to struggle with is having players actually call the timeouts
as opposed to coaches calling it from the sideline. That's something that I
think is going to need to be practiced.  
  
I think the four-foot arc instead of three-foot arc is a great change. But we
don't emphasize taking charges anyway as much as what we probably should. But
that's never been an emphasis of ours. So that's obviously going to be a
factor.  
  
And the one that nobody talks about that I think is a big deal is the closely
guarded call. Theoretically, if you have a strong point guard and it's a delay
of game situation, you can dribble out the clock. There's no five-second call
anymore. So I think that will be one that coaches will have to adjust to in
how they defend those situations because everything's now going to have to be
trapping and doing things like that as opposed to just trying to play pressure
defense.  
  
It's going to be interesting, but I probably have done a poor job with it
because the first three weeks of practice, we've emphasized the physicality
and how to play different post defense and things like that. But we haven't
really emphasized all the other changes as we go moving forward.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 20, 2015

  

### [Steve Prohm](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23490)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by Iowa State's coach Steve Prohm. Coach, your
thoughts on the upcoming season?  
  
COACH PROHM: Thank you for having me. Really excited about this upcoming
season. I've got my four guys over there with me, Georges, Jameel, Naz, and
Monte. These guys have been terrific. Obviously it's been a big transition,
not only for me, but for these guys. I've told these guys from day one they're
my focus. These four seniors, the two juniors, Monte and Matt, they're what
this is all about, giving them the best possible season that we can.  
  
That's my job, that's my staff's job to max these guys out. Obviously we've
got a lot of expectations, but that's a good thing. That's a credit to what
they've done over the last several years. The job Fred did, the job this
senior class has done. They won a lot of games. Georges and Naz have an
opportunity to be the winningest players in the history of the school at Iowa
State, and that's an unbelievable achievement to be a part of something like
that.  
  
So my focus and my mindset with these guys is let's be great today. Let's win
the day and that's our job. Obviously, we have big dreams, big goals, big
aspirations of winning Big 12 championships and making a great postseason run,
but right now, today, in October, it's about getting better and enjoying the
process, and trusting the process of getting better.  
  
So they've been great. They're working extremely hard to try to build a good
foundation as we get ready for November.  
  
Q. How do you -- how would Georges' role change, if at all, in your new
system?  
COACH PROHM: I don't think it will change at all. I'm really trying to sit
down with Georges, understand the strengths on what he was able to do over the
last several years, watching a lot of tape.  
  
I talked to Fred a couple times. I just tried to put him in the best position
that he feels comfortable. I want to be able to have a relationship with my
seniors, my best players. Talk to them, hey, what do you feel comfortable
with? Tell me and we'll put it in and we'll go over it and we'll execute it.  
  
So I don't think his role will change. He knows how important he is to this
team. I do want to challenge him on the defensive end to become a better
rebounder, to rebound out of his area and do some things defensively that we
need. But offensively, I don't see it changing at all. I just hope he can even
excel it even more.  
  
Q. What will you guys do different defensively than what Iowa State's
done in the past?  
COACH PROHM: I don't know what they've done in the past from the standpoint of
the day-to-day, so I can't tell you that exactly. I just want to put an
emphasis on getting back in transition defense, not giving up the easy
baskets, containing the basketball, making everything a tough, contested shot
and then finishing plays.  
  
I want to have a three-stops-in-a-row mentality. We can challenge our guys.
How many times can they put three stops in a row together? That's huge at
home, but it's really, really big on the road to have that type of mentality
to finish games away with big stops on the defensive end. So we'll have a
focus about it in practice. We'll touch on something, transition defense,
boxing out, positioning each and every day to just build good habits on the
defensive end.  
  
Q. With all the rule changes and we kind of got the tutorial, and it's
obviously more than just a shot clock, did you do anything different so far to
educate your players on what's changing and what they're allowed to do? Do you
plan on doing that in practice?  
COACH PROHM: We had our first intersquad scrimmage this past Saturday. We had
referees come in, so they spent five to ten minutes just going over the new
rules with our guys. Being able to call timeouts and doing things like that in
live play is something I've talked to them about. As we get closer, I'll
really start to stress that, to where Monte, Georges, whoever has the ball in
certain situations, they may need to call timeout in live play.  
  
But when you look at shot clock, I don't really think that will affect us.
People may try to slow people down with three-quarter court pressure, but we
want to be in attack mode. I want our guys to try to continue to play free,
and space the floor and continue to make big shots like they've done in the
past.  
  
Defensively, we've got to continue to build our depth at 7, 8, 9. I feel
really good about our first six. But when you look at the way they're
officiating with the hand checks, with the bumps and the weight, we set a lot
of ball screens. A lot of dribble handoffs to where we're not getting illegal
screens. We don't need to be getting some of our main guys in foul trouble.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 20, 2015

  

### [Lon Kruger](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13820)

  
_Irving, Texas_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Lon Kruger from Oklahoma. Coach, welcome, and your thoughts
about the upcoming season?  
  
COACH KRUGER: Great time of the year. Guys have obviously been two weeks into
practice, lot of enthusiasm, lot of energy. If you don't have it this time,
you're probably not going to have it. So it's been great. It's been great.  
  
Had a little bit of injury with our big post guy, AK, with a foot injury,
little stress fracture from July, haven't fully got him recovered. Otherwise,
pretty injury-free, and guys getting after it every day.  
  
Q. Rashard Odomes has got a lot of attention this summer. What is it
that he brings to your team? What have you seen from him since he's been on
campus, and what can he add off the bench that maybe you haven't had the last
couple seasons?  
COACH KRUGER: Rashard Odomes and Christian James are kind of similar in that
they've got good size at the wing, very versatile. They're very aggressive,
physical on the boards. They rebound the ball well from the wing. They can
score. For incoming freshmen, they've been well-coached. They have a good feel
for the game. Great enthusiasm for working every day, and the real benefit too
from having Buddy and Isaiah from a work ethic standpoint in the gym all the
time. And those guys come in and see what they do and fall in line and they'll
benefit from that a great deal too.  
  
Q. I know some things being out of your control in terms of scheduling
and when you start and that sort of thing. But it wasn't too long ago that
practices didn't get going until the end of October. Now you guys are
practically playing in October. In your neck of the woods, it's football
season still. Do you almost wish it could move back a little closer to the end
of the year before you guys really started that non-conference schedule?  
COACH KRUGER: The goal everywhere in the non-conference schedule attendance at
games during that time is to try to work to improve that. Different people,
different places in the country are working hard at that. Never thought about
moving it back a great deal. Right now we go through part of both semesters
anyhow. Our guys are in town for Thanksgiving, they're in town for Christmas,
they're in town for spring break. So there is not a lot there if you were
backing up a lot. We're playing almost until the last month of the school year
anyhow.  
  
So you can certainly do that, but I don't know if we would benefit a great
deal on the other end.  
  
Q. You guys returned four starters this year. How beneficial is that not
only just having the returning starters, but the production those guys are
bringing back for you?  
COACH KRUGER: It's great to have them from them being familiar, them having
the experience, a lot of Big 12 starts. Leadership out of that group is
outstanding, maybe as good as we've ever had with a returning group. The work
ethic, their unselfishness, all those things that you'd certainly rather have
than not.  
  
Expectations are different this year, be it the challenge of having those
well. These guys have never really been in that position before. But they'll
handle it well. They understand how they have to work every day, focus every
day, and work at getting better. They know how tough the league is, so they
know what lies ahead.  
  
Q. Lon, you mentioned your trio of seniors, but looking across the Big
12, it seems every team has a lot of upperclassmen back this year. And it's
maybe a bit of a rarity these days in college basketball. Do you see this year
being different in that way and every team has veteran leadership?  
COACH KRUGER: I think that's a good point. It appears to be that way. You talk
about rosters and we turn a lot of the top players from the league last year,
the top three teams, two-thirds of those return, leading scorers, leading
rebounders, they return. So down the line it seems like it's a league that's
not really very talented, but it's older talent which will make it even
tougher.  
  
Q. Your philosophy seems that you let your teams play and really kind of
get after it. You have a group of older guys that probably makes it a little
easier to do that. But when you've got younger groups, do you tend to maybe
not want to do that? Talk me through that philosophy for you, because that
seemed pretty consistent with your team.  
COACH KRUGER: Well, every group's a little bit different. But we think
confidence is a big thing, maybe the most important thing. You assume they're
going to work hard and compete, so that's certainly a starting point. But you
assume that's there.  
  
So now confidence, promoting confidence, trying to down play roles, you want
guys that can shoot it, to feel free to shoot it. Guys who can't, you have to
limit that, but you have to do that individually. Yeah, I think everything's a
little bit different. With an older group, they probably identify their roles,
they know what their roles are and what to expect from each other.  
  
I think good teams have different individuals that respect other people's
roles, but also be accountable to their own, step up and every night deliver
whatever it is. Maybe rebounding, maybe blocking shot, maybe scoring. But,
yeah, you want them to play. You want them to do the things they do every day
in practice and things they're comfortable doing and can do with confidence.  
  
Q. A lot of folks, I think, see Dante Buford as a guy that can give you
what Cameron Clark did a few years ago. Is that a valid comparison in your
mind?  
COACH KRUGER: I think it is. Given Dante's a freshman, and people remember Cam
as a junior and senior and very productive. But Dante has a chance to grow
into that. He's an undersized four man if you put a number to him. Stretch
four, can shoot the ball well, can put it on the floor.  
  
I think he's a guy that will get more and more comfortable, having red shirted
last year, he along with Jamuni McNeace, they both benefited from that red
shirt year and will get better and better as time goes on. But Dante now and
Jamuni both are off to a very good start in the early season workouts.  
  
Q. Does it help to have the Big 12 Conference tournament in Oklahoma
City kind of give you a home crowd of sorts instead of having it elsewhere and
having your team try to play it? How does that help you guys potentially going
into an NCAA Tournament situation?  
COACH KRUGER: The Big 12 Conference tournament, of course, is in Kansas City.
Having a site there in Oklahoma City gives us something to work toward
perhaps. But we've got a lot of work to do to have a chance to earn that
opportunity to play in Oklahoma City.  
  
But Kansas City does a great job with the tournament. Great arena, great
attendance, and certainly a great event.  
  
Q. The decision for Buddy to stay for his senior year, how much did he
come to you with knowledge or needed some knowledge, because he's obviously
one of the best players in the conference? Was that a factor for you having
to, not convince, but show him the positives of staying an extra year and
staying for his senior year?  
COACH KRUGER: Buddy's really smart. He's got a great family, so our function
was just to provide information. We talked to a lot of the folks in the NBA
and we got the committee's evaluation back, as we do for any young player that
may entertain the idea of going into the draft early, and just provided that
to Buddy.  
  
Buddy took those projections and took the expert's opinions and said, I can
get better. He's got a pretty good experience there, so it's not like he's not
enjoying the time in Oklahoma. He said he thought he could enjoy that, improve
his game, and maybe elevate his draft status and give himself a better chance
to have a longer career at the next level.  
  
But, again, he made a decision that will be very good for him in the long run
and certainly very good for our program, but I think good for Buddy, and that
is the key there.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 20, 2015

  

### [Trent Johnson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18247)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by the TCU Coach Trent Johnson. Coach, welcome,
and your thoughts about the upcoming season.  
  
COACH JOHNSON: Another year in the Big 12 grind, but obviously we're excited
about the opportunity to move to our new venue. Ed Schollmaier and Rae
Schollmaier have done an excellent job, along with all our other donors and
our administration speared by our athletic director, Chris Del Conte and our
Chancellor Boschini, putting us in an environment this year that we'll compete
at a high level. It's been a long time coming.  
  
For me, having had the opportunity to be in numerous leagues, usually your
donors and your administrators put their financial and their fate on the back
end after you've won a lot of games. So our people have been extremely
impressive in terms of their commitment to our men's basketball program and
the women's basketball program even before we became relevant.  
  
So I'm looking forward to this year in terms of trying to make that next jump,
that next step, so to speak. That's going to be extremely hard. We all know in
this league it's extremely hard moving up. So we're excited.  
  
Q. Coach, I know you lost Cameron Williams, who is going to replace that
edge for you?  
COACH JOHNSON: You use the word edge, and he's probably one of the most
competitive individuals I've been around. He has great instincts and rebounds
the ball well and really improves his ability offensively. So it's going to be
done by committee. A kid by the name of Jalen Miller, who is very, very
talented from Seagoville High School right in Dallas is very talented, but
he's going to have to be brought along at a faster rate than we normally
would.  
  
But there are some opportunities out there for a lot of guys. You know, Chris
Washburn, Karviar Sheppard, Brandon Parrish, Mike Williams, Chauncey Collins,
all those guys that have been in the program in the previous three and four
years, there are opportunities now to step into roles where they can score the
ball and be more effective at the offensive end. So I'm excited about that
moving forward.  
  
Q. You mentioned Karviar, and obviously came in as a very highly touted
recruit. He's had two solid seasons, but what does he have to do to, I guess,
take his game to the next level?  
COACH JOHNSON: It's interesting. You say highly touted, I think his rankings
are nothing but negative in terms of young kids and young basketball players
because rankings mean nothing.  
  
But what he's had to do is what he's done. He's had a very good spring and a
very good summer, and he needs to play within himself. He's been developed to
where he shoots the mid-range jumpshot effectively. And defensively, him and
Chris are good defensive players in terms of their ability to communicate on
the back, rebound the ball and so on and so forth. So his continued
improvement is important, but I think he needs to play within himself. That is
the most important thing, as opposed to trying to do things he can't do.  
  
Q. Chris Del Conte and everybody is excited about the new basketball
arena and wanting all us to come see it. You touched on it earlier, how much
is it helping your program now? And conversely, how much did it hurt, if at
all, playing at Wilkerson-Greines and just the whole year of transition?  
COACH JOHNSON: Well, it didn't hurt us because obviously we won our share of
games when we were playing at Wilkerson-Greines.  
  
How does it help? Well, obviously with young people, student-athletes and
basketball, they want to play in the venues that are nice. They want to have
nice facilities. So it helps from a standpoint of recruiting, from a
standpoint of fans. They want to be in a venue that's really nice and classy.
So it helps in that regard.  
  
But the bottom line is, I've said this often since going into year four, our
football program, our baseball program, our track and field, our rifle
program, there are a lot of programs in our athletic department that did a lot
of winning before they had really good facilities. So under my leadership, our
role is to make sure we make this next step when we're capable of beating the
good teams and the good people.  
  
We had our opportunities last year, and we didn't quite frankly close some
situations, some deals, so to speak. So moving forward, you can have all the
facilities in the world, but you've got to compete at a high level and win
games.  
  
Q. Coach, your guys last year and the winning record and the 18 wins and
use that sort of as a springboard?  
COACH JOHNSON: No, no. You know me, Carlos, I dwell on today, not tomorrow.
The thing for us moving forward is after today, we've got like a 4:30 flight
out and 9:00 p.m. practice. So we look forward to that. This is a situation
for me and it always has been where you don't live in the past.  
  
Moving forward, we have an opportunity this year with a lot of new additions,
with four guys on this basketball team, they have to have a huge role for us
to be successful. We have some guys that have been through it, so to speak.
The key for us is leadership, and then obviously guys having opportunities to
score the ball and doing that with confidence and taking care of the balls,
doing that with confidence and being able to pass and catch and doing that
with confidence. Hopefully that will put us in a situation where we get over
the hump. But in the past, I don't know, that's not something I dwell on a
lot.  
  
Q. For the last couple years, Anderson seemed to have the ball in his
hands an awful lot?  
COACH JOHNSON: Who is that? No, go ahead.  
  
Q. You've already put him out of your mind, I imagine?  
COACH JOHNSON: No, he's a good kid and a special player.  
  
Q. He did seem to be the guy that at crunch time, he had the ball in his
hands a lot, the guy that you lean on a lot. How do you fill in for what he
gave you guys the last couple years and he was likely to step into those
roles?  
COACH JOHNSON: It's going to have to be done by committee: Lyrik Shreiner, the
freshman; Chauncey Collins, who is as talented as there is, and then he's a
sophomore; and then Mike Williams, who is a junior. Those three guys will be
at the point guard position. So you'd like to think that three players can
replace one.  
  
But the thing that Kyan brought more than anything is he had a lot of
confidence, a lot of swagger, and obviously, he could handle the ball. So
versus pressure, he really relieved a lot for us.  
  
And then Trey Zeigler was the other one from a leadership standpoint. So those
two guys will be missed, but obviously, again, as opposed to dwelling on the
past, and I respect your question, but moving forward, those guys that have
opportunity to come in and make plays, so they'll be challenged to do that.  
  
Q. Speaking of football a little bit, we've heard from a few other
coaches and just talked to Bob Bowlsby about the talk now about maybe moving
the start of men's basketball season back maybe three weeks, a month, to avoid
the conflict of football, and maybe play non-conference teams a little bit
more. Of course this would mean moving back the NCAA Tournament. Do you have
any thoughts on making basketball a semester sport?  
COACH JOHNSON: Yeah, I do, I think a one-semester sport helps academically.
But having been in the SEC and being in the Pac-10 at that time, I think this
league in my experience does a heck of a job promoting basketball from top to
bottom. So I think the onus is probably myself. From the way I look at it,
it's on the people who cover the game and who report the game. You guys have a
great a voice, you have a great mindset in terms of what goes on.  
  
So I think moving it back helps academically. In terms of how many people
watch and how many people are attending, that depends on where you play, who
you play, caliber of games and so on and so forth.  
  
Q. The rule changes this year, have you figured out how to benefit their
team or hurt it?  
COACH JOHNSON: I think the rules changes will benefit my team or our team if
their coach keeps his mouth shut and stays in the coaching box and the
officials call the game the way it's supposed to be. That's just a joke. Don't
get me going on that.  
  
No, the five-second guarded one is going to be interesting because kids are
really going to handle the ball, bounce it a little longer. Me personally I've
always addressed my group that they're in situations (indiscernible), if you
master it, take the five-second count and eat it, that way you can get your
defense formed, not let a team run out on you.  
  
And on the 30-second shot clock, I don't know how much that's going to help or
hurt. The NBA has a 24-second shot clock, and I think you look at what happens
late in the year, those scores dwindle because of the level of play and the
commitment. The scouting defense, all good teams have good players that make
you run. I think more than anything, the shot clock you might see more bad
shots just because they have to play faster.  
  
I think our game is in great hands. I think the people who are officiating and
the people who are coaching it, and the people who are playing in it, they're
all going to make the necessary adjustments to make sure the game flows and
continues to get better.  
  
Q. Just a really quick follow-up. Your team's full of good shooters and
scorers this year. I wondered if that freedom of movement played into your
hands?  
COACH JOHNSON: My team's full of good shooters and good scorers this year? I
don't know about that. Depends on what practice you're watching.  
  
But freedom of movement, yeah, I think that helps the flow of our game. But,
again, the onus is on the people who are calling the game, the people who are
teaching the game to make the necessary adjustments. But in terms of good
shooters, good scorers, we've got some experience. Some nights that ball goes
in, some nights it doesn't go in. So your ability to get back and defend and
limit the other team that has good scorers and good shooters will probably
determine whether you're successful. But freedom of movement will help.  
  
I go back to what I said years ago when I was coaching other places, I always
look at Big 8 or Big 12 basketball, depending on the time of the year it was.
You always saw the physicality of that league and the way they played. The
culture of that league is unbelievable. Now having been in it and going
through my fourth season, it's true, true to form.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 20, 2015

  

### [Bob Huggins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15824)

  
_Irving, Texas_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by West Virginia coach Bob Huggins. Coach,
congratulations on a good season last year, talk about this year.  
  
COACH HUGGINS: Thank you. Tell us about this year? Hmm, well, we lost two very
good, quality seniors. Juwan Staten had a perfect career for us. I think the
big thing that we'll miss is the ball security those guys provided for us.
Juwan was one of those guys you couldn't trap, you couldn't take the ball from
him, and he made free throws. So he was invaluable in the games.  
  
So we're kind of looking to replace that with some of the guys that actually
played a good bit when he and Gary both were injured.  
  
Q. Most important question of the day: Can you tell us about the pants?
Where do you come by pants like that, and is there any chance you might wear
them in a game?  
COACH HUGGINS: We were just talking about that over there. I think the only
person that would benefit from that is this guy, Dale Sparks, who takes
pictures and makes pictures and sells them.  
  
One of my friends gave me a gold suit to wear my first year, and it's still
the hottest selling picture. I don't know if I want to subsidize Dale anymore
than what I already have, so probably not (laughter).  
  
But I went to graduation. I had to do a little speaking thing at graduation,
and President Gee came in with a pair of pants on like this, and I thought,
boy, that's a great idea for Media Day. So I ordered me a pair. He wore one
gold and one blue sneaker though, Chuck Taylors. I didn't go quite that far.
But I don't have the bowtie either. He had the bowtie on as well. Kind of sets
the trend for fashion in our state.  
  
Q. Could you describe the decision last year when you got to that point
of deciding to press, and when you decided that this was going to be your
philosophy from here on out?  
COACH HUGGINS: I was tired of losing, that was the biggest thing. I think
sometimes it's good to do something different, and I kind of looked around the
league and really nobody played that way. So it kind of gives you an advantage
to a degree when you're doing something that other people don't do.  
  
And we did the system in a different way, it wasn't three quarter court, it
wasn't the full court. The three quarter court, and it just got to where it
was so time consuming. And I've got a guy named Danny Fortson that wasn't very
good in the press, but he was a great player, and I didn't want to get him in
foul trouble, so I quit pressing.  
  
Then I happened to run into Kevin Mackey, who I have the utmost respect for. I
think he did a better job with pressure basketball than anybody that's ever
coached college basketball. I ran into Kevin, we started talking about it, and
we talked on the phone a few times. Then Kevin came to Morgantown and watched
us practice, and he said you've got the personnel to be able to do this and do
it well. And we continued to talk. Actually we still continue to talk about
some different things.  
  
But basically what he said was you have to be committed to it. You just can't
throw it on. And if they score a couple lay-ups, get out of it, because then
your guys lose confidence in it.  
  
I think what it did for us, it gave us great team chemistry, because everybody
knew they were going to play. How much you played was up to you. That's kind
of what I tried to explain to them. If you play better, you're going to play
more. If you don't play as good, you won't play as much, but you're going to
play. So everybody went into the game knowing they were going to get in the
game and have an opportunity to play, so I thought that was good.  
  
Q. Just describe the versatility that Ahmad brings to the lineup this
year.  
COACH HUGGINS: Well, we're trying to get him up to speed as best we possibly
can. He's a talented guy. He's a guy who can bounce it at 6' whatever he is,
6'8", he's a guy who passes it well.  
  
The speed of the game I think is affecting him right now, but it's just a
matter of him kind of getting used to it. Because he does pass, and he sees
the floor really well. He can make shots, obviously. He's a very good
rebounder.  
  
When we went to the Bahamas, it wasn't certainly like playing in this league,
but we did play three games there, and he was our second leading scorer,
second leading rebounder. He's one of those guys that just knows how to play.
I think that is the first thing I've noticed when I watched him. I think the
more I watched him, the more I realized this guy has a great aptitude to
understand basketball. I think that's his biggest attribute.  
  
It's kind of like what Deshawn Butler was for us in terms of understanding the
game, understanding what's supposed to happen.  
  
Q. The new rule change closely guarded, for a team, for a coach, you
like to see your guards guard. How does that change your mentality on defense,
especially in the game?  
COACH HUGGINS: I don't know. I've been back and forth with it in my head here
since the rule changes came out. Honestly, I don't know.  
  
We're going to scrimmage here in a couple weeks. We've got a scrimmage with
Temple and see how much has changed, how we have to play.  
  
I'd like to sit here and give you a very intelligent answer, but obviously I
can't. So I don't know. I think we're going to continue to try to do what we
do. We may have to make a modification or two. But I'm not sure. I don't think
five seconds makes any difference, if that helps. I think there's an idea out
there by a lot of coaches that maybe you have pressure to burn some clock. But
at the end of the day, everybody's going to run a quick hitter into a ball
screen anyways, and that's what everybody did against us for the last 30 years
because we tried to not let people run offense, so we ended up guarding ball
screens or sprints, and that's what's going to happen. I don't think that
changes much.  
  
It's just probably going to be more bad shots taken maybe. But other than
that, I don't think there is much difference.  
  
Q. Your point guard situation, you had it pretty good with Juwan and
Gary last year. Is it strictly Javan and Tarik now or is it Dax or Jaysean or
do foresee passing the ball up and using as many players as you can to get to
where you want?  
COACH HUGGINS: There's not a lot of absolutes, but absolutely Jaysean will not
be in the equation. Dax could be. Dax' ball skills have gotten better.  
  
I don't really want to change Dax's mentality. Dax has been a guy who goes and
tries to score, and we need him to score. So I don't see him playing a lot
there. He could. He's skilled enough to play there.  
  
Obviously when Beetle got hurt, that hurt us at point guard, but Jaysean's
getting better, and better. Tarik's getting better and better. It's just a
matter of them being there and understanding their responsibilities a little
bit more. But I think we're okay there.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 20, 2015

  

### [Travis Ford](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18471)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Travis Ford of Oklahoma State. Coach, welcome,
and your thoughts about the upcoming season?  
  
COACH FORD: Well, we've had very competitive practices. We've got a lot of new
players, a lot of players on our basketball team that have new roles. The
returning players' roles are going to be increased drastically. So from that
standpoint, practices have been very good from the standpoint of how hard
they're working, their attitudes.  
  
They're going pretty slow right now as far as implementing a system. Got a lot
of guys learning from scratch. But it's been fun coaching the guys.  
  
The league this year, I think going through my eighth season at Oklahoma
State, and I think this could be the best year of the Big 12 since I've been
there. Our team has to have a mentality of being very hungry. We understand
where we're picked and the expectations and different things like that. But
it's a great challenge for us. But I like our team.  
  
Obviously Phil Forte is really playing well for us. I think this team is going
to be much more balanced than a lot of our teams of lately. Last year we were
very dependent on two guys scoring the ball. I think we'll be much more
balanced this year scoring-wise, playing-wise, as far as a lot of guys getting
a lot of different minutes. Lot of versatility on our basketball team and a
lot of depth, balanced depth. From that standpoint, if I had a game tomorrow,
I'm not sure who I would start other than one or two players. So there's very
good competition in practice right now.  
  
I like our team. We just have a lot of new faces and returning players who are
going to have increased roles. Again, from that standpoint, we're trying to
define who we are and our identity each and every day. But I like our
basketball team.  
  
Q. Last year you guys had a lot of ball screens and trying to create
opportunities for Phil and everything. With the rule changes we just heard
about and specifically the screening, what have you done in practice to try to
prepare for that?  
COACH FORD: Well, we've brought in referees on a couple different occasions
already and scrimmaged with real referees so our guys can get a feel for the
changes. We have had several illegal screens called on the ball, but that was
a great learning experience for our players. We're not going to change -- I
think we have a very good point guard that is really good off ball screens, so
we're going to set him, it's just doing it correctly. Doing it the right way,
wait on the screen, make sure our screener understands what he can and can't
do. But we've learned a lot through the scrimmages with the referees, and
we're going to continue to do that.  
  
Q. You're a Pitino guy, close to Rick. I'm curious what you feel should
be the way forward for Pitino and Louisville? Also, big picture what this
whole deal has meant for college basketball and will mean in the future?  
COACH FORD: Well, obviously I don't know a whole lot about it other than what
you read. One thing, I'm extremely 100% confident in him, that he knew nothing
about it if they were to come out to be true in some fashion or form. I can
guarantee you that. For somebody who played for him and knows what he stands
for and his expectations out of his players and how he does things, I know
there is no chance in the world he knew anything about it.  
  
The question has been posed a lot in these back hallways and different
interviews and things about accountability amongst coaches and things like
that. I think every head coach you do -- you meet with your coaches and staff
and have expectations. You meet with your players and you have expectations
and you do the best you possibly can. It's impossible to know every little
single thing that's going on within your program, as much as we'd like to and
as much as we try to.  
  
Again, I don't -- I know what I've read, and that's about it. I've been so
involved with my own team, but also I've texted him and done different things.
I know how much he cares for Louisville basketball and cares for his team and
his players and his coaches. I think the hardest thing probably for anybody is
not knowing and then finding out something. How could it occur, if it is true
and things like that?  
  
So I think at this point, you've just got to -- everybody's got to wait to see
what's going on.  
  
Q. You guys have the first homecoming scrimmage this week. How excited
are you to get out in front of a big crowd?  
COACH FORD: Yeah, it's always exciting. Homecoming at Oklahoma State is like
nothing in America. It's the best, the biggest, the greatest. It's always a
fun week.  
  
The football team is obviously playing unbelievable, we're 6-0 going into this
homecoming weekend. We've got some special things planned as far as our team
for the students and for the fans with Homecoming and Hoops. It will be very
entertaining and fun to watch, something our players, along with other groups
on campus and teams, that we're going to do some things that I think the fans
and students will like. Then we'll scrimmage just so they can get a look at
the team.  
  
But, yeah, we always look forward to it. It's a lot of fun. You have recruits
in and do different things. Homecoming at Oklahoma State is a week-long event
and it's a lot of fun.  
  
Q. Initially, at least outside perception was that Phil was sort of a
sidekick to Marcus Smart coming in. Safe to say he's the leading man now for
this team?  
COACH FORD: Yes, he is the leading man. He is a captain on this team, a leader
on this team. He's got the most experience of anybody on this team. He's been
through the most on this team. But he is not a player that can do it by
himself.  
  
I think last year we relied way too much on just Nash and Forte and that was
my fault. I'm talking about more scoring. We just -- everything was designed
to try to get them a shot. Now it worked a lot. We had a lot of big wins and
probably overachieved in a lot of areas, but it caught up to us at the end of
the year. It caught up to us. But it got us through a lot of tough moments.
But at the end of the year, we just weren't balanced enough. We were not
balanced.  
  
With that said, we are really concentrating on being more a balanced, scoring
team. I think part of that that's going to help is we have a point guard that
makes other people around him better.  
  
Last year we had a point guard that was really good. Anthony Hickey won great
games for us, but he was a scoring pint guard first. His success and our
success a lot of times depended upon him scoring. When he scored, we played
well.  
  
We're not going to be as dependent on that. Jawun Evans and Tyree Griffin are
point guards, pass first point guards that get other people involved, which
opens the court a lot. When you have a point guard that with penetrate and
create, he has to be honored by all five defenders. So hopefully that opens
things up for Phil Forte. Whereas at the end of the year last year, people are
so locked onto him and they didn't really have to help except for Nash, to an
extent.  
  
I think opening the court up and having a point guard and some other balanced
scorers on our team and having an offense that's designed more for balance, I
think it's going to help him. With that said, yes, we do need him to score
points. We do need him to get his 16, 17, 18 points a game. But I think he'll
hopefully get it in a little easier manner by playing off other players than
just having to come off screens all the time and just be the focal point. But,
yes, we need a big year from him. He's come a long way.  
  
You're looking at a young man who a lot of people questioned could he play at
this level and things like that. He led the Big 12 in scoring for pretty much
half the year last year, and he's continuing to try to develop his game over
the summer by studying different NBA players and doing things we've asked him
to do.  
  
Just watching him in practice the last week or so, he seems a whole lot more
comfortable in getting shots, a lot easier within the offense we're running
right now. Even though we have a long way to go offensively.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 20, 2015

  

### [Scott Drew](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14205)

  
_Irving, Texas_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined with Coach Scott Drew from Baylor. Coach, talk
about the upcoming season?  
  
COACH DREW: Excited to be here this morning. Lot of exciting things happening
at Baylor University with our football team.  
  
But excited for basketball to begin. I think Big 12 fans are really going to
be in for a treat this year. Last year, No. 1 RPI conference in the country,
70% of the teams went to postseason in the NCAA Tournament. But you look at
the returners, you've got four of the five first-team, all-league players
returning. 91% of the games involved a rank team last year, and I think it's
going to be a very exciting year. I'll probably lose a little more hair, but
excited about the team we have.  
  
Q. Rico obviously is a rebounding machine. What do you want to get out
of him this year? And what have you talked to him about trying to improve his
offensive efficiency scoring-wise?  
COACH DREW: I think Rico spent time in the gym in the off-season. He knows
that he's somebody that's getting to the free-throw line quite often. So first
and foremost, if he can become a 75, 80% free-throw shooter his production is
going to go way up.  
  
Second thing, because we have a lot of length in practice, him finishing over
length every day is something that will help. His jumpshot has improved. It's
a lot softer, a lot better rotation. At the end of the day, making those free
throws will be first and foremost.  
  
Q. You mentioned the football team, and I know that excitement in your
town is big around them. I was doing a little research. It seems like the
start of basketball season has inched back as years have gone on. Do you see
evidence of crowds maybe not starting to show up until that football team gets
done? Have you guys tried to do some things to combat that and get your people
out?  
COACH DREW: I think all across the country with football season backing up and
playing in the first week of December, I would be a proponent, advocate for
moving basketball back. I think it's tough when you have two seasons like this
going on. As far as how far back, I know players don't want to practice
anymore. They want to play games.  
  
I know we have other complications with the Masters and different things for
TV rights when it comes to March Madness, but I do feel there are a lot of
quality games in November, and sometimes they get overlooked just because
football season is still going on. And that's across the country.  
  
Q. It looks like you're pretty well set from an experience standpoint in
the front court, but you lose Kenny, you lose Royce who gave you kind of
leadership as well. How do you replace those guys? Who looks like he'll step
into the point guard position for you?  
COACH DREW: You look, first and foremost, when Kenny was out a couple games
last year with an ankle injury, Lester Medford stepped in, did a very nice
job. Austin Mills also helped out at the point. Then Al Freeman played minutes
at the guard position.  
  
Other than that, you have a lot of incoming guards, lot of freshmen have an
opportunity to help out. But that, replacing Kenny and Royce, two people that
were not only very solid with the basketball, whether it's first and second in
assists, but also great leaders and individuals, and great team guys, everyday
guys.  
  
So from a leadership standpoint, happy with the chemistry what we've seen so
far. But at the same time, I know we don't want to have a lot of injuries in
the back court because we don't have as much returning experience there.  
  
Q. There's been a lot of debate around the country, Scott, about
watchability of college basketball. Do you hear those comments, and what do
you say to people that say sometimes games get a little bit funky?  
COACH DREW: Well, I think it's most important to look at the TV ratings. I
believe last year from the numbers that I remember, from our Big 12 spring
meetings, the ratings were the highest they've ever been in March. So I think
most people enjoy March Madness, and I think every coach wants games to look a
little better. Less turnovers, more skill, better shooting percentages, more
points. I think a quicker clock will help with that.  
  
Officials are going to call it closer this year, which will give more freedom
of movement, which will help with scoring as well.  
  
Our football team scores a lot of points and it's fun to watch. I know our
basketball players like to score, so hopefully the tweaks this year help.  
  
Q. Obviously a lot of focus on Rico this year. He did have the one off-
the-court incident. What did you talk to him about after that occurred, and
how has he responded?  
COACH DREW: Well, first and foremost, he admitted he made the mistake and
apologized to his teammates, coaches. Rico is somebody that is married, a
child, has a lot of responsibility on his shoulders, and the great thing is
he's going to graduate this year. Hopefully he's going to have an opportunity
to play pro basketball.  
  
Then, as a coach, we all want to see our players leave and improve
spiritually, socially, academically as well as in basketball. Rico, I think is
on the right track for that.  
  
Q. Going back to the rules you mentioned a minute ago, with the hand
checking, do you think that will be a situation sort of like last year where
it seems like there were a thousand fouls in the first month and then the refs
just backed off?  
COACH DREW: I know from a coaching standpoint a couple years ago, or two years
ago that was an emphasis. Then as the year dwindled on, it got a little more
physical when you get into conference play. I believe in the resolve this year
with the officials, and I know from a coaching standpoint we're prepared for
that to be called all year long.  
  
Q. Taurean was so effective last year as the sixth man. Do you see him
continuing in that role? Or do you like the idea of him in the starting
lineup? How much did the Team USA competition, do you think, help his game?  
COACH DREW: I think he's definitely earned a starting role this year. Last
year he was just so effective coming off the bench, and the team was off to a
great start, we kind of stayed with what we were doing.  
  
And TP, this year, will be starting barring an injury or incident or anything.
But I think this summer really took his game to another level, having an
opportunity to be one of eight college players on that USA/Pan-Am team, and
just the confidence he was able to gain from that. The way he's approaching
each and every day at practice, it's great to see.  
  
As a coach, you always want to see people mature, and definitely he's matured
from his freshman year to senior year as far as how he conducts himself. He's
been a great role model and example for our younger players.  
  
Again, I think the Big 12 was tremendous last year, but you have so much great
leaders coming back and so many experienced players that what happens is your
freshmen and of so more look up to those juniors and seniors. No matter what
the coach says, players look at each other, and when they see upperclassmen
that are successful and see their work ethic, I think every coach will tell
you that really speaks volumes. That's why I think it's going to be a great
year in the Big 12 this year.  
  
Q. When last a lot of us were talking to you was after that NCAA game in
Jacksonville and I remember you --  
COACH DREW: Yeah, thanks.  
  
Q. I remember you saying that was going to stay with you for a while.
How long did that stay with you? Is that something you're using with this
year's group? How are you approaching that into last season?  
COACH DREW: First of all, I think coaches remember those losses for a
lifetime. When, hopefully, I'm 80, 90 years old, and unfortunately I'll
probably still remember that game and other big losses because they just stick
with you. At the same time, I think our players that returned, definitely I'll
remember that, and that experience hopefully will motivate us this year.  
  
You look at the Spurs lost, in a great example, lost the playoffs to the Heat.
The next year they came back and were stronger than ever. I think coaches,
again, remember those things. But when the players have that burning desire
and they're the ones that have that experience, that's even more beneficial.
So hopefully at the end of this year that's something that will have helped
us.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 14, 2015

  

### [Frank Mason III](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=27860)

### [Wayne Selden, Jr.](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26682)

### [Bill Self](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13713)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Iowa State  70  
Kansas  66

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined now by Coach Bill Self and the Kansas Jayhawks,
student‑athletes are Frank Mason, III and Wayne Selden, Jr. Coach, your
thoughts?  
COACH SELF: Well, obviously we're disappointed. We put ourselves into a great
position and to go up 17, I guess with about 19:30 left. And then we didn't
really defend the second half or rebound either one, and those were the two
things we did great the first half.  
When they came back and the pressure was on for us to have some good
possessions, we didn't have it. All we really had was just drive it and get to
the free‑throw line and we did a very good job of that.  
They just made a few more plays than us. We got it tied late and couldn't get
a stop on a rebound, and they were able to score. And then we turned it over
and they were able to extend their lead to 3. And then basically we had a
great opportunity on the layup, Frank made a great play, just missed it. And
then they were able to win the game.  
But we did some good things, proud of our guys. We fought hard. We're not
whole. We need a week to get well, and hopefully we'll back with our batteries
recharged next week.  
  
Q. For both you guys, how difficult was their dribble penetration and their
run ‑outs in the second half?   
WAYNE SELDEN, JR.: We didn't guard the ball that well. It was really, when it
came down to it, guarding the ball one‑on‑one and we didn't do that as good as
we could have.  
FRANK MASON, III: I agree with Wayne, we didn't defend the ball well. Our help
defense wasn't good. It just came down to one‑on‑one defense and their guys
made plays and we didn't do a great job of helping.  
  
Q. You guys were up 17 in the second half. How much confidence did you have
that you could hold them off?  
FRANK MASON, III: We had a lot of confidence when we were up 17. We just
wanted to keep attacking, get easy shots, but‑‑ and try to continue playing
great defense, try to continue the defense from the first half, just try to
stop them from getting easy baskets.  
  
Q. For both of you, obviously Iowa State has had a habit this tournament of
having double ‑digit deficits, coming back, gutting out second‑half wins in
the second half. How much did y'all discuss that, saying, we have to stay
composed and can't let them make a run at us?   
WAYNE SELDEN, JR.: We know it's a long game. No matter whether you're up or
down, it's going to be a long game and you just want to get stops down the
stretch.  
FRANK MASON, III: We knew they were a comeback team. The past few games, they
have been coming back and we discussed we wanted to keep the attack mode on
and keep the lead and keep them from getting the easy baskets.  
  
Q. For both of you guys, thought process on the lob to Wayne and the one
‑handed slam?   
FRANK MASON, III: I was just coming down in transition, I seen Wayne's
defender paying attention to me, he snuck behind him and I threw it up.  
WAYNE SELDEN, JR.: Playing with a good point guard and knowing he's going to
find you, that's the biggest thing.  
  
Q. For either of you two, what's the mindset for y'all as a team going
forward into the NCAA Tournament? Obviously you don't know the seed or where
you're going, but how do you recover from a loss like this?  
WAYNE SELDEN, JR.: Biggest thing is all year we've came down the stretch where
we've played well and we haven't played well.  
We just want to take the games we haven't played well and correct it and
continue the things we did well. That's the biggest thing, just trying to
focus on getting stops down the stretch.  
THE MODERATOR: Gentlemen, we will let you return to the locker room with your
SID Chris Theisen. Good luck next week.  
  
Q. Coach, same question I asked the guys. You are up 17, you knew they were
a come ‑back team, how confident were you that your team could hold them off?
  
COACH SELF: We talked about not thinking hold them off, then you're on the
defense if you're thinking that way. So we talked about extending the lead at
halftime, but when things fell apart, you know‑‑ they scored an absurd number
of points in the paint the second half and none of them were off post‑up
touches, none of it. So it was off driving the ball or second shots and a lot
of it was our turnovers had led to run‑outs. Our transition defense was good,
just our turnovers that led to run‑outs.  
Our offense cost us the second half. Our offense contributed to our poor
defense. But the bottom line is they played take‑em, and we had no answer. We
went zone late and the zone actually got it back tied. We were down 7 when we
went zone, I think, and we got it back tied.  
But the bottom line is we didn't defend and didn't rebound. We didn't do
things the second half that we were doing the first half that allowed to us
get a lead.  
  
Q. Bill, what do you think of the atmosphere? The NCAA Fine Fours and
Regionals aren't able to play in arenas like this, but what would you think
about that?  
COACH SELF: Well, it's never going to happen, so I don't know why we're
talking about that, I mean, the Final Four. But I guess you could play in a
Regional that could be a smaller arena.  
But even in the NCAA Tournament, the atmosphere very rarely would ever be as
good as it is today. This is better because you have fan bases that get more
than 450 or 1,500 tickets and that kind of stuff.  
I obviously applaud Iowa State's people because I don't know how in the world
they can get 10,000 people in this building and have 5,000 waiting to get in
that can't get in. It's unbelievable how they took over downtown. And our fans
were good today, too, but their fans certainly‑‑ I guess it's a destination,
Kansas City is, for their fans because they packed 'em in here. I think the
crowd obviously helped them, but it wasn't a factor in the game. But I think
it gave them energy the second half.  
We did some good things, but the bottom line is we need to get our team back‑‑
this isn't an excuse, but we need to get back healthy. Landen is out there
fighting through it and Perry is fighting through it and we got some other
guys that are nicked up and we need to take a couple of days and regroup and
get our batteries recharged.  
We did some good things. We basically played a pitiful half of basketball and
a really good half of basketball today. And our pitiful half was a little
worse than our really good half.  
  
Q. Bill, first, if I can just follow ‑up on that answer, how confident are
you that you guys will be as close to whole as a team can be?   
COACH SELF: I think we will be. Perry did well. It was a lot for him to come
back two days in a row, that was obvious. He didn't have the bounce and he's
not 100%.  
But the great thing is he got through it and, you know, he's able to play‑‑
Perry was able to play 56 minutes the last two days when he's been, you know,
only injured for eight days. Give him six or seven more days, he'll be fine.  
Landen, he needs three or four days without question with all his nagging
stuff.  
I think Frank obviously needs a couple of days, but I think we will be as
close to whole as we have been in a long time by the time Thursday or Friday
rolls around.  
  
Q. You've called this the biggest grind that you've had in the run of
titles. What do you know or think about your team now that maybe you weren't
sure of before the conference season started?  
COACH SELF: Well, you know, I have probably‑‑ although we didn't show it the
second half, the thing I do think is that we can make other teams play poorly.  
We did a good job of that the first half. In the second half, we didn't at
all. I mean, didn't at all. It was a polar opposite.  
But we've got it in us to do that and we've got it in us to rebound the ball,
but we didn't play tough the second half. I think I know our team enough to
know that we will do those things.  
Offensively it's a grind every day. You don't have a post guy to play through
today. You're trying to play four guards, a ton of time together. And Iowa
State packed it in, they didn't guard us on the perimeter and dared us to make
some plays. So we've got to have some guys step up, and I thought Wayne did a
nice job of stepping up today. But it would be nice if we could stretch it and
play inside/out again, and we will do that when Perry gets healthier.  
I like our team. I like our chances. Who knows about the draw yet, but this
isn't the end of their season today. I told our guys that, if you play you
might as well win. So there is no question that we didn't compete to win and
they just outplayed us. But the bottom line is, hey, by 6:00 tomorrow nobody
is going to be thinking about this game and Iowa State won't be thinking about
it either by 6:00 tomorrow. It's the quickest turn on an emotional game that
we have all year long.  
  
Q. Looking to the NCAA Tournament, Bill, this time of year, coaches, players
like to talk about everything is zero, zero. Everybody has a chance to win a
tournament. With the way that Kentucky is playing, is it going to be more of a
challenge to get the guys to buy into that mentality that we've got the same
chances as 67 other teams to win the whole thing?  
COACH SELF: That will never be mentioned. Our goal is to win a two‑game
tournament, that's it. And the next weekend your goal is to win a two‑game
tournament. And then if you're lucky enough to play the next weekend, it's the
same. Maybe there is somebody out there, but I won't approach it like that.
Whatever anybody else does is irrelevant. You're just going to try to win a
two‑game tournament wherever you go.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach, good luck next week.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Iowa State  70  
Kansas  66

  
THE MODERATOR: We're ready to begin with the Championship team from Iowa State
University, Coach Fred Hoiberg, three student‑athletes tonight, Monté Morris,
Abdel Nader and Georges Niang. And Coach, as we said yesterday, you know how
to make things exciting. Congratulations. And your thoughts on today's
Championship?  
COACH HOIBERG: Thank you very much. It was obviously a tough game; we got off
to a tough start. I attribute the fact that we got back to the hotel at about
midnight last night and had to get up. We brought them over here to try to get
them moving and get their legs going.  
I thought we went out there with really good energy. I attribute our lack of
shot making maybe to having wobbly legs, which tends to happen. I remember
playing three in three days back, hell, a long time ago, I'll just say that.
But you've got to fight through it. When you've got leaders like we've got,
especially guys sitting up here, that can keep your team together ‑‑ and we
got down 17 and they were still talking and positive in the huddle and that's
a great sign when your guys can stick together through that adversity.  
I couldn't be more proud of how we did it, to bounce back after beating Texas
on Monté Morris's heroic shot, to beat an extremely talented Oklahoma team and
Kansas.  
I have so much respect for Bill and the program, and they have won 11
straight. That's an unbelievable accomplishment. To get the opportunity to
play them for the Championship was great for us and just proud of our guys for
finding a way to come out on top.  
  
Q. Georges, you're down 17 early in the second half. Did you think you had
another run you?  
GEORGES NIANG: Yeah, for sure. With the guys that we have and the coach that
we have, we have no quit in us. We were all talking about what we had to do
and we had to stay positive and push through and I think we did that. It led
us to a great thing in the Big 12 Championship.  
  
Q. For all of you, does having to rally from double ‑digit deficits three
straight ball games in close ones like this in three days take more out of you
physically, emotionally or is it about the six of one, half a dozen of the
other?   
GEORGES NIANG: I figured it would take a lot out of you guys. I think it's all
good. I feel like we're built for this. We don't want to come back every time,
but it just seems to keep happening to us. When our name gets called, we
answer the bell.  
I'm not going to say that's who we are, but if that's our emergency button and
that's what we have to do, then we're going to have to do it.  
ABDEL NADER: I mean, especially the last couple games we fought through
adversity. We faced it all the time, all year long. So Coach always talks to
us about playing through adversity and staying together as a team and that's
what we did tonight.  
MONTE MORRIS: To touch on what Abdel said, we have been down in situations
like this before, being down 20 at home to Oklahoma and being able to come
back.  
We have only been playing a good stretch of 14 to 16 minutes of good
basketball and we're just trying to figure out a way to put all 40 into one
game and still come out victorious.  
  
Q. This is for Abdel. Selden tied the game with a three ‑point play, made it
63‑all, and you guys miss a 3, but then you keep the ball alive. A couple of
offensive rebounds and finally you end up getting fouled and hitting the 2.
Can you take us through that sequence and keeping the ball alive and how
important that felt at the time?   
ABDEL NADER: I knew they were in a zone, so it's easier to offensive rebound
all that. I was on the backside of the defense, kind of snuck in there. And I
just knew if the 3 didn't go down that we had to get a rebound and I stayed
with it.  
  
Q. For all of you guys, what does it mean to beat Kansas on this stage in
the final? And also, can you talk about the fans' support that you had? They
may have outnumbered KU fans.  
GEORGES NIANG: Coach touched on that, what Bill Self has going on over at KU
and that whole program, the legacy that's over there is just astounding. To be
able to beat them, especially this year, is utterly the best league in the
country is just phenomenal.  
The fan support, we have the greatest fans in the country, the way they travel
and the way they support and are never down on us and never give up. A lot of
other teams, their fans would have given up on them being down however much we
were at halftime. They stayed with us and we kept them involved and tried to
make plays and they ended up helping us in the end.  
THE MODERATOR: Gentlemen, you can go back to the locker room. Congratulations.  
  
Q. Fred, why did you decide to play ‑‑  
COACH HOIBERG: Ask them.  
  
Q. How was the 5K there; did you guys run it? Why did you decide to play
such an appealing style of basketball to begin with in your career and what
goes through your head when you've heard this season how bad the game looks?  
COACH HOIBERG: Well, it's just‑‑ it's the style that I know. I guess, coming
from my years, I've got more experience, with ten years as a player and one
year sitting out after my surgery and four years in a front office, with a
24‑second shot clock. That's the style and the system and the pace we played
with in the different organizations that I was fortunate enough to be with.  
I'll tell you what, one guy that I think gets a lot of credit for coming in my
first year and helping me establish my philosophy is Bobby Lutz who played an
up‑tempo style at Charlotte.  
And then I look back on my coaches, going Johnny Orr probably has as big an
impact on the way we played at Iowa State, really trying to get up and down
the floor, playing an exciting brand of basketball, that was great for the
fans to watch and we have tried to do that, but at the same time not play out
of control.  
And tonight I looked, we had six turnovers against a Kansas team that really
pressures and we practice it every day. We practice transition basketball. If
you don't practice it, if you just tell your guys to play fast, you're
probably going to be throwing that thing up in the third row.  
I guess just from the way that I was raised and played the three years there
at Iowa State with Johnny and my years with the great coaches that I played
for in the NBA.  
  
Q. Fred, what I asked Georges earlier, what's the magnitude of beating
Kansas on this stage especially with what they have done the regular season,
and how can your fans get tickets?  
COACH HOIBERG: That first night against Texas, I'm not sure I'd ever heard a
neutral court that loud in favor of one team. It was just unbelievable how
they helped will us to that win even being down 10 with about four minutes to
go in that game.  
Kansas has unbelievable fans, Allen Fieldhouse is one of my favorite places.
When I was playing, we got the hell beat out of us, but it was a fun place
because of the history in that building. And the fans, they show up. It's 16‑3
every game, doesn't matter who you're playing.  
And our fans are like that as well. We have fan bases, and I knew tonight
would be an exciting atmosphere because in my opinion you've got the two best
fan bases in the Big 12 conference and you're basically split right down the
middle. Their fans were great when they were going on runs and our fans were
great when we were going on runs. That's what it's all about when you can have
two fan bases like we did tonight.  
I think the two teams have great respect for each other. I know we do and I
think they have the same for us.  
  
Q. Coach, what was with the blowout, piling it on late?  
COACH HOIBERG: Hell, I don't know how to answer that question.  
  
Q. Fred, how about Bill throwing the zone at you after you get the lead, and
I thought it took you guys a couple of possessions to handle it?  
COACH HOIBERG: It did. I thought they may throw it out there. We talked about
it. Didn't know if they would go to it, but they threw it out there when we
had success getting into the paint. I'm really excited we got 46 in the paint
against that length and against that team. They slowed us down and I think
that was the objective with that.  
Out of the 3‑2 zone, we were trying to get it in the middle, shorten the game,
get longer possessions and then kinda had to rush‑‑ had a couple of good
looks. Abdel had a good look and Naz had a great shot, and then the big
offensive rebound in the zone as well that Abdel was able to get.  
But it was great coaching by Bill to get us out of our rhythm.  
  
Q. Coach, did it feel like you got production from just about everybody in
the lineup at different spots, key rebounds and free ‑throws over the course
of this game and over the course of the tournament?   
COACH HOIBERG: No doubt about it. That was a big thing. I talked to our team
about ‑‑ Georges only played 36 minutes tonight, so we got him quite a bit of
rest. But we knew we needed those guys to come in and give us great minutes.  
I thought Bryce Dejean‑Jones' steal and dunk when he got fouled might have
been the play of the game that kind of got the momentum going for us when he
tied the score.  
And then Nader just continued to attack the basket. We got him a couple of
times isolated on the wing. He's a really talented kid and it was good to see
that come out tonight.  
Our bench was awesome. Matt Thomas is going to have a big role for us in the
NCAA Tournament, and I'm confident he's going to knock down a couple of big
ones for us.  
  
Q. Coach, what was your thought when you were down 17 besides here we go
again? Were you confident your team could come back?  
COACH HOIBERG: That was tough. When they went up 17 and we called a time‑out,
get 'em over there together and challenged them on, all right, guys, what have
you got left in the tank, let's leave it out there, let's go down swinging and
fighting and whatever happens, happens. Our guys did exactly that. We tried to
talk to them about getting it to single digits and then anything can happen
and I couldn't be more proud of how they responded in that time‑out.  
  
Q. Coach, you were in a similar spot in terms of momentum coming out of this
tournament. You had the injury to Georges and everything. Do you feel like
this is another year where maybe you guys have a chance to make a run and do
something in the NCAA tournament?  
COACH HOIBERG: I hope so. I think there is parity in college basketball this
year, outside of Kentucky. If we can get hot and keep the confidence goin',
that's, I think, the biggest thing in a three‑day run like this against three
great teams is it breeds confidence in your players. They can battle through
anything. No lead is insurmountable. And you find a way to battle and bounce
back and I think from a confidence standpoint it certainly helps your team.  
  
Q. Fred, why does Dustin Hogue play with a toothpick?  
COACH HOIBERG: That's probably a question for Dustin. We'll go one more, that
wasn't a good last question. Let me just say this: This was a great week for
us, for Jamie Pollard, this is a win for him and I know it was a stressful
three days, but the end result I think was great for Jamie and his therapy.
He's the best, he's a great guy to work for, a great boss. And to win this one
for him is really a special moment, thank you.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach. Again, congratulations, and we wish you the
best next week.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Iowa State  67  
Oklahoma  65

  
THE MODERATOR: We're ready to get started with the Iowa State Cyclones, Coach
Fred Hoiberg and his two student‑athletes tonight, Jameel McKay and Georges
Niang. Coach, you sure know how to make things exciting. Congratulations on
the victory.  
COACH HOIBERG: Thank you for that. It was an unbelievably competitive game. We
knew it would be. They jumped out on us early. I thought we missed a couple of
good looks at the basket and I thought we started rushing our shots a little
bit as opposed to letting the offense come to us.  
Once we calmed down, I was glad to see we were able to pull back even at the
half and come out and get off to a nice run in the second half.  
They went on a run, which we knew they would, but we held our composure, which
was a great sign and that's what allowed us to win that game.  
  
Q. Georges, can you talk the 1 of 2 from the free ‑throw and then how that
set up?   
GEORGES NIANG: That changed the dynamic of how Oklahoma was going to attack.
And I knew I had to make the second one, so I knocked it down and my teammates
did a great job of getting back and I don't want to say forced them to miss a
shot but go after the rebound after he missed.  
  
Q. Either of you can answer this or both, you've had four back
‑to‑back‑to‑back‑to‑back games where you have been in a double digit deficit
and ended up winning. How have you been able to do that?   
GEORGES NIANG: The comeback kids strike again? No, we believe in each other
and have the will and the fight to keep fighting until the clock hits zero.
I'm not saying being down double digits for those last couple of games is a
good thing. Obviously we need to get things in check, but there is no quit in
this team and that's the biggest thing we need. That's all we have is each
other, and we put our best foot forward every time we get out there.  
  
Q. For either of you, your thoughts on playing KU again third time this
year?  
JAMEEL McKAY: It's an exciting feeling, especially knowing that we got a
chance to win the Big 12 Tournament Championship. I feel like we let one go
the last time we was at McCasland Field House, and this was our time on the
big stage to get some revenge.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, guys, you got off easy, we will let you go back to the
locker room. Congratulations.  
  
Q. Coach, your A.D. has heart issues, this is not the way to ‑‑  
COACH HOIBERG: So do I.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the resiliency of the team to win these close games?  
COACH HOIBERG: Well, yeah, it's a great sign, I guess, when you fall behind
double digits, to be able to keep your composure and come back and get the win
as opposed to earlier in the year where it would go from 10 to 20, and then we
would get it back to 10, now it's getting to 10 or 12 and we're able to cut
back like we did tonight. That's a step in the right direction. Hell, the next
step, I guess, would not be getting down double digits. Maybe that would help.  
  
Q. Again, with your A.D., close games, not exactly good for heart
conditions. Have you talked with him recently? How is he feeling?  
COACH HOIBERG: Yeah, I have. I've actually talked to him the last two days. I
got a call from his wife Ellen the day after the surgery while he was still in
ICU, and I had a good conversation with him and just talked to him about the
recovery being through an open heart procedure myself.  
He sounded, I thought, really good. From being in that situation, I doubt he
remembers much of what we talked about. And I talked to him after the game and
he was obviously in great spirits. I forgot to tell him the day before not
watch. I'm surprised that his doctor let him watch the game. But at the end of
it, it's great therapy, I think, for him that keeps some normalcy in his life.  
Hopefully he will be able to get out of there in a few days and then it's the
road to recovery and the biggest thing for Jamie is going to be to listen to
his body and not try to play super hero and get back on his feet. Knowing
Jamie and his fighting spirit, I know he'll be back in no time.  
  
Q. Coach, do you have any idea why your team falls behind by double digits?
Obviously it's not as easy as flipping a switch, but what is it that's
happening to them that gets them behind?  
COACH HOIBERG: Good question. I don't know, that's a great question. I thought
we had great prep going into this one. And, again, I don't think it was
because of lack of effort. They hit some shots on us early, 5 of their first 7
they hit and we defended the line much better after that, finishing the game
for them 7 to 28, 2 for 12 there in the second half.  
The biggest thing that I thought hurt us tonight was the glass. We did not do
a good job rebounding the ball. We weren't making contact on the cutouts and
their length, they were back‑trapping the ball and they were getting looks and
second‑chance points. But we did outscore them in the paint and that was the
goal coming into this game was to try to win that paint battle so that was a
positive.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 13, 2015

  

### [Buddy Hield](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28575)

### [Kevin Kruger](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17015)

### [TaShawn Thomas](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26664)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Iowa State  67  
Oklahoma  65

  
THE MODERATOR: Okay we're joined now by the Oklahoma Sooners, Coach Lon
Kruger, his student‑athletes in the interview room are Buddy Hield and TaShawn
Thomas. Coach, an opening comment?  
COACH KRUGER: Third time we've played Iowa State and it's been three really
good battles.  
Tonight was a good battle. I thought both teams played really hard. And when
you know each other a little bit after a Big 12 season, it gets to be a little
bit of a grind. But I thought guys really fought and battled, and obviously
didn't get it done but we will learn from it and get better.  
Congratulations to Fred's group, he always does a great job, but we got to get
our heads up and get ready to play next week.  
  
Q. Buddy, talk about struggling from the shooting for you tonight and how
frustrating it was to lose in the last second.  
BUDDY HIELD: It's tough. Got a great look, feel bad for Ryan for what he's
going through right now, but we've got to find a way to pick him back up. But
we got to go into the NCAA Tournament and we got to make a big run and stick
together no matter what. Win, lose or draw we got to stick together as a
group.  
  
Q. TaShawn, you guys staved off their runs tonight by going inside, was that
game planning?  
TaSHAWN THOMAS: I kind of felt like me and Ryan, especially myself, wasn't
that physical and wasn't aggressive in the first half. So when Coach‑‑ Coach
said something to me in the second half and it made me just change my mind
saying just attack. I felt like that's what kept us in the game. And then our
guards were able to knock down shots later on.  
  
Q. For both of you, how can you use this maybe frustration, this loss, going
into the NCAA Tournament as fuel for that?  
TaSHAWN THOMAS: Kind of feel like it could make us hungry, make us want to
work hard. At the same time we can look at it and be, like, we were that
close. If we would have done this one thing at the end of the game, we could
have went to overtime. But at the same time, you can't look back and dwell on
the negative things and just look at the positive things. I feel like if we do
that we can keep on striving.  
THE MODERATOR: Guys, we will let you go back to the locker room. Good luck
next week.  
  
Q. Coach, what is it about this match ‑up where both teams seem to go on
runs in the same game? Every time you play 'em, big runs.   
COACH KRUGER: That's the way it's been in the three ball games. I think both
teams have various options, a lot of different guys that can score, both teams
attack aggressively. The pace is general‑‑ seems like there was more action
today than there was productivity, but both teams were still attacking and
swinging away.  
And I think there is great respect from our guys for Iowa State and we know
they're good and I think our guys look forward to that challenge, too.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk us through that last play? Was the idea to get it in
Ryan's hands or what were you looking for there?  
COACH KRUGER: Looking to just push it, get Jordan loose going to the bucket,
had shooters in each corner. Kind of a bobbled around there a little bit, and
all of the sudden no one knows how much time is on the clock. And Ryan
probably felt he needed to get it up there quickly, but, again, that's not the
play that would have sent it into overtime. But we had other options, like
Buddy said, throughout the game to make a difference as well.  
  
Q. Lon, do you wish you could play Iowa State in a seven ‑game series based
on the way this stuff has gone down?   
COACH KRUGER: Well, if we can play 'em deep in the tournament. We don't really
want to meet 'em early.  
It's been a good series, Big 12 games, a lot of them have been like that.
Again, a lot of respect for how they play and how hard they play and Fred does
a great job. They have been good battles.  
  
Q. Coach, same question, how can you use this loss maybe as fuel for the
fire going into the NCAA Tournament?  
COACH KRUGER: Just a play or two away from playing in a championship game as
we would have been here. That's always disappointing. And kind of you go back
to the value of each possession, competing harder for the result, each
possession, not taking any loose ball for granted or any second shot
opportunity for granted, just trying to do things better.  
That's how games are decided. And all of the sudden, you know, the next time
you lose, it's over. This group has responded great all year to‑‑ after
winning, after losing, they have bounced back and practiced well and I have no
doubt that they will bounce back with a couple of good workouts next week.  
  
Q. Lon, Ryan is pretty dejected in that locker room. Do you worry about
getting him ready for next week?  
COACH KRUGER: Worried for Ryan, but, hey, he'll get over it. He's the heart
and soul for this club, his emotion, his blue collar work ethic, he's our
identity in that regard.  
Everyone appreciates that and certainly everyone feels for him that he missed
that shot, but, hey, we'll pick it up and play again and he'll bounce back.
He's a gritty competitor and no one feels worse about it than he does. But,
again, he's been at the heart of everything we have done and he will have all
the support he needs to bounce back well.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you.

### [Perry Ellis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25064)

### [Wayne Selden, Jr.](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26682)

### [Bill Self](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13713)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Kansas  62  
Baylor  52

  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, we're ready to begin with the Kansas Jayhawks, Coach
Self, two student‑athletes tonight, Perry Ellis and Wayne Selden, Jr. Coach,
congratulations on your victory. We will call on you for an opening statement.  
COACH SELF: There for a while I think both teams set basketball back, Mr.Ivan
and Dr.Allen would have been proud there for a while. We kind of got a little
rhythm offensively and defensively and really played well defensively and
rebounded the ball. Certainly, we were on fire from three because we made
three. We were 3 for 12, and that's the best we shot in a while. But it was
good to have Perry and Kelly to knock down a couple right off the bat and that
gave us confidence.  
But the difference in the game, from my perspective, was that would he
defended for 40 minutes and rebounded the ball great. And Wayne was great and
having Perry out there gives our team a ton of confidence.  
  
Q. Perry and Wayne, a lot has been made about the rivalry you guys have had
with Iowa State. Is the possibility of getting them in the championship
something that excites you?  
PERRY ELLIS: Definitely, whatever happens, happens, we're just here trying to
take it game by game and just go from there.  
WAYNE SELDEN, JR.: Definitely, I feel like those are two good teams playing
tonight and we will wait for tomorrow to see who we got.  
  
Q. Perry, coach said yesterday you were a little bit hesitant about playing
yesterday so he sat you out. In what ways do you feel like having the extra
day helped you tonight?  
PERRY ELLIS: Just getting more reps up and getting more confidence in myself
and I did that. I've been working real hard. I felt today was the day, and it
felt great.  
  
Q. Perry, you did limp off there in the second half and didn't come back
into the game. Could you have returned? What's your status look like for
tomorrow?  
PERRY ELLIS: Yeah, I definitely could have. It didn't hit my knee. It was just
high up on my leg, I got bumped there. But I definitely could have. I'm fine.  
  
Q. Perry, have you ever had a basketball injury before? Was that any reason
to want to get back on the court and see how it felt?  
PERRY ELLIS: I would say this was my most serious one I've had and I was
definitely anxious to get back out there to feel it out, and it felt great.  
  
Q. Both players, can you talk about the defensive effort you guys had
tonight?  
WAYNE SELDEN, JR.: We knew we hadn't been playing defense to our capability in
recent games and we wanted to get out and pressure their guard and try to deny
the passes and play with a lot of energy.  
PERRY ELLIS: Like he said, just gettin' out there and gettin' after it, and I
feel like we did a great job, great job tonight.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, guys, we will let you return to the locker room. Good
luck tomorrow.  
  
Q. Just talk a little bit more about the defensive effort. That was their
lowest point total of the season.  
COACH SELF: I think we did a really good job in everything tonight defensively
with the exception of transition defense. It has down they only got 10 points,
but there was more points than that in transition because of follow‑up shots
or whatnot.  
I thought we defended 'em well. Let's be real ‑ they missed some open looks,
too, but that's part of it. But with the exception of keeping Rico off the
glass, we rebounded the ball very well against a team that's a great
rebounding team. I thought the mindset was, you know, we can't‑‑ because we
hadn't made shots lately obviously, if we can't depend on that, we can depend
on making sure the other team doesn't play well and we actually did that
pretty well.  
  
Q. Coach, what were the keys to stopping Rico Gathers? You held him to 11
points and forced five turnovers, his career high.  
COACH SELF: The key is he got better than his averageon both, I think. He may
be averaging more than 11. He got 13 rebounds. I don't know that we did a good
job of stopping him. But what we did do a good job of is we trapped him early,
which led to maybe a couple of missed shots. But we did do a good job of
challenging his shots high and he made a great left‑handed hook to start the
game from about six feet, which was a hard shot.  
But for the most part, we didn't give him angles. Even when he got an
offensive rebound, we usually fouled him before he had a chance to have an
and‑one or whatnot. So I don't know if we did a great job, but we were able to
throw more bodies at him. And those guys, Landen especially competed hard
against him.  
  
Q. Coach, Wayne had 20 points, were you pleased with how your team attacked
the rim?  
COACH SELF: I thought Wayne did a much better job. He settles too much in my
opinion. He did a much better job of getting to the free‑throw line, didn't
make his free‑throws great but he was much more aggressive and he seemed to me
like he had much more balance. He's been laboring and it's been fairly well
documented, but I think today he was a basketball player and you score when
you don't worry about scoring.  
Now, we weren't any good offensively for the most part the whole game and they
had a lot to do with that from a rhythm standpoint, but we did take advantage
of getting to the free‑throw line by driving the ball.  
  
Q. Was it purposeful to start the game with threes or is that just what the
defense gave you?  
COACH SELF: I told them if they're open to shoot it and hoped like hell that
they wouldn't! (Laughter.)  
The thing about it is if we're going to make two threes, you don't think the
bigs and Kelly would line 'em up and knock it down. When a team plays zone and
you only shoot 12 threes, you're not exactly playing to shoot the ball from
beyond the arc. But we did fine. We didn't attack their zone great. They
played it differently than they did either other time that they played us. But
I was really pleased with our guys because we won the game with what I think
coaches take most pride in is we played tough, rebounded and we defended.  
  
Q. Bill, I guess one way to look at your team is it's versatile, finds
different ways to win, another way is maybe you don't know how you're going to
find a way all the time. Defense was a big deal tonight. Is this as much of a
find ‑a‑way‑to‑win type of team as you have had at Kansas?   
COACH SELF: I think so. The thing about it is, when you‑‑ we've got a pretty
good team, but, hey, Baylor arguably is as good as anybody in our league and
they've been on a role and things like that.  
I think sometimes when it's not very artistic, I think people say, well, you
didn't play well. If we wanted to play a pretty game with Baylor, they would
probably beat our butts. So I think we did a good job of making it a game with
no rhythm and I do think our guys find a way to win. Last night we found a way
to win ugly, I don't see that being the case at all tonight.  
I think it was more of a good defensive energy rebounding‑type effort which is
the formula for winning in the NCAA Tournament, too, because you can never
bank on shots going in.  
  
Q. How eager was Perry to get out there? How did he look and did he tweak it
there late in the game?  
COACH SELF: Well, you know Perry covering him, his personality, he just exudes
so much enthusiasm that I really didn't know how eager he was. He is
stoned‑faced all the time. You could tell he was excited, he was in the zone,
way excited to be out there. I didn't know if we would play him that many
minutes and I could have put him back in, but we had the game.  
The bottom line is he's going to let his leg hit, that's basketball. It's just
like a running back gets hit. You gotta get hit and realize you're okay and
that's what happened there. So he should be fine and there should be no
problems tomorrow.  
  
Q. Were you surprised to see Baylor shoot as much as they did in the first
half rather than testing Perry or Jamariinside a little more than they could
have?  
COACH SELF: I don't know. They did take ten threes the first half, but I
thought we did a pretty good job defending them. And when you trap the post, I
think sometimes that discourages people from throwing it in there a lot. Not
really surprised at all.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach, we'll see you tomorrow. Good luck.

### [Scott Drew](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14205)

### [Rico Gathers](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25026)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Kansas  62  
Baylor  52

  
THE MODERATOR: We are ready to begin with Baylor University and the head
coach, Scott Drew and his student‑athletes tonight in the interview room are
Kenny Chery and Rico Gathers. Coach, we will look to you first for an opening
comment.  
COACH DREW: I thought defensively we put ourselves into a position to be
successful. Rebounding‑wise we did as well.  
Unfortunately we didn't take care of the ball well enough. Shooting, obviously
wasn't good, wasn't pretty, but the turnovers got us, especially in
transition. I think we had seven in the first half or way too many, and we are
too good of a rebounding team not to give ourselves a chance to get
second‑chance points off the glass.  
Credit Kansas's defense, but I know some of them we did to ourselves, similar
to them. I'm sure the 18 that they had, some of those were self‑inflicted as
well.  
  
Q. Rico, you guys have been playing so well offensively the last couple of
games. What do you feel like happened tonight?  
RICO GATHERS: I just felt everybody is entitled to a bad shooting night. I
guess tonight was one of those nights for us.  
If we would have made half of our shots that we took, we would have ended up
winning the game. That's just something positive to look at.  
Going forward, I just hope we don't have no more shooting nights like that,
but that let us know we gotta get better and Coach Drew and the coaching staff
will do a good job of making sure we achieve that.  
  
Q. Kenny, are you watching it and just thinking, what's going on out here,
with the way the shots weren't falling?  
KENNY CHERY: It happens to the best of us, like we said we wasn't making shots
today and you can't do nothing about it and just go out there, play defense.
We had good stops and we had good execution and we just didn't hit 'em.  
  
Q. Kenny, did Kansas show you anything defensively that they hadn't showed
you the first two games? Talking about both the shooting and the turnovers, is
there anything you can put your finger on?  
KENNY CHERY: They're a good defensively team and we executed what we should
have executed. We had some careless turnovers, which they converted into
points, and we just gotta take care of the ball.  
  
Q. Rico, you guys play with such confidence normally. Did you guys see this
weekend as a chance to make a national statement for yourself and have other
people get some confidence in you and feel like you missed that maybe today?  
RICO GATHERS: We saw this weekend as a chance to make a statement, a stand for
our program. We really wanted to come out victorious for tomorrow and
hopefully bring home a Big 12 championship. We fell short.  
Just looking forward now, we're trying to win a National Championship and
we're going to do a good job of listening to our coaches and going over Xs and
Os and stuff like that to see where we can get better so we can make that
happen.  
  
Q. Rico, along those lines of going forward, some projections have y'all as
a 3 ‑seed, some as a 4‑seed, what is the excitement level right now for Baylor
getting into this thing and to try to make noise?   
RICO GATHERS: The excitement comes from we are one of the first teams to ever
go back‑to‑back NCAA Tournaments. We're not just excited about making the
tournament, we're trying to make a run.  
Hopefully, you know, we could get a 3‑ or 4‑seed so we will have a better
chance to make it to the Sweet 16 and the Elite Eight and hopefully a Final
Four.  
  
Q. Kenny, you guys got down 14 early in the second half, cut it to 4, but
never could get over the hump. Did you ever feel like if you could catch up
and get over the hump that you could kinda get on a roll?  
KENNY CHERY: The one thing I can say about this group of guys is we are going
to keep fighting. We could be down 30, we're going to keep fighting. We always
believe. We were out there playing our best and they was making shots and we
wasn't, but we were still fighting.  
  
Q. Kenny, your thoughts on going to the NCAA Tournament? How excited are
you?  
KENNY CHERY: We're excited and we feel confident. And today was a lesson for
us, we're going to watch film and prepare ourselves for the next match‑up.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, guys, we will let you go back to the locker room. Thank
you and good luck next week.  
  
Q. Scott, clearly shooting ‑wise that wasn't y'all tonight. So in your mind,
do you just sort of automatically disregard what happened tonight and move on?
Is there something you take out of this?   
COACH DREW: I think, first of all, for both teams neither shot well. Give
credit to the defense, the intensity of the game, playing back‑to‑back nights
in the best conference in the country there is fatigue and that affects you
physically and you see that in the shots and it also affects you mentally.
Make some decisions, take some shots you probably wouldn't take if you were
mentally sharp, probably make a couple extra passes.  
And then let's face it, shooting is confidence. You miss a couple‑‑ now,
normally teams let up on the defensive end. If you shoot this poor against a
team as talented as Kansas, most teams lose by 20 plus. Credit our guys for
fight and heart to continue to battle.  
Besides Kenny, we're 0 for 15 from three. You're not going to win a lot of
games when you shoot 32%, and yet you give yourself a chance. If we weren't
stuck on 35 or 36 for what seemed like an eternity in the second half, we
would have a chance down the stretch.  
  
Q. Coach, how much stock did you put in the weekend for elevating your seed
for next week?  
COACH DREW: We were encouraged not only by trying to make as good of an
impression for our seed because we know the higher the seed the better chance
you have to advance and win in the tournament, but I think playing in the Big
12 Tournament is such an honor.  
I mean, cut down the nets here, bring home a championship, that was motivation
in itself and these guys wanted to do that. That's why you're all upset when
you lose when you don't have a chance to do that.  
Rico was talking about it would be the first time ever we've gone back‑to‑back
to the NCAA Tournament. And the great thing is because of the work we have
done all year long, our RPI was 9, strength of schedule was 3, so hopefully we
get a good seed and we will put ourselves into‑‑ and you're never in a
position where you play back‑to‑back games again either. So you get a day of
rest in the NCAA, which allows you to hopefully make a couple more shots
because I don't know if people would like to watch basketball if no one ever
made anything.  
  
Q. Scott, Bill talked about the first half setting the game back a little
bit. When you are 5 of 25, 1 of 10 from three and I don't know how many
turnovers, you feel fortunate to be down by 8 at half?  
COACH DREW: No question. You go in the locker room and 20%, 5 for 25, that
many turnovers and single digits? Again, that's a tournament like this, where
the intensity is so high it affects you mentally and physically. What it does
though is it does prepare you for the NCAA Tournament and that's the best
thing about the Big 12, they do everything just like the NCAA.  
So next week our guys will be ready for it and that day off they will recover
a little more and hopefully we will have better performance if we are able to
make it to Game 2.  
  
Q. Scott, what are the reasons you feel like your team could go far in the
tournament?  
COACH DREW: I think, first of all, defensively you see people are going to
have off shooting nights. Hopefully not as off as tonight, but you got to be
able to defend and rebound and give yourself a chance to be successful. We've
taken care of the basketball, that's why that to me is the biggest
disappointment. The 17 turnovers, I mean, you can't win like that. But for the
most part, we have done a good job.  
And West Virginia, we had 10 turnovers. So as long as we do that with the
rebounding we have, being the No. 1 offensive‑ranked rebounding team and
that's why turnovers are so tough because when you turn over, they get an easy
on the other end and so your defense isn't set which ours is tough to score
on. And the second thing is then you don't give yourself a chance to offense
rebound which we do so well.  
  
Q. Coach, 4 of 22 from three today. You went 4 of 14 yesterday. You guys are
the best 3 ‑point‑shooting team coming into the Big 12, what do you think the
reason was for struggling?   
COACH DREW: I think defense, and when you play everybody a third time,
everybody knows each other's offense, their sets, nothing comes easy.  
So sometimes results are more one‑on‑one play and one‑on‑one play against good
team defense is tough to score. So I think no matter who any of us play, it
will be somebody different and when you're not scouted for that third time,
that should help.  
  
Q. Scott, everybody has been talking about how great the Big 12 has been in
the regular season and it was great last year. To validate everything, does
the conference need a couple teams to go on nice tournament runs as well? You
guys didn't have anybody in Regional Finals last year, is that something you
would like to see?  
COACH DREW: No question that helps with perception, winning a National
Championship, getting to Final Fours. But I guess it all comes down to how do
you‑‑ which team has the two best in it or which team from top to bottom. If
you're looking top to bottom, the Big 12 has been the best. I think people
advancing and getting to the Final Four, National Championship, helps with
nationwide recognition, but if you're judging a conference on top‑to‑bottom,
and that's what how they do the RPI, and you get your conference ranked ‑‑ and
I think we've been the best the last couple of years according to the
computer.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
COACH DREW: Last year you look at Kentucky and UConn, what were they seeded, 7
and 8? Look at how many Big 12 teams are going to be seeded higher than 7 and
8. That's parity in college basketball. You look at UConn and Florida this
year, and not the same turnover, transition, the one‑and‑dones and all that.
It's really hard with parity nowadays and it's hard to be consistent. That's
why Kansas's feat of the conference championships in a row is really
impressive.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much. We wish you the best of luck.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 12, 2015

  

### [Landen Lucas](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28544)

### [Kelly Oubre](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28543)

### [Bill Self](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13713)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Kansas  64  
TCU  59

  
THE MODERATOR: We are now joined by Coach Self and his two student‑athletes
from Kansas, Kelly Oubre and Landen Lucas. Coach, congratulations on your
victory today.  
COACH SELF: Thank you. It was obviously a win which we're happy about, and,
you know, we didn't play particularly well. And I thought TCU played really
smart and really tough. Obviously we didn't make as many plays as I would have
liked throughout the game, but Kelly and Landen basically made enough plays to
allow us to win because basically they were the two best performers we had
today by a long shot.  
  
Q. When you guys play a team three times that you've beaten twice, is it
difficult knowing that they know what you guys are going to do and you know
what they're going to do?  
KELLY OUBRE: Not necessarily difficult because they're a great team. We kind
of underestimated them the first two, maybe the first two times and they
showed us what they were about.  
This game we wanted to show them that we can handle their punches and they
threw a lot of them today, but we withstood them and came out with a victory.  
  
Q. For Kelly and Landen, Coach was crediting you all with making enough
plays in the end to win it. What do you feel like the guys around you did to
hold off a team that kept hanging around?  
LANDEN LUCAS: You know, we did enough to win, but credit to TCU for playing
great game. We just wanted it. We got to play better moving forward and we all
know that. And I think the other guys know what they can do better and they'll
step up for sure.  
  
Q. Kelly, this is the second game out of three that I think you guys haven't
hit a 3 ‑pointer. Is that concerning to you? Also can you tell by a way the
game is going that the shot is not going, the 3‑pointers aren't going down and
you're going to have to figure out a different way to score?   
KELLY OUBRE: Not concerning because we know we can shoot, we know we have to
get our attitudes right, just know that they are going in, and just confined
by the confines of the game. If the shot's there, take it. If it's open, take
it. If you have an extra pass, make the extra pass. But we can't hunt shots.
We have to just play within ourselves, but we know the shots are going to fall
if we have a great attitudes.  
  
Q. Kelly, I think late in the game there was four straight possessions where
you went to the hole, got fouled, went to the foul line. Was that something
they were giving you or did you feel you need to do take control at that
point?  
KELLY OUBRE: Within our offense the lanes were opening up, so the play was to
drive and kick. But I had a bigger, slower guy on me, so I took him and got
fouled.  
  
Q. Kelly, you haven't really played the 4 much this year. How do you think
you exploited that mismatch bigger bodied Washburn?  
KELLY OUBRE: I can move better on the defensive end, I have a lot to learn and
I will learn that. I will do anything to help my team to win.  
  
Q. Kelly, your thoughts on how the game changed without Kyan Anderson and
the job that Trey Zeigler did as you saw them in the backcourt?  
KELLY OUBRE: Both great players, both can step up and get a bucket anytime
they want to. We have to strap down on defense because Zeigler was getting in
the paint a lot. They're both great players and they step up big for their
team. They're two seniors, I believe, or whatever. I credit them for putting
their team on their back and TCU is a great team.  
  
Q. Kelly, you guys played Baylor twice, you're going to play them tomorrow.
Two close games. Why are they so tough to play for you guys?  
KELLY OUBRE: They run a "Y" zone. They have great players, also, on the
offensive and defensive end. We have to bring our game, play with heart and
come ready to play tomorrow because we can be beat on any given night if we're
not ready to play.  
  
Q. Kelly and Landen, what advantages do you think playing four guards gave
you in the game today?  
LANDEN LUCAS: I think Kelly did a good job with guarding. You know, he's
learning it, so it's going to take a little bit of time.  
But on the offensive end, when he has a bigger guy on him, he's able to go
around them. And I think it will be good for us moving forward because we will
be quicker on offense and we can spread them out and open the floor up a
little bit, let them drive to the floor, get fouled.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, guys, we will let you go back to the locker rooms.
Congratulations. We will see you tomorrow.  
  
Q. Bill, player personnel questions, I guess. If you can update us on
Perry's situation and how close is he? And I saw Cliff Alexander's lawyer put
out a statement today. Are you planning for this to be a drawn ‑out process?
  
COACH SELF: I heard that he put out a statement. I haven't seen it so I'm
really not capable of commenting on it because I have no idea what it said. To
my knowledge, everything is status quo.  
We have approached it like we're just moving forward where we're not going to
have him. And if we have him it will be a bonus, but certainly I'm not going
to let it be a distraction for our team. Everybody says Cliff Perry, Cliff
Perry, Cliff Perry, and you're talking about two guys that didn't even play.
It'll be a bonus if we get him, but certainly after being around the situation
for a couple of weeks and there hasn't been much movement, I'm not certainly
holding my breath.  
Then on Perry, Perry practiced a little bit Monday, noncontact. Some contact
Tuesday, full speed Wednesday, and then we practiced him this morning at 8:00.  
He felt really good. When I talked to him he said "Coach, I feel really good.
I think another day would probably do me some good, but I can play."  
And I said, "Well, if you think another day would do you some good, then we're
going to wait another day."  
He said he wanted to play, but when he threw in there, I think another day
would help me, I made the decision right there, we're going on play him
tomorrow. Hopefully he will play tomorrow. But we will get him up and practice
him in the morning. He went through a 30‑minute workout and if he feels good,
which he tells me he feels great‑‑ he said he could have played today. So
there was no reason to put him out there, but I would like to see him play in
this tournament, because I think he would do well to put him in
competitive‑type situations before next week.  
  
Q. Coach, I remember earlier in the year you guys shot 3 ‑pointer so well
and you might have used the term "fool's gold" at one point. You guys haven't
shot them well as of late. You found a way to win those games. What is your
concern with shooting the 3‑pointer, and is it something you can shoot
yourself out of them or are you guys just finding ways around not making them?
  
COACH SELF: I think we're finding a way to piece it together right now. And
that's not a great way to go into the postseason. You usually have an identity
of who you are and how you're going to play. But you're playing three bigs and
two of the bigs get two fouls in the first five minutes, so you've got to play
the rest of the game. So it's just different. We're just kind of make
shifting.  
Today was a good game for us in this regard because we had to play a way that
we haven't practiced very much at all for a large percentage of the game.  
You're not going to advantage in the tournament‑‑ I think if you ask all
coaches, what's the most important thing in the tournament, probably making
shots. You got at that make shots. Everybody can guard and rebound, but you
gotta step up and make shots. But there is a positive about not making shots,
if there is such a thing, because I'll spin it that's really a positive
because we haven't made any. It really focuses you to be better on the
defensive end and better rebounding, because now those things become the way
you carry your team.  
If you guys remember back, which you won't remember as well as I do because I
was a part of it, in 2012, we didn't make any shots and we went to the Finals.
Tyshawn madehis first three of the tournament with three minutes left in the
Championship game. You figure out how to win by defending, rebounding.  
We played North Carolina State in the Sweet 16 game and made two shots outside
of three feet and we still won. So the mindset was, let's guard, guard, guard.  
This team doesn't quite have that mindset, but I do think I'm not going to
talk about, we gotta make shots because if you don't make shots, what do you
do?  
What we gotta do is just play the game. Take 'em as you get 'em. And today
there be wasn't‑‑ we didn't play to a lot of threes, but we took about eight
good ones and came up empty. But the last few games, we have become a team
that drives it hard and that's been good for us, too. We didn't play well
today, obviously, offensively, but TCU had a lot to do with that.  
I know the reality is you're not going to score over a lot of length inside
and things like that unless you can stretch it and, yeah, we need to stretch
it. But you don't shoot 50% for three weeks and have bad shooters, we're just
in a rut right now.  
THE MODERATOR: Time for one more question‑‑  
COACH SELF: If I talk a real long, it's one question. We've only got time for
one more. It's perfect. That was the plan.  
  
Q. Can you talk about TCU's effort, really not having Anderson the full
second half?  
COACH SELF: Frank didn't have a good game, but Frank did a good job on
Anderson. I think he's a good guard and very deserving of All‑League honors. I
watched him play yesterday a lot and I thought their attitudes were perfect.
The postseason was perfect, happy we won and looking forward to the next game
and challenge. And Trent has done such a good job with them. They've gotten so
much better. It was probably good for us that he was out. But on the flip side
when he's out that meant that the Zeigler had the ball the whole time and he's
the one who killed us.  
So, I'm glad that he was out, but on the flip side, I don't know if we took
total advantage of it because Zeigler got wherever he wanted to go.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach. We will see you tomorrow.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Kansas  64  
TCU  59

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by TCU head coach, Trent Johnson, and his two
student‑athletes will be Chris Washburn and Trey Zeigler. Coach, opening
comments?  
COACH JOHNSON: Obviously we weren't good enough this afternoon. I thought we
competed really hard and had opportunities to make plays down the stretch and
didn't make them. It's tough for us to beat anybody when we don't have one of
our best players on the floor.  
The bottom line is Kansas was the better team this afternoon and I would like
to go ahead and let these guys answer questions so they can get off their
feet.  
  
Q. Trey, what was it like for you personally without Kyan, missing your
right hand there?  
TREY ZEIGLER: Well, Kyan is a big part of what we do and me and him share the
responsibilities for the team, and it kinda got put in my hands the whole
second half. And we just tried to battle and keep ourselves in the game.  
  
Q. Chris, how much of a scoring load did you think you had to take on?  
CHRIS WASHBURN: I felt like I had to take on a little bit once Kyan got in
foul trouble and be more aggressive. Kyan has a huge responsibility getting us
into the offense and making everybody better, including himself. So once he
goes out, you gotta try to find somebody else who can step up and I was just
trying to be that person.  
  
Q. Trey, just talk about the confidence of your team, you're down three when
Kyan goes out, 16 minutes to go, four fouls, you guys hung tough, gained a
point before he came back in.  
TREY ZEIGLER: Yesterday I said we felt like we matched up well with Kansas. We
play the same style of basketball. We knew coming into this game we had a
great chance of winning and we just wanted to compete.  
Not having Kyan out there, it hurt a lot and I think guys stepped up and tried
to help out in place of Kyan.  
  
Q. Trey and Chris you can answer, do you feel like you earned an NIT bid
this week with what you did?  
TREY ZEIGLER: I hope so. We felt like we competed at the highest level,
playing the toughest league in the country. So every night we play an NCAA
Tournament team. Probably going to get seven teams in, so we feel like we're
the next team. So we definitely feel like we should get the NIT bid.  
CHRIS WASHBURN: I feel the same way.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, gentlemen.  
  
Q. Coach, same question I asked the kids. Your level of confidence losing
Kyan with 16 minutes ago in the second half?  
COACH JOHNSON: Well, we played well without him at certain times during the
course of the year, going back to Mississippi State. 'Ole Miss he was in foul
trouble.  
The bottom line for us is we didn't do a good enough job at the defensive end
and we're strong with Trey guarding at the point of attack, but it hurts, it
hurts.  
One thing I want to say about Kyan, in all my years as being a head coach, let
alone as an assistant coach, I never seen a kid handle the ball 90% of the
time in the three years in this league, which is a really, really physical and
a mentally tough league. And for him to play like he's played and played
through things is unbelievable, speaks volumes for him. We need to understand,
in three years, this is the first year he has had a full complement of
players.  
Last year his back‑up 4 man was a 6'1" walk‑on and his starting 4 man was a
6'2" guard pushed back to the 4.  
So what he has been able to do in terms of his durability and be out there and
reliable on a consistent basis is pretty impressive. Versus some really,
really good players and being the focal part of everybody's defense.  
  
Q. Coach, what did you tell Kyan on the bench, were you trying to be
encouraging to him?  
COACH JOHNSON: I don't need to encourage Kyan, he's fine. There are a lot of
things you have to play through and we talk about it all the time as a group,
as a team. Keep your poise, play through whatever else is going on out there.
He ws down because obviously he knows how important he is to us. But I don't
need to pick him back up. He was real positive with his teammates and moved
forward.  
This group has been really, really resilient. Going back to Oklahoma when we
had travel issues, we go to Oklahoma compete our tail off, have an opportunity
to win that game and then we play a really, really good Oklahoma State team on
the road and find out that Chris Hall lost his father, have to tell the kids
that after the game, they stayed the course, never batted an eye.  
Then we go play an Iowa State team and we find out Dalton Dry's, a walk‑on
kind, a helluva kid, his dad, Mike Dry, had a heart attack going to the game.
So the kids find that out, they never once started feeling sorry for
themselves, they kept moving on and moving on.  
Then to come here and compete and beat a very, very good Kansas State team and
play at 6:00 and turn around and play these guys at 1:00 and have an
opportunity to win it speaks volumes to the resilience of these guys. Because
last time I checked, we all get called up in rankings, there is not a bunch of
guys on this team that are McDonald's All‑Americans players and all that other
stuff, but this is a pretty good basketball team that stayed their course in a
very, very good league.  
  
Q. Given the resiliency and perseverance of this team down the stretch and
what you accomplished this week, do you think this team deserves an NIT bid
right now?  
COACH JOHNSON: Well, I don't get caught up in that, Chuck, you know me, that's
not my responsibility. I just know there have been three games, the Baylor
game in overtime, the Oklahoma game on the road and the West Virginia game in
overtime, that some way, some how it was my responsibility to get them over
the hump and give them an opportunity to win and I didn't get that done.  
I will say this, my last year at LSU, we were 17‑14, we won a game and went to
the NIT and it was a no‑brainer and that league was nowhere near as strong
from top to bottom as this league. But we lost three out of four, four out of
five, so that's no my decision. And I trust the people at the NIT Selection
Committee that they will do what's good and do what's best by college
basketball.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 12, 2015

  

### [Bob Huggins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15824)

### [Jaysean Paige](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28531)

### [Devin Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28530)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Baylor  80  
West Virginia  70

  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by the Mountaineers from West Virginia, Coach Bob
Huggins and his student‑athletes, Jaysean Paige and Devin Williams. We will go
directly to the questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Devin, you guys seemed to attack the zone far better this game than you
had the past couple. What was the difference to you today?  
DEVIN WILLIAMS: I don't know, really, it was the third time playin' them. It
was a statement game for me and, you know, I was just trying to come out and
do what I could.  
Watching film, you know, I was able to see what I did the first game, first
and second game, so I was just trying to take advantage of the opportunities
that I know was there.  
  
Q. Jaysean, tell me about your performance today and how much that can help
you going into the Big Dance here, 18 points on the day.  
JAYSEAN PAIGE: Builds a lot of confidence coming in, hitting a few shots and
things I work on every day. But the win is the most important and we didn't
come up with a win.  
THE MODERATOR: All right, gentlemen, we will let you go back to the locker
room. Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. With the seven or eight days that you've got between now and your next
ball game, all the preparation and everything involved, do you feel like
you've got enough time to get Juwan and Gary rested up and 100%?  
COACH HUGGINS: Well, we're not going to rest 'em up. They're going to have to
get some cardio. They're both planning to play.  
They weren't 100% today. They could have played, but they weren't 100%, and I
didn't think it was worth them reinjuring themselves to‑‑ not it wasn't worth
it. It wasn't the right thing to do by them, let me put it that way. Scratch
what I said before. I didn't mean that. I meant it wasn't the right thing to
do by them. They're both planning and are very excited about playing next
week.  
  
Q. What is it about Baylor's match ‑up, three times you've played 'em tough,
just can't get over the edge?   
COACH HUGGINS: Well, they're very well coached. Scott does a good job making
adjustments. We just didn't‑‑ we didn't finish around the rim the way we need
to finish around the rim. We got the ball pretty much where we wanted to get
the ball. We got a 5‑point lead and miss the front end of a one‑and‑one. They
made some key shots and we didn't.  
We talked about it going in, we can't put them at the foul line 34 times. When
we have lost, that's what as happened, people have doubled us from the
free‑throw line and they basically doubled us from the free‑throw line again.
You can't win like that.  
I don't think it has anything to do with much of anything else than that,
really. 13‑point difference.  
  
Q. Coach, the way you guys were able to shoot the ball in the first half
must have done wonders for you at halftime. Did you feel like you would keep
that momentum going into the second half? More the most part you were right
there?  
COACH HUGGINS: I don't know, I must have been watching a different game than
you were. No, I didn't think we had the bounce that we have to have to win.
We're not a great shooting team. We get a lot done from effort and enthusiasm,
and we didn't get to 50/50 balls. We didn't rebound the ball the way we need
to rebound the ball, and we didn't take care of the ball. I think we had nine,
ten turnovers at halftime and coming in we said we have to keep 'em off the
free‑throw line, which we didn't do, and we couldn't turn the ball over, we
had to get shots.  
I guess my view of the game was better than yours, you maybe should have come
in and talked to them, you might have been better, more positive approach.  
  
Q. Coach, this is the second straight game against them. They were able to
force more turnovers than your guys. What is it about their ball handling that
seems to break your defense?  
COACH HUGGINS: We didn't press. We really didn't press. We didn't press
because we don't have the numbers to press right now. We kinda backed it off.
So we really weren't‑‑ we were trying to guard 'em and we didn't guard 'em
very well, but we were trying to guard 'em better and not turn 'em loose at
the basket.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach thank you. Good luck next week.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 12, 2015

  

### [Fred Hoiberg](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21399)

### [Monte Morris](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28560)

### [Georges Niang](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25065)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Iowa State  69  
Texas  67

  
THE MODERATOR: We're ready to begin with Iowa State, Coach Hoiberg, his
student‑athletes tonight Monte Morris and Georges Niang.  
COACH HOIBERG: Wow, what an unbelievable game. Still not sure how we won. I
will say this, our guys hung together and showed great resolve and found a way
when it wasn't looking very good out there. These guys made a heck of a play
on that last possession, coming up, Georges slipping out of a screen. They
actually defended it very well and Monte Morris just made a heck of an
individual play.  
Unbelievable atmosphere out there, this is the best league in the country,
there's no doubt about that. Top to bottom, the way that each and every game
is as competitive as it is. It's fun to be a part of and, again, I'm proud of
these guys for finding a way and sticking together and gutting out an
impressive win against a very good Texas team who I think absolutely belongs
in the tournament.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Georges, can you talk about how going the full ‑court press sort of
triggered everything for you guys?   
GEORGES NIANG: We felt that Texas was getting comfortable with the game and
running isolation for Taylor, so we really wanted to speed them up and get the
ball out of his be hands. So the full‑court press really helped with that. We
got some guys that we wanted the ball in their hands, and they made some plays
that really helped us out. I think the biggest thing was trying to make them
uncomfortable.  
  
Q. Monte, what went through your head when you released the ball and watched
it go in?  
MONTE MORRIS: At the time you are just hoping and prayin' it goes in. I got a
great look at it and got the ball in for us and we was able to walk off the
court with a victory.  
  
Q. Monte, you guys were able to keep your composure, as Fred said. Why was
that? Obviously the game wasn't going in your favor for quite some time.  
MONTE MORRIS: First half we got off to a slow start and shots weren't falling
and we knew we had to make a run soon or later, and we forced them to change
their style of play a little bit. We played more up tempo going to the full
court press, and we was able to play Cyclones basketball and get open looks
and Dustin had a big three late that set that up for us.  
  
Q. Georges, first half maybe not what you wanted, what's got to click in
that first half for you guys?  
GEORGES NIANG: I think Coach is going to have us locked in for the rest of
this tournament. It's a mental aspect. We really just got to come in and
really respect our opponent and come in with a locked in mind to run our stuff
and defend against their stuff. And Coach is going to will us in the right
direction with that and I hope we can keep up with it.  
THE MODERATOR: Guys, we'll let you go back to the locker room. Congratulations
and good luck tomorrow. Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. Fred, did you feel like the way the game was going, the crowd, the
atmosphere, if you pushed yourselves up on them that they would crumble like
that?  
COACH HOIBERG: No, not at all. I wasn't feeling too good about it. We made a
couple of plays late, they controlled the game and the tempo. And Rick had a
great game plan and they executed it beautifully. We couldn't get anything
goin', it's not very often we're going to have a 9‑minute scoring drought with
what we have out there offensively and give those guys a lot of credit. Every
time we made a run, they had an answer for it, whether it was Holmes hitting a
three or Lammert hitting a three. We tried to get the ball out of Taylor's
hands. He was just kind of doing what he wanted out there and thankfully those
guys missed a couple of shots because they were hitting everything in the
first half to create separation. Again, when we made a run, they seemed to
answer every call.  
  
Q. Coach, great win. Off the court I want to talk about your athletic
director. How is he doing?  
COACH HOIBERG: Probably not very well after watch that go one, he's probably
had another heart attack.  
  
Q. Your thoughts on his recovery?  
COACH HOIBERG: I had the opportunity to talk to him yesterday. He sounded
about as good as you can after going through that procedure. Obviously being
through that once myself, going to have to go through that again sometime here
in the not‑too‑distant future, we were able to‑‑ I know how much it helped me
to talk to people that have been through it and the big advice that I gave to
Jamie is he can't be a super hero throughout this process, he's going to
listen to his body. On days when he doesn't feel good, he's got to take it
easy. If not, it's going to make it a long recovery.  
I'll tell you this, we're all thankful that he was in a public setting when he
had the heart attack and his daughter who was absolutely a rock star who went
and got the EMTs, got him to the hospital and he was able to get in a
helicopter and fly back to Des Moines and get that surgery pretty much right
away. We're all extremely thankful.  
He said he was embarrassed where it happened, I said you're damn lucky where
it happened. With all thankful Jamie is doing well. Where heart disease is
right now, with all the awareness money that's raised for it, Jamie should be
able to live a normal, long life and that's a blessing.  
  
Q. You talked about the quality of this league, the games that you've played
during the regular season, how much does that allow your team to have
confidence in these situations not just here but perhaps in the next couple of
weeks?  
COACH HOIBERG: We have played three in a row where we have not gotten off to a
good start. We missed some shots we should have made driving to the basket
early, but, again, Texas' length had a lot to do with that. We've got to come
out of the locker room and have that same urgency that we have in the second
half. And if you don't do that you're going to get burned eventually.  
I love the guys, and I thought our energy was actually was pretty good. They
were getting tough shots and it almost deflated us a little bit. You try to
keep the tempo where you want it, and Texas dictated that the entire night
until the last couple minutes of the game.  
Again, I'm proud of how they found a way. Great teams find a way and our team,
you know, they did that tonight.  
  
Q. Fred, just curious, 5.8 seconds left, would you have liked to have just
played it out? Were you okay with the time ‑out?   
COACH HOIBERG: I talked to them about it, we get the stop, we're goin'. But
Dustin, I guess, made the right play, called a time‑out, we came over, we
regrouped, drew something up in the huddle, and Monte made a heck of an
individual play out there.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach. Congratulations.

### [Buddy Hield](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28575)

### [Lon Kruger](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13820)

### [TaShawn Thomas](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26664)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Oklahoma  64  
Oklahoma State  49

  
THE MODERATOR: We are ready to begin with the Oklahoma Sooners, Coach Lon
Kruger, his student‑athletes in the room tonight, Buddy Hield and Thomas
TaShawn. Coach?  
COACH KRUGER: Two different halves. Really good win, proud of our guys for
hanging in there.  
First half we didn't have much going, didn't have much activity on either end
of the floor, but I liked our guys' comments. Their attitude and focus at
halftime was good, very positive. They were anxious to get back out there and
then their play showed that.  
Much more active defensively the second half, created some offense from
defense, pushed the ball a lot more aggressively and made for plays for each
over. Proud of the guys, good win over a good Oklahoma State club.  
  
Q. Buddy, you got off to a slow start, but that stretch you guys scored six
straight possessions. You had ten points in that stretch. What got you going
during that spree?  
BUDDY HIELD: My teammates found me in areas where I'm comfortable scoring the
ball. Jordan gave me a line on it and I was able to get boards.  
We just stayed positive and Coach did a great job of keeping us calm in the
locker room. They got two quick buckets and we scored back to that. I feel
like us picking up full court helped us get our energy back and that was good
for us.  
  
Q. TaShawn, was it a matter of not being aggressive enough in the first
half? And if that was the case, why would you be that way in the first game of
postseason?  
TaSHAWN THOMAS: I think it was just I was thinking too much. I think it was
just like when we got the ball in certain spots that we know we can score
where we wanted to. We slowed down and started thinking, What should I do?
Doing that kind of caused us not to be aggressive and I just think‑‑ I don't
know if it was just jitters or anything, I just felt like everybody on the
court was‑‑ well, everybody on the team was playing like that in the first
half.  
  
Q. Looks like, Buddy, you went 5 for 15, so struggled to shoot but still
finished with 22 points, another night where you find ways to contribute and
score despite maybe not having your stroke.  
BUDDY HIELD: I was attacked a little bit, got a couple of fouls called and I
was able to knock down some free‑throws and focus. I think my free‑throws,
making two free‑throws in the early second half helped me make those two
threes go down because I felt a good rhythm. I feel a good rhythm, and I'm
going to shoot better tomorrow, promise you that.  
  
Q. TaShawn, you get a rematch now with Iowa State, that was a crazy game in
Ames a couple of weeks ago. You guys had a big lead, they came back. Thoughts
on the match ‑up against the Cyclones?   
TaSHAWN THOMAS: We're going to have to defend. Niang is going to be a tough
match‑up, just like Nash was today. We're going to have to defend him and try
to contain him because he gets them going. I feel like if we can defend pretty
good, sound, we can come out with a win.  
  
Q. Buddy, you guys struggled so much to shoot in the first half. How
conscious were you to get in the lane and try to get to the free ‑throw line
in the second half?   
BUDDY HIELD: You know, our offense was too stagnant the first half. They were
denying us, taking us out of our stuff, wasn't getting in a good rhythm.  
Coach called some good plays and we were able to execute. TaShawn got some
good looks and I got some good looks and we just went off from that.  
  
Q. Buddy, you guys as a team you didn't shoot a good percentage, but from 3
‑point you did, 5 out of 11. How important is it when things aren't going well
that you're stillnot just ‑‑ you didn't shoot a ton of three pointers and the
ones you did take were good shots and you made a good chunk of them.   
BUDDY HIELD: It was good for us. We needed a spark. It was said in the locker
room, we needed a spark, somebody give us a spark. Jordan did a good job
finding us in good open spots. We were able to score the ball.  
Ta made some good plays and Isaiah made some good plays and it was a good
effort. I like how the team responded to the run they had in the first half
and we've got to move on from that, get ready for the next one now.  
  
Q. Can you talk about defending Forte, because I know you scrape off some,
TaShawn, and you do some things to help contain him. His numbers were just
really poor tonight and they were, I think, earlier in your other games. Can
you talk about defending Forte? What you key on?  
TaSHAWN THOMAS: In practice Coach tells us it's not just one person guarding
him, it's going to be the whole team guarding him because he can get the ball
off real quick and make 'em. Whenever he comes off ball screens, the bigs, the
guard is trailing so the big has to show out a little bit, just to rattle them
a little bit and then make sure the guard gets back in front. So it's really a
job for both us and every game we played in, we did a really pretty good job
on him.  
  
Q. Buddy, the Commissioner gave you the Player of the Year trophy before the
game. Was that strange, out of your routine to get announced before the game
with everybody looking at you?  
BUDDY HIELD: No. I like people, it's always good to me. I'm always smiling, so
it doesn't hurt me a little bit. But it was a good honor. Hats off to my
teammates and coaches, they push me every day, from Coach Kruger to Ta and
everybody. They push me every day in practice, and I try and be a better
player and a better person on and off the court. Hats off to them, they all
deserve the award, too.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, congratulations, gentlemen. We will let you go back to
the locker room.  
  
Q. Lon, you didn't play Frank Booker until the second half. Was there any
specific reason for that or just match ‑ups?   
COACH KRUGER: Frank didn't practice much this week because of academic
requirements. That was basically it, nothing official or formal, just gelled
in practice a couple days when Frank hadn't been there. So it was just fair to
play those guys that practiced.  
  
Q. Coach, how do you explain the difference between the first half where
nothing went in and the second half where you shot pretty well and basically
took control?  
COACH KRUGER: I think Ta summed it up pretty well, seemed like the first half
we were tentative, shooting it quick, shot selection was poor.  
Second half was much more downhill, much more in the flow, much more attack,
much more in rhythm. Just easier to make shots when you're doing things that
you typically do every day in practice. First half we weren't doing that,
second half we weren't.  
  
Q. Lon, you survived a really good game by Nash. He had 27 points, 12
rebounds, made a big percentage. What's the key to stopping him and keeping
him in check which you didn't necessarily do tonight, but why he was able to
go off and how were you able to survive that?  
COACH KRUGER: He's a tough player. They got Nash and Forte, they both require
extra attention. And when you start doing too much of that, you leave open
other good players around them.  
But I thought our guys, like I said, did a really good job on Forte, terrific
player, terrific shooter. Nash, at halftime, we were talking about he's got
too much room and we wanted more congestion and we never did really get that
to the degree that we wanted. He's a good player. He's a good player and he
had a good night.  
  
Q. You really controlled the glass in the second half, particularly Spangler
has 15 rebounds. How huge that was?  
COACH KRUGER: That was big. Ryan and Ta assisted him, they were big on the
glass. That first half, any loose balls, balls that weren't clean, they were
getting them.  
And second half, we got them much more aggressively, two hands on the ball,
Ryan leading the way, did a great job, 15 boards, big number.  
  
Q. Coach, this sets up a semi ‑final match with Iowa State, thoughts on the
Cyclones and in particular Monte Morris, their point guard, who had a pretty
crazy game today.   
COACH KRUGER: They're great. Fred does a terrific job. They spread you out.
And our two games have been crazy, they got off to a big start in Norman and
we had a big run in the second half, and we got the big start in Ames. They
had the big start in the second half. Kind of four different halves. I guess
it's been 2‑2 and the games are 1‑1\. But they're good, they're really good.
We've got to come out with a lot of energy and work hard, try to limit them to
one.  
You can play Iowa State, it's a little bit ‑‑ Niang is such a tough match‑up,
you got to determine‑‑ that's where it starts, determine what you're going to
give him, up to him and what you're going to cheat on him and that opens up
others. So it's choosing your poison a little bit because they are so good.  
  
Q. Coach, this is the only week every year where you play back ‑to‑back‑‑ I
guess other than the preseason tournaments where you play back‑to‑back nights.
Can you let us in on the next 24 hours, what they're like for you, how long
are you up tonight? How does that work in the morning for back‑to‑back?   
COACH KRUGER: Like everyone in a tournament setting, we'll go back, get
together as a staff and kind of determine tomorrow's schedule and I think we
know now when the shootaround is and breakfast and you piece in as much as you
can, editing out a tape that we can show the players, 15‑20 minute tape all
tolled is what they will watch, but we will watch more than that tonight and
tomorrow.  
It's tournament time, much preferred to driving home, for sure. Thank you.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 12, 2015

  

### [Travis Ford](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18471)

### [Le'Bryan Nash](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25023)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Oklahoma  64  
Oklahoma State  49

  
THE MODERATOR: Let's begin with Oklahoma State and Coach Travis Ford. His
student‑athlete, Le'Bryan Nash will be here shortly. Coach, your thoughts on
tonight's game?  
COACH FORD: Congrats to them. I thought they played a heck of a game, came to
battle, played for 40 minutes and competed at a high level. I thought they
played well the second half and took advantage of our mistakes in the second
half.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about what went right for them? They shot 23% in the
first half and really well in the second.  
COACH FORD: Our last game with them, they took it from us in the second half.  
This game we had open shots, a lot‑‑ we just missed a lot of open shots,
turned the ball over on an up nine, we have a fast break, turn it over. Two
possessions later, we have 3‑on‑1, don't convert, a lot of open shots. We
didn't convert. We shot ourselves in the foot a little bit different than the
last game.  
We had opportunities, and when we weren't scoring they took advantage of it.
You knew they were going to score more points, but we had plenty enough
opportunities, plenty enough opportunities.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Le'Bryan Nash.  
  
Q. Le'Bryan, you had a monster game. What got you going and why do you think
things down the stretch didn't go the team's way?  
LE'BRYAN NASH: I mean, this is the postseason. I knew what was on the line for
our team and I wanted to go out there and play my hardest and try to play to
win, try to as many positives plays as I can and focus on the defense and the
rebounding and the scoring is going to come. I tried to get my teammates
shots, I did a good job of that and some of them didn't fall. We gotta go back
to the drawing board and see what we can do and what we can't do.  
  
Q. You guys did a great job on Thomas in the first half, he got loose in the
second half. What happened in the second half that got him uncorked?  
LE'BRYAN NASH: We just let him keep going right and Coach Ford kept explaining
to us don't let him go right, make him go left and sometimes players be
hard‑headed and not listen to their coach. I guess that's what happens when
you don't listen to your coach. The game don't go your way.  
Like I say, we got to go back to the drawing board and listen to our coaching
staff. They know what's in our best interest and hopefully we will have
another chance.  
  
Q. Le'Bryan, when they have the announcement for the NCAA Tournament, are
you confident you're going to hear your name?  
LE'BRYAN NASH: I'm always confident in my team and our resume. We have some
good wins, three top‑10 wins on the resume and I feel like everybody sees us
as a tournament team. I feel we're confident enough and we got to wait until
Sunday.  
  
Q. Le'Bryan, last five minutes didn't go your way, but it was 43 ‑43 with
nine minutes to go, does that show that you can make the NCAA Tournament and
do some damage when you get there?   
LE'BRYAN NASH: We had that game, we was in the lead for the most part and
shows you that we had turned the team ‑‑ Oklahoma is a great team. I think
they're a more talented team than people think they are. And it just shows you
we compete, we don't care who we step on the floor with and that's how we
gonna feel if we make it to the NCAA Tournament and try to get the best run
and hopefully the Committee picks us for part of the 64.  
  
Q. Le'Bryan, over a 14 or 15 ‑minute stretch in the second half, you guys
scored only 11 points and you were responsible for ten. That had to be
frustrating. It was almost like you were‑‑ you didn't have much choice but to
go one on five, given the fact that you weren't getting much help.   
LE'BRYAN NASH: I was just trying to do what Coach told me to and scoring is
part of our offense. The game was going good for me, but I tried to get my
teammates involved because I need them as much as I can. We've just‑‑ like I
said, we've got to go to the drawing board, get in the gym as much as we can
and shoot the ball as much as we can.  
THE MODERATOR: Le'Bryan, thanks very much.  
  
Q. Travis, kind of similar to the last question to Le'Bryan, did you feel in
the second half that you're only option was to put the ball in Nash's hands?  
COACH FORD: As a coach, we were getting opportunities. It just goes that way.
He was feeling it, but other guys had shots the second half, they weren't
falling. So it's not like you as a coach, you just say, hey, everybody give it
to him, nobody else is allowed to shoot. No, that's not what happens.  
Now, they're smart enough to figure out, hey, we need to probably get him the
basketball and he made some strong moves. He was in position to score 10 out
of those 11 points, but it was the fact that we didn't get much from anybody
else. But it's not like ‑‑ no, I didn't call time‑out and tell everybody else
they couldn't shoot and to throw him the ball.  
That happens in games. It happens in games. But you are right, he was the only
guy that was producing. We had a lot of other people shooting, but he was the
only guy producing at that point in time.  
  
Q. Travis, you had a good lead there early second half. They get hot for a
short stretch and score 6straight ‑‑  
COACH FORD: We allowed that.  
  
Q. What happened during that stretch?  
COACH FORD: We were up 9, we come down, we have a fast break, we throw a lob
and it goes out of bounds, whatever happened. They get to go to the other end.
We have 3‑on‑1, kick it out‑of‑bounds, we get it back, but we don't score.  
We're matched up to Hield, and the guy leaves him and he makes a three. We had
a lot of open shots. We had a lot of good looks. We knew they were going to
play better second half.  
They're a great team, I don't think there is too much teams in America better
than them; I don't. I don't think there are too many teams, you look at their
offensive stats, their efficiency against the rest of the country, they're
really good. We just didn't take advantage of it. It was a lot different than
the last game that we played against them. We had our opportunities this time.  
  
Q. The follow ‑up is you got stabilized for a while, got it to 43‑43, and
they didn't score a ton after that but your offense went away. What happened
to it after that point? Lack of shot‑making?   
COACH FORD: Yeah, yeah, we got‑‑ they weren't great shots, when it gets that
tight, nobody is going to get an easy shot but we had some.  
I tell you, Le'Bryan, he made every right play, he made some nice passes to
get guys open, but that's part of the game. You're not going to make 'em, some
games you're not going to make 'em. And we made some shots first half. Second
half, you know, we had a lot of good looks and they just didn't go if in.
That's part of it. And when you are not making those shots, you better come up
with a ridiculous defensively effort, I mean, ridiculous, because we were in
that mode offensively.  
I would like to say they defended, we didn't get any open shots, we had a lot
of good shots, didn't go down and they made some nice shots and they're a
better offensive team than we are. They are not going to go like we are. They
have quite a few weapons. We did a lot of stuff we wanted to do in the game,
that we worked on, I mean a lot. We just‑‑ our basketball team we gotta have
everybody‑‑ we gotta have guys‑‑ we're not a one‑man team, we can't do that,
we gotta have guys step up and it just wasn't the night for some of the guys.  
The guys played hard, they never gave in, they kept fighting, kept playing
hard, shots didn't fall, we were sitting there counting them as a staff, what
could you do differently? We kind of got the ball where we wanted to get it a
lot of times, just didn't convert and when you're not converting like that,
against a team like Oklahoma? They'll make you pay eventually, they will make
you pay eventually and they did.  
  
Q. Coach, you kinda answered this, but heading into the game had you known
that Le'Bryan was going to have the game he did and that you would be able to
hold Buddy in check for a large portion of the game, would you have thought
you would be sitting here on the other side of the scoreboard?  
COACH FORD: They're not a one‑man team they have Hield, they have a lot of
other weapons that can score. They have all had big nights.  
Yeah, but I would have looked at some of the stats on my side, I would have
said, oh, we probably got killed. So it's give and take a little bit.
Obviously it was closer than the score shows, but just one of those second
halves, we‑‑ just had some guys get out of their element and we didn't make
plays.  
We told them they were going to start pressing us, we knew what was going to
happen. We've seen them play a lot and what they do when they get down, how
they really start to pick up the tempo and they did it. We got shots, just
didn't go down. Just didn't go down for us in the second half.  
  
Q. Travis, going into Sunday, you guys in good shape?  
COACH FORD: Yeah, we got three top‑10 wins in the country, four top‑25, six
top‑50, eight or nine top‑100, four of those on the road. After tonight, 15th
strongest strength of schedule in the country. So, yeah, our numbers speak for
themselves. Everything that the Committee looks at, we put that work in. We
put that work in, the numbers speak for themselves.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much.

### [Scott Drew](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14205)

### [Royce O'Neale](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26642)

### [Taurean Prince](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28529)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Baylor  80  
West Virginia  70

  
THE MODERATOR: We are ready to begin with the Baylor Bears, Coach Scott Drew,
and student‑athletes, Royce O'Neale and Taurean Prince. Coach, we will call on
you first. Congratulations.  
COACH DREW: We knew coming in that any game you play was going to be a war and
playing on one or two possession games and you've got to operate late and I
thought our guys did a great job operating down the stretch. Having a senior
point guard and a senior like Royce O'Neale leading us and two juniors, Rico
and T.P. that did a really good job keeping everyone focus and making sure we
operated properly down the stretch.  
Credit our guys for grabbing rebounds and not letting them get second and
third opportunities down the stretch and contesting threes, because they made
a ton early on.  
  
Q. Taurean, talk about that play where you had the breakaway, kind of lost
the handle on it and looked like you were going out of bounds and found Rico
for the dunk.  
TAUREAN PRINCE: I just lost the ball. Gotta be ball strong. As I was going
out‑of‑bounds, I whipped my head around and saw Rico coming down the middle
and shot it to him and he made a great play.  
COACH DREW: It's hard to miss that big body!  
  
Q. Taurean, you guys seemed to pick up the defense in the second half, got
some big steals, were y'all being more aggressive or what was going on?  
TAUREAN PRINCE: We got a little bit more focused than we were the first ten
minutes of the game, flew around more, closed out and went inside and
rebounded the ball, just active with our hands and got fast breaks.  
Credit to Lester, Royce and Kenny, they did a good job of operating fast
breaks toward the end of the stretch and we came out with the win.  
  
Q. Royce, Coach talked about it, but y'all's poise down the stretch, a one
‑possession game last five minutes, talk about what you were able to do there?
  
ROYCE O'NEALE: Starts with me and Kenny being seniors, with the help of T.P.
and Rico being juniors, and we had to keep everybody poised and Isaiah stepped
up off the bench when we got in foul trouble so you never know who is going to
step up but we had to steady it as a team.  
  
Q. Royce, I believe the last count was you had 12 baskets in the second
half. Ten of those were assisted baskets. What's it say about this team not
only in this game but I guess throughout the season?  
ROYCE O'NEALE: That we're all unselfish guys, really, we love playing with
each other because we're always going to find the open person. Our main goal
is to get to the paint, penetrate, find an open person for an open shot. You
might have a good shot, but somebody else might have a better one.  
  
Q. Taurean, you guys have beat ten West Virginia pretty handily the first
two times. This was a much more competitive game. Is that what y'all
expected?  
TAUREAN PRINCE: Most definitely. We expect that in every game we play. The
first two times, it was pretty‑‑ those were tough games, too, we just kind of
caught a run at the end, the very end.  
They're a tough team, they play very hard, tough team to outrebound, but we
did what we needed to do tonight and we came out with the win.  
  
Q. For both of you student ‑athletes, I was curious, you guys are probably
in the moment, but in the back of your mind are you aware that you might have
a chance to be playing your way into a four seed, three seed, maybe a chance
to be in the Houston regional going forward, things like that that might
factor into it if you have a good tournament?   
ROYCE O'NEALE: Right now we're focused on the Big 12 tournament, taking it one
game at a time. After the tournament, we will look at that.  
TAUREAN PRINCE: Same what he said, just focusing on what team we have next.
You can't look forward because you have got some good teams in the Big 12 and
we've gotta prepare for them and not think about the future.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you to the student‑athletes. Congratulations.  
  
Q. In what ways did Bob's decision to have to sit out Juwan Staten and Gary
Browne affect your preparation from playing them a third time?  
COACH DREW: Well, the last time we faced 'em, both of them sat out, and I
think we all saw when they played Kansas how they played Oklahoma State, Coach
Huggins did a great job getting them ready and adjusted. Obviously every coach
would like to have all your players and ready to go and I'm sure if they would
have been ready to go, he would have played them. Hopefully they will be ready
to go for the NCAA, because I know how much that means for the seniors.  
  
Q. Scott, on Ish, was that a foul situation or were you hoping to get him
minutes like that playing back home?  
COACH DREW: I think he earned them. He did a tremendous job in the minutes
that he had. He had 7 points, 6 rebounds, in 15 minutes, and a steal.  
We had foul trouble and he was playing well so it made it easy to play him
longer.  
  
Q. Coach ‑‑  
COACH DREW: Testing my contacts!  
  
Q. You guys have played in so many tight situations down the stretch where
it comes down to one or two shots. Are you used to that by now and how
gratifying is it to see them constantly perform under pressure the way they
did today?  
COACH DREW: That's the great thing about playing in the Big 12, when you play
91% of the conference games involving a ranked team, if you're going to win,
they're probably going to be close games. A lot of different styles, so
hopefully this prepares us all for the NCAA Tournament.  
But in the meantime definitely you have gained experience throughout the year.
Playing in hostile arenas in front of tough crowds, you have to learn how to
play in tough situations and, again, it helps when you have a senior point
guard like Kenny Chery.  
  
Q. Coach, they were shooting the ball well. How were you able to adjust?  
COACH DREW: That was a big thing, they made six, threes in the first half, 11
for 9, and we were up 2 points. So you had to feel good about that situation.
We shoot a lot of threes, we're the best three‑point percent shooting team for
threes in the Big 12 and showed them we could win other ways. We outscored
them in the paint 40‑20\. Against Coach Huggins' team that's hard to do
because they're a tough team.  
  
Q. Third time I think you've beaten a team, three times in one season. How
tough is that to do?  
COACH DREW: It's tough beating anybody, let alone a team as good as West
Virginia, I think they got, what, nine losses on the year? That's tough to
beat them, period.  
  
Q. Scott, you guys handled their press again really well, ten turnovers,
what's the key?  
COACH DREW: Royce, Kenny, Lester did a tremendous job and then everybody else
who contributed with that, but predominantly those three, they did a very good
job.  
  
Q. Scott, you talked about it a little bit, but the defense down the
stretch, I think you held them to zero field goals in the last six and a half
minutes, but the back ‑to‑back turnovers, how critical was that to separate?
  
COACH DREW: Huge, because it's one thing to get a turnover, it's another thing
to get a turnover and a conversion. And for us to get easy baskets, keep the
momentum, that puts more pressure on the other team, so those are huge plays.  
  
Q. Coach, how do you ‑‑ now that you're going into tomorrow, winner of
Kansas/TCU, how do you prepare for tomorrow with who you think you might play?
  
COACH DREW: That's the great thing about the Big 12, doesn't matter who you
play you're in for a battle, playing each team twice, you know a lot about
them. We'll find out who wins, I'm just hoping for a five overtime game.
(Laughter.)  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Iowa State  69  
Texas  67

  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Rick Barnes of Texas and call on you for your
thoughts on tonight's game.  
COACH BARNES: Hate it for our guys, because I really thought they played a
hard game and obviously when the game is over there are things that you think,
I could have helped them a little bit more.  
But I really thought there were four crucial plays that hurt us, the two times
out in the open court where we should have pulled the ball out and one time we
didn't, it came off our chest. The other time we fouled and they went down and
scored. And then not getting in, the 10‑second violation, those four plays.  
I can understand, you like to hold the ball there for that last shot if you
could, but I could understand Javan shooting it with the rhythm he was into.
Give them credit, one possession, I think they ran down three balls.  
We just didn't finish it. Again, I'm proud of my guys. I think that if you're
talking about looking at our team from an eyeball test in this atmosphere
today, which obviously was like a home game for Iowa State, and the poise our
guys played with and the way we did some things, I'm really proud of my team.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. Seemed like the last seven, eight minutes the offense really slowed down
and that seemed to be intentional, where you weren't trying to push it to the
last few seconds of the shot clock. Can you explain that?  
COACH BARNES: A lot of it was Isaiah, he played his heart out and he was out
there the whole time. We were putting a lot on him and I really had confidence
in him because I felt like he really had good command of where he was and what
he was doing.  
So the fact is, you know, they play such a packed defense in there, and we
could run, could have kept running motion and those‑type things, but I didn't
want to just make him run unnecessary motion right there. But you go back to
the chances where we did run, those two decisions in the open court, those
were not two good decisions right there.  
Again, they're an outstanding team and we're an outstanding team and I just
hate it for our guys, because, again, it got down to where, again, we made
some mental mistakes. Again, the two plays at the end where Connor turned it
over throwing it in and Saiah's 10‑second call and I should have called
time‑out but I thought he was going to bring it across.  
Those are two big plays obviously, and I understand Javan shooting it when he
did because of the rhythm, if it goes in it's a whole different situation. But
it didn't and they came down and made a shot.  
  
Q. For Isaiah, when they went to the full ‑court press, I don't know if that
caught you guys off guard but that triggered everything for them. Could you
talk about that and just the 10‑second call, what happened on that play?   
ISAIAH TAYLOR: When they went to the press, obviously we're going to play a
slower game. You can't just necessarily fast break a team that presses, you
have to take it easy and make smart decisions.  
On that 10‑second call, that's me as a point guard, that's nobody else's
fault. That's my fault. I've got to know the clock situation of the game and I
have to get it past half‑court.  
  
Q. Demarcus, it looked like you were playing pretty good defense on that
last play. Can you go through what you saw and the shot he hit on you?  
DEMARCUS HOLLAND: Well, he was trying to get ahead of steam. Obviously, trying
to clear it out for him to get a shot and the other guys try to rebound it. I
tried as hard as I could to stop him from getting to the basket. He made a
great move, I tried to contest it, and he made the shot.  
  
Q. For both you guys, how big of an opportunity did you feel like slipped
through your hands tonight?  
ISAIAH TAYLOR: We played our hearts out. I just want to commend all my
teammates, my coaches. Our coaching staff put us in a great position to win a
game, and unfortunately we couldn't pull it out.  
What happens from here on out is not our decision, but if you guys don't‑‑
it's not our decision to say if we make the NCAA Tournament or not, but I
think based on our effort tonight and our past games I think we would be a
good team to compete for a spot.  
DEMARCUS HOLLAND: Can you ask the question again?  
  
Q. What do you think about the opportunity and where you guys are going
forward now?  
DEMARCUS HOLLAND: Going forward, I mean, we can't really control anything
right now. We are who we are right now. We dropped one today that would have
helped us out a lot. I'm confident whatever tournament we go to and if we go
to the Big Dance, that we will be a great team that can compete with anybody
in the country. I think our whole team believed that and our whole coaching
staff believed that.  
THE MODERATOR: Guys, we will let you return to the locker room. Thank you.
Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Rick, in analyzing the last four minutes, did you notice anything with
your team once they went to the press to try to shake you guys up, did you
sense any stress or anything?  
COACH BARNES: No, I didn't. And the press didn't catch us off guard. We had
our press offense on. Isaiah got down the floor one time and obviously got
fouled. It shouldn't have hurt us, the 10‑second call, I thought he saw it. He
was right down the middle. Again, I've looked at myself, hindsight, yeah, I
could call time‑out there, but I thought he was going to bring it, because he
had been doing that.  
The turnover, we just threw it away. That one, we can't do and you go back to
the two open court plays, those are big plays. We want to be aggressive, but
if you go in there you gotta get something. And like I said, on one of them,
Cam fouled and they went down and made 2 with the clock stopped.  
But, again, I thought our composure, again, I didn't think we stressed. We
kept talking about, we gotta win the game, we can't just play it out. That's
how fine of a line it is. It really is. You go back‑‑ I think one play we even
had the ball and we lost it and I think we came up with a rebound‑‑ I got
blocked on that one, but I thought we had the ball and they came out with it.  
But there were a lot of good things. I really love my team, the poise and the
way we win. I thought the question was a great question about the pace. And it
was Isaiah because we had been riding him pretty hard. I thought he did a good
job. Again, they, as much as anybody, forced a lower possession game because
we weren't going to settle early. I thought at the start of the game even
though we hit some threes, we told our guys we can't fall in love with that,
early in the clock. We can get those shots any time we want at the end. So we
were probing and doing some things and we felt like we could drive from the
top. Hard to drive from the side because of the way they play defense, but,
again, I am proud of our guys.  
I'm disappointed. Today if you're watching this game you look at Texas and
think, wow, in some ways, where has that been? We know, we struggled
throughout the year with rhythm and having everybody.  
You look at‑‑ again, in this environment I thought we were composed and
played, I think our team is‑‑ I love the way we are playing right now. And,
again, it's tough, losing the way we did, because just the turnovers in the
last four minutes really.  
  
Q. Rick, after Connor grabbed that last rebound of Isaiah's shot, did you
have a time ‑out to call there? And if you didn't, did you think about just
having them wait for one shot?   
COACH BARNES: We were hoping to go with one shot right there. I actually told
the referee, if we score, we want a time‑out. We got the long rebound and they
were denying Isaiah the ball and, again, Javan‑‑ obviously you want last shot
there, but if it goes in, you're like‑‑ and that's why I said about poise and
our guys' mind‑set. There was no hesitation from that end, it's just that we
made a few careless plays at the wrong time. We could, like I said‑‑ yeah, we
had a time‑out left. We were going to use it if we made it to set our defense.  
But, again, the last shot is one thing, it's what happened up to that. It goes
back to the two open court plays, the 10‑second call, Connor's turnover and
that's not just his fault, it's everybody moving to get it. You got to give
them credit, they ran down a couple of rebounds and made some shots.  
  
Q. Rick, you talked about the eyeball test and how people might look at this
game. What are you going to be doing between now and Sunday? What's your
emotions for the next couple of days?  
COACH BARNES: Again, I‑‑ what I think and I've said it all along, if we've
done what we should do and I look at‑‑ again, I haven't looked at any of the
bracketology or any of that, I don't know where Iowa State is expected to be
seeded, 3 seed. If they're a 3 seed, the way we played today obviously and the
way we played really the last two and a half weeks, someone had told me that
Iowa could be a 6 seed.  
Early in the year when we had everybody before Isaiah got hurt, we won that
game by 15 on a neutral court. There is a lot of things we could talk about
like that, but I do have confidence in the committee that I think they do
their work. I'm not one for politicking, because, one, I don't think it
matters, but I do know that I don't think there is any team that would want to
play us by just the way we have played the last couple of weeks.  
Like I said, you go back to, throughout the regular season, you could say if
this or if that, but you can't play that game. Like Demarcus said, we are who
we are right now. And I hurt for our guys because they felt like they could
win this tournament, but to do it, you got to do it for 40 minutes and that
was a lesson that we didn't finish it.  
We're good enough to play and beat anybody in the country and I believe that.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Texas  65  
Texas Tech - 53

  
THE MODERATOR: We are ready to begin with the Red Raiders of Texas Tech, Coach
Tubby Smith, and his three student‑athletes tonight will be Toddrick Gotcher,
Norense Odiase and Robert Turner. Coach, we will call on you first for an
opening comment.  
COACH SMITH: Well, we want to just congratulate Texas, obviously played
extremely well there during that stretch in the second half when they came
out. We thought we were playing fairly well, but they turned it up another
notch and Rick Barnes and his staff had his team ready to play.  
I'm really proud of these guys, our players, they competed extremely hard
tonight and came up short.  
  
Q. Toddrick, do you think y'all had any breakdowns when Texas went on that
run or did they just go off?  
TODDRICK GOTCHER: Yes, I believe we had a lot of breakdowns, it started off
with rebounding. We didn't rebound the ball well. They got a lot of
second‑chance points and you gotta give 'em credit for what they did.  
  
Q. Norense, in the first half, Texas shot threes and in the second half they
went down low, what were you seeing?  
NORENSE ODIASE: They made an emphasis to get it into their big guy and we just
tried to battle and get it in front of them.  
  
Q. Rob, what have these past two years meant to you playing on this team?  
ROBERT TURNER: It really meant a lot and I learned a lot, and I will take it
with me as I continue my journey into the future. It was a great opportunity
to play for Coach Smith and the rest of his staff. And just to have this
opportunity, like I said, has been a blessing.  
  
Q. Toddrick, what have you learned from Rob and how do you plan to implement
those lessons next season?  
TODDRICK GOTCHER: I learned leadership and toughness. I look up to Rob and he
means a lot to me. When he came in, I was excited and he is so tough and a
great player. So hopefully in the future, I'll get them aspects, also.  
  
Q. Norense, what have you learned this season and what do you hope to see
next season?  
NORENSE ODIASE: Work hard. Everybody works hard but you've got to do the
little things, extra things, put in more time in the gym, just listen to the
coaches and play your game and play confident.  
Next season we've got to get better in every aspect of the game. We can't get
beat like this all the time. The guys we got back, our core, we're ready for
it.  
  
Q. Rob, what have you seen from the freshman this season and what do you
expect from them next year?  
ROBERT TURNER: This is a strong foundation, I look for them to come back
stronger than ever. This is a great group of guys. I've had a great time
watching them grow throughout the season and I can't wait to see the progress
next year. This was a learning experience and I don't think anybody is ready
for what the Red Raiders have to bring next year.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, gentlemen. We will call on Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, what do you think of your guys' fight down the stretch in this
game?  
COACH SMITH: I thought we competed extremely hard. I thought Rob laid it on
the line. He's a guy that‑‑ he's been the catalyst to us‑‑ he was our first
recruit when we got to Texas Tech and he tried to do his best in the second
half, kept us in the game there early in the second half when we couldn't get
a rebound.  
But this group is relatively‑‑ well, they're very young, especially the five
freshman, the four that play. And with Justin Gray not being here, we missed
his leadership among the freshman, among the team, but especially among the
freshman. I am glad he was here with us today. We have a lot to build on, and
that's why I was happy to hear them say. I was happy to hear Rob and Norense
and Toddrick say that they believe and they trust in what we're trying to get
them to do.  
  
Q. How much did it hurt with Zach having two early fouls in the first
half?  
COACH SMITH: It hurt, but we battled back, 4‑point game at halftime, getting
good stops and sometimes the ball wasn't really bouncing our way.  
It got pretty physical during that stretch when they sort of dominated the
boards. If we could have gotten more out of D‑Will, another scoring‑‑ we
needed another scoring punch and someone else to step up and make some shots.  
But, again, we did some good things, penetration, but then we get to the
basket and didn't find the open guy and tried to take a tough shot.  
  
Q. Are there any building blocks you take from this game specifically over
to next season that you can build off of?  
COACH SMITH: Just the kids' attitude. All year long we have been outmanned a
lot, they have never given up, they have come to work extremely hard in
practice. For the most part, each individual player has lived up to what our
expectations are. We need to get them to overachieve and that's something if
you're going to play at this level and win at this level, everybody is good.  
Everybody says are you going to be able to take it to the next level and the
only way you can do that is to train and prepare the proper way.  
  
Q. What did you learn from this season?  
COACH SMITH: I tell you what‑‑ I learned that‑‑ I learned a lot about just‑‑
me, trying to‑‑ you've got to be yourself and sometimes when you have a young
team you tend to be a little less‑‑ you try to be patient, but sometimes that
can be taken as a weakness. By that I mean players, just like a little kid, if
you don't discipline them properly and make them do things in practice the
proper way‑‑ not that you take things for granted, but then again you do.  
Your games are coming so fast and you're trying to keep guys healthy, you know
they're getting mentally drained and physically because they're young.  
The fundamentals may not be as‑‑ may not work on them as hard as you should. I
learned that the fundamentals are most important and if you don't practice it
every day and if you don't stress certain things every day the slippage will
happen.  
  
Q. I saw that Justin Gray was here and was off his crutches. Do you know how
he is doing?  
COACH SMITH: He's doing well. I don't know how‑‑ probably be Maybefore he will
start. That brace, he still has to have that brace. I think he's at a
40‑degree angle, 30 degrees. He can bend the knee now. But he's a hard worker
and very dedicated, so I know his rehab is going well.  
It's going well. He is there at practice every day on the sidelines, doing his
exercises. So he's‑‑ I really like ‑‑ and I really think if we had him this
year, it would have been a different‑‑ maybe we wouldn't have won as many
games, but I'd like to think he would help us win a few more games.  
  
Q. Coach, college basketball has been criticized for being low scoring and
going the wrong way. If there is one thing that you could do to improve the
game, make it better in the future, what might that be?  
COACH SMITH: Basketball should be a game of finesse and John Wooden said that
and it's turned into a real physical play.  
I think you gotta clean up the game and call it. A foul is a foul. I think it
will open up some things. We probably need to make some changes on the court.
I'm in favor of widening the lane and putting the three point line back
because a lot of that has been part of it, space the floor a little bit
better. All those things will help. Man the shot clock. I think all of those
things will help the game improve in a lot of ways, especially, and I think
the scoring will go back up.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 11, 2015

  

### [Thomas Gipson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26659)

### [Bruce Weber](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14492)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

TCU  67  
Kansas State  65

  
THE MODERATOR: We are now joined by the Kansas State Wildcats, Coach Bruce
Weber and Thomas Gipson. Nino Williams will not be appearing in the interview
room. Coach, we will call on you for your thoughts on tonight's game?  
COACH WEBER: Our guys didn't quit. I think the game was kind of a microcosm of
our whole season, a bunch of ups and downs and all‑arounds, but to the kids'
credit, they battled and battled and we gave ourself a chance.  
In hindsight, I should have probably got a time‑out when we got it to 2 and
had the ball out‑of‑bounds and I didn't do it. That was our one opportunity
maybe to grab it. I thought Thomas gave a great effort, Nino gave a great
effort, Wesley gave a great effort. I thought Jevon really competed. Malek
gave us some good minutes, one of his better games when we had a lot of foul
trouble.  
But TCU, they made enough plays when it counted down the stretch. It was
similar to the game at Ft. Worth where they went on a nice run before the end
of the first half and luckily we stopped the run this time and kept it at 8
and we gave ourselves a chance.  
Our guys fought vibrantly, like they did all year, and it's disappointing. You
want to keep playing and you want to keep coaching, but you have to help the
guys and move forward and that's all you can do.  
  
Q. Thomas, what's goin' through that head of yours? You and Nino played your
butts off in your final game. What are you thinking about right now?  
THOMAS GIPSON: I'm just sad that it's all over. It happened so quick, and
right now I'm just reflecting on everything I've done these past four years. I
feel like I've had a great career here.  
But as far as the game, I'm just happy we didn't give in. We tried to put up a
fight at the end. Unfortunately, plays didn't happen down the stretch. But I
mean, I feel like the guys that were on the court at the end didn't give up
and that's what we needed.  
  
Q. Just to add on to that, what has it meant to you to be able to go through
this journey with Nino and have this time with him?  
THOMAS GIPSON: It means a lot. We played with each other for a while, I've
known him since 6th, 7th grade and I didn't know we was going to play with
each other, but we ended up these last four years and it was just a good
feeling.  
I know he's going to be a great man down the stretch. I know he's going to do
good things and I'm sure he could say the same for me. It's just disappointing
that it all had to end like this. I wish it could have been different but
that's just what happens.  
  
Q. Coach, you talked about the battle that you had toward the end of the
game to make it close. During that first half, there was a 17 ‑5 run. You guys
could not find your rhythm. Talk about battling back from that and going in
down 8 at the half.   
THOMAS GIPSON: Just seems like we always dig ourselves a hole and have to
fight back to get the lead or cut it to however points we needed to. Our shots
just didn't go in.  
They were getting layups and open threes and that's what happens. We gave them
a 10‑, 12‑0 run and it's tough to come back from that on anybody, not just
against TCU but anybody you play.  
  
Q. Thomas, it's kind of on the same line. Both halves you guys started out
well offensively. You're hitting everything and then just go cold. Did TCU
change defense or was it a matter of you guys all of the sudden you couldn't
make a shot?  
THOMAS GIPSON: I just felt like we couldn't make a shot. We weren't patient
enough. I messed up on that, too, I forced a couple of shots, other people
forced a couple of shots. We should have just pulled it back out and just
executed. Unfortunately, we didn't, though.  
  
Q. Thomas, I know you want to look back on your time at Kansas State fondly,
but just this season in general and this game, how frustrating was this year
for you?  
THOMAS GIPSON: I can't speak for the team, but for myself it was kind of
frustrating. There was some games where I just wasn't playing up to my
ability. Right now I just regret that because now it's all over. I can't take
those games back. That's just what it is.  
  
Q. Thomas, can you give me a quick thought about the play of the TCU
forwards, Washburn and those guys, how they were able to get things done?  
THOMAS GIPSON: They're good. They rebounded. They can score. I feel like
they'll be real good once it comes to their junior and senior year. They're
physical, they play hard. That's about it.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Thomas. Thank you for coming.  
  
Q. Nino and Thomas couple quick fouls early. Late in the first half you put
them back in with two fouls, did you feel like you had to put them back in,
the game was slipping way?  
COACH WEBER: It's pretty obvious, they were on that run and it was very
similar to the game at Ft. Worth and we needed to do stop the bleeding. We
picked up the intensity, we got a couple of plays to go our way, got them
stagnant, we went on a 6‑0 run. They got a bucket before the half, but we kept
it in the range. That's what I kept talking about in the huddle, keeping it
under 10 will allow us to come back, which we did and just couldn't get over
the hump. A couple of shots here, there, couple of plays, we have 20 offensive
rebounds and only get 16 second‑chance points.  
Some of that, you know, our size, our strength, you know, their size, their
strength. Both games‑‑ last two games, Washburn kicked our butt. And if you
look at the last five, he didn't average much at all, 5 and 2 or something, 5
and 3, something like that, five games.  
Nino has always been undersized and he battles and he had a double‑double
tonight and two fouls early. Two fouls early and he only plays 22 minutes and
he got hurt down the stretch and still kept playing.  
You had to make some kind of move and we made the move and it gave us a
chance.  
  
Q. Coach, you guys went 1 for 6 from the 3 ‑point range and one was the last
shot at the end of the game. What was TCU doing defensively where you guys
just couldn't get the looks you wanted beyond the arc?   
COACH WEBER: I thought we got a lot of good looks inside the arc, we got
layups and we got 12 offensive rebounds and we don't finish the plays. We had
layups in traffic. I thought you could say is there a foul, is there not a
foul? You've got to go up strong, if they're not calling it, you've got to
take it to them and we didn't do it.  
All year we've‑‑ we're not a 3‑point shooting team. Marcus was our one guy‑‑
we thought between Marcus, Nigel, Justin and maybe Tre, we would have enough
ammo there to get something. But Marcus struggled late and we didn't get
enough looks from the other people. If you look at it, it was probably the
difference in the game. They only go 4 for 10, but we're 0 for 5, if you don't
count the last one. So their four baskets probably the difference in the game.  
  
Q. You mentioned that you thought this game was a microcosm of your whole
season. What do you think is the reason for the high highs and the low lows
that you had this year?  
COACH WEBER: I thought when we were ready to play and played with great
emotion and intensity, we could beat anybody in the country and we showed it.
Go back to Maui and Arizona, we gave them as good a battle as anybody has all
year.  
We didn't have‑‑ with the injuries we didn't have the depth. And then
probably, you know, I've used the word maturity all year, we didn't have the
maturity to focus and be ready to play every game. It's not‑‑ we always had to
wait for the game to get going like today to really turn up the juices. You
can't do that. You have to do it every day.  
  
Q. Bruce, it's been since 2007, 2008, Illinois last time you had a losing
record, about 12, 13 years since Kansas State has had a losing record. What is
your message to Kansas State fans who are concerned about riding the ship of
this program?  
COACH WEBER: Obviously we're disappointed. I was the one who said from the
beginning when there was a lot of hype going, I was cautiously optimistic. I
thought we had some pieces, and, you know, I was still worried. I was worried
that we didn't have experienced guard play. I was worried about the injuries,
and that we didn't maybe have the depth we needed and I was worried about
maturity.  
It was a tough way to learn. Even today we're close but not‑‑ we just didn't
have it. We gotta get some things corrected, we feel good about our nucleus
coming in, a little more skill, some guys that can maybe make some shots and
help us, but we will miss Nino and Thomas. The other guys have to take a step
in the weight room, in their workouts, their intensity, and we'll be fine.  
Probably overscheduled, but that's my fault. Some of it we had Maui planned
ahead of time. Some things happened, but, you know, it's just a shame, because
we had enough tools to be better than we were. I'm not saying we could have
been 30‑0 or anything but we should have been a handful of games better than
we were.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much.

### [Cameron Ridley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26867)

### [Isaiah Taylor](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26734)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Texas  65  
Texas Tech - 53

  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined now by Coach Rick Barnes from the Texas
Longhorns, his two student‑athletes will be Cameron Ridley and Isaiah Taylor.
They will be on stage shortly. Let's get comments from Coach.  
COACH BARNES: Good win for us. I really thought that Isaiah was really, really
good tonight, maybe as good as he's been all year. Defensively first half,
again, I thought Texas Tech put a lot of pressure on our guards getting down
the lane in a high percentage area and did a great job not only driving the
ball but coming off some throws in there.  
Second half I thought we were a little bit better defensively and from the
16‑minute markdown to about the 6‑minute mark, we were maybe as efficient as
we've been all year offensively.  
  
Q. Isaiah, can you talk about that stretch he's talking about in the second
half? Ball movement, everyone is hitting, it's almost like everything is
clicking. How good was that to see that?  
ISAIAH TAYLOR: I think it was great. I think this team still hasn't reached
its potential yet. It was good to see our wings filling the lanes, Cam dunking
in and just being a defensive presence. We know we can do a lot of great
things and that's what we're trying to do in this tournament.  
  
Q. Cameron, seemed like you got a spark from the play when you were on your
back and made a pass to Kendal to make the layup and seems like you were the
dominant player that you were last March. Can you go through that play and
talk about you starting to feel like this is your time of year again?  
CAMERON RIDLEY: First of all, all the credit to the guards for looking for me.
I just wanted to come out the second half and do the things we do in practice
and work on playing harder, dunking in and creating angles for my teammates
and opportunities for myself.  
  
Q. Cam, just following up on what Mike was asking, do you feel that Marchis
your time of year, that it's your time to shine?  
CAMERON RIDLEY: I'm going to play a lot more aggressive than I have before,
because that's what the team needs from me. Any player on this team can come
out and have a good game like I had today. It all comes out to us playing
together at the end of the day.  
  
Q. Cam, in the second half, did they make more of an effort at halftime to
tell you, hey, let's get the ball inside, feed the post more? You guys shot 13
threes in the first half and only six in the second.  
CAMERON RIDLEY: That's the way we should play, inside‑out and I did a good job
of making myself presence in inside, and the guards delivered the ball. And I
just worked as hard as I could to get the position I could. Isaiah and Kendal
and the other guys got the ball to me.  
  
Q. Your thoughts on the game tomorrow and having another crack at those
guys?  
ISAIAH TAYLOR: Iowa State is a great team, they can put a lot of the points on
the board and it's our job when they go on 8‑0 runs, 10‑0 runs. Whatever it is
we have to stay composed. If we stay composed, we have a good chance of
winning. We are looking to come to this tournament to compete and win as many
games as possible and potentially win the championship.  
  
Q. For Isaiah and then Cameron, three games ago, conventional wisdom was you
had to win three in a row to have a chance at the NCAA Tournament to secure
things, how do you feel about your chances now?  
ISAIAH TAYLOR: I think we have a good chance to get into the tournament, but
that right now can't be a focus. We're looking to win the Big 12 tournament.
We have Iowa State ahead of us tomorrow and we're looking to come in and
compete tomorrow.  
CAMERON RIDLEY: Pretty much the same thing he said, we're focused on this
tournament right here and trying to do the best we can this weekend. And when
that time comes, we will be ready for it.  
THE MODERATOR: Guys, thank you for coming. Good luck tomorrow.  
  
Q. Rick, you've been super frustrated with them because you know that they
have it in them, their ability to do that, like they did in the second half.
Was it good for you to finally see it?  
COACH BARNES: Yeah, and, you know, again, I did think we shot too many threes
start of the game. I'm sure Tech and anyone would like for us to do that.  
Certain guys, when they're open and they're in rhythm, we want them shooting
them. Other guys we want them to pick their spots and we probably shot four of
those in the first half that weren't good threes from our point of view and we
wanted to get inside.  
It goes both ways. Those guys, and Cam said it, they've got to want the ball.
Like we threw it into Myles once and he scored, and we tried to go back to
them. Connor's brother actually did a great job post defense, and wouldn't let
them catch the ball where he's got to make the second, third effort to get it.  
Cam did a good job posting deep. Prince actually did but he got called because
he got wrapped the guy up. We need those guys to do that for no other reason
because we are telling those guys to throw it to them, but they've got to know
where they want to catch it. Cam did a really good job of finding people
tonight. We knew they were going to double him at some point tonight and he
did a good job. And I thought Isaiah's demeanor has been as good as it has all
year just in terms of running things for us.  
  
Q. Rick, Isaiah and Cameron were important to you guys this time last year
more than anybody, do you see what you saw from them at their best?  
COACH BARNES: We need them to be. You guys watched that all year, that's what
we want. We want ‑‑ consistency‑wise we want to know what we're going to get.
In terms of posting up, making yourself big, that, we want to get that and I
do think Cam is more confident now and why he hasn't been, I'm not quite sure,
I wish I knew how to answer that.  
I thought‑‑ yeah, those two guys are important. They were kidding coming down
here, Isaiah is telling him he's got to catch those balls and I keep telling
Isaiah those passes in traffic down by his feet are kind of hard to come up
with and even find them, because Cam has great hands. If we make the simple
plays and move the ball‑‑ what was huge tonight, the rebounds were huge. We
got 18 second‑chance points where we were able to get to the glass that way
and score some.  
Like Cam said, we need 'em all. We need everybody to step up and give us what
it is they give us.  
  
Q. Coach, there was a day in college basketball when the 20 ‑victory plateau
would be a magic number for making the NCAA Tournament. Now that you have 20,
does it make you feel better about your chances?   
COACH BARNES: You know, I don't know about‑‑ I think years ago they went away
from that, the Committee, I think they went to strength of schedule and making
the emphasis on that. All I knew, where we were, the hole we have been trying
to dig out of, we just knew we had to win games. Everybody‑‑ I know those guys
on the outside, everyone is talking about we need to win this game, three in a
row, four in a row, whatever. I tell everybody every game you need to win 'em
all, because you ever know when you're going to‑‑ somebody getting hurt, this,
that, or whatever.  
I truly believe with the NCAA Tournament, they really do their homework now, I
do. I think they really‑‑ they don't wait until two weeks out, three weeks
out, they work it all year. They're going to know why we struggled in the
middle of the year, they're going to know we dealt with injuries and different
things. They're going to know it all because they do want to put together the
best tournament they can and I have confidence in that.  
And at the end of the day, we have done enough and if we've done enough, we
will be in it and if we're not, we haven't.  
  
Q. Coach, I hope you allow me to ask a broad question. There has been a lot
of criticism about college basketball this year with points being down and
play doing this and that. From your perspective, do you feel that way and if
there is anything you can do to improve it, what might you do?  
COACH BARNES: I think there is a lot of things we can do to improve the game,
I think a 30‑second shot clock. I think we should be playing with the same
lane that the NBA plays with. I think officiating has to get more consistent
where they've got to get a set rule on how they're going to allow post defense
to be played, what's going to happen on the perimeter.  
I think with the new hire for the officiating, I think it's the biggest thing
facing college basketball right now and officiating has to get more
consistent. And the only way it's going to do that is I think NCAA and college
basketball realizes how important it really is.  
I think there is a lot of things we can do. I think we should be playing with
the international three point line. And the question is, it'll take too long
to put it all together. I think they're going to‑‑ it wouldn't surprise me
next year if we go to the 30‑second shot clock. We should open the lane up. We
should make the restricted area bigger and all those things should be
implemented at one time. But because of the Rules Committee and the people
that I know that have sat on it tell me it's a joke in terms of the way they
go about doing it.  
And we should have a universal game at Division I, Division II, Division III
level; it should be a universal game. But there will be too many politics
involved and that's what you would like to see changed. We can definitely make
it a lot better, there is no doubt about it.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

### [Trent Johnson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18247)

### [Trey Zeigler](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28495)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

TCU  67  
Kansas State  65

  
THE MODERATOR: We have been joined by TCU, Horned Frogs on the stage. We are
joined now by Coach Trent Johnson and his two student athletes, Kyan Anderson
and Trey Zeigler. Coach, congratulations on the victory, your thoughts?  
COACH JOHNSON: Thank you very much. First and foremost, this is a time of year
where you need to get good guard play and these two guys have been steppin' up
all year long and they're both seniors, but I thought they did a really,
really good job of handling the ball and getting us into the offense. We had
to make a few adjustments, because they put a lot of pressure on Kyan and were
really physical, like they have been all year long. So we put the ball in
Trey's hands and they did a really good job of handling pressure and K‑State
is a good basketball team. This is a team, the nucleus of everybody on that
squad was in the NCAA tournament last year.  
And we defended better the second half. We had our problems of getting stops
and tonight was a good effort all the way around.  
  
Q. Kyan and Trey, do you feel like this means something for you guys to show
your senior year, a Big 12 tournament game win, no matter what else happens?  
TREY ZEIGLER: Definitely. We came in here very confident. We ended the season
on a high note. We felt like overall we played well even though we didn't
finish our games. We came in here and we knew Kansas State was a good team and
me and Kyan just tried to make sure we did everything we could do as senior
captains.  
KYAN ANDERSON: Like Trey said, we came in here to do the best we could. We
tried to stop them in transition, things like that. They tried to take me out
early and Trey showed up big.  
  
Q. Guys, now you're set to play Kansas tomorrow. You played them tough
during the regular season. Do you foresee having a better game against them
now that you've played them really well twice before?  
TREY ZEIGLER: Well, we match up well with Kansas. We feel like they play the
same style of basketball we do. They're a tough, physical, defensive team.  
We're looking forward to that match‑up tomorrow and hopefully, like you said,
we had two good games against them so hopefully we can continue to compete and
try to get a win tomorrow.  
KYAN ANDERSON: I feel like it's hard to beat a team three times, especially
until a conference like this. It's definitely going to be tough to try to pull
that out, but we're going to do our best.  
  
Q. Coach Johnson, can you describes the contributions that Chris Washburn
made for you today?  
COACH JOHNSON: Yeah, that was his best game all year long, 16 and 8. I thought
he did a good job of giving us a post presence and he got happy hands and
happy feet there late. But for the most part, this was his best game all year.  
  
Q. Kyan, did you get a sense late in the game that this was going to be
y'all's game?  
KYAN ANDERSON: Coming into it we thought it was going to be our game so that's
just the mentality we have, but, yeah, when it got down to the end, I told
these guys, try to make the solid plays, don't lose aggressiveness and just
make solid plays down the stretch and we did that.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, gentlemen. Congratulations, and we will see you
tomorrow.  
  
Q. Coach, what did you think of your team's effort especially on the
offensive boards tonight?  
COACH JOHNSON: Well, for the most part we‑‑ these kids have given great
effort. Sometimes in the "W" and the loss column hasn't always been good, but
it has a lot to do with who you're playing. I mean, that's been pretty
consistent.  
I think the one thing we have done the last month is we have shot the ball
with confidence and that's the big thing for us right now.  
  
Q. Your thoughts on Kansas?  
COACH JOHNSON: Premiere team in this league, one of the premiere teams in the
country. No basketball program has a more storied tradition than they do and
we've got to find a way to compete at a high level in a short period of time,
and it's just a supreme challenge. It always has been.  
  
Q. Coach, I was just curious from your standpoint going against Nino and
Thomas Gipson the final time this senior season, can you talk about what it's
been like going against those guys and what they brought tonight in their
final game?  
COACH JOHNSON: Well, having competed against them in three years they appear
to be great kids, two really great competitors and I hope K‑State doesn't have
anybody in their future like them.  
Gipson, he's a load in the post, he causes so many problems. And Nino, my hats
off to him, because I understand there was a loss in the family or something
like that, the reason he wasn't here, if I'm not mistaken. But for him to come
out and play and compete at the level he competed at that speaks volume to the
kind of kid he is and the kind of kid both of those guys are‑‑ excuse me, men,
because those are two men, believe me.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, congratulations, see you tomorrow. Good luck.

_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

Villanova  69  
Xavier - 52

  
Q. Josh, congratulations on the win and on being the tournament's Most
Outstanding Player. Your thoughts on that award and the tournament victory.  
JOSH HART: Thank you. I know I'm going to sound like a broken record the last
couple of days, but I got to shout out to my teammates. The confidence they
had in me. They kept on finding me when I was open.  
Then when you have the confidence of your teammates, you're able to go out
there, play, and have fun. So that's just what I did.  
  
Q. Best regular season in Villanova history, you guys don't have that one
big star. What's made this team so special?  
DYLAN ENNIS: It's the confidence Coach puts in us. We trust in what he does.
They've been doing this for a long time. We have the confidence in each other
as well as Coach. We just stick together.  
  
Q. Josh, Chris Mack came in here before and said you guys are capable of
winning a National Championship. Going through the season now, do you feel
like you're capable of beating anyone going into the tournament?  
JOSH HART: I think so, yeah, if we play Villanova basketball, but our focus is
on getting better every day. Our focus is on, tomorrow we're going to find out
who our next opponent is and just preparing for that game and just getting
better every day and just taking it game by game.  
So obviously, that's our goal this year, but we have to go through everybody
in the NCAA Tournament. They're tough teams. All those teams are experienced.
All those teams are talented.  
Like I said, it's our goal, but we have to get better every day to do that.  
  
Q. For both players, guys, this is the first Big East Tournament
championship for Villanova in 20 years, and as a longtime member of the
conference, what does it mean to the basketball program, the university, and
both of you as players?  
DYLAN ENNIS: As players, we're very excited about it. We haven't been here,
but I think every player would say they're really excited for Coach as well.
Coach has been grinding with Villanova for a long time. For us to be finally
able to give it to him, we're happy about that.  
The school gives us so much support. We love them for it. From the students to
the teachers to Father (Donohue), you know. Everybody is happy about it.  
  
Q. Coach said earlier this week you guys have done a good job of not getting
ahead of yourself, focusing on one game at a time. How important was it for
you guys to win this thing and shed that short coming of last March?  
JOSH HART: It felt good. Obviously, we came here and kind of failed last year.
So we kind of let the past be the past. Obviously, this definitely feels good,
and we just have to build on this. We have to go back tomorrow, get better,
and then figure out who we're playing and just prepare for that game.  
  
Q. Josh, I know this is obviously a big moment for the team, but as an
individual, your name is now etched alongside Patrick Ewing and Chris Mullin
and Kemba Walker. What does that mean to you just to know that?  
JOSH HART: It's an honor. It's definitely humbling to be in that list of guys.
But like I said, I've got to thank my teammates for that.  
Dylan did a great job finding me when I was open, Darrun. Our bigs did, Danny,
J.P., Ryan. Coach had full trust in me.  
Like I said, when I have those guys' total confidence, we just go out there,
play, and have fun and do whatever I can to help them. I've just got to say
it's a great honor, and it's definitely humbling.  
  
Q. Coach, this one's for you: What's your opinion about winning the
conference title, in this atmosphere (inaudible)?  
COACH WRIGHT: Anything we do at Villanova in the Big East is very, very
significant. We take great pride in being part of this conference. We take
great pride in the history of Villanova; we really do. So to be one of the
coaches that has won that, just like Josh said, it's very humbling. It's a
great honor.  
There's not a lot of coaches at Villanova. It's a great place to coach. You
can look at the records, all the coaches have won at Villanova. It's a great
place. I'm very honored to be a part of it. And this league. We love this
league.  
  
Q. Coach, talk about the play of your Most Valuable Player. He shot 21
‑of‑29 over three games and missed no more than three shots in any game and
made seven shots in every game. Talk about his play in the tournament.   
COACH WRIGHT: Honestly, he's about halfway there to what he can be. He really
can be a great player. He had a great freshman year. We all hear about the
sophomore jinx, and he came back and had a better sophomore year, which is
really difficult to do, because this year people knew who he was, and when he
came in the game and knew he was coming in to give us energy. And to do it in
all these big games, it just shows you talent, character, and it also shows
you how much better he can get.  
  
Q. Jay, do you mind talking about winning your first Big East Championship,
your first time in the championship game.  
COACH WRIGHT: It's a thrill, man. Like I said, I grew up coming to this
tournament as a fan. When I coached at Hofstra, I would make sure, even if we
were in the championship game, which was always 11:00, I'd come here to this
tournament to watch Villanova. This is my favorite tournament.  
I love the NCAA Tournament, obviously, but this is where we're all from. We're
all from the Northeast. New York, Madison Square Garden is the Mecca, and so
to come here and just play in it is a thrill for us. To win it, I can't even
tell you. I don't know if it's really sunk in yet. I do know we're going to
have to forget about it, though, on Monday.  
  
Q. Jay, you mentioned earlier how the '95 team was honored because of
winning the Big East Tournament. How do you feel about this group of guys now
being honored 20 years from now, coming back and taking a bow?  
COACH WRIGHT: That's a great point, Joe. When we played our last game against
St. John's at home, the '95 team was there, and they came in the locker room.
They're a very revered group at Villanova, and we said that to our guys. We
said, "It would be great if you guys come back as Big East Tournament
champions, also." Already, we're going to come back as regular season
champions, but we said that would be great to do.  
I'm thrilled for these guys because these are really special players, but also
special Villanovans. These guys take pride in being part of the program. They
take pride in playing for the guys that came before them. They know all the
history. Stewart Granger was here behind the bench tonight, Alvin Williams.
They know all these guys.  
For these guys to be‑‑ the names you mentioned, Patrick Ewing, that means a
lot to them. But to be mentioned with Alvin Williams and Kerry Kittles, that
means more to these guys.  
  
Q. Jay, there's been some great Villanova teams, but nobody's ever had a
season before the tournament like you guys. Is this the best team you've
coached?  
COACH WRIGHT: They've got a chance. They really have a chance. We'll see how
they do in this next tournament, but this does have a chance to be the best
team I've ever had.  
  
Q. Jay, oftentimes, when cutting down the nets, the coach is the person who
makes the last cut. You specifically asked all your team to have Pinkston make
the last cut. Can you tell us why.  
COACH WRIGHT: He means so much to our team. He really exemplifies what our
guys are all about. He came as an McDonald's All‑American. He was a leading
scorer on this team, and in his senior year, he just did whatever the team
needed him to do, not score as much. He could, but he didn't need to. And he
just sacrificed all year.  
He's going to graduate on time, like all our guys do. He had a little trouble
his freshman year, and he's in New York City, which means the world to him. I
thought of it, but I know every guy on this team would want the same thing. As
soon as I said, they said, "Yep, J.P." He means so much to us, and New York
means so much to him. This was a beautiful experience for all of us to watch
him.  
  
Q. Coach, you won the regular season. Now you've won the tournament. As
such, your voice right now carries. With the NCAA coming up, how important is
it for you to be able to trumpet the idea that six teams in the Big East
should be in this tournament coming up?  
COACH WRIGHT: I always leave it to the Committee. I think the Committee does a
great job. If anybody cares about my opinion, just playing against these teams
and watching what all the other teams have done this year, I definitely do
think all six teams are deserving.  
I think, if Seton Hall would have stayed healthy, I think they would have been
an NCAA Tournament team. They had the talent. They had injuries. They lost
some guys. If they would have stayed healthy, I think they would have been in,
too.  
I think that's the strength of this conference. No one loves the old Big East
more than me. It's not the old Big East. It's never going to be. But there's
no old ACC either, and there's no old Big Ten either. This is something really
special. Every school here that comes to this event is a basketball school,
the purest, everybody.  
You can tell the crowd, they're intelligent basketball crowds. It's awesome to
be a part of this.  
  
Q. Jay, when Chris Mack was in here, he said that he thought you guys were
capable of winning a national title. As you head into next week, do you feel
at this point you're capable of beating anyone?  
COACH WRIGHT: I definitely do. I appreciate that from Chris. He doesn't just
throw things around like that. I really respect the job he did with his team.
That game they had to win at Creighton was a tough game. I think that one put
them in the Tournament.  
But we could win it. But we could get beat by anybody. It's just the way
college basketball is. We're not Kentucky in terms of depth and talent, but we
could beat them. But we could lose to a 15 or 16, too, if we don't play right.
I just think that's what we are.  
  
Q. Jay, you mentioned the Big East isn't the Big East anymore, but the
conference tournament is the conference tournament. Is there a sense of relief
for you? I know you had your fair share of wins in early 2000 and could have
won the Big East Tournament. Is there a sense of relief that you kind of
needed this at all?  
COACH WRIGHT: Not personally. It's thrilling. It's thrilling. There's kind of
a relief for our program in that ‑‑ I sit and think about we had some teams
like '06 with Randy Foye and those guys, I kind of feel bad they didn't get to
experience this. The '09 team, I felt bad they didn't get to experience it. I
felt they were good enough to win it.  
It's hard to be a good enough team to win this tournament, but I'm thrilled
for these guys. I'm thrilled for these guys and our program.  
  
Q. Coach, do you have any closing comments on playing the conference final
on a Saturday and having to play on a Thursday and also playing on a Sunday.  
THE MODERATOR: Saturday versus Sunday playing.  
COACH WRIGHT: For the finals? I think it's huge. I really do. Plus you get to
enjoy Selection Sunday, which is great. On our campus, it's like a holiday.
It's nice that the guys get to experience that, and the families all get to be
there and the students get to be there.  
And you do get that day of rest. If you're playing on Thursday, it's
important.  
  
Q. Jay, can you talk about the crowd, the Villanova fans tonight.  
COACH WRIGHT: Every time we come‑‑ our strongest alumni following, the largest
number of alumni is in the metropolitan area. When we come up here, they just
love it. They love the Garden like we all do. They all grew up with the Big
East, all of them. It's just awesome to play here.  
They always come out strong in the Garden. I'll tell you, when the game‑‑ when
they were doing the introductions and I could hear‑‑ it sounded like a home
game. I could hear them chanting, "Let's go Nova!" before the game started, I
was impressed. I kind of forgot about that, but it hit me real quickly. We've
got an advantage here.  
  
Q. Jay, if you look at some of the best teams in the country, most of those
teams have a big star. You guys don't have that guy. Is that a strength for
you guys in terms of they don't know where to look?  
COACH WRIGHT: I think it is. I think we have guys that are capable of being
stars, but they know they don't have to be, and they accept that. They love
being a part of the team, and I think that's our strength. I think that's our
strength, that a number of these guys could be stars if we needed them to be.  
  
Q. Jay, can you talk about the success the team had against their zone,
especially in the first half?  
COACH WRIGHT: I thought the Providence game really helped us because we
struggled against Providence's zone, and it almost cost us the game, and it
gave us a chance to look at it last night, talk about it today, look at it
again today, and then be prepared.  
Chris is a smart coach. He saw it. He was like, we've got to give it a shot.
And I thought the guys really adjusted well.  
  
Q. Coach, another terrific season for you, but do you feel like it's
overlooked? I feel like Villanova on a national scale isn't being thrown in
with names like Wisconsin, Virginia, Duke, Kentucky. Do you feel like you're
overlooked on a national landscape?  
COACH WRIGHT: I don't think I follow that enough to know. A lot of people have
asked us that. I'll tell you what, in the Northeast, in Philadelphia, we get a
lot of attention. I think Fox Sports does a great job of putting us out there.
We've got commercials with our guys on it. We get a lot of‑‑ every recruit
across the country watches every game on Fox Sports. I feel fine about it.  
And the guys don't play for that. They play for their teammates and their
coaches and the people at Villanova. We get a lot of attention there. I have
heard that a lot. We're not bothered by it at all. We're pleased with the
attention we get.  
  
Q. It seems like you locked up a Number 1 seed this week. How big of a
difference is that between being a 1 and a 2?  
COACH WRIGHT: I really don't think it's that big of a deal. I said that when
we might not have been a 1. I just don't‑‑ it's all matchups.  
I remember we were a 1 seed‑‑ tell me if I'm wrong. I remember the game. I
think we were a 1 seed in '06, and we got Arizona from an 8‑9 game, I think.
That team‑‑ we played them at the Wells Fargo Center. If we didn't play that
game at home, that team was beating us. It's just matchups.  
A couple of years ago, we were 2 or 3 and got an UCLA team in the second
round, and they were real young. They had a lot of freshmen that were leaving
early for the NBA, and they were young. It wasn't as difficult a matchup
because they were so young. It's so much matchups.  
  
Q. Jay, a couple days ago, you said your team was not one of your best
defensive teams. After the last two nights, would you care to amend that? Or
do you still feel the same way?  
COACH WRIGHT: We're getting there. I felt the last two nights were a great
setup for us, especially last night in that Providence did such a great job.
We couldn't score, but we did a great job on Henton. And Dunn, even though he
got 22, was a killer. We made it tough on him. They had to bring Lindsey off
the bench to hit some threes. We did a good job.  
We lose that game last night if we don't defend like that. And then tonight I
thought we really stepped it up, too. That's what we've got to keep doing.
We've got to keep getting better, and we could be one of our best defensive
teams. We could get there.  
  
Q. Coach brought up against Kentucky, how do you think you'd match up if you
played them? Is that a team you'd like to see?  
DYLAN ENNIS: I think Kentucky is a great team. Whoever is put in front of us,
we approach it the same way; we play the Villanova basketball way. I think, if
we play Villanova basketball, we're a tough group of guys. If we stick to our
core values, and I think we can beat anybody. As Coach said, we can get beat
by anybody as well.  
But I think if we continue to play with each other and play confident‑‑ Coach
gives us all the confidence in the world. If we play defense how we've been
doing, I think we should be fine for anybody.  
  
Q. Coach, a lot of times in the NCAA Tournament, team will get a scare, and
they'll bounce back with a strong game. You kind of had it last night, and
then tonight, do you think that's the best preparation you could have going
into the Tournament?  
COACH WRIGHT: That game for us last night was great for us after you win it.
When you're in it, you don't ask for one of those, but that was great for us.
It really was because we had a lot of chances to lose that game, and we
battled.  
Those games are good for you. When you get in the NCAA Tournament, if you make
a run, you definitely have those games. I'm glad we got it in the tournament.  
  
Q. Coach, you talk about defense. Talk about your defense against
Stainbrook. He's been dominating the last couple of nights. Tonight, just 4
points, 2 ‑of‑8\. He was clearly out of rhythm.   
COACH WRIGHT: I thought our depth on him‑‑ we tried to keep fresh bodies on
him. He's been dominant. We had Daniel Ochefu, Pinkston, Kris Jenkins and Josh
Hart on him at different times. We tried to do it, fresh bodies, fresh bodies,
and you've got to be tough on him. He did a great job.  
  
Q. Going back to the whole 1 seed thing, again, it's not official, but most
likely you guys will probably stay in Pittsburgh. How big will it be to stay
there?  
COACH WRIGHT: In '05, we played up in Syracuse, and that was our first
tournament since I was back at Villanova as a head coach. We were shocked how
welcoming everybody from Syracuse was. It was unbelievable. They did
everything for us.  
And then in '09, we went to Boston in the final eight. It was after B.C. left
the Big East. And everybody in Boston was so thrilled to have a Big East team
there. It was pretty cool. It would be nice if that happened in Pittsburgh,
too. That would be cool.  
  
Q. Jay, offensively, it's been a feature of your team all year, but just
talk about how tough it is for teams to guard you guys. You had nine threes
tonight, shot 50 percent from the floor, you had 24 points in the paint, and
you had 27 points off the bench. A lot of weapons.  
COACH WRIGHT: Again, I think that is our strength. That balanced scoring and
guys that are good enough to be 20, 22‑point scorers. Both of these guys could
be 22‑point scorers on another team. But their mentality is positive being an
8, 10, 12‑point scorer and being a good team player. I think that's our
greatest strength.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 14, 2015

  

### [Dee Davis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16908)

### [Myles Davis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28638)

### [Chris Mack](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20746)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

Villanova - 69  
Xavier - 52

  
COACH MACK: Well, we weren't very good tonight. Villanova had a heck of a lot
to do with it. I know the guys next to me and some of the guys in the locker
room are tired of hearing it, but that's where the bar is in this league. They
set the standard.  
They have a chance to win a National Championship, and they are not given
nearly enough credit for how tough of a team they are, how hard they play, how
unselfish they are. They're the true definition of a team.  
I haven't been doing this as long as some coaches out there, but I've been in
some really good leagues, and I've seen some really good teams, and they're up
there with any of them.  
As far as tonight, we missed too many bunnies around the basket. I thought we
took pretty good care of the basketball. They had nine turnovers. But we were
just on our heels. We couldn't score around the rim. Because of it, it
affected our defense.  
Really talked a whole lot going into the game about limiting their three‑point
field goal attempts, but it's easier said than done. They only shot 23 of them
as opposed to 29 and 34, the first couple times that we played them.  
But I'm proud of our team. It's not easy to sit up here after you get your ass
kicked in the Big East Championship, but we made a heck of a run. Hopefully,
our younger guys‑‑ I know Dee's not going to be back, but hopefully our
younger guys understand what it takes to get to this point. And then when you
watch that team in white at the other end, see what it takes to close the
deal.  
But as bad as we feel today, give us about 20 hours, and we'll be excited to
play another day.  
  
Q. Coach, is there a moral victory at all in this league for what you did
this week, getting to the final, possibly showing this league or the country
what kind of program you have and what kind of team you have?  
COACH MACK: I wouldn't say‑‑ the first two games certainly weren't moral
victories because we won them. We try not to‑‑ as we came here, we didn't
necessarily look at it as a tournament. We looked at it one game. We had
Butler, and that's who we wanted to beat. We played them. Whoever came out of
the other side, we played them, and it was Georgetown, and we beat them.  
It's disappointing when you lose the opportunity to win a championship, but
like I said before, I'm proud of the effort that we made to get here.  
  
Q. Coach, Matt looked really frustrated that first time ‑out, like he asked
to be taken out. Is that the case? Kind of what was going on with him and what
did they do to him tonight?   
COACH MACK: They worked harder than him. They're a little undersized,
obviously, Ochefu isn't undersized, but he's more athletic than Matt. He
worked harder than Matt. I think Matt let his frustrations spill over to his
play. He missed some shots that we're normally accustomed to him making he
can't play like that if we're going to be effective, especially against a team
that pressures so much on the perimeter. You've got to hurt them in the
interior.  
  
Q. Dee, do you look at the play as a challenge in itself, or are you excited
to play a team that isn't in the Big East that doesn't know you so well? How
eager are you to get to get to the next game?  
DEE DAVIS: Well, it's always fun to play in a tournament. My freshman year we
made it to the Sweet 16. Of course it hurts, you work hard to win a
championship. We've done a lot this weekend. But it's how it goes. We didn't
show up today and we've got to move on.  
  
Q. What does it mean just for your program to be in this game tonight?  
COACH MACK: It means a lot. It's not easy. There's three newcomers to the
league. We've won the first game, the Big East Tournament both years that
we've been in. Obviously, we took it a step further this year. I think the
players would be in agreement, the atmosphere during the National Anthem, just
big‑time atmosphere. Big‑time atmosphere.  
It means a lot for our program. We've been in some great leagues. Nothing
compares to the stage that we're on now. We've got some young guys in our
program, and hopefully, they use it as an experience to draw on, to inspire,
and to work hard over the summer and we'll get to this point a year from now.  
  
Q. Myles, J.P.'s on the bench with an ankle injury and Matt's having trouble
and then Tre gets two fouls. How much were you guys discombobulated there in
the first half when they really started to pull away? Or did that affect
things for you?  
MYLES DAVIS: We have a really deep team, and with J.P. being out, we needed
guys to step up, including me and Tre. Today just wasn't our day.  
Nova is a great team. They obviously had way more experience than us. This was
our first time being in the Big East Championship, and they showed it. They
showed why they're one of the top contenders in the country.  
  
Q. Dee, it looked like you were grimacing throughout most of the second half
there. Did you have any type of injury? If so, what was it?  
DEE DAVIS: I just twisted my ankle. It shouldn't be anything to worry about,
though. I'm going to get treatment and be ready to go in the Tournament.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 13, 2015

  

### [Josh Hart](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26656)

### [Jay Wright](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13690)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

Villanova - 63  
Providence - 61

  
COACH WRIGHT: Arch has a rib issue. So he's getting it checked right now.  
Just great college basketball game. Just a thrill to be in it here at the
Garden, semifinals, Big East, Friday night. It's what you dream of, man. It
was an awesome game.  
I give Providence a lot of credit. Their zone was awesome. We just really
struggled with it. We've been good against zones, but we really struggled.  
But I thought our defense kept us in it, but we couldn't rebound. Couldn't
rebound against them. That's what kept them in the game. So their defense,
their rebounding, and I think our guts and a couple big plays at the end, that
was the difference.  
  
Q. Jay, thoughts on your first Big East final as a coach.  
COACH WRIGHT: I'm thrilled. I love this tournament. I like this tournament
better than any other tournament. I just love being in New York, love being in
the Garden. I know all of our alumni do. I'm thrilled. I'm really happy for
these guys.  
  
Q. Jay, regardless of what happens tomorrow night, do you feel like you've
earned the 1 seed at this point?  
COACH WRIGHT: Honestly, I don't know enough about it. I really don't. I don't
follow it. I couldn't give you an honest answer. I think, if we win it, we
deserve one. But I don't know all the other parameters to give you an honest
answer.  
  
Q. Coach, another big game from Josh coming off the bench. Can you talk
about that. And also is there something special that allows him to come off
the bench as the sixth man right away to do things like that?  
COACH WRIGHT: I'm glad you give me a chance to say that. There is something
special about him. He's good enough to be a starter. We have him penciled in
as a starter preseason, and Dylan Ennis just had a ridiculous summer and fall.
Josh had a real good one, and Dylan Ennis was amazing. He just shocked us all.
He just earned it.  
We told Josh, you didn't get beat out. He just‑‑ you didn't lose it. He just
was ridiculous. You've got to accept this.  
The day he won the Sixth Man Award, I called his mom and dad and said, "Just
because of you guys, the character you built in him," and his parents don't
complain. His parents say, "Hey, you're the sixth man. Be the best sixth man."
That's what he did, and that's unusual.  
  
Q. Jay, just your thoughts on Kris Dunn's performance tonight, and your
thoughts on him.  
COACH WRIGHT: Awesome. He is big time. We're pretty good defensively, and
we're pretty good at pick‑and‑roll defense. He's the toughest guy. I would say
he's the toughest guy we've guarded in pick‑and‑roll defense.  
I'd have to look at every game, but after coming out of that game, I don't
think there's another guy we've had as much problem against on the
pick‑and‑roll.  
  
Q. Jay, when you look at this team, do you feel it's one that's built for
the NCAAs?  
COACH WRIGHT: I hope so. I really do. I think tonight was a great example. A
couple of our guys were just not in sync tonight. I don't know why. Darrun
Hilliard fouls out, and then other guys step up.  
Josh steps up. Daniel has a huge game. But we kept our composure and found a
way to pull it out. That's what it takes. You've got to have guts. You've got
to have a great resiliency to keep going. So I like this team.  
  
Q. Do you think there's something this team has that maybe last year's team
didn't that might afford it to go far?  
COACH WRIGHT: Definitely, the experience. Everybody on this team, the top
seven guys, have all been in big games. They've all played in the Big East
Tournament. They've all already lost in the Big East Tournament. They've all
already played in the NCAA Tournament. They've all been a 1 seed in the Big
East Tournament. They've been through everything.  
That makes a huge difference. It's not something to be taken lightly.  
  
Q. Talk about the strategy on the last play with 12 seconds left. What was
the strategy? Who was the play drawn up to?  
COACH WRIGHT: Daniel‑‑ we were having trouble getting the ball inbounds before
that. Daniel is great at coming back and getting the ball. He's got great
hands. The play was to inbound the ball to Daniel, Daniel get it back to Ryan,
and then spread the floor and set a middle ball screen.  
We had three shooters around Ryan. That's why he got to the rim because they
knew we had three shooters out there, and Daniel set the back screen.  
  
Q. Jay, what's that time ‑out like? After that turnover that ties the game,
is it panic? Do you have to calm them down at all?   
COACH WRIGHT: No, not this group, and that's where the experience comes in.
That's happened to us before, and we've lost games on that, this group,
because they've been around. So that's happen. And we've won games.  
We just say, "Attitude" to each other. That's our word we know. "Next play,
man. Next play." They're more calm than I am.  
There was no doubt we were going to make a play there. The concern was going
to be how much time was going to be left? And were we going to be able to get
a stop?  
  
Q. Was there a point in the game where you felt, even though they were
playing zone and you usually are able to move the ball well enough to find
your shots, that wasn't going to happen, and you were going to have to put the
ball on the floor and penetrate and do it a different way? Was there a moment
where you said, hey, guys, we've got to start doing something else?  
COACH WRIGHT: In the second half, we started that way. We started doing a good
job. They started taking out a way. They lifted all four guys above the foul
line, which is really unusual.  
And they just said, go ahead, put it in to Daniel Ochefu or put someone in the
middle of the lane. At the end, we got it to J.P. in the middle of the lane.
We got it to Darrun in the middle of the lane. Darrun Hilliard made a big
play.  
They made us do things we don't normally do. That's where you give them
credit.  
  
Q. Is that big down the road for you?  
COACH WRIGHT: Definitely. I'd rather not have all these games, but when you
do, you're really glad you have one. It's great to go through that. There were
plays where we just threw the ball off a guy's foot and one guy wasn't
looking. It was one of those nights, but you've got to find a way to win those
nights.  
  
Q. This is for the players: How tough was it to regroup after losing the
lead, which you had the entire game until those last 12 seconds?  
JOSH HART: It wasn't really tough at all. Like Coach said, we got in the
huddle and looked at each other and said "attitude", and we moved on to the
next play. We had 12 more seconds left to play Villanova basketball. We knew
we had one mistake, but it was in the past. We focused on the next play. We
focused on the last 12.9 seconds, and luckily it worked out for us.  
  
Q. Josh, you guys wouldn't have been able to repeat what you did yesterday
from three, but you started out kind of slow. So how important was it for you
especially to hit those two that you did in the first half when you did?  
JOSH HART: It was a good feeling. Like you said, we were starting off a little
bit slow. We can't always have the shooting game that we had against
Marquette. That's where our defense really came into play.  
Obviously, when you make those first couple in the first half, you have a good
feeling.  
  
Q. Jay, you had a pretty good angle compared to the rest of us. What did you
think of the call?  
COACH WRIGHT: I had no angle because he was on the other side of the defender.
So I really had no angle at all.  
  
Q. Jay, the last couple games you guys have won by more than double digits.
How did it feel to finally win a game in a tight finish?  
COACH WRIGHT: I think that's going to be a great experience for us. That's
going to be something for us to look back on and learn from. You need that. We
really haven't had many games like that, and it was good for us.  
A lot of end‑of‑game situations, we made some mistakes, we did some things
well, but we'll learn from that. It's good to be in a game like that at the
end of the year.  
  
Q. If you guys end up playing Georgetown tomorrow night, historically, is
there something to be said for that matchup, given it's two old school Big
East teams and the anniversary of the '85 title game?  
COACH WRIGHT: All that stuff would be cool. It really would. But it would be
just as cool as to play Xavier in the finals. Being in the Big East finals,
that's the best, man.  
This night, the double‑header Friday night, that's the great night to be in,
but the final game in Madison Square Garden is a thrill for anybody that's in
the Northeast in basketball, man. You just dream about that.  
  
Q. What's the biggest difference between last year's team that got knocked
out surprisingly in the quarterfinals and this year's squad that's going to
the Big East championship tomorrow?  
COACH WRIGHT: I think the fact that they all played in that situation
together. It's not like anything sexy. It's not like Daniel's improved a lot,
which he has, but it's really that these guys, they're coming into these games
having been in lots of big games, having been the top of the league all year.
Everywhere we went on the road, it was the biggest game, it's a sellout,
everybody's out to get us, and they've been through all that.  
And they already failed last year. I heard Ryan Arch say, "Hey, we already
came up here and lost in the first round, and everybody hated us." We already
did that. We're not afraid of that. We lived through it. So the fact they've
been through all of this together is a great characteristic they have going
into every game.

_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

Xavier - 65  
Georgetown - 63

  
COACH MACK: I told our coaching staff in the locker room that I've only been
involved in one other game like that that I can remember. I was an assistant
coach. Certainly, the stakes weren't nearly as high. But I was an assistant
coach at Wake Forest, and we played Arkansas in preseason NIT, and at one
point we were up by 25 and we ended up winning by one.  
I feel like, if we played three more minutes, we might have lost by 17. I
don't think it's anything other than we missed some free throws. You can't
stop momentum if you can't score.  
Georgetown started to solve the zone we had out in the second half. I thought
we did a good job, for the most part, of taking care of the basketball,
drawing some fouls. We did have a few turnovers down the stretch. We've been
the league's best free‑throw shooting team all year in conference play.
Tonight we didn't do not even close to what we're capable of, especially down
the stretch. But we hit enough at the very, very end to play tomorrow night.  
  
Q. Talk about the swing of momentum after the technical foul when they got a
five ‑point possession, it seemed like.   
COACH MACK: It certainly changed the game. I didn't have the luxury of being
able to see the monitor. So I'll leave it in those guys' hands.  
I do know that there have been some double technicals called throughout the
season, and not necessarily for guys being separated or pushing, but some
taunting. At least what I saw live, I felt like that could have been the
appropriate call, but I'm not the referee. I'm just the guy that yells at
them.  
  
Q. You've had some great wins. You've had some obviously bad losses. Today
you played great for about 32 minutes, and then you had some bad minutes. Is
this a hard team for you to figure out?  
COACH MACK: No. Next question.  
  
Q. What does it mean to you and the program to be in the Big East finals for
the first time?  
COACH MACK: It means a heck of a lot. These guys sacrificed their summer. We
went overseas to Brazil this summer. Basketball, as a college athlete nowadays
is 24/7, 365 days a year. In the stone ages, when I played, you got to go home
for the summer. These guys stick around for the entire summer and take
classes. Then to have three weeks off like you normally have for the summer
session, too, they said, no, we're going over to Brazil and going to practice.  
These two took it like champions. It's not the easiest thing in the world to
do wallop drills and taking charges in July. We felt it was necessary to get
our young team together. It's been a long journey, ups and downs. It means a
lot. We've been in a lot of good leagues. This is obviously the best league,
and we're looking forward to the championship tomorrow night.  
  
Q. Looks like J.P. rolled his ankle. How is he doing, and how will that
affect his availability tomorrow?  
COACH MACK: I really don't know. I don't think it looks good, to be honest
with you, for tomorrow. The X‑rays were negative, which is a good thing. But
in terms of when he gets back on the floor, I couldn't tell you.  
  
Q. Do you think it's an ankle sprain?  
COACH MACK: It is an ankle sprain.  
  
Q. Matt, down the stretch, after your turnovers, you were going back
on(inaudible)what was it like for you to get yourself back in check?  
MATT STAINBROOK: We just wanted to make sure we kept our team calm. We weren't
going to implode on ourself. We were in control. We wanted to play like we
were in control. Though we didn't, I think, have the best leadership by us‑‑
that's something we're working on‑‑ but I think we were able to handle it in
the game. So I'm happy.  
  
Q. Dee, as a point guard, you weren't having a good shooting night. You had
a poor night from the free ‑throw line, but yet you didn't allow that to
frazzle you. You weren't turning the ball over or anything like that. Could
you talk about how you were able to maintain and keep a level head even when
they started pressing you guys.   
DEE DAVIS: In my position, that's your job, to take care of the ball and make
sure the team is calm and is ready to do what we need to do to win.  
Having a bad shooting night, it happens. You just got to go through it. I made
some big ones in the end to make it feel like I did all right tonight.  
  
Q. Chris, James Farr hasn't scored much recently, but it seems like he's
gotten more minutes and settled into a role. What are your thoughts on his
play the last few weeks?  
COACH MACK: I think he's done a great job. James has handled maybe not getting
as many minutes in Big East play like a champ. He handles our team, our team
winning, and he comes to practice every single day with a great attitude.
That's what you need to be a team that plays in tomorrow night's game.  
If guys start to pout, guys start to separate; that's when it becomes a
problem. James hasn't done that. He's a terrific rebounder, and tonight we
needed him on the floor.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about your decision ‑making process with opting to
foul up three towards the end of the game?   
COACH MACK: I've had some negative experiences with not fouling as an
assistant coach and watched [] Ron Lewis, when we were up in the Ohio State
game to go to the Sweet 16. We were up three, and he hit a three to go to
overtime, and it took all the momentum.  
We felt like with 10 seconds, by the time they maybe got to half‑court, these
guys did a good job of turning them, maybe 5 seconds on the clock. I trust the
guys to block out, rebound, and inbound, and that's just the strategy we chose
to go with.  
  
Q. Following two double ‑digit victories over Georgetown in the regular
season, was the game plan any different?   
COACH MACK: In the quick turnaround, it's a very hard team to prepare for. As
well as these guys played Georgetown the first two games, it's also very
difficult to quickly remember all the actions they run‑‑ the dribble handoffs,
back door‑‑ but we try.  
I thought early on they got a little bit of a rhythm. We decided to go to our
zone. It was very, very effective, and we never got out of it. We didn't play
that zone much the first two games. I don't know how much Georgetown has seen.
Again, they only have 24 hours to prepare as well.  
  
Q. For Matt and Dee, you guys don't seem to be afraid of any team, whether
it's a ranked team or non ‑ranked team. You beat Georgetown three times
ranked. What do you think gives you guys the best advantage against a
Villanova team that you haven't beaten?   
DEE DAVIS: Believe in ourselves. We came here to win a Big East championship.
We didn't come here to beat Georgetown. We came here to win a Big East
championship. So that's our plan.  
  
Q. Chris, style ‑wise, where do you and Villanova most drastically differ?
  
COACH MACK: I would say that they tend to play four perimeter players. I know
they start Pinkston and Ochefu together. But the separator in Game 2‑‑ Game 1,
we were never in it. Game 2, the separator was when Josh Hart and Jenkins were
on the floor. That's really four guards and a small power forward, if you
will. That's the difference.  
We can certainly play that way if we put Tre at the four. But I also really
like having Matt, Jalen, and James out there at the power forward and center
position.  
So just the contrast with the traditional lineup in the frontcourt versus a
four quick line would be the major difference.  
And their coach dresses a hell of a lot sharper than me.  
  
Q. Matt, talk about the battle with Josh Smith tonight. He played nearly
half the minutes that you played, and you guys got him in foul trouble pretty
quickly. Talk about how that limited their role.  
MATT STAINBROOK: He's a load to guard at the beginning of the game. He started
to get rolling a little bit. That's something we've got to make sure we can
catch the ball out farther. Had to dig down even though they did a good job of
helping me. I had to make sure I was locked in and returning to him and going
high side, making it tough for him, because I knew my teammates were going to
do a good job of crowding.  
Luckily, we got him into foul trouble, and we were able to keep him off the
glass for the most part. But a tough battle.  
  
Q. Chris, you mentioned the quick turnaround, less than 20 hours to tomorrow
night's game. Explain a little about the process of preparing for Villanova.  
COACH MACK: It's different for players and coaches.  
My main priority for these guys is to get back in their beds and get some
rest. Put a lot of fluids in.  
Fortunately, Villanova is a very, very simple team, but they're also really,
really good. When I say that, they don't run all these different actions and
50 set plays. If we had to play Butler tomorrow night, that might be an issue.
They run a million plays.  
It's their players that get you, how hard they play. Our guys know them very,
very well, having played them in this true round‑robin league a lot.  
They'll rest a lot. We'll watch a lot of tape, figure out how they really
played here the first two nights. Obviously, we're not going to change a whole
lot. They shoot the ball pretty well, I hear.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 13, 2015

  

### [Isaac Copeland](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28622)

### [John Thompson III](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13688)

### [Jabril Trawick](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26645)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

Xavier - 65  
Georgetown - 63

  
Q. John, what changed for you that allowed you, when you were down 20, to
make that comeback at the final push?  
COACH THOMPSON: I think we finally started getting the ball in the middle of
their zone. For too long of a stretch, we were just passing the ball around
the perimeter. But we started getting the ball into the middle of it and
making correct decisions.  
I think that, when we finally started to score, our defense got better. So we
weren't scoring for stretches, and then they were coming down, and our defense
wasn't good. Once we started scoring, our defense got better.  
  
Q. Coach Mack said that he didn't go 1 ‑3‑1 in your first two meetings. Did
that catch you off guard? Was that something that you did or didn't factor
into your preparation?   
COACH THOMPSON: No, they played it. They played it in just about every game.
We knew that they‑‑ especially the second half of the season, they've been
going to that a lot. We just didn't execute.  
  
Q. Coach, after the technical fouls, you guys made like a 14 ‑1 run. Can you
talk about that momentum swing that you had that brought you down from 20 to
6.   
COACH THOMPSON: I think the answer is the same. We started getting the ball in
the middle of their zone to Isaac, and it was open in the first half. We just
did a poor job of not getting to him. So we switched up a few things and got
it to him after some initial movement. Then he made the right decisions most
of the time.  
Also with Jabril off the bounce attacking the ball and making the decision
whether to go all the way or kick it out.  
I think that was the key‑‑ I don't remember, but if it started with the
technical, so be it.  
  
Q. John, Stainbrook has been a pest in all the games, was again today. What
was the issue today with stopping him?  
COACH THOMPSON: I would classify him‑‑ I'm not sure if I'd use‑‑ he's good.
He's a very, very good player. He's poised. He makes the right decisions,
whether it be for himself or for his teammates.  
So stopping him is difficult just because he's so poised and they do a good
job of getting him the ball. And he does a good job of‑‑ they play through him
in so many different things. But he's a good player. He poses problems, not
just because of his size, not just his skill level, but also his IQ.  
  
Q. Jabril, in the second half, you drew Stainbrook's third and fourth foul.
You drove it in on him a couple of times. Obviously, you weren't going to
match up with him on the low block. Did you take it upon yourself to sort of
attack him on offense? Is?  
JABRIL TRAWICK: Definitely. When they went 1‑3‑1, we were being too stagnant.
I just wanted to be aggressive and try to get to the cup, get to the line.
Just find some ways to put some points on the board. By getting to the line,
that stopped the clock and able to put those free throws in, we were able to
climb back.  
  
Q. Do you take minor consolation that you fought all the way to the very end
and made it a one possession game the last few minutes? Do you take some
consolation from this game ‑‑ obviously, it's not the result you want. Is
there anything positive about making the comeback at the end?   
ISAAC COPELAND: I think this comeback shows how deep of a team we are. It's
not easy to come back from down 20 like we were. It shows we have a lot of
heart.  
  
Q. Coach, talk to us about the full ‑court pressure. You're down 20 with
nine minutes to go. Instead of your guys packing it in, you went full‑court
pressure. Your guys really put on a tremendous run and cut the lead all the
way down to a few points. Tell us about that.   
COACH THOMPSON: We had to. I know packing it in didn't cross anyone's mind on
that pitch. So we had to try to change the pace a little bit. So we went to a
couple of different presses.  
They handled it, I thought. To tell you the truth, I thought they handled it
well.  
  
Q. Jabril, on that last free throw, were you trying to miss it or make?  
JABRIL TRAWICK: I was trying to miss it.  
  
Q. Coach, how often do you practice those situations, up, down, with the
free throw towards the end?  
COACH THOMPSON: We have enough trouble practicing making, so I can honestly
say, we never practiced missing.  
  
Q. Coach, this is the third loss to Xavier this season. What is so tough
about them for you?  
COACH THOMPSON: Everything about them. They have interior presence‑‑ several.
It's not just Matt. It's Reynolds. It's Farr. Especially the first half, they
hurt us. And they have perimeter guys that can shoot.  
With Dee Davis‑‑ I guess combined, Dee and Miles, the Davis boys, they have
perimeter leadership, and they make sure everyone gets what they should when
they should. They execute extremely well.  
I just think they're a balanced team. They're a very, very balanced team. They
support and help each other at the defensive end. Whether it's their 1‑3‑1,
their man‑to‑man, or their 2‑3, it's difficult.  
  
Q. With the Big East season over with and the NCAA Tournament coming up, is
it a relief for you to play some different teams outside of the Big East?  
COACH THOMPSON: I don't know if right now is the time for me to digest that
question. Just because I'm thinking about this game right here. Yes.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 13, 2015

  

### [Ed Cooley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23287)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

Villanova - 63  
Providence - 61

  
COACH COOLEY: Just gathering my thoughts. Really proud of our group. I thought
we played hard. I thought we played with great purpose. I thought we played
with a great sense of urgency. Playing Villanova, who I think is playing as
well as anybody in the country.  
It was a play here, play there. It came down to a couple of plays, and
unfortunately, we weren't able to get over the hump. When you're down like
that, we tied the score and never got over the top.  
To me, it wasn't so much about Villanova today. It was about what Providence
was able to do. We've played them twice and made a couple of adjustments,
which was big time. I credit our staff and our preparation.  
I thought our players were great. I really did. I thought our freshmen grew up
today, playing on this stage against that type of team, against a veteran
team. I thought we had a lot of resolve today. It just didn't show up in the
final score.  
Credit Villanova. Great team. Deserving of the win. I'm glad and very
fortunate that we definitely will be playing next week. I don't think many
teams around the country want to play Providence right now. I'm glad we're
playing as well as we are right now. Again, you've got to tip your cap to
Villanova. Great game. Hopefully, next year from this experience, our younger
guys that will return will learn from it.  
The environment was great. It was a big time environment, and I feel really,
really bad for our kids because the game was right there for us to win.  
  
Q. Your thoughts on the foul call at the end and also your thoughts on Kris'
overall performance tonight.  
COACH COOLEY: I thought Kris‑‑ let's face it. He's the player of the year. By
far the player of the year. He's the best player in the league. I don't think
it's a close second to his overall talent.  
The last play of the game was a 50‑50 call. I think we have the best officials
in the country. I think the Big East has always had the best officials in the
country. It doesn't come down to one play. I'm pretty sure everybody's going
to ask me about that. At the end of the day, we have the best officials in the
country. It was a 50‑50 call. It can go either way. It just didn't go our way
tonight.  
  
Q. And then your last play, was there any question whether Kris would take
that shot, instead of LaDontae?  
COACH COOLEY: It's set up twofold. They did a good job taking away what we
wanted because actually LaDontae was supposed to catch the ball, but they
double‑teamed him. That's why the ball went to Carson.  
At the end of the day, in tournament play, you at least want to get a shot
off. We got a shot off. In the basketball world, you got to get one off. Once
it gets out of your hands, it's got a chance to go in.  
  
Q. It seems like early in the game Villanova turns over the opposition, and
then they go for big leads. It looked like you guys adjusted to that, and then
you guys kind of like stepped up your defense. What was the thing that you
told them, to stay calm, whatever?  
COACH COOLEY: I told our guys, embrace the moment. In tournament play, crazy
things happen. We've played them twice. With technology today, you know
exactly‑‑ everybody knows what everybody's going to do. There's no secrets.  
We know they're a great three‑point shooting team, and when you take their
threes away, they want to drive the ball. They're really good around the rim.  
The one thing people understand about Villanova, they're a senior‑laden team.
They have a lot of guys that have played in big‑time games. That's what's
going to make them tough in the next tournament.  
  
Q. Talk about playing zone defense against them. You didn't have the three
‑point kill you tonight.   
COACH COOLEY: One of strengths is our length and our girth, and one of their
advantages is their quickness. We played man. We played zone. We've been doing
it the whole year. You just want to make sure you keep it close, when you play
those level of teams, to make sure you give yourself a chance at the end.  
  
Q. The job they did on LaDontae, did you guys look for him enough, or they
just took him out?  
COACH COOLEY: A combination of both. Their number one focus is to try to take
him away, that's for sure. That's where the other shots were available for
other players, like Ben, like Carson and Jalen. I thought Jalen really grew up
today. He was big time today for us. Hopefully, that's a good spark for us as
we go into next week.  
  
Q. Going on what you were saying, Jalen, he's a freshman. In a stage like
this in the semifinal against Villanova, he had two big threes in the second
half. How do you describe his performance stepping up today?  
COACH COOLEY: Today he showed a lot of mental toughness. We hadn't been
playing him a lot. It's a big‑time credit to him to come off the bench in this
type of game and pull through like that.  
As a kid, you live for those moments. You're praying the coach calls your
number. He was mentally tough enough to pull through for us. Congratulations
to him.  
  
Q. In putting together your resume for the NCAA Tournament, how does this
performance help in terms of where they'll place you seed ‑wise? Do you think
it will help you tonight?   
COACH COOLEY: First of all, I don't know what that Committee thinks. I really
don't. All I can tell you is we're playing pretty good. We're excited to play
next week. I don't know the ins and outs. That's why people are paid to
bracket it the right way, fair and equitable.  
I don't know. We're just excited to be playing. Just invite us to the dance so
we can have a party.  
  
Q. Coach, you really dominated the glass tonight, especially with Ben. How
much is that going to help you going into the Tournament when you play those
low ‑scoring, grinder type of games?   
COACH COOLEY: Again, they did a good job taking away our transition. We want
to play in transition as much as we can, but they send three, four guys back.
They flood the lane line with Kris.  
I thought today was great preparation for next week. I don't know how many
teams are out there that play as hard and as tough to guard as Villanova.
Villanova is a really, really tough out. I'm proud to say they're part of our
great conference.  
  
Q. You talked about shortening your rotation last game. With Lindsey's
performance tonight, does that make you think about using him more on the
outside?  
COACH COOLEY: Yes, we need someone that opens up that interior for us.
Hopefully, we can use him in that.  
  
Q. What's the biggest thing your team needs to work on so you can do well in
the big dance next week?  
COACH COOLEY: Make some free throws down the stretch. I thought we missed some
critical free throws down the stretch. And complete the defensive possession.
I thought there were two 50‑50 balls late in the game that we weren't able to
come up with.  
If we can clean those up, especially coming down the stretch, everything
counts.  
  
Q. Is it particularly disappointing not to repeat as tournament champions?  
COACH COOLEY: No. Let's face it, you're coming in it‑‑ if you'd have told me
we had three returning players‑‑ I don't know if any of you guys understand
that. Three guys played on this floor last year, Carson, Tyler, and LaDontae.
And if you told me in September we'd have a chance and be in a tie ballgame
with 12 seconds in a semifinal game the next year, losing 40 some odd points
between Kadeem, Cotton, and Fortune, I'd say sign us up.  
It's a credit to these guys to position ourselves to play in postseason, and
hopefully today is a steppingstone for us to continue to build our program.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 12, 2015

  

### [Derrick Wilson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28526)

### [Steve Wojciechowski](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26981)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

Villanova  84  
Marquette - 49

  
COACH WOJCIECHOWSKI: Obviously, we ran into a great team that played‑‑ I don't
know if they could play much better. Certainly, I don't think they could shoot
much better than they did.  
As I said yesterday after the game, I think Villanova is a team that could win
a National Championship. I think they have all the ingredients. They play like
they did tonight, I don't know how you beat them.  
I'm proud of my team. Obviously, we wish we had some more opportunities to
celebrate during the year, but I thought my guys fought throughout adverse
situations throughout the year. And a lot of that was the result of the senior
leadership of Derrick, Juan, and Matt. Those guys were great.  
As I told them in the locker room, I appreciate everything they've done for
our program in the past and in this past year.  
  
Q. Coach, they hadn't shot threes well the last two nights out of the
season. Was there a calculated risk in make them beat you at the three? Or did
you feel like the defense wasn't getting there?  
COACH WOJCIECHOWSKI: We wanted to try to limit their threes. I mean, the first
four threes they hit were well beyond the NBA line. So you take a little bit
of a risk. We had about 14 hours' preparation.  
But they were great, and they shot it great. Nothing but great things to say
about that.  
  
Q. Coach, how did you feel about the defense today versus Seton Hall
yesterday? It seemed like you guys were kind of playing both roles today.  
COACH WOJCIECHOWSKI: With all due respect to Seton Hall, Villanova is a much
different offensive team. You're talking about one of the most efficient
offensive teams in the country. You bring a guy off the bench who can hit 7
out of 10 from the floor, 5 out of 7 from three.  
Like I said, they don't have any holes in their game, and they played a great
game this afternoon.  
  
Q. Coach, in year one, obviously, your record wasn't what you want it to be,
but it seems you've established a culture here going forward. Can you talk
about how you can blend that in with some of the talent that you have coming
in next year.  
COACH WOJCIECHOWSKI: I thought our guys worked hard. I thought we fought. I
mean, we had a chance to win a majority of the games that we were in.
Obviously, the record wasn't like we wanted.  
I'm proud of a lot of things. We also have a lot of things we need to improve
upon. So we'll get to work on that right away.  
  
Q. Derrick, would you like to reflect on your college career? Two coaches.
You've been in several NCAA Tournaments. What these past four years have meant
to you.  
DERRICK WILSON: I enjoyed each year. This past year was one of my favorites. I
would say, having Coach Wojo, it was a blessing in disguise. At the beginning,
none of us knew exactly what we were getting, but it was one of the best
things that happened to me in my career as far as basketball in general. I
learned so much from him and the rest of our coaching staff, and it was fun.  
I mean, we didn't get the results that we always wanted, but I really enjoyed
myself this year and being around our new coaching staff and the players this
year.  
  
Q. You had one of the more memorable embraces with Coach K at the end of
your career. Take us through that moment with Juan and being on the opposite
end of that.  
COACH WOJCIECHOWSKI: Really, with all three of the seniors, I wanted all of
them to be recognized by Marquette fans because they contribute a lot.
Obviously, Juan and Derrick for four years and then Matt for this past year.  
12 months ago, their life‑‑ less than 12 months ago, their life changed a lot.
When life throws curveballs at you, you have the choice on how to handle it,
and I thought our seniors handled it as well as you possibly can. I hope I
always have a senior class like this.  
Even though we didn't get as many wins as we would like this year, the wins we
do get in the future will be a result of the foundation that they laid.  
  
Q. Coach, as a first ‑year guy in a league like this one, what was it like
going through the grind?   
COACH WOJCIECHOWSKI: I mean, it's an unforgiving league. It's an older league.
It's a league that, obviously, there's excellent coaches, tremendous
basketball traditions and home courts. It never stops. The waves keep coming.
There's not a bad team in our league. There's no gimmes.  
So it's a tough league. It's a great league to be a part of. We have a lot of
work to do to get where we want to go, but, obviously, our program is honored
to be a part of the Big East.  
  
Q. Derrick, by my count, you had 23 assists in 19 hours between yesterday
and today. Can you say something about bringing the kids along. Obviously,
you've got younger players to get the ball to. Maybe how that translates
moving forward.  
DERRICK WILSON: Yeah. I mean, they already have the talent. So just getting
them the ball and boosting their confidence. What they've done this year will
only prepare them better for next year. So get them the ball and putting them
in the right position to score. They see that. They learn. We all learn from
it. They'll do the same for the next guys coming up, and they'll keep on doing
what they've been doing, scoring the ball and playing great.  
  
Q. Coach, you mentioned the challenges you faced this year the first year
coaching. How did you personally handle them? I mean this in the nicest way,
when's the last time you've been part of a team with a losing record?  
COACH WOJCIECHOWSKI: Yeah, my freshman year. My first year in college
basketball. And in hindsight, it was the best thing that ever happened to me
as a player.  
We have a lot of work to do, but we'll get it done. I don't think it's
appropriate initially to talk about the future because I think the seniors are
the guys that I want I'm mostly focused on right now, and I appreciate
everything that they've done. Derrick, Juan, and Matt have been terrific.  
  
Q. Coach, last night you were able to hit the shots early in the game, and
it seemed like in this game, they tried to shut that off. Is that something
that you need, as far as your game goes, to be able to hit the shots to get
you going?  
COACH WOJCIECHOWSKI: Obviously, our plan was we wanted to get off to a great
start. We anticipated them trying to take Matt out of the game. Obviously,
Coach Wright is a great coach. A guy who hits eight threes, they're going to
try to shut him off.  
I thought they knocked us back with their offense more so than their defense.
They came out and shot lights out. I thought that actually knocked‑‑ their
defense was really good. But I thought their offense really knocked us back.  
  
Q. Coach, you've been an assistant for many years at Duke. You kind of
already answered this, what was kind of the biggest takeaway as your first
year at the helm of the program?  
COACH WOJCIECHOWSKI: We'll look at everything. There's obviously things that
are in our control that we can do better, and we'll work like crazy to improve
on those things. We also had some injuries, things that were out of our
control, that we hopefully won't have to deal with in the future.  
So we're always working to get better, and we will. And we will.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 12, 2015

  

### [Joshua Smith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28562)

### [D'Vauntes Smith-
Rivera](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24979)

### [John Thompson III](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13688)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

Georgetown - 60  
Creighton - 55

  
Q. John, you've seen D'Vauntes come up big time and time again, but to have
12 of the final 15 points in that stretch, what can you say about that
performance?  
COACH THOMPSON III: We needed it. They cameand jumped out‑‑ when they jumped
out to their lead, we had to make plays. They're one of these teams‑‑ this
league, I said it all year, most of the coaches have said it all year: Someone
has to be Number 1. Someone has to be No.10. But there's not much difference.
Maybe Nova is a little different, but everyone else, there's not much
difference.  
Forget looking at numbers. You have to play, and you have to play well to win
every night. They came out, and they played with a sense of purpose, and their
execution‑‑ I thought Creighton's execution was at a high level today.  
So we got to the point where we needed someone to step up. You've heard me say
all year, when we need baskets, everyone knows who we're going to‑‑ one of
these two, and it's usually him. So he answered today.  
  
Q. What was Creighton doing defensively that bothered you a little bit? Shot
just 38 percent today.  
COACH THOMPSON III: They do a good job. They were focused. They were extremely
aggressive with how they played, and it was effective. It was effective. Then
you get to thinking about that, and we get a few shots that we normally make
that we didn't take, and then it's tight. But it was caused by their
communication and their aggressiveness.  
  
Q. Coach, a sense of relief, or does this kind of tight game give you reason
for optimism or anything like that moving ahead?  
COACH THOMPSON III: Can it be both?  
  
Q. Sure.  
COACH THOMPSON III: To get the first win is a sense of relief, but we are
optimistic going forward. So now we have to watch this game and go and play a
very good team, whichever one wins tomorrow.  
  
Q. This is for Josh: Your patience and your poise tonight in the box because
they really wanted to beat you up in the lane. Talk about that.  
COACH THOMPSON III: They wanted to what?  
  
Q. They wanted to be kind of physical with him tonight.  
COACH THOMPSON III: What did you say the first time?  
  
Q. Beat him up.  
JOSHUA SMITH: I was trying to be patient. I had three turnovers. That was on
me. Going into the game, we knew they were going to double‑team, and I was
just trying to find my teammates.  
  
Q. D'Vauntes, that three ‑pointer you hit with about five minutes to play,
what was your thought process on that when you hit him with the hesitation
move? Were you always going to shoot it? Or did you think you might take it to
the floor? What was your thought process?   
D'VAUNTES SMITH‑RIVERA: At that point, they were on the run. I really just
wanted to make a play, and the guys were looking for me to make something
happen. At that point, that's what I wanted to do.  
  
Q. D'Vauntes, can you talk about you beating these guys by a combined 42
points in the previous two, were you surprised what you saw out of them today?
What did they do differently?  
D'VAUNTES SMITH‑RIVERA: Not at all. They played a lot faster today. Their
transition was really well, and they were really physical. I knew today, we
beat them two times physically, so third time‑‑ it's hard to beat anybody
three times in a year. We knew they were going to come out tough. They
definitely earned somewhat of a respect.  
  
Q. D'Vauntes, Milliken had 17 points, had the four ‑point play, hadn't
missed a shot the first 20‑something minutes. I don't think he scored, though,
after that. What was the key for you guys ultimately to figure out how to slow
them down?   
D'VAUNTES SMITH‑RIVERA: Just communicating, talking on defense. I know we lost
him a few times, but he got a few good looks at the basket. He's a good
player. He's going to make shots. We let him get off early, and I know that's
what he continued to do.  
  
Q. Coach, talk to us about your decision to go zone late. Your guys really
executed in an outstanding manner, your call to switch to zone. They really
had trouble getting looks when you went zone.  
COACH THOMPSON III: They were getting too many easy looks against our
man‑to‑man, and they were putting us in difficult situations. So usually, I
guess conventional wisdom says, when you can play against a team who shoots
like they do, you don't go zone, but we did today, and it worked. It was to
our benefit.  
  
Q. D'Vauntes, Coach mentioned a sense of relief getting the first win with
the way things have gone in previous postseasons. Do you feel the same way,
especially when you guys are down six early?  
D'VAUNTES SMITH‑RIVERA: For sure0. Last year we went down the first game to
DePaul. We watched yesterday, and we didn't know who we were going to play. At
that point, that game kind of played over and over again in our head.
Creighton ended up winning, and we knew it would be tough against them, also.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 12, 2015

  

### [Rick Kreklow](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28563)

### [Greg McDermott](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15827)

### [James Milliken](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28511)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

Georgetown  60  
Creighton - 55

  
COACH McDERMOTT: Obviously, it goes without saying we're extremely
disappointed. I felt like, in a lot of ways, we outplayed Georgetown tonight.
Then in the last three minutes, they made some plays, and we didn't.  
But for us, the way we're built, to have four more field goals and outrebound
them by three, that's a recipe for success for us. And for most of the game it
was.  
Smith‑Rivera, obviously, made some big plays right before halftime and then
made some big plays late in the game, and then we had some costly turnovers
that you can't have against a team that's the quality of Georgetown.  
Give them a lot of credit. They went to the free‑throw line, and they made
their free throws. Obviously, they shot a bunch of them. They're a good
basketball team, and Smith‑Rivera played like the all‑league player that he
is.  
  
Q. Both players, can you talk a little bit about Georgetown's zone late in
the game and how much problems that caused you guys.  
RICK KREKLOW: What we were trying to do is really exploit how open that zone
can be there at the free‑throw line. I think, to a point, we did a pretty good
job getting it there. We had some good looks at three, there from those
kick‑outs in the zone and getting the ball there quick. We just didn't knock
down some in the last few minutes that would have definitely helped.  
They're a big team. They've got a lot of length. So when they're moving well
in that zone, there's really not a lot of gaps to penetrate. It gave us a few
problems.  
JAMES MILLIKEN: I feel, just like Ricky said, just trying to get the ball in
the middle and break down the zone. I felt like we did a pretty good job
getting it there. We just didn't make the plays at the end of the day.  
  
Q. James, can you talk about the play toward the end when you were looking
to drive, make the pass, and threw it away at the end.  
JAMES MILLIKEN: Yeah, Coach had told me to attack, and they opened the gap for
me, and I attacked it, and I saw Austin at the last minute. I thought he was
going to flare out to the corner. So I just misled him.  
  
Q. James, obviously, you had a lot of your points in the first half and the
start of the second half. What did they do to neutralize what you were trying
to do?  
JAMES MILLIKEN: They did a pretty good job denying me. As far as our plays
were coming off of down screens and ball screens. They did a pretty good job
of denying that and making me change up my change of pace and stuff. I felt
like they just adjusted pretty good the second half.  
  
Q. Do you feel that the game slipped away from you? You had a six ‑point
lead with a little over five minutes to go.   
RICK KREKLOW: There were a few plays there at the end that we weren't able to
convert. As Coach said, we had a few turnovers there in the last few minutes.
That doesn't help.  
But Georgetown hit some good shots there at the end. They put themselves in
position there with a few minutes left to win the game. We had our chances,
and they had theirs. Unfortunately, tonight we weren't able to hit the shots
that we had or just let a pass or two get away from us.  
  
Q. Coach, as tough as this loss is, do you still see it as a successful
stand in the tournament? You won last night and gave Georgetown a good run
tonight.  
COACH McDERMOTT: Yeah. Like I told the team in the locker room, since the 0‑8
start, we've gone 5‑7 in league play, including the tournament. Probably we're
about eight possessions from being 10‑2 or 9‑3 in that stretch because of the
close games we lost.  
Through the first 15 minutes of the second half, we held Georgetown to 14
points. So defensively, we were doing the things we had to do.  
There's teams across the country where, when you get off to a start like we
got off to, that they just crumble from within their locker room. And the
seven seniors I have on my team didn't allow that to happen. I think every
coach aspires to have his team playing their best basketball in March. I'm not
sure that that happens very often, but with our program it happened.  
Even through the adverse start that we had, our guys continued to practice
with a great attitude, with great energy, and they committed themselves to
getting better individually and collectively. As a result, we were a tough out
down the stretch.  
So I'm disappointed that we're not playing tomorrow because we split with
Xavier. We lost two last‑second games to Butler, and we just lost to Villanova
by four the other night. So I was confident anything could happen, but
Georgetown was good.  
I couldn't be prouder of my team. These seniors have been a pleasure to coach.
They protected the culture of our program at a time where it was very, very
difficult to protect the culture because oftentimes, when adversity hits like
that and you start as poorly as we started, guys just start thinking of
themselves. The season isn't going to be what we thought, so just worry about
me. To our guys' credit, they realized they were part of something bigger than
that, and they moved this program forward.  
I think their legacy is they got better, they continued to work, and they
protected the culture of our program. That's really important.  
  
Q. Coach, what kind of effect does Josh Smith have on your offense when he's
out there on the floor?  
COACH McDERMOTT: He's so big and so strong. His impact is when you're trying
to defend him, I think, is where the problem lies because he takes up so much
space, and he's got‑‑ he's big and strong, and he's got a soft touch, but he's
got unbelievable hands. Anything that's close, Josh corrals. And everything he
throws up on the rim is soft.  
We tried coming at him with some double‑teams at different points in the game.
We forced a turnover one time, but he usually makes you pay for that. We just
didn't feel we could keep him off balance. We had one big guy foul out and
another one with four fouls. So trying to guard him makes it tough.  
  
Q. More for the players, Coach just talked about it in the previous answer,
but he talked about the culture and how tough is it to maintain that culture
of the program through some of the tougher losses that you guys have had.  
RICK KREKLOW: I mean, to lose kind of eight games in a row like we did at the
beginning of the Big East, after we had a pretty successful run up until the
Big East started, it's tough. You've got a lot of guys who had been on this
team the past three or four years that have been incredibly successful.  
And it's a pretty big adjustment to make when you have to deal with having a
few losses there on last‑second threes or a missed box‑out or free throws or
the drive at the buzzer‑‑ I mean, to kind of have the lead there going into
the last possession and to have teams make good plays, I mean, to beat you,
it's tough.  
But I'm really proud of the guys on this team and the coaching staff who show
up every day. I mean, despite those kind of losses, which can really just be
demoralizing. To be able to have the short‑term memory to put that behind and
you focus on the task at hand for the next game. It's really tough to do, and
this team was able to do that.  
It's definitely been something, with the help of the seniors and a lot of the
upper‑classmen here, to kind of protect the team‑first mentality and to not
let guys give up or give in, which would have been real easy to do, and the
season would have ended in a much different way. I'm really proud of the team
for being able to do that.  
  
Q. Rick, as a guy who's not going to be back next year, what have you seen
out of the younger guys that would give you hope that better days are ahead
for this group?  
RICK KREKLOW: We've got a lot of young guys that are very talented, a lot of
potential. Some guys need to work in the off‑season with putting some weight
on, but that's something, if they work at, they can do. We've got a few
transfers we had sitting out this year that are going to be great basketball
players. They already are. It would have really been beneficial for us to have
them this year as well.  
You've got a lot of talent coming up, and the more important thing, you've got
a lot of right guys in the program coming up.  
This program is all about protecting the culture, and Coach has said that.
You've got a lot of the talented guys that have that team‑first mentality that
are going to be playing next year, and it's going to be real exciting to
follow that team. Hopefully, they can learn from a lot of the shortcomings
that we've had this year, in terms of being able to close those games out, and
protect the leads there in the last possessions, in the last few minutes. I
really feel like that's a team that can really put a special season together.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 12, 2015

  

### [Josh Hart](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26656)

### [Darrun Hilliard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26866)

### [Jay Wright](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13690)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

Villanova  84  
Marquette - 49

  
COACH WRIGHT: Good start for us. Obviously, good start to the game. Marquette
played zone, which was very effective last night against Seton Hall and a good
shooting Seton Hall team, and we just came out and we just made threes
consecutively early. I thought that set the tone for the game.  
If you're playing zone and a team comes out and starts hitting threes like
that, it makes it tough. Then they had to switch to man‑to‑man. And after
playing last night, I don't think they want to be chasing us around
man‑to‑man.  
I think that was probably the two keys, the fact they played late last night,
and the fact we hit threes early against the zone.  
  
Q. Jay, did last year's early exit, have you thought about that going into
this tournament?  
COACH WRIGHT: We tried not to talk about it. We really tried to focus on just
"be here now." We have the saying "be here now." Whatever's in front of us.
But there's no doubt it's in the back of your mind. We didn't talk about it.  
I just think the experience of that is a part of these guys now. So I think
they came really, really focused and ready for anything.  
  
Q. One guy we don't really talk about, Kris Jenkins, he comes in, and they
cut it to 15 or so. And the ability to have a guy like that who comes in and
hits three straight threes like that. How has his attitude been like that with
the minutes, and what kind of weapon is he?  
COACH WRIGHT: He's an incredible weapon. He's an outstanding three‑point
shooter, but more than that, he's really a smart player. He actually had two
turnovers early in the game that were good pass, good plays, and we didn't
execute them.  
I thought there was a play in the first half where he skipped it to Josh in
the corner, that was a big play to kind of separate us. He does a lot of
things for us. He can be a really good rebounder. He had four defensive
rebounds. But when he's hitting threes like that, that's really dangerous,
when that's your four man doing that.  
  
Q. Can you talk about your three ‑point shooting today, as you guys made 17
three‑pointers.   
COACH WRIGHT: We're a good shooting team. So when you have nights like that,
you're going to win most games. But when you're a shooting team, there's going
to be some nights where you don't make those shots, and you can't be afraid to
let them fly. You've got to be able to do other things when you're not making
shots.  
That's why I thought it was so important that we hit shots early against that
zone. Early in the first half, we took a lot of threes. If we're missing those
and they're getting out in transition, it's a different game. So when you make
them, it makes a big difference.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the 22 assists on 30 made baskets.  
COACH WRIGHT: We've done a good job of that all year. Our guys are very
unselfish. Darrun Hilliard is our leading scorer. We just talked to the team
about that. Darrun Hilliard starts the game off hitting two threes, and then
we ran six more plays for him, and he got six assists in the first half on
those plays.  
So a lot of times, when a guy gets it going, he feels like, oh, it's my night.
When your senior does that, your leading scorer, I think that sets the tone
for everybody.  
  
Q. Jay, it was 18 ‑8 and then 18‑16\. Right before 18‑16, Josh comes in. I
know this gets to be an old story for you after a while. Were you starting to
worry? What were your emotions as it went from 18‑8 to 18‑16?   
COACH WRIGHT: I think we called time‑out at 18‑16.  
  
Q. I think so.  
COACH WRIGHT: I was worried if I called a time‑out. We made some substitutions
there that probably weren't‑‑ we had a bad mixture out there on the court for
what they were doing. We didn't get some rebounds. They got some offensive
rebounds, some extra opportunities.  
Josh brings so much to us, not just his shooting, but offensive rebounding,
defensive energy guarding Carlino, getting steals, in transition. He's an
incredible scorer. When it was tight, he made an incredible one‑on‑three drive
to finish.  
So he's the perfect sixth man. Probably won't be a sixth man next year, but
he's the perfect sixth man in that he can come in to fill any spot, any
position, or any role, whatever you need at the time. You need shooting, you
need defense, you need rebounding.  
  
Q. Just a quick follow, so just to be funny about this, he makes 11 in a
row, and out he comes?  
COACH WRIGHT: Is that what he got, 11 in a row?  
  
Q. I think it was 11 in a row.  
COACH WRIGHT: He gets tired sometimes.  
  
Q. Jay, what were you trying to do with Carlino, and how would you rate that
as far as a defensive performance this season against the good scorer from the
other team?  
COACH WRIGHT: That was definitely one of our best. You've seen them all. He's
so‑‑ he's got the quickest release of anybody we've played against. Cotton was
like that last year for Providence. You can't let them catch it because, if
they catch it, they get it off before you can get to them, and they're great
shooters.  
I just thought we did‑‑ especially the first half. We did a great job in the
first half. In the second half, you notice the first five or six possessions,
they got him looks like four straight times. They made very good adjustments.
He made one, but it was only a two, and then the others, one went in and out.
I just thought we rushed him and kept enough people on him, and we switched
out on him.  
So it was really good execution by our guys.  
  
Q. Jay, when you look at your coaching career, where does this team rank
defensively? Out of all the teams that you've had.  
COACH WRIGHT: Not as good as I'd like it to be, really. Today was good. Today
was good. We haven't been consistently this good defensively. We can be.
That's what we're trying to do here at the end of the season is really be‑‑
this team is not one of our better defensive teams. It's really not. It's
good, but we can be a lot better.  
  
Q. Coach, as you alluded to, Marquette did play last night. Does that help
you in maybe conserving your energy for the next two games.  
COACH WRIGHT: I think our depth helps us in this situation. When a team plays
the night before and then get off to a great‑‑ I'm repeating myself, but when
they get off to a good start, that adrenaline can keep you going, and then
playing the night before doesn't affect you.  
But us coming out and hitting those threes early, getting some stops early,
and kind of jumping on them, then your fatigue, you've got to chase, it starts
to wear on you.  
  
Q. Jay, as the weeks have rolled on here and the wins have rolled on, how
much time have you spent talking to the kids about not getting ahead of this
thing and to keep it all in perspective?  
COACH WRIGHT: I think that's the best thing we've done so far is these guys
have been able to stay focused on the next game, and that's always the
challenge when you're winning. When you lose, it's easy to focus on the next
game because you just can't wait. I think when we lost to Georgetown this
year, I think we had a week until our next game; we were dying. We just wanted
to go play somebody. That's easy.  
It's when you keep winning that you've got to stay focused on your scouting
report. You've got to stay focused on the details. I think this team has done
a very good job.  
  
Q. This is kind of a backward question, but you're used to those: Is this
kind of game okay with you in that the things you do well you were able to do
today, and the Big East Tournament is usually all about surviving when you're
not doing the things that you do well. In other words, find those secondary
ways of getting it done. I mean, not that there wasn't adversity today.  
COACH WRIGHT: I think it's a good way to start. It's a good way to start. If
you're coming off a game‑‑ you know, last year in the game against Seton Hall,
we actually took the lead with eight seconds to go, and it's one of the games
where you would look back and say, guys, we found a way, but we've got to make
improvements in all these areas.  
I like it better this way, where we did a good job defensively. We can go back
and look and prepare for whoever we play. Guys are feeling good. They're
making shots in this arena. They feel good about it. I like it that way.  
  
Q. Josh, take us through that sequence where you hit those 11 straight. What
was going through your head, and what were you feeling?  
JOSH HART: I just felt confidence. Darrun was finding me when I was open. Ryan
found me. Kris found me. And then when those guys just find you when you're
wide open, after like the first couple, you just get in a rhythm, get a
confidence, and my teammates did a great job finding me.  
I really wasn't thinking. I was just shooting.  
  
Q. Coach, there's been a lot of talk, obviously, about a 1 seed and maybe
having to win here to secure that. That's something you care about or not care
about?  
COACH WRIGHT: Really don't care about. Winning the Big East Tournament would
be‑‑ to me‑‑ I'm a little different this way, but to me, it would be far more
rewarding than getting a 1 seed. I just think there's a lot more to that than
getting a 1 seed.  
A 2 seed's good, too. We've been in both spots and had success in both spots.
I think we've had trouble in both spots, too.  
That really doesn't bother me. It does not affect our thinking at all. But
winning the Big East Tournament affects our thinking a lot.  
  
Q. Both players, we asked the Coach this, but what were your thoughts about
last year and wiping that out? When you came in today, what were you thinking
about last year?  
JOSH HART: We just try not to think about. Obviously, that happened. We let
the past be the past. We can't take that back. We just knew we're going to
have to come in with our captains, and then with the great group of guys we
have in the locker room, we just went out and played as hard as we can and let
everything else take care of itself.  
We knew not to focus on that and just focus on what's ahead of us.  
DARRUN HILLIARD: Same thing. We can't control what happened in the past. We
can only control what happens now, and I think we came out with great energy
and a great attitude. That's the only thing we can control.  
As far as last year, it's over, and we just focus on this year.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 12, 2015

  

### [Dee Davis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16908)

### [Chris Mack](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20746)

### [Matt Stainbrook](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26765)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  
Xavier - 67  
Butler - 61  
  
COACH MACK: It seems like every time we play Butler here over the last five or
six years, they're just gritty games. We didn't get off to a really good start
either the first or second half. I thought our team responded with the
resiliency that at times maybe we haven't had, but certainly we've had over
the last month of the season.  
I've told these guys that everybody's been talking about the Butler‑Georgetown
matchup in the semifinals, and that was a little disrespectful because they
have to play us first. Then you can deal with the semifinal matchup.  
Our guys are competitors. We felt like, if we played at our best, that we
would advance. That's exactly what we did. These guys played really tough.  
We've got a quick turnaround to play one of the best teams in the country in
Georgetown, and it will be a challenge.  
  
Q. Coach, with about 2:30 left, Trevon made that three ‑pointer that tied up
the game. What was the difference for you guys from that point and into
overtime on to be able to get the win?   
COACH MACK: Honestly, there's so many big plays on both ends of the floor for
both teams. It's hard to pinpoint one. That one certainly gave our team a lot
of confidence.  
We just kept chipping away, chipping away, but we could never tie it up. We
were always down one, down two. At that point, we felt like it was a new game,
obviously.  
From there, like I said before, players made some big time plays both at the
end of regulation and overtime.  
  
Q. Chris, Jalen's playing with foul trouble yet stayed so aggressive in
overtime. What do you make of the way he finished up this game as well?  
COACH MACK: We played the way we know he's capable of. Jalen is one of the
toughest matchups in the conference when he's playing with a lot of
confidence. He's strong. He's very confident himself. He's an excellent
finisher.  
I thought our guards did a tremendous job of feeding both Matt and Jalen down
the stretch in the post where I thought we had an advantage.  
  
Q. Chris, what was the advantage of starting J.P. both halves?  
COACH MACK: Not necessarily an advantage, but we just‑‑ that's who we started.
Sorry for the vague answer.  
  
Q. Matt, can you just talk about coming into this rubber match game. You
know them very, very well. So did they throw anything different at you tonight
that you didn't see the first two games?  
MATT STAINBROOK: Not necessarily. We tried to maybe change up our defense a
little bit. I think we had me on Kam Woods a little bit more and sort of put
Tre and other guys on Chrabascz.  
Other than that, we scouted them really well. We knew their stuff. We just
wanted to make sure we didn't get out‑toughed.  
  
Q. Coach, looking at tomorrow, what do you see in Georgetown that really
stands out to you that you've seen over the year? You guys have already beat
them twice this season.  
COACH MACK: Those matchups have nothing to do with tomorrow night. I see an
excellent team. I see a team that's very athletic, really big around the
basket. A little different than Butler in the sense they've got great size in
the frontcourt. They match our size extremely well.  
They have a potent scorer, one of the best in the conference in D'Vauntes
Smith‑Rivera, we know very well. Their freshmen have become sophomores.  
Coach Thompson does an incredible job with their style of play. They make you
guard for the entire shot clock. We have to be at our best to win tomorrow
night.  
  
Q. Dee, can you talk me through that sequence to start overtime where you
made that layup and then were fouled. How big was that for you guys heading
into the overtime period?  
DEE DAVIS: Well, I think we were taking the ball out, and Coach told me we had
11 seconds left, and we need to get a shot up. When I couldn't get the ball to
Matt in the post, I took advantage of the matchup I had with Kellen Dunham and
went to the cup. I was trying to make a play for my team and I think it gave
us a lot of energy.  
  
Q. Talk about your ability to come back. You got behind early, got the lead
at halftime, fell behind in the middle, and then bounced back again.  
MATT STAINBROOK: I think our team is resilient. We didn't get too high with
the highs and low with the lows. They're going to make our runs, and we're
going to make our runs. I think we did a good job of every media time‑out,
hey, we're still in this one. We've got to keep fighting and pushing. Nothing
is going to take us out except for ourselves. I think our team was really
resilient.  
  
Q. Matt, at the end of regulation it looked like you were vocal in the
huddle. Were you asking for a play there? What was the plan when you got
pulled?  
MATT STAINBROOK: I got denied the play.  
COACH MACK: This guy is drawing up plays on the clipboard.  
MATT STAINBROOK: I've got a go‑to play.  
COACH MACK: That we didn't go to.  
MATT STAINBROOK: Just wait. When we need it and when it happens, I'm taking
credit for it. That's all I know.  
COACH MACK: Honestly, that last play, Dee made a really good read and threw it
to Matt. Hindsight 20/20, I should have flipped Alex Barlow's man to the other
side of the floor because that dude gets his hands on every basketball. He has
the best set of hands in the country, it seems like. Did a really good job of
being able to rake the ball and get a jump ball. But these guys did a great
job of being resilient, like Matt said, in overtime.  
  
Q. Roosevelt Jones scored less points than in any other game. Did you guys
do anything differently?  
COACH MACK: I think our guys paid great attention to detail. He's always
trying to the corner. He circles up on penetration, and if you lose vision on
him, now he has an angle to the basket. Our team presents maybe size he
doesn't necessarily see in practice. We just want him to score over, whether
it's his matchup or the size inside. I thought we did that flawlessly tonight.
That's one of the reasons he didn't necessarily hurt us with his point total.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 12, 2015

  

### [Ed Cooley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23287)

### [Kris Dunn](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28533)

### [LaDontae Henton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26672)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

Providence - 74  
St. Johns - 57

  
COACH COOLEY: We knew we were coming in to basically play in a road game. We
just had the white uniforms on because of our seed. Played against a team that
really played well against us for two games. We felt the first two times we
played them we didn't play with an incredible sense of purpose or attention to
detail.  
I thought today was one of our better games we played. I think St. John's is
playing as well as anybody in our league, maybe in the country. So for us to
come in and play as well as we did, I'm really proud of our guys, our
scouting, I'm proud of their tenacity. This was one of our better defensive
games we've had all year, and it's really a credit to the players, following
the scout report and being relentless on offense.  
These two guys‑‑ I thought two really silent assassins today, the entire
night, with Tyler Harris and Ben. I thought those two guys were terrific, and
you know, when you got two guys like this, with LaDontae and Kris, they're
able to get you over the hump, if it does get close.  
Great team win. We're excited to play tomorrow. We know we're playing a
juggernaut. I'm pretty sure no one in this room is giving us a chance. We've
been in this position before. We're going to do everything we can to continue
to advance.  
  
Q. Coach, your team had three players with double ‑doubles. Talk about how
well rounded they are.   
COACH COOLEY: You know, the guys, in particular LaDontae and Tyler, they've
been here before, same exact game, same exact time, same exact bench. The
conversation was, hey, we've been here before. This team has beaten us twice.
We're playing for some pride. We're playing to get to Friday night. There's no
better place in the world to play Friday night than in this building.  
  
Q. Coach, could you talk about the two players with you. You said they get
you over that hump.  
COACH COOLEY: I love these guys. These guys, I've seen them grow so much. You
guys get to see them grow as basketball players. I get to see them grow as
men. I get to see them grow as students.  
These guys, again, when they play well, we're a tough out. If they struggle,
we're going to struggle. I think everybody understands that.  
LaDontae kind of does his thing. He's a junkyard dog, and he can do it a lot
of different ways. Kris is a maestro and a really hard‑to‑guard type of point
guard.  
  
Q. Could you just talk about your start, going down 7 ‑0 and then ripping
off 18 in a row.   
COACH COOLEY: You never want to come out like that, but the game's long.
You're not going to‑‑ you can't overreact because people come out and kind of
hit you a little bit. Our team settled in. I thought, once we settled in, we
controlled the entire game.  
I thought our defense controlled the game, not so much our offense.  
  
Q. Kris, during that 18 ‑0 run, they missed 15 straight shots. What did you
guys do to take them out defensively and to keep them out of transition?   
KRIS DUNN: We took the shots on offense that helped us with defensive
transition. We made a lot of good buckets. Everybody was swinging the ball.
Everybody contributed in the game. So I think that's what helped us on
defense.  
  
Q. Your thoughts about playing Villanova tomorrow night?  
COACH COOLEY: They're a very good basketball team. One of the best, if not the
best, in the country. I don't think Villanova has gotten the respect they
deserve on a national scale.  
I'll put our league against any league in America when we're looking at the
Big East from top to bottom. We know what we're up against. We've seen them
play. We've played against them a couple of times. We've got to make a couple
of adjustments, if we can. We can't let them loose in transition and threes.
They're very, very talented, but they've got to guard somebody on the other
end as well.  
  
Q. By this point of the season, for anybody up there, at this point of the
season, whether it's Villanova in particular or some of the top teams you may
face this postseason, how ready does this team feel to play at that kind of
level?  
LaDONTAE HENTON: We feel like we can play with anybody. We know it's not going
to be easy. It's going to be a tough matchup. Villanova matches up well with
us. So we've just got to be prepared mentally for them.  
  
Q. Kris, you were hurt last year, as Providence made this run here last
year. Now you're obviously playing. How frustrating was it to watch this last
year and how excited are you to get this going now?  
KRIS DUNN: It wasn't more frustrating.  
I think it was a learning experience for me. What we did last year was
amazing. Bryce Cotton and Kadeem, they led us last year and LaDontae. Carson
and Tyler, we still have the veterans now and are leading us now. It was a
good experience. I'm just excited to be here.  
  
Q. LaDontae, talk to us about rebounding. Those of us who have seen you guys
play know you have developed that MO as being one of the best rebounding teams
in the county, particularly on the offensive glass.  
You had 18 offensive rebounds, 49 total. Talk about that.  
LaDONTAE HENTON: The coaching staff does a great job of making sure we're
mentally ready for the battles down low and making sure everybody knows what
they've got to do. A lot of people's roles on this team is rebounding at a
high level, and we were able to do that tonight.  
  
Q. Was the plan to just try to make them play at half ‑court? They struggled
there. Was that part of what you wanted to do today.   
COACH COOLEY: I think any time you play against a transition team, you want to
try to get them to play against a set defense. It's really hard to score
against set defenses.  
I don't know how many points we scored in transition today, but if the floor's
really spread open and you get the athletes that are in our league, you can
get to the basket and score. If you kind of make them play against a set
defense‑‑ you can't let St. John's lose. You let them lose, especially in this
building, you're in trouble.  
  
Q. Either of the players: Down the stretch, you guys really sort of had your
hands on the ball on almost every possession, every score. Is that time that
you really like it or you want it? Can you just talk a little bit about
that.  
LaDONTAE HENTON: The leaders on the team was just telling everybody to lock
in. Right now is when we battle, the last four minutes, or four minutes at a
time. We just wanted to = lock in and make sure we get every loose ball and
every rebound.  
  
Q. For Ed and LaDontae: Your attention to detail, like you refer to, I
assume that means the three ‑point shot. I think they only had one the first
set. Villanova set, I think, a record in the first game.   
COACH COOLEY: That's been‑‑ this truthfully has been one of the worst teams
that I've coached, so that's on me, of our three‑point field goal defense.
We've had three or four games where teams have gotten 10, 11, 13 threes. If
teams are making threes on you, you've got no chance.  
I'd rather take a tough two‑‑ even a two at the basket versus threes. Threes
motivate people. They get you excited. They're like dunks. And tomorrow we've
got to play a team that is probably averaging 12 or 13 threes a game coming
down the stretch right now. So they're playing at a really high level.  
We've got our work cut out tomorrow. Hopefully, we can get some rest tonight.
Again, a very, very dangerous team. We have to be super, super detailed
tomorrow in order for us to advance to try to get to Saturday night.  
  
Q. Coach, the run you guys made for the tournament championship here last
year, has that made this a more confident run this time of year?  
COACH COOLEY: Are we more confident? I think LaDontae, Tyler, and Carson have
done a good job of talking to the other players. Kris was on the bench and
probably the best cheerleader on the bench last year. At least our guys have
had a feeling of being in the building. Many guys didn't play, but some guys
were on the bench and at least got the feel of what it is.  
We're excited about tomorrow. I'm proud of our leadership. But we still hope‑‑
I'm hoping I'm having this interview as happy as I am right now tomorrow night
around 9:00.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 12, 2015

  

### [Jamal Branch](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28534)

### [Phil Greene, IV](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24963)

### [Steve Lavin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21860)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

Providence - 74  
St. Johns - 57

  
COACH LAVIN: Obviously, we're disappointed with the results today and didn't
feel that our aggressiveness‑‑ our aggressive was not the level it's been when
we've had success this year, and the best indication of that is rebounding.
Providence was plus 13 on the glass, and they beat us to the punch, not only
on the boards, but for some 50‑50 balls and really established the tone early.  
We got out to a 7‑0 lead. They went on a run, and we tried to get it under 10,
but for the most part, after that 7‑0 lead we had, the run that they went on,
we never really in contention. A couple of possessions there maybe we would
have had a chance if we came up with a rebound, to get it back under 10 if
we'd been able to convert.  
As a group, we are disappointed with the result today. Now we've got to get
ready for our next game.  
  
Q. Steve, Rysheed has started every game since January 31st. Why not
today?  
COACH LAVIN: Sure, this older group, and Jamal has been playing so well coming
off the best game of his career against Georgetown. Also, we look at the
practice that week. There's so many elements to go into, as our players know,
what determines a starter. There's just a myriad of elements that go into
determining, from game to game, who's going to start.  
So practice is part of it, and then also where a player is in terms of
experience and just‑‑ Jamal was someone that played well today for us.  
  
Q. Steve, you guys had looked so good leading up to this last weekend and
these last two games. How concerned are you about the way the team's played?  
COACH LAVIN: I just shared with the team that it's one of the advantages‑‑ and
it's important that they know this because they sometimes don't have the
context that a coach has that's been in the business for a long period of
time.  
Last week we were just down two key players, Branch, who was playing the best
basketball of his career, and our next game against Georgetown, didn't play.
And obviously Chris Obekpa, who's a central part of everything we do.  
Obviously, Villanova has 30 wins. They're not losing to anybody. Last week I
felt it was more of a few of our key players, two of our six‑man rotation were
out, and we're playing a great team on the road.  
Today we're just disappointed as a group with our performance because we
didn't feel that we brought the aggressiveness. I thought we were tentative‑‑
you know, tentative, hesitant. There's a lid on the rim, but sometimes that
comes from the nerves of the postseason. There are going to be days when your
offense just is not clicking. You can't buy a bucket. We call it being in the
desert or in the midst of a drought. But the disappointing part collectively
was aggression level on defense and our rebounding is where I thought
Providence really beat us to the punch.  
The points in the paint, the second shots, the 50‑50 balls. So we're
disappointed with it, but at the same time, I explained to them I probably had
four or five teams that lost their first game in the conference tournament or
their last regular season game, and then went on a run in the NCAA.  
You also can't get carried away. You've got to get ready and address the
deficiencies and turn the focus to improving as a team, and that enhances the
chances of doing something special in the postseason.  
So not concerned to the point where I don't think this team is still capable
of doing something special.  
  
Q. Steve, just to follow on that, I assume you're confident you're in the
tournament, and it looks like you would have a week off. Since you guys are
banged up, is that almost good to get some rest for these guys?  
COACH LAVIN: We'd rather win the Big East Conference Tournament and be cutting
down the nets on Saturday night here in New York, but given that we got
knocked out and Providence played a hell of a game, deserves to advance, now
we need to take this time and take advantage of it in preparation for the
postseason.  
  
Q. For Phil, was there a lot of self ‑imposed pressure, do you think, on the
seniors? And you guys felt, because you wanted this game, it really seemed
like you weren't ourselves tonight?   
PHIL GREEN IV: It may have seemed like it. Like Coach said, we wasn't
aggressive. We were tentative. If anything, we let our offense bleed into our
defense, and we can't win games like that. When we get stops and rebounds, it
would be a totally different game, but we were just not aggressive.  
  
Q. Usually, when you guys have gone through droughts or fallen behind,
there's been some grit that you guys have gone back in the game, sometimes
come back and won it. Where was that today?  
JAMAL BRANCH: I mean, we tried a couple stretches, but we couldn't buy a
basket. We were shooting 26 percent in the first half, and they were shooting
46 percent. We had no points in transition, and that's pretty much our game.
We like to play in transition and get the easy buckets, but we didn't have no
transition points in the first half.  
They capitalized on the turnovers and all the missed shots.  
  
Q. Steve, I know Rysheed returned. What did he relay to you about his wrist?
Is that something that's going to linger going forward?  
COACH LAVIN: No. We'll get more information this evening, and I think we're
cautionary they either are currently examining it or they're going to examine
it in terms of the team doctors.  
But he was able to play in the second half‑‑ not that that's always an
accurate indication, but hopefully that's a sign that it wasn't so
debilitating that it's going to knock him out of being able to play moving
forward.  
  
Q. Phil, when you guys are going through a stretch like you did in the first
half where they're scoring 18 straight, you're 0 for 15, what's going through
your mind?  
PHIL GREEN IV: Just get a stop. Get a stop, shut out. Like I said, our defense
fuels our offense. When we get stops and rebound the ball, it changes the
whole complexion of the game. But since we couldn't get a stop, they just kept
it going.  
So they capitalized on it, and they played a good game.  
  
Q. Steve, your seniors have done a lot of good, but they're going to finish
their career without a Big East Tournament victory. Why has these guys not
been able to put it together in this tournament?  
COACH LAVIN: I don't think it's them. I'm just a poor Big East‑‑ I'm a poor
conference tournament coach. We didn't have one at UCLA either. I know we lost
at Cal. I was talking to Rico about it. Rico has participated in some form or
fashion in every NCAA Tournament appearance we've had as a player or a coach,
except for one. I think he missed in '96/'97.  
What I shared with them is we lost at Washington on a final. Washington was
like a last place team, and some guy banked in a three‑pointer from 30. It was
Fred Brown's son, I think. Maybe even fouled him. It was like a four‑point
play close to the buzzer. We lost in that game, but then we went on a run to
the Elite Eight or Sweet 16.  
I know we lost to Cal in a game where we laid a complete egg, similar to this
game, at Staples. We lost to a Cal Bear team who just played horrific, and
next week we were beating the Number 1 team in the country in Cincinnati or a
1 seed in Pittsburgh to go on to the Sweet 16 and play to go to the Final
Four.  
Probably the trend in the racing form is I don't think I've ever won a
conference tournament game as a coach in the Pac‑10 or the Big East. I don't
think it has anything to do with our players.  
  
Q. For Phil and Jamal, you guys said ‑‑ came out tentative. You came out
hesitant. You guys had been on such a run for the last few weeks where you
were very aggressive. You were driving and doing everything you need to win.
What's the difference from these last few weeks, where you guys were super
aggressive, to today?   
JAMAL BRANCH: I mean, it would have helped if we would have made some shots at
the beginning and right at the end. I think we need to get, like Phil said, we
need to get rebound and stops. They got easy points off transition. They did a
good job executing their plays and running their offense, and knocking down
shots. Something we didn't do.  
  
Q. Steve, Twitter says you beat Arizona in 2003.  
COACH LAVIN: That's right. Actually, we did get a win. So it was a couple
wins, but overall we struggled.  
  
Q. For Phil and Jamal, to follow up on the earlier question. I know your
senior group really wanted to get a Big East Tournament win, not to go oat in
your career without one. Now that you're unable to do that, how disappointing
is this that you're not going to have another chance? [Out, not oat]?  
PHIL GREEN IV: Very disappointed. Like you said, we wanted to get one. We're
going to focus on getting better. We've got to move on. The game is an open
house. So we've just got to get back to the drawing board.  
  
Q. Jamal, how much easier is this ‑‑ not that you want to lose, but how much
easier is this to take knowing that you're not really on the bubble anymore
and you didn't have to win this game.   
JAMAL BRANCH: Say that one more time?  
  
Q. How much easier is it to maybe stomach this loss knowing that you didn't
need to win to get into the tournament?  
JAMAL BRANCH: We'll see Sunday what happens, but good thing that it happened
today than if we make the tournament and it happens in the tournament.  
  
Q. I'm going to cheat by getting two by asking Phil and Steve the same
question. Phil first. The games aren't going to get any easier, and people
know that you guys are a great transition team. Can you guys score enough to
win if you can't get the fast break game going?  
PHIL GREEN IV: Of course I think so because we have a lot of good players. It
starts with our defense. The defense just helps out everything. That's why
we're going to get back to the drawing board, go back to practice, work some
things out. So next time we could play better.  
  
Q. What do you think, Steve?  
COACH LAVIN: Yeah, if you look at the scores, when we beat Xavier in a
grinder‑‑ I think it was 58‑57 or 57‑56\. We held them to the fewest points
they had all season long. Or even up at Syracuse. That was the game play in
the 50's. Kind of a grinder, methodical, kind of similar to the conditions you
face when you're in the NCAA Tournament.  
So we demonstrated the ability to score in the 80s and win games but also
score in the 50s. I agree with Phil. If you're not getting stops defensively,
you're taking the ball out of the net, then clearly you are playing uphill.  
Seton Hall is another one? Seton Hall is more of a game that's played at that
methodical, grinding pace.  
But we talk about the team. When you take the ball out of the net after free
throws or baskets, it does limit our ability to go on runs. What's interesting
is the theorys that we're an excellent transition team, but we actually are
eighth or ninth in the league if you look at the metrics and analytics, in
transition, we're one of the worst teams in the country. Just in terms of the
metrics.  
On the half‑court, we rate very well because we shoot the three‑pointer well.
We distribute the ball. We have so many interchangeable parts with the four
guards out there. But in transition, even though we still are going to push
the ball, the numbers, the percentages happens to be near the bottom of the
league.  
It's an interesting thing. I know that seems that counterintuitive to when you
watch us because we do some really special spectacular things in transition.
When we've been our best, we've had 20, 22 assists, 18, 19 assists, and
distributing the ball and really making those extra passes and executing with
precision on the half‑court.  
Because of that, Dom has been spectacular with dunks, the numbers appear to be
good in transition team. But we've talked about it as a team. We do not
convert well in transition. It's one of the poorest teams I've had in terms of
converting when playing at high speeds in transition. But we make some
electrifying plays that make SportsCenter, and then people think, wow, they're
a great transition team. But we really struggle in transition to work, and we
often throw the ball away because we're in a hurry playing too fast.  
We get on the half‑court and get ball reversal and play through the pain and
start sharing that thing and making that extra pass is when we shoot so well
from the three‑point line. 12, 24 at Marquette. The game at Syracuse, we shot
the ball extremely well from the three. All of our big wins, it's more
half‑court execution, shooting the three, balanced with an occasional
transition and getting to the foul line.  
We want to keep running. We think we have potential to be good transition, but
to this point in the year, we just haven't for some reason excelled in the
fast break. The metrics and analytics, we happen to be near the bottom of the
league.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 12, 2015

  

### [Alex Barlow](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25256)

### [Kellen Dunham](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28582)

### [Chris Holtmann](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28581)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

Xavier - 67  
Butler - 61

  
COACH HOLTMANN: Listen, I think that we've got to give Xavier credit. I think
they played physical, as we expected they would, and I thought it was a
physical, hard play game by both teams.  
We were hoping to be able to get to the free‑throw line, be a little bit more
efficient than what we were. That and our inability to take care of the ball
at the level that we've done for the most of the season, I think, really
affected us.  
But I thought both teams played really hard and played really physical. Give
Xavier credit. I thought they made enough plays down the stretch, particularly
getting to the foul line in overtime really hurt us.  
  
Q. It seems like Butler at time is contagious. In other words, great talent,
some of the play calls, defense unbelievable. The contagiousness is that, if
you hit free throws ‑‑ if you don't, like 10‑2 are up, 10‑7, 12‑7, Roosevelt
Jones hits the free throws at that stage. I don't know what the percentage was
at the end. 45 percent or something from the free‑throw line. I'm not looking
at the stats.   
COACH HOLTMANN: From the free‑throw line? Looks like it was 52 percent.  
  
Q. But the thing is because of Kellen hitting some shots. But the thing is
‑‑ and Alex as well. Alex started so strong with the three‑pointers that
really opened things up, and it looked like we were going to put Xavier on
their backs. Coach, what happens as far as the contagiousness as we move
forward towards the tournament, towards March Madness?   
COACH HOLTMANN: I'm not certain what you mean about the contagiousness, but I
will tell you that, I think, free‑throw shooting in general can be a
confidence thing, and I think it's about getting the right guys to the
free‑throw line‑‑ we would have loved to get Kellen there a little bit more.
We came off a game where we shot 20‑for‑20\.  
It was good to see Drew make a few, but for us we wanted to get there a little
more than we did. Obviously, we've got to do a better job of knocking them
down.  
When we've lost a couple of close games this season, a couple times it's been
because of free‑throw shooting.  
  
Q. Coach, what's it like to prepare for a team when you have so much
familiarity, as you do with Xavier? Did anything surprise you tonight about
anything they did?  
COACH HOLTMANN: No. I'm sure they would say the same. It's bone on bone. It's
a really physical‑‑ most teams, we know their calls. They know our calls. We
kind of know where they're going with the ball, and likewise.  
So it makes for a very physical, grinder of a game. We anticipated that, and,
again, I think that overtime was key with them able to get a couple and ones
and get to the free‑throw line more.  
But it's really‑‑ I think any time you play a team that has a lot of
familiarity with each other, it's bone on bone. It comes down to can you make
free throws? Can you take care of the ball a little bit better? Xavier did a
better job than us tonight.  
  
Q. Is this particularly disappointing given how much you led during the
game, both halves?  
COACH HOLTMANN: No, not necessarily. That's the nature of college basketball.
There's games of runs. Both of our games at Hinkle was a game of runs with
them as well.  
I don't think you ever look at it and say, hey, you're up nine or ten‑‑ teams
are too good to be able to kind of put it away, so we anticipated it was
probably going to come down to the last five minutes. We certainly would have
liked to have more quality possessions when we had the lead than what we did.  
Again, you have to give them some credit for making some plays.  
  
Q. Coach, you had two runs of scoring droughts in the second half that
really seemed to hurt you. Was that just your team missing shots and not
making it or just Xavier stepping up defense?  
COACH HOLTMANN: I'd have to go back and look at it. Was it lineups we had in
there or did we‑‑ I think we did a better job than we did in Game 2 of getting
a higher quality of look. Alex did a good job stepping up and shot a high
volume tonight, but we anticipated that he'd be open.  
Our team has had some droughts throughout this year offensively, but really
our mainstay has been our defense, and it let us down a little bit tonight.  
  
Q. Alex, you had a career high point total for you tonight. What was going
so right? On top of that, you were making hustle play after hustle play. How
do you think that kind of got the team in the game there?  
ALEX BARLOW: My teammates did a great job finding me. I kind of got in a
rhythm in the first half a bit. Obviously, I'd like to make a few more shots;
5‑of‑14 is not a great percentage.  
So I'll just work on that for the next game and make sure I knock them in.  
  
Q. Coach, after a long Big East season, it seemed like a grind just from
watching it, are you looking forward to getting out in the Tournament and
looking forward to competition?  
COACH HOLTMANN: I think most teams would tell you that, that they're looking
forward to playing somebody different in the Tournament because it gets to be
such a grind.  
We've had a tremendous, tremendous Big East season, to finish 12‑6 and tied
for second is a real credit to this group. We obviously would have liked to
stay here a little bit longer, but I know our guys are excited about next
week. They were excited about this week. I know they'll be excited about next
week. I'm sure they'll be excited to someone outside of Big East on the
ledger, but I know we're going to get a really, really good team.  
  
Q. You mentioned, when two teams are familiar with each other, it's bone on
bone. Could you talk a little bit about the rivalry between you guys.  
COACH HOLTMANN: People have said it's a rivalry. Obviously, the location makes
it unique. It's pretty close. We certainly recruit against each other. I think
there's a longstanding history of games between Butler and Xavier.  
It's always an intense, physical game, and we anticipated that. I know our
guys were excited to play this game, particularly after what happened at the
Cintas Center, and we wish we pulled it out.  
  
Q. Chris, you look at this group, and just the roll that they've been
through, and now the grand scheme of things, you're going to be an NCAA
Tournament team. What makes you think that, if you click, what's the key to
clicking? And what makes you think this team could do something here in the
NCAA Tournament?  
COACH HOLTMANN: I think we've shown throughout the year that we can play
really good basketball. These guys have shown it time and time again. They're
so impressive in their approach, their detailed approach.  
Listen, they know we've got to clean up a few things. Take care of the ball
better. It's really got to be about that. We've got to focus on things we need
to do and take from this game. Not going to put too much into it, but there's
some things we need to clean up and do better.  
Hopefully, that will prepare us for a really good team on Thursday or Friday.
So, again, these guys have earned the right throughout the year playing really
good basketball to enjoy next week.  
  
Q. Coach, talk about really good basketball and earning the right.
Obviously, that comes with hustle plays. Just talk about the hustle on this
team. How much does that mean to Barlow coming up with big steals at the end
of the game? How much does that kind of influence the team?  
COACH HOLTMANN: Well, he's terrific. Both these guys are terrific at that.
Listen, I think we know, if that's not us, we can be pretty average, and also
we can be pedestrian at times if we do not play with a real edge to how we
play. That has to be us.  
So if it's not us, then we won't‑‑ we certainly won't be who we are. I think,
when we've been good, we'll be able to make enough of those plays, and I
thought we played really hard tonight.  
  
Q. Kellen, you scored about as many points tonight as you did in the first
two games combined. Were you getting better looks tonight? Kind of what was
working well for you?  
KELLEN DUNHAM: A few times I was able to get my foul calls and get to the
free‑throw line. It's nice to see a few go in. I got the and‑one early, and
just to see a basket go in for me is good.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 11, 2015

  

### [Oliver Purnell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15064)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

Creighton78  
DePaul63

  
COACH PURNELL: I thought our guys came to play today and came to battle.
Unfortunately, the thing that's bothered most of the year, the rebounding
situation bothered us. As a result, they shot the ball slightly better than we
did, 48‑43, a bunch of those were second shots.  
I thought we got the score kind of tied, went up in the second half a little
bit, and I thought we were in a good position, but we couldn't sustain it. We
took a couple poor shots in the second half. I thought that deflated us
defensively a little bit. I thought we were doing a good job of defending the
ball screens until about 14 minutes to go in the game, and we could no longer
defend it well. We were kind of backing up into the basket and making them
take an in‑between shot and taking away their threes. We were doing a good job
with that.  
Then we started to come up a little bit and giving them shots at the basket,
and they finally knocked in a couple of threes that gave them a working
margin.  
I thought they played pretty good. They played pretty good. They stayed with
it. We just didn't play well enough for long enough. We didn't rebound the
basketball the way we needed to in order to beat them.  
Minimize the amount of shots that they get because they're a really good
shooting team.  
  
Q. Do you think that the guys were getting discouraged when they started to
go on that run? How do you feel like their mindset was?  
COACH PURNELL: I thought they battled right till the end. With about two or
three to go, they kind of recognized that they might not be able to get it,
even though we still had a little bit of a chance.  
They're down. They're down in the locker room, which I would expect them to
be.  
  
Q. With this being another losing season, why should fans want you back next
year?  
COACH PURNELL: I know why I want to come back, because I want to continue to
rebuild this program. We've made some progress. But at the same time, I'm just
like fans; I'm not satisfied. So I want to come back to finish the job. That's
the way I feel about it.  
  
Q. Coach, along those same lines, how do you feel about the season as a
whole? Considering it probably exceeded expectations in the tough Big East
this year.  
COACH PURNELL: I'm just not satisfied because we got off to a decent start in
the Big East. I would have liked to have finished strong. I would have liked
to have won more games. We had an opportunity to win a few more games. And
obviously, I'd like to be advancing tonight. So I'm not satisfied.  
  
Q. What would you want to improve on going into next season?  
COACH PURNELL: Defensively, we've got to be better, and that really centers
around our rebounding. I thought, for the most part, we guarded initially
pretty decently. But when you're getting outrebounded in double figures, it
makes it hard to win. When you're giving teams a lot more shots than you're
getting, it just makes it tough.  
So those are the two areas that jump out at me. We need a little bit more
size, which we think we've addressed in recruiting. We need a few more good
basketball players. We think we've addressed that as well. Got a commitment
from a kid up in this area today. Four coming in for next year. So we feel
pretty good about that.  
  
Q. Coach, they got to the line 30 times. Was their aggressiveness more match
‑up based or just something you guys weren't doing defensively?   
COACH PURNELL: Their style is to go to the basket or to get threes. Once we
started to take away their threes, they were going to the basket against our
bigs, and we weren't doing a good job in the second half of protecting the
rim. We were either letting them get all the way to the rim or fouled.  
  
Q. That was a good 10 seed that you guys played tonight, a good basketball
team. You've seen Georgetown. You've battled them and only lost by a few
points in both games. So how do you see tomorrow night's game between
Creighton and Georgetown?  
COACH PURNELL: It's the second ranked conference in the country. There are
only ten teams and they are all going to be good. Creighton's lost seven or
eight games by five points or less, including their last one. They're a good
team because they're hard to match up with. They shoot threes, and their
little guards drive it to the basket. They've got size so they can defend in
the interior.  
They are a good team, and they could certainly win that game. Georgetown's
been playing really, really well. But I expect it will be a close game.  
  
Q. Coach,s what the big picture outlook as you look ahead to DePaul
basketball? Is it the new building? Obviously, that's got to be a big lift.
But what do you think the program needs, bigger picture, to become a factor in
the conference?  
COACH PURNELL: Well, a number of things. We've got to keep getting better.
We've got six wins in the Big East this year, in the second ranked conference
in the country. We need to get more. We need to get better players. We're
starting to recruit guys from the Chicago area. We have eight guys from the
Chicagoland area, four from Chicago Public League.  
We want to keep getting more talented. We want to continue to build a winning
culture and guys understanding, on and off the floor, what to do. Leadership
of guys like Billy Garrett, those guys are getting older now and kind of
understand what to do.  
We've just got to keep getting better, better players. The new building is
very nice and something to point to and we can recruit to, which has been an
issue for us. So I'm thrilled about that. But there are a number of things
across the board that we've got to get better at‑‑ talent, experience, and a
lot of that has to do with recruiting.  
  
Q. You say that you're going to have the new building like in another two
years or so?  
COACH PURNELL: We haven't announced exactly when that will be done or when the
shovel is going into the ground, but it's going in there soon, I do know that.  
  
Q. Basically, that would be upgrading your facilities, obviously, would that
actually not help you recruit locally in the Chicago area, but nationwide as
well?  
COACH PURNELL: Facilities are important. It's an important motivator for
recruits; no question about that. So we're thrilled that's coming down the
line, and it's going to be a state‑of‑the‑art facility as good as any in the
country, and that will be a selling point for us.  
  
Q. You said you were not satisfied, but are you frustrated or disappointed
at all that you haven't had the success that you've had at other programs?  
COACH PURNELL: Not frustrated, disappointed that we aren't better right now
than we'd like to be, but that's been the case at every program I've been at
when we haven't been along as far as I'd like to be. Of course, that's winning
the championship.  
I'm disappointed. Not frustrated, but disappointed.

_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

Marquette - 78  
Seton Hall - 56

  
Q. Kevin, did you feel like your focus was there tonight?  
COACH WILLARD: I think the first couple shots they hit took a lot of wind out
of our sail. We've been getting off to tough starts. We get off to a tough
start, and we didn't just bounce back, to be honest with you.  
  
Q. Kevin, how can you summarize the path this team has taken and what's
happened over the last couple months?  
COACH WILLARD: I'm so proud of these guys. I'm so proud of the way they've
played all year, the effort they've given all year.  
Our tank was a little bit on empty the second half, but so proud of all those
kids in that locker room. I think that's what made it tough for me for them to
go through that and kind of end the year that way.  
You've got to give Marquette credit. I thought Carlino and Fischer, who played
terrific the last game against DePaul, played great.  
It's a tough way to end the year, but I can't say enough about those guys. The
amount of freshmen that played and the kind of stuff they've had to go
through, very proud of them.  
  
Q. The production out of (inaudible) is that part of it?  
COACH WILLARD: Yes. We became very fragile the second half of the year, and
that's what happened. When guys bank shots in on you a couple times, their
fight and their grit is still there. They're just not mentally able to get
over that hump. That's kind of what we fought the whole second half was we
just couldn't get over the hump when something went bad.  
  
Q. Coach, especially early on, it seemed like the perimeter defense was
struggling a little bit. What happened that they were getting so many open
looks?  
COACH WILLARD: They do a good job of running Carlino off screens, and he
just‑‑ he played a hell of a game. I've just got to give him a lot of credit.
He came off screens. He hit some tough shots.  
I thought, again, we had Isaiah on him a little bit. We had Dino (Carrington)
on him a little bit. Sterling was on him a little bit. But trying to guard a
fifth‑year senior, sometimes that fifth year senior is going to win.  
  
Q. Is Brandon all right?  
COACH WILLARD: Yes, he's all right. Once the score went up, he had
hyperextended his knee. He did the same thing in the Providence game, in
Providence. At that point, you're not going to put him in danger.  
  
Q. Kevin, was the success this team had early on, was that too much to
assume it was going to continue.  
COACH WILLARD: Yeah, I think that was a little bit to do with it. I don't
think‑‑ again, I really look at this season as we were all playing at a very
good level. We lost a very important key to the team at the start of the Big
East season. I thought the team did a great job of fighting through losing
somebody. And then when that piece came back, it was very hard to readjust
roles.  
Plus, again‑‑ I know it's not an excuse, but I knew the second half of the
season, the second nine games was going to be brutal just because of the
schedule. I think we had six of eight out on the road.  
These guys, it's tough for them to end the year this way because they deserve
a little bit better, they've earned a little bit better. They've worked hard.
Their attitude has been great. We just got really fragile toward the second
half, end of the year.  
  
Q. I know it's asking a lot to look ahead to next year, but looking ahead to
next year, all these guys will be a year older; freshmen will be sophomores.
Do you expect these guys to make a significant jump and attempt for postseason
next year?  
COACH WILLARD: Yeah, get a little refreshed, get a little bit stronger, kind
of get a better understanding. I even look at Sterling, and I look at the jump
Sterling took this year. He went from being a very good player‑‑ I guess his
sophomore year‑‑ to this year he's one of the best guards in the country.  
You can't look at his numbers the last three games. He's coming off a
concussion. I just don't think he's‑‑ he came off that concussion and just
didn't have the same zip in his step, but I look at the jump he took this
year. He went from being, like I said, a good player to one of the best guards
in the country.  
So I think the guys will take big steps. They always do. It's frustrating, but
I know what kind of jumps they can take. I saw his hard work and what he did.  
  
Q. Building on Adam's question, how much does that have to do with age and
how much do you have to work with and manage as a coach?  
COACH WILLARD: I think, when you have as many young guys who have never really
had to go through what they went through, playing great competition every
night, going against older, stronger kids every night, I just think experience
counts.  
I think it's one reason the league is so good right now. I think the league is
so good because it's very senior‑ and junior‑laden heavy. I think we have
great young talent in the league, but you look at the guys who are playing
really well right now, and they're all older guys. I think that's one of the
reasons the league is so deep and so good.  
  
Q. For Sterling, is there any way you can just sum up where you guys were
when you made that shot against Creighton, that was 60 days ago, and where you
are now? Is it shocking to you that it's gone this way?  
STERLING GIBBS: Obviously, we were on a high at that point, but we just took
some bad turns. We had a couple tough breaks. Like Coach said, we're a little
young. Guys getting a little fatigued, fighting through injuries, fighting
through different things.  
It's tough, but I think we stuck together and battled it out.  
  
Q. Sterling, you've been through a few of these seasons, and every year you
don't win a championship is always a disappointment. This year you guys have
had such highs and lows. As you kind of were with everyone in the locker room
after the game, is there anything you said or can say to the young guys that
kind of help transition and build off of this for next year?  
STERLING GIBBS: Right after the game, everyone's kind of down. So there's
nothing to really be said at that point. When we all meet up as a team, I'll
definitely tell them to work hard in the off‑season, got to make gains, got to
make sure that we're stronger, make sure that we're all together.  
I think the fact that they have this season underneath their belts, I think it
will help us a lot moving forward.  
  
Q. Coach, how frustrating has it been for you over the past five years in
conference play?  
COACH WILLARD: I think the thing I'm frustrated most of is I think the only
year I went into Big East play without anybody hurt was my second year. Last
year Eugene (Teague) had a concussion December 27th, and he was out pretty
much eight games. I actually don't think Eugene ever really got back.  
This year Isaiah. Jeremy broke his wrist the first year. Patrick broke his
foot the second year. Patrick broke his foot again last year. I think that's
my frustration level. I think we've always gotten to a pretty good point, and
once you're going into the toughest part of your season, we just haven't been
able‑‑ now all of a sudden we're adjusting, and we're constantly adjusting.  
I think that's the only frustrating part. The rest of the part, like I said,
I've been extremely proud of their effort, battling through. It's not easy
when you're a young guy‑‑ 22, 23, 21‑‑ trying your hardest, and things aren't
going your way. They gave me everything they had this year. I just can't ask
for anything else.  
But the frustrating part is we've never gone into a Big East season fully
healthy.  
  
Q. Coach, why did Whitehead only take one shot in the first half? Was he
hesitant to get going?  
COACH WILLARD: Again, we have to get an X‑ray on his hand. Battling a bad
thumb injury that he got two weeks ago. Isaiah is a little‑‑ going in, he's
just not as confident as he was at the beginning of the year. He just hasn't
had enough time to practice. Hasn't had enough time to play. He's coming off a
stress fracture. Again, he's part of the fragility. Is that the word?  
STERLING GIBBS: I'm not sure.  
COACH WILLARD: He's part of the fragile group. Again, he was guarding Carlino
that first three. He worked hard on it, and he took a tough shot, and I think
it kind of hit his confidence a little bit.  
Again, these guys need a good break. We'll get one, and we'll get back
together, and we'll get working.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 11, 2015

  

### [Matt Carlino](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28494)

### [Luke Fischer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26181)

### [Steve Wojciechowski](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26981)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

Marquette - 78  
Seton Hall - 56

  
THE MODERATOR: We're going to take questions for Marquette.  
  
Q. Coach, what made it so much easier for you this time against Seton Hall
than previous games?  
COACH WOJCIECHOWSKI: I think our team is getting better. We haven't been
healthy for the better part of the second half of the Big East season.
Obviously, Matt was not with us for over three weeks. Juan Anderson has been
injured. Duane Wilson's had some injuries.  
In the last ten days to two weeks, we've had all our guys, and I think we're
improving individually, and I think we're improving collectively.  
Obviously, tonight that was about as well as we can play. We had everybody
play well once, and that certainly helps.  
  
Q. Coach, how's Duane doing?  
COACH WOJCIECHOWSKI: Duane's really a tough guy. He'll be fine. He'll be fine.
He's taken some hits over the last couple weeks between his shoulder and his
face today. I expect Duane will be fine.  
  
Q. You've had a tough last couple of months or weeks losing a lot of games.
How do you get your mindset? Is it a brand new game? Is it a brand new season
coming into the postseason? How do you do that, Coach?  
COACH WOJCIECHOWSKI: The very first thing, I credit our guys. Even though
we've had a tough season in the win/loss column, I think, if you watch the
effort of our practices, watch the attitude of our guys behind the scenes, our
guys have really had good attitudes.  
The tournament play allows you the opportunity to start fresh. Regardless of
what's happened in the regular season, whether you've had a great season or
whether you've had a season with some bumps in it, everybody starts 0‑0\. I
think that's how we approached it, and our guys were terrific today.  
  
Q. Steve, just your thoughts on the turnaround against the No. 1 seed
Villanova and what challenges they present.  
COACH WOJCIECHOWSKI: They present all sorts of challenges. I think Villanova
is capable of winning a national championship. Obviously, they're extremely
well coached, and they have some outstanding players. That's why you play the
games. I think our guys will be ready.  
Our thoughts are we're happy to be alive in the Big East Tournament.  
  
Q. Luke, what was the difference down low tonight?  
LUKE FISCHER: In the first half, they were pretty physical. In the second
half, my teammates told me to push back. So we did. I credit Steven and Juan
all down low. We played pretty well tonight. That's been a trend for us the
past couple games, and it's resulted in wins. Hopefully, we can keep going to
that.  
  
Q. You guys practiced for the game, the one game that you're playing, or do
you look ahead with the time period that you had before, knowing that they're
back to back to back to back, as far as Villanova is concerned or down the
road?  
COACH WOJCIECHOWSKI: You take the game in front of you. You can't do that in
postseason play.  
  
Q. So now you have 15 hours?  
COACH WOJCIECHOWSKI: So now we have 15 hours, but it's going to be a darn good
15 hours. This is really survive and advance. You're only focused on the
opponent at hand, and that's where our guys' mindset was completely.  
  
Q. Coach, it just seems early your zone play kind of kept them off balance.
Then when their big guy, Delgado, got in foul trouble, you were able to use
your size, it seems like. So you made that switch.  
COACH WOJCIECHOWSKI: I thought we did a nice job of locating their shooters.
Sterling Gibbs is one of the best players in our conference, percentage‑wise,
the best three‑point shooter. I thought we did a good job of locating our
shooters.  
Luke, in particular, did an amazing job of protecting our basket. We put a lot
of pressure on him in our zone to protect the basket. He was phenomenal
tonight on both ends of the floor. Luke has improved a great deal, and it's
exciting to see his growth as a player.  
  
Q. Could either of the players or both of them talk about or follow up with
what the Coach said about clean slate or brand new season or something like
that. How do you guys come in like that?  
MATT CARLINO: Everyone starts at 0‑0, like Coach said. It's one game. That's
why we play the game. So I do think we're getting better at this time of year,
and we are healthy. So we're excited. We're excited for just every game that
comes to us.  
LUKE FISCHER: Same thing.  
  
Q. I don't know if you talked about this yet, but would you qualify this as
your best game of the season?  
COACH WOJCIECHOWSKI: Are you asking me?  
  
Q. I'm asking any of you guys.  
COACH WOJCIECHOWSKI: I thought it was one of our better games of the season. I
think there's a couple reasons: I think our guys have really good preparation.
I think it's the healthiest we've been in the second half of Big East play.
Our guys are getting better. Luke Fischer is a much better player today than
he was a month ago or even two months ago.  
Then, obviously, having Matt healthy. Before Matt was injured, he was having a
First Team All Big East. He was having a great, great year. He's one of the
best guards in the country. He showed it tonight.  
  
Q. Matt, when Derrick's doing what he did tonight with 14 assists, how much
of a different monster does this offense become?  
MATT CARLINO: I mean, it's huge, like it was a combination of everything.
Derrick really finds guys with the ball. Guys who set screens. Guys are
getting open. I think collectively, as a team, it just really clicked for us
tonight. Derrick's really good at finding the open man and making the smart
decision.  
  
Q. Is there something that this matchup with Villanova comes down to
tomorrow?  
MATT CARLINO: We're going to have to look at it.  
COACH WOJCIECHOWSKI: Against a team like Villanova, you have to be great
across the board. You can't say we played a great defensive game and the
offense let us down. You've got to play a great offensive game, you've got to
play a great defensive game.  
It's going to be a great challenge and one we're looking forward to. Look,
there's no better time than March, period. Period.  
  
Q. Going back to Villanova, is there one aspect or two aspects of Villanova
that you feel like you have to concentrate on?  
COACH WOJCIECHOWSKI: They really have no holes. Their guard play is terrific.
They're experienced. Their guards are, I think, as good as any perimeter in
the country.  
We're going to have to play a great game on both sides of the ball. We'll go
back and try to get ready to do that.  
  
Q. Matt and Luke, how big was that three by Steve right before the half
after Gibbs and Whitehead both hit back ‑to‑back threes? It kind of gave you
guys a little extra momentum going in.   
MATT CARLINO: That was huge for us. We haven't had that a lot this year, going
into halftime with some extra juice to us. So it was a big shot, and I think
it really got us going for the second half. So it was good.  
LUKE FISCHER: Just to add, I know they had two threes right before that, and
they were crawling back in the game. Steve's shot going into halftime gave us
that little jump start to go into the second half.  
  
Q. Matt, so you guys all year have jumped out to leads and then kind of
watched it disappear a little bit. Was today just confidence carrying over
from the end of the regular season?  
MATT CARLINO: I mean, yeah, coming off a win obviously gives you more
confidence, but like Coach said, I think we're getting better this time of
year. We've made those mistakes all year, so now we're kind of learning from
the mistakes and just getting better as a team.  
  
Q. Luke, once Delgado got in foul trouble, were you just given the green
light, any time you're in the block with Anthony, just kind of take him off?  
LUKE FISCHER: Yeah, we did a great job of executing our offense. Coach was
calling plays for me to get the ball. If it was open, I would take it. If not,
we could relocate and hit other shots. It was just good offense, and we were
able to move the ball and get good shots.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 11, 2015

  

### [Will Artino](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24843)

### [Greg McDermott](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15827)

### [James Milliken](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28511)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  
Creighton - 78  
DePaul - 63  
  
COACH McDERMOTT: Obviously, given what we've been through this year with the
number of close games that we've come up on the short end of, my message to
the team before the tournament is I think they've established their legacy,
this group of seniors. Because of their ability to stick with it, stick with
each other through a very adverse situation with seven games in conference
play where we led the last minute and lost, a lot of them being in the final
seconds.  
And this is their time. It's time to do something for themselves. I'm just
really proud of the way they competed. I thought defensively we had a little
more teeth the second half. I thought Will was exceptional the second half,
and, obviously, James got us off to that great start with his play on both
ends of the floor.  
So really proud of my team. Looking forward to the opportunity to play
Georgetown tomorrow night.  
  
Q. Coach, you were tied at 46 in the second half. You went on a 26 ‑10 run
at that point. What was the biggest factor in that stretch?   
COACH McDERMOTT: I thought it was really critical that we got into the bonus
first. By doing that, it allowed us to attack and get to the free‑throw some.
We made enough threes, and James shot it well enough the first half, but I
think they respected that shot a little bit more, and it opened up some
driving lanes.  
As I said, I thought defensively we were better. We forced a few more
turnovers. We made them shoot challenged shots, which is what we were after.
We really got hurt by the three‑point shot the first time we played them, and
the last two times we've done a better job of getting to those shooters.  
  
Q. James, talk about that fast start you got off to tonight. Just how much
you were feeling it at the beginning.  
JAMES MILLIKEN: We just started with transition points. I had my teammates
looking for me. After I hit the first one, my shot felt pretty good. So I took
the next one.  
  
Q. Will, talk about your second half. You obviously looked like you were
playing, like a guy who didn't want to have his career end.  
WILL ARTINO: I felt like Coach told me to come in and bring some energy.
That's kind of been my role the past few years. I didn't feel like I did a
good enough job coming off the bench and bringing in the energy in this half.  
They had a little run, and I knew it was my position as a senior leader to do
my job. Like you said, I know my days are winding down. So I just wanted to
give it everything I had and keep swinging and keep trying to get these wins.  
  
Q. I guess both guys: A few times DePaul took a lead and you guys were able
to counter that right away. How important was that to never let them get up
and go really in terms of taking a lead?  
WILL ARTINO: I think that tonight we did a great job of not getting rattled or
flustered when they did go on their little runs. We were able to respond
really well. I remember Ricky hit a big shot one time, and I don't remember
who else. We were able to keep our composure. I think that's the biggest thing
is sticking to the game plan.  
At times throughout the season, we would kind of lose composure and get ahead
of ourselves and do things we're not capable of doing, and tonight we were
able to stick in with ourselves, play to our strength, and keep fighting and
build back the lead.  
  
Q. Coach, how do you feel about the Georgetown matchup? Tough games, at
least based on the final score. Do you plan on doing anything differently?  
COACH McDERMOTT: As I told the team, I really felt like we only played‑‑
Georgetown has only seen 20 minutes of what we're capable of. We played a good
first half in D.C. and then got dominated the second half. And then had as bad
a loss as we ever had on our home floor when they came to Omaha.  
There's a reason that happened: They're a heck of a basketball team. They're
long. They're physical, extremely well coached, and tough with the short prep.  
I think our guys‑‑ if there's one team we'd want to play again, it would be
them just because we played so poorly the two times we played against them.
Maybe it's them. Maybe they're that much better than us, but at least tomorrow
we'll get another opportunity to find out.  
  
Q. Coach, 53 of your points were at the free ‑throw line or in the paint.
How much did that help you tonight?   
COACH McDERMOTT: It's huge. It's been a critical part of our offense recently
being a little more efficient than it was earlier in the season. We've learned
to maybe turn down a three early in the shot clock that isn't a perfect three
for us to try to attack and see if we can't get a better shot.  
Obviously, James and Austin‑‑ Devin was outstanding tonight. As I joked with
Devin in the locker room, it is possible for him to play a game without a
turnover. I wasn't sure, after two years, if that was possible. But for him to
come back to New York City and play the way he did‑‑ he and Austin to get ten
assists and no turnovers between them is really efficient basketball.  
  
Q. I guess both players: Talk about Georgetown tomorrow night.  
WILL ARTINO: Obviously, they're a great ball team. Like Coach Mac said, we
really didn't give them our best games. We played them both times pretty early
in this Big East Conference play. As a team ourselves, we've come a long way
since then.  
Like you said, maybe they are that much better than us. Maybe they're not. But
like you said, we're happy to get another shot at them, and we're going to go
out and play our hardest tomorrow, that's for sure.  
COACH McDERMOTT: Creighton, thank you.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 15, 2015

### [Frank Kaminsky](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26750)

### [Bronson Koenig](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28625)

### [Bo Ryan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17045)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  

Wisconsin  80  
Michigan State - 69

  
Q. For all of you guys, just what do you think of your NCAA Tournament draw,
and what was it like to get the Big Ten Tournament win today?  
BRONSON KOENIG: I thought it was really good for us to kind of have a game
like this where we were behind with seven minutes left. They kind of thought
they had us when we were down 11, but I just kept telling our guys, you keep
fighting, never give up, and that's what we did, and luckily we were fortunate
enough to came out with a win.  
FRANK KAMINSKY: To go out the way we did and fight back and really take the
Big Ten title was awesome. Our fans were great, just awesome environment to
play in, and it was just a blast.  
NIGEL HAYES: Yeah, basically the same thing, echo what they said. It was great
for us to have to come back from the deficits that we had, to play with that
pressure on us to get us ready for the tournament because those type of games
happen plenty during the NCAA Tournament.  
  
Q. Did you guys have that TV appearance planned when the seed was
revealed?  
NIGEL HAYES: Yes, we did. Our leader right here, Frank Kaminsky, he had the
idea to do that. We wanted to show that we were‑‑ I guess we're casual, but we
also know how to have a good time.  
  
Q. You guys didn't talk about getting a No.1 seed at all, but now that you
have it, what does that mean to you as an accomplishment and a reflection on
your season?  
FRANK KAMINSKY: It's awesome. First No.1 seed in our school's history, so
that's an accomplishment in and of itself. But we have a lot of goals and
aspirations in the NCAA Tournament, so we're going to prepare for our first
game and be ready when we tip the ball up and get ready to go.  
BRONSON KOENIG: Like Frank said, it was a good scrape for us to get to get the
first No.1 seed in school history and everything like that. We're not
satisfied yet. We have a long way to go still, and I think we're playing
pretty good basketball right now, but hopefully we can keep it going in the
tournament and get even better.  
NIGEL HAYES: Yeah, it's nice to have the 1 seed, but that doesn't mean that
we're guaranteed a Final Four appearance or anything like that because going
off of last year, there was not a 1 seed in the Final Four and a 1 seed did
not end up winning, so we still have to go out there and leave it on the
court.  
  
Q. Tom Izzo yesterday said that it was fitting that you two were playing in
the final here today, and given how closely contested the game was today, what
do you think about him saying that?  
COACH RYAN: Yeah, I echoed his sentiments. We talked earlier this week, and as
soon as I got off the phone, I said to him tonight before the game, I said, as
soon as I got off the phone with you, I said, we're going to be playing each
other, and it ended up happening. Some things had to fall into place. They're
playing extremely well right now. That was a tournament‑‑ that was a high
level NCAA Tournament game right there, if you ask me, as far as the crowd,
the intensity, the swings, the up‑and‑down. For us to get that one and get the
No.1 seed, these guys are extremely proud to represent the University that
way.  
  
Q. The rebounding disparity, is that kind of living dangerously for you
guys, or do you feel you have other aspects of your game that can overcome
that on a regular basis?  
COACH RYAN: Well, we led in one phase of the game, about a three or
four‑minute phase where the rebounding got away from us. But we still hung in
there, still tried to get our points in the paint. I don't know what they
ended up with on second chance points, but six points on seven offensive
rebounds. We had five points on four offensive rebounds. I don't think the
disparity shows in where the points were scored and opportunities taken
advantage of.  
On one scenario, they had three offensive rebounds, and then on the fourth,
did not score. As long as we kept fighting and they didn't get something out
of those offensive rebounds, we were still alive.  
  
Q. I want to get your thoughts on this historic No.1 seed for the program.  
COACH RYAN: Well, I'm sure it'll sink in later, but we were just looking to
see who they were going to match us up with so we could get right away to the
computer and get all our information on our opponent. And pretty much right
now, the main thing is get these guys off their feet, get back. Fortunately,
we play Friday and not Thursday, so what we need right now is to get these
guys back. We have class tomorrow. Some of these guys have tests. They've got
midterms this week. It'll be business as usual for our student‑athletes. We
would just like to get them back tonight and get them some sleep.  
  
Q. Is this a good game to play going into the tournament as far as high
energy, like you said, a tournament atmosphere, or do you have concerns that
maybe it's a draining game?  
COACH RYAN: No, I never think that for‑‑ read that much into things like this.
It was how it played out, so you do it, you get back, you get prepared for the
next one.  
I don't really try to read a lot of that stuff into it.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 15, 2015

  

### [Branden Dawson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25081)

### [Tom Izzo](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13984)

### [Travis Trice](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26853)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  

Wisconsin  80  
Michigan State - 69

  
COACH IZZO: Extremely proud of my team, and I'm proud of the way they played.
I'm proud of the way they prepared. I thought we played one of the greatest
games we've played for 32, 32 and a half minutes, or 35, 36 minutes. And then
we made a couple mistakes, and they made a couple of great shots, and that's
the way the game goes.  
To go 9 for 9 from the line, to do almost everything we wanted to do, to
dominate them on the boards, it was a couple of bad turnovers and a couple
great plays by them. So extremely disappointed, but extremely proud that this
team battled and prepared last night, tired, prepared as good last night and
this morning as any team I've had.  
  
Q. At this program there's no silver lining in losing, but your best
performance of the year. How can this now propel you for next week?  
TRAVIS TRICE: We've just got to correct our mistakes. Like Coach said, we feel
like we played great for about 35, 36 minutes, and just ‑‑ we had a couple
mistakes where we fell apart. But other than that, I mean, we're proud of the
way we played.  
BRANDEN DAWSON: Just what Travis said, we just had a couple mistakes that we
made down the stretch. We played good as a team. We listened to the game plan,
we were well prepared, and we just came up with some key mistakes down the
stretch that you can't make against a disciplined team like Wisconsin.  
  
Q. Travis, what did you guys learn from the last three days, and do you
think you're playing your best basketball right now?  
TRAVIS TRICE: I think we learned a lot about our team. I feel great where
we're headed right now. Our coaching staff did a great job of preparing us all
weekend. Players did a good job of executing and carrying out the game plan
and not losing heart.  
Yeah, it feels bad to lose, but we're happy with where we're at right now
going into the tournament.  
  
Q. With the NCAA Tournament ‑‑ getting over the disappointment, is that an
issue with the NCAA Tournament, not having a hangover or anything like that,
when obviously everything you guys put into this game, to come that close?   
BRANDEN DAWSON: Yeah, I think we played good as a team, so we were the last
two teams in the championship, so like Travis said, we can't hang our heads.
We still have another chance with the NCAA Tournament coming up, so we played
good, so right now we definitely feel comfortable going into the tournament.  
  
Q. Coach called a time ‑out with 3.7 seconds remaining. What was going on
during that time? I'm sure it wasn't drawing up strategy.   
TRAVIS TRICE: Coach did it on purpose, and he said, he made us look around,
look around the gym, and he wanted us to look at that and remember that
feeling. Take that all in. That way we don't want to feel that feeling again.
And I think that was the perfect thing to do. I mean, to sit around, and
you're looking at the gym, everybody else is celebrating, probably mad that we
called a time‑out knowing they were going to win. But we just don't want to
feel that feeling again.  
BRANDEN DAWSON: Yeah, I agree with Travis. Coach, he wanted us to just look
around the gym and just see how it felt. Like I said, we played good as a
team, so we definitely just have to learn from our mistakes and just listen to
his game plan.  
  
Q. Branden, being from this general area, so much talent that comes out of
this region, what do you think it is about a Chicago player that makes him
stand out from players from the rest of the country?  
BRANDEN DAWSON: I'll say guys from Chicago, they're just all‑around good
players. Guys from Indiana are good players, too, but it's just the way‑‑ just
a different style of basketball that they play. Chicago, they play hard, so
being a guy from Indiana, really just taking over the same thing.  
  
Q. You talk about building blocks, and your guys certainly gave you one
today for next week. Taking those timeouts, doing those little things, how do
you see this translating for next week?  
COACH IZZO: That's really what I did in the time‑out. I didn't just say look
around. I said look around, but understand that ‑‑ I preach a lot about
winning games and winning championships. To win a game, you do a lot of things
right. To win a championship, you do 90 percent of the things right. We made
some mistakes. We had a couple turnovers that were just ridiculous, but they
come back, and give them credit, they had to make some shots. I thought there
were a couple tough calls. Everything goes that way at the end of a tough
game. But we had our chance to win the game, and we didn't finish the job. But
for once, it wasn't at the free‑throw line. We got 9 for 9, we out‑rebound
them by 9.  
That's a very, very, very good basketball team we played, deserving of all the
accolades that all of them have got from Bo as Coach of the Year, and
hopefully Hall of Fame, to Kaminsky's Player of the Year to hopefully National
Player of the Year, to hopefully a No.1 seed. They deserve everything they
got, and they proved it because we gave them as good a shot as I think anybody
has. To get them down 10 at that time of the game and them have enough
resiliency and senior leadership to come back, that's a team that can compete
for a national championship.  
  
Q. Similar question that I asked Branden. You started two guys today from
the Chicago area. What is it about this region that makes it so special in
producing talent?  
COACH IZZO: Chicago is a big city, they've got a lot of good players. I think
the Midwest in general has a tougher kid. I love getting guys from the cities.
I think they're hungrier sometimes, they're tough, and of course when there's
more people, there's more chance to have more players. There's been a lot of
good players that have come out of Chicago. I think the saddest part of the
day for me is I thought Branden Dawson had, whatever minutes he played, all
but one or two‑‑ he played 38 minutes and I`d say all but one or two were
phenomenal. He jumped over people, he made shots, free throws, he got
rebounds. We put him on Kaminsky and he didn`t guard him the whole game, but
he did one hell of a job on him. And you know, he had a guy at 19 points, but
on Dawson, I don't think he had nearly that many, so maybe that shows why a
Chicago kid, tough kid.  
And I'm pleased for Branden. I'm the first to push him. I'm the first to hug
him, and today was a day where the guy gave me everything he had. He prepared
last night well. Guys did such a good job last night and this morning, and
trust me when I say this, that is a good team that we played.

## March 14, 2015

  

### [Richaud Pack](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28632)

### [Evan Smotrycz](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25961)

### [Mark Turgeon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13696)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  

Michigan State  62  
Maryland - 58

  
COACH TURGEON: You hate to lose, but it was a good tournament for us. We had
great‑‑ we had a lot of people here, which was tremendous to see all the Terp
fans come all the way to Chicago. We started out great today making some
shots. They weren't making shots. Second half we just kind of lost our rhythm.
If we just could have made a couple shots in that stretch or had a couple
really good possessions in that stretch or got to the foul line, could have
stemmed the tide a little bit, and I think the outcome might have been
different, but we couldn't. Give them credit.  
But this has been great for us. We played a team that plays really fast and
spreads the floor in Indiana with great guards, and then we come play Michigan
State who's a really physical, well‑coached team, and it's going to prepare us
for what lies ahead for us next week. We got better this weekend. We got
better this week. I'm proud of my team. 27 wins now. We're looking forward to
what lies ahead.  
  
Q. Evan and Richaud, the fact that you guys have won so many close games and
had that streak going of winning close games, does that make it easier to
weather this one or make it harder?  
EVAN SMOTRYCZ: I mean, losing is never easy. Like you said, we've won a lot of
close games, so I think that gives us confidence moving forward, if anything.  
RICHAUD PACK: I agree with Evan. We've won a lot of close games, and we
usually make some big plays down that stretch. We'll just try to do that
moving forward.  
  
Q. Evan, you've matured into playing almost a point forward role at some
points in the game. Can you describe the progression this season and how well
you've been handling the ball outside and those three ‑pointers?   
EVAN SMOTRYCZ: Yeah, just try to give us another look, another dimension. It's
been a tough year, but just trying to make plays in March.  
  
Q. Richaud, you guys went about seven minutes there at the beginning of the
second half without scoring. What happened to the offense? Was it a matter of
shots not falling, or what really happened there during that drought?  
RICHAUD PACK: We were stagnant for a little bit with the lead and whatnot, and
we had some shots, and we just didn't knock them down.  
  
Q. Evan, Coach said that this was a good tournament for you guys, prepares
you for next week. What are some of the specific things that you took out of
this weekend moving forward into the NCAA Tournament?  
EVAN SMOTRYCZ: I think conditioning is a big part, that we didn't just come
here and play one game. We got to play two real good teams. I think we get
better every game, so we'll just take what we learn here and kind of translate
it into practice, and hopefully continue to get better and move it into next
week.  
  
Q. Coach, Michigan State had a bunch of big offensive put ‑backs in the
second half. With Damonte Dodd being in foul trouble, was there a reason John
Graham didn't get any run?   
COACH TURGEON: Coach's decision.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about how the world is round and things go back and
forth. Do you think that's what it was today or do you think it was something
different that Michigan State made the big plays that you guys usually make?  
COACH TURGEON: One, they're really good, and Michigan State has been playing
really good. They've had a tough schedule down the stretch, and really the
difference‑‑ the question he was asking is they did get some lay‑ups in the
second half, second chance points and lay‑ups, and it hurt us. We tried to
spread the floor with Evan on offense but we don't rebound as well on the
other end. I think the difference was we gave them lay‑ups, staying too long
on ball screens, rolling guys in for lay‑ups, and we weren't getting those in
the second half. Everything was a tough, contested shot. We didn't get to the
foul line. When you get lay‑ups, it gives you a chance to be successful and
they probably had seven or eight lay‑ups in the second half they made.  
  
Q. Your thoughts on Melo's development this year?  
COACH TURGEON: Melo has been terrific. Of course he started out great, our
offense was clicking early, had great spacing, we played inside out, and he
made some shots. But he's become a better leader, and I thought he really
competed defensively this weekend, had to guard good players this weekend, and
I thought he really competed. It's great to see. Happy for him. I think he got
a little bit tired. We couldn't get him a lot of good looks. He got a couple
late, one went all the way in and came out, a big three, I think we were down
one, it would have put us up two. He's terrific. There's a reason we're 27‑6,
because we have a really good point guard.  
  
Q. How big was it for you to have a guy like Evan, a guy who played in this
event before coming in?  
COACH TURGEON: Oh, I think experience helps. You look at close games, coaches
always have their most experienced players out there. Tom did the same
tonight. We did it. Did it help? Yeah, I'm sure it helped Evan, but what
helped Evan more than anything is he's feeling the best he's felt all year,
physically and mentally. He's in a good spot right now. That's probably helped
more than anything.  
  
Q. 27 ‑6, obviously a great season. Did you learn anything from the game
today? Was there anything that surprised you? We know we had three threes go
in and out, could have changed the whole thing, but was there anything else
you learned?  
COACH TURGEON: Yeah, I've got to do a better job when the game is on the line,
when they're making their run, getting us to the foul line or getting shots,
getting Dez involved. Give them credit, but I've just got to do a better job
during that stretch, so that's what I learned. Our half court offense has been
pretty good. It's been getting better. So hopefully I'll learn that and I'll
help get us better shots next week.  
  
Q. Jake seemed a little out of sorts offensively today. Any reason for
that?  
COACH TURGEON: Yeah, Michigan State is really good defensively. They switch 1
through 4, and they're really aware of Jake, probably more so than anybody we
play, and they do a great job of switching out. Whenever we'd run a play for
Jake, he looks like he's going to be open, and then all of a sudden they
switch out. They do a good job on him. We moved him to the three one time and
I thought we were going to get an open look for him. He dribbled out of
bounds. But give them credit.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 14, 2015

  

### [A.J. Hammons](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26680)

### [Matt Painter](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17039)

### [P.J. Thompson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28626)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  

Wisconsin  71  
Purdue - 51

  
COACH PAINTER: Well, I felt that our guys did a good job coming out and being
ready to play. I thought they did a good job of executing what we wanted in
the first half we got a spark from PJ Thompson off the bench, made a couple
huge threes for our team. But I thought we did a good job up to that point.
We've had a little bit of a trend‑‑ not a little bit of a trend, a trend,
where when we lead at half, we have a tough start to the second half, and when
we're behind at half, we have a great start to the second half. And it makes
absolutely no sense because I've never been part of a basketball season when
it's been that way, but that has been a trend for our team.  
The problem with playing Wisconsin is when you have those bad starts and you
allow them to get their head up and they start playing with confidence, it can
snowball in a hurry. I did think that we did a good job in the stretch coming
up into the 10‑minute mark to where we called a time‑out. They had it to six,
we ran it back to one, they ran it back to six, had to call another one. We
have a couple open threes at that point. We miss them, and we never really
bounce back and recover. But I just thought Wisconsin was great in the second
half. We were quicker to the basketball, they out‑rebounded us. I thought
Bronson Koenig was very good for them.  
We tried to get fouled instead of scoring the ball on a handful of
possessions, and they have a way of frustrating you the way they defend, and
played great position defense, and we didn't do a good job of adjusting with
it and kind of fell apart from there. But give them credit, they've got a
chance to do something special in the NCAA Tournament. Bo has done a great
job.  
  
Q. A.J., I don't know how much time elapsed after your offensive foul where
you backed into Kaminsky and when you got into foul trouble and were on the
bench because of that, but it seemed like after that foul, something just sort
of shut off with you or you didn't have it after that. Am I wrong? What was
going on with you after that play?  
A.J. HAMMONS: Got my head down a little bit personally. I thought it was my
third foul, so I tried to slow myself down a little bit. It hurt our team, but
the second half I came out and I didn't feel like I had enough opportunities,
so I was kind of down on myself and trying to pick myself up, and that just
hurt me a little bit.  
  
Q. A.J., did they do anything differently on you on defense in the second
half?  
A.J. HAMMONS: I don't think they did anything differently, really just trying
to get around, and when I got the ball, just trying to poke it from the back.
That`s the only thing really differently. Really just kept trying to push me
out and then just give me room, and I felt he was just trying to take charge
the whole time, so when I did get the ball later on, just tried not to lower
my shoulder as much. But I don't feel like they changed up that much.  
  
Q. P.J., we've seen the trend and the results of what's happened lately when
you guys are up by the half and then end up losing. Have you seen any trends
within the way you guys are playing in those situations that's leading to that
within the last three games?  
P.J. THOMPSON: Not really. I mean, sometimes when a team is making a run on
us, we might get stagnant on offense a little bit, we might not move as much,
cut as much. And we're just standing and watching. We need to just come
together as a team really, be able to sustain a run, and be able just pick it
up and know that we can hang with them. We've just going to stay on a run.  
  
Q. A.J., I appreciate your answer to my last question. You play against
Kaminsky obviously, I'm sure you've tangled before with Nigel Hayes and even
with Dekker. Can you describe each one of them, what it's like to play against
them when they're rolling and what you think is unique?  
A.J. HAMMONS: Are you talking about offense or defense?  
  
Q. Whatever stands out to you.  
A.J. HAMMONS: You know, they're just very versatile just offensive wise.
You've got to have a great close‑out each time. Hayes knocked down great
threes this game. Kaminsky, he'll get you on the tough edge, get you on the
drive, so it's hard trying to stay in front of him. He's more‑‑ I would say he
moves better than most, so just something like that, you've got to be ready to
guard that kind of speed, that kind of just versatility. I felt like we did
great the first half but the second half we didn't stay together as a group,
and it just kind of hurt us.  
  
Q. Going forward this year and into next year, when you're sitting in
halftime like you were today and you see how great you played and you were
really dominant during stretches, do you feel that this can be a really elite
team over the next few years and if you're capable of putting 40 minutes
together you can compete with anybody?  
P.J. THOMPSON: Yeah, I mean, this year has been a great learning experience
for us as a team. Going back to December we had some downs, and we lost to two
teams that we weren't really supposed to lose to, but I felt like we came
together as a team after that and we had a nice meeting. We had great practice
after that, and we just felt like we just needed to get back to Purdue
basketball, and that's what we did, and we were able to make a great run in
the conference tournament. But when we get down at halftime, we just can't get
complacent really. We've just got to know that first media time‑out, instead
of getting up five, let's get up nine, ten, and move on from there.  
A.J. HAMMONS: Really I feel like we`re going to be a great team next year and
years on. We have so much depth on the bench and our starting five is just so
good. We've got to learn to play more as a team. We put in a lot of work in
the off‑season, just more coming together as a group and when your number is
called, just make sure you're ready all the time.  
  
Q. A.J., they were able to get some offensive rebounds there when you guys
were down quite a bit. What kind of impact did that have on your guys' ability
to do something positive, maybe get your heads back up when you were down
pretty significantly?  
A.J. HAMMONS: It was kind of hard. Somebody was just getting offensive
rebounds. You`ve got Coach yelling at you, like, just rebound, rebound. It`s
hard. A couple guys put their heads down. Anytime we got an offensive rebound,
they`d kick it back out and get a big three. It's pretty much a game changer.
It hurt our team, but it's just something ‑‑ we just had to come together as a
group, try and get it back. Shots weren't falling for us, but I feel like next
time we'll get it.  
  
Q. Matt, how good is Wisconsin and do you see them potentially being a No.1
seed?  
COACH PAINTER: Well, I don't know about the seeding because I don't know what
all goes into it. But I think they have a chance to win a national
championship, so I don't think there's a lot of people that can say that.
They're versatile. The element of being really good and not fouling people is
unheard of. They do an unbelievable job with that, and I'm not knocking that
or saying that. They do a great job. They were not fouling us down there, even
though at times we were calling for it. They were not. They get physical with
you, and then when the ball comes, they play great position defense and they
don't give you angles and they come from different spots. They're really good.
They get to the free‑throw line and their opponent doesn't.  
When they rebound the basketball‑‑ like today I thought they shot the ball
just okay. They had a good stretch in the second half. They can actually shoot
better than they did. Their percentages are good in the second half, but they
had some open looks and we were giving them some of those open looks. We were
trying to keep their post play‑‑ we were trying to keep that out, keep the
ball out of the post to the best of our ability. They can hurt you in so many
ways with their skill and their size, and then they have one of the best
coaches in the game.  
  
Q. You allowed two turnovers ‑‑ Purdue had two turnovers in the first half,
seven in the second. Do you attribute that to your play or Wisconsin's?  
COACH PAINTER: A little bit of both? They're not a pressure team outside of a
couple guys. You can't play alternate size the way they do and then pressure.
They pack it in, they take it away, Gasser will pressure, Koenig will pressure
a little bit. You can`t tell people not to foul and then go after people.
You're going to have a contradiction there.  
So I thought we did a good job of moving the ball and being patient and
getting what we wanted offensively, but for us that's great. We've struggled
in that area, but we haven't struggled with this style of teams turning it
over. We've struggled with team that are a little bit different than this.  
  
Q. The lesson being learned from Isaac playing in a game like this, how much
does it benefit him down the road in terms of his growth?  
COACH PAINTER: Well, I think he's got a chance to be great. He's got to learn
from his mistakes. He's getting frustrated sometimes when things don't go his
way. We had a couple calls against him in Penn State that were borderline
atrocious. It's mindboggling because he used to lie to me early in the season,
so he'd come off‑‑ he was one of those guys, I didn't foul him, and he just
would crush the guy. Now the past two months he's been really good. He was
like, Coach, I didn't touch this guy, he flopped, and you go back and watch
tape and he`s right. They crack him in the head in the Penn State game and
then they call him for a foul he's had some things go his way. He's got to
have a great off‑season. I think the officials have to have a great
off‑season, because he's different, man, he is 7'2", 300 pounds and he's
trying to keep position and he's keeping his arms up and he's legal most of
the time. But they have to learn how to officiate him because those guys can`t
keep him from where he wants to get and still be in legal guarding position.
But I think the whole body of work, he's not going to grow until he can get
that frustration away and not be able to get so down on himself when he
doesn't get a call. He had a point blank lay‑up right there. He went to get
fouled. You've got to go to score that and take that guy with you.  
  
Q. With A.J. in the second half, did they do anything differently or was it
just a matter of playing better defense on him?  
COACH PAINTER: You know, I thought it was him to be frank with you. I thought
at times big guys want lay‑ups and you've got to take a five‑foot jump hook.
They're so good with their positioning. We've really worked with A.J. on that,
just holding, pausing, waiting, and then go above them. Because A.J. can go to
a spot they can't get to even with seven footer if you keep your angle and
score the basketball. And he was just trying to grind it a little bit more and
wheel and deal and get to lay‑up mode, and you've just got to score the
basketball.  
But I didn't think they did anything. I thought he dropped the ball and they
took it from him once. I thought they blocked his shot the other time. The
other time I thought he just missed when they played good position defense.  
If you want to know how to play position post defense, watch Wisconsin. They
do the best job the way they teach it. A.J. really did a good job in the first
half of going against that. In the second half he kind of reverted back once
some things went against him.  
  
Q. Do you like where you're at, where your team is at heading into the
tournament? And following up, is there any question in your mind that you're
in the tournament?  
COACH PAINTER: I like where we're at. I like our effort. I like our guys, and
I thought today we got away from what got us the lead. But we also didn't make
shots in that stretch. Sometimes if you don't make shots, it doesn't look as
good as it was before. I do think we're in the tournament. We've had 13 Big
Ten wins, and I do feel we're in the tournament. But we had to overcome some
things. There's no doubt the way we played non‑conference we had to go get‑‑ I
said it when we walked out of non‑conference. I just said, we've got to get 13
Big Ten wins in some way, counting the Big Ten Tournament, however you want to
accumulate it, we've got to get to 13, and we were able to do that.  
  
Q. Why was Bronson Koenig such a tough match ‑up in the second half?  
COACH PAINTER: Well, we switched some of those and he broke us down off the
dribble the one time late and shot that tough shot that banked in. He broke us
down on a switch one time stuck a three of Vince. He stuck a three on Basil,
and we're going to live with that. We`re going to go on the switch and knock
Frank Kaminsky out of driving the basketball and then make him make a play
over us. I think you've got to tip your hat to him. I thought the made some
tough shots in that stretch really helped him. The ones that we get frustrated
with are the ones that he's open. Those are the ones. But those three right
now, I thought those guys played good D, the offense was just better than the
defense.

### [Bo Ryan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17045)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  

Wisconsin  71  
Purdue - 51

  
Q. For Sam, when they're up 35 ‑30 and maybe you hadn't played your best
half, your team, I mean, not you, at this stage of your career and through all
your experiences, are you discouraged at all? What's the feeling like, and
what was it like in the locker room?   
SAM DEKKER: Well, obviously we wanted to play better. We were behind for a
reason. But we're never going to freak out. We're never going to try to get it
all back in one play. We know we have a team that can put some things together
and string some possessions together and win some ballgames. So we just said,
hey, got to get some stops and get into our offense and take good shots, get
inside, and we went inside early in the second half, and I think that's what
propelled us to a win.  
  
Q. Bronson, what has it meant for you to step up in Traevon's absence and
have the succession that you've had?  
BRONSON KOENIG: I'm just trying to help this team in any way I can. My
teammates have done a good job of giving me confidence to do so, especially
Traevon from the bench, during halftime, timeouts, stuff like that. He's given
me a lot of confidence to do my thing.  
  
Q. Speaking of confidence, Bronson, I think at least twice and maybe more
times, you took on the shot clock and really aggressively. Can you explain
what you have to be able to cope with in order to be able to get off a good
shot when you know the defense and the clock are both against you?  
BRONSON KOENIG: Well, it's really nice to be in a ball screen with Frank who
can pretty much do everything, so if his guy drags me, then I just kick it
back to him or I try to be aggressive as I can coming off the screen, going to
the hole or shooting any jump shots, yeah.  
  
Q. Bronson, a career night in points for you. Can you talk about how this
tournament and how this particular game has made you feel more impactful as a
player?  
BRONSON KOENIG: I mean, like I said before, my teammates and coaches have done
a good job of giving me confidence just to be aggressive, and when I have the
ball in my hands at the end of the shot clock, that kind of gives me a little
bit of freedom just to make a play pretty much. I'm just trying to do anything
I can to make us better and try and help us win.  
  
Q. Sam, defensively in the second half, I know it was more of a switch, and
you guys really frustrated A.J. Hammons, Frank doing a good job with, that,
too. How did you force so many turnovers in the second half and what was the
effort in that category?  
SAM DEKKER: Well, first half I don't think we were aggressive enough
defensively. We were kind of letting them get easy post touches and get two
feet in the paint too easily, and they're too big inside, and if you let them
do that, they're going to win. We just tried to make it a little tougher for
them to get inside, to stay physical, and like I said, somewhere in the first
half, we did an exchange, got a guy as well in the first half. In the second
half, we talked it out and we were all on the same page, and when we're all on
the same page like that, we become pretty good defensively, and hoping to
build on that for tomorrow.  
  
Q. Sam, I think they scored 16 in the second half, and many minutes in, it
was like nine. What's more fun for your team, offense or defense?  
SAM DEKKER: When we're playing defense well, it becomes really fun, because
then you can see what it does to us. When we get those good stops and good
momentum, we get our athletes out in the open court and we can make it tough
on them and get them on their heels. When we're doing good on the defensive
end, it makes offense more fun because one thing leads to another, and we have
the guys that can get it done on both ends.  
  
Q. Sam, how big has Bronson been for you guys, and what's it going to mean
when Traevon comes back to have Bronson's scoring ability coming off the
bench?  
SAM DEKKER: It's been huge. That was a nice thing in the beginning of the
year, we have Trey starting, an experienced player that's won many games for
us, but if he needed a break just as good a point guard in Bronson.
Unfortunately Trey went down, he's coming back soon, but then we set Bronson
in and he hasn't missed a step. The kid is very talented, one of the most
talented players I've played with, and he's won us many games already, and
he's leading us, and he's got a quiet confidence about him, and it's fun to
watch him do what he does, and nights like tonight you're reminded how good he
really is.  
COACH RYAN: You've never asked an individual a harder question than to ask Sam
what's more fun, defense or offense. He's just now getting the defensive part.
So it's hard to answer that question.  
When Trey comes back, somebody said about him taking Bronson‑‑ we'll probably
go small and he'll take Sam's place.  
Okay, questions?  
  
Q. 18 total for your team and five for your two forwards in Kaminsky and
Hayes. What's the big reason for this team's chemistry and ball movement?  
COACH RYAN: You're my kind of guy to notice a stat like that. How about that
stat? Well, Frank Kaminsky must really be a good player because he wasn't
asked to the press conference shooting 50 percent, 5 to 1 assists, three
blocks, three steals, and you probably thought he had a bad game.  
But those five assists, getting to your answer, they were huge because they
were paying a lot of attention to him, and he might have tried to force one
earlier, a pass, but he really caught himself, relaxed, played. The way Purdue
was playing, we had to do some different things, and Frank is smart enough to
either do it on his own or listen to coaching.  
Our bigs being able to find people has been one of our keys for a long time.  
  
Q. When it comes to playing in the NCAA Tournament, do you think there's an
advantage or disadvantage to that Sunday final in the conference in terms of
rest, preparation, anything like that?  
COACH RYAN: Well, let's see. Trying to be fair, we've played in a few Finals.
A couple years there we had key players get injuries. Maybe not from that last
game, but we lost Brian Butch, one year we lost Trevon Hughes in '08, and we
played in the championship game in those two years, I'm pretty sure, '07 and
'08. In '04 we played in the championship game, lost to Pittsburgh in a close
game in Milwaukee, and then we played in The Finals against Illinois in '05,
which is a team to beat everybody pretty much, lost in the national
championship, but we did get to the Elite 8 that year. You probably didn't
know I remembered all this stuff at my age.  
But just thinking‑‑ because I've thought about those things, like how much
rest, what are we doing, how many reps in practice do you have leading up? And
with the pass strength coach and with our guys we have right now, we're just
trying to compile all that information and do what's best for the players.  
What's really tough is if you play Sunday and your game is Thursday. So what
we ask for, I'm on the board of directors of the Coaching Association, we ask
for if anybody is playing in a conference final on Sunday to not play until
Friday. That's been the case most of the time.  
  
Q. I know you're on the board and all that and that you're active with that.
I know that there's been a lot of discussion about the direction of college
basketball, especially with the offense scoring down and all that. You guys
are out there playing probably the most beautiful basketball you guys have
played in your time here, the most attractive. I wondered if you ‑‑  
COACH RYAN: Is it the uniforms?  
  
Q. That's what it is, yeah. Good ‑looking guys. Is that sort of a reflection
of where the game needs to go? Are you conscious of all that talk and what
changes might be needed to make the game more like what you guys are playing?
  
COACH RYAN: Yeah, I think it's overcooked, overdone, talking about the points
per game. It's not a lot. And we'll probably end up going to 30 seconds. I've
coached 30‑second shot clocks, I've coached 24‑second shot clocks. We run
drills in practice, 17 seconds in order to get a shot off, full court. And
Bronson being in that situation, I run a drill where I'll put 12 seconds on
the clock and fire the ball to one of the five offensive players. Okay? Figure
out a way to score. So you find out that guys like Trey, guys like Jordan
Taylor, guys like Devin Harris, they'll get them the ball and we'll run a high
rub, we'll run a wing ball screen, we'll run throw‑back, which is a ball
screen action. We'll run flat if I feel that the point guard is one‑on‑one
better than the guy guarding him.  
So it's not rare that we're in situations that they're not used to when the
shot clock is going down because we actually put them into those situations in
practice. I'm sure other people do, too. I've never asked. But I think our
game is in pretty good shape. I think there will always be people who will
stir the pot simply because it's conversation and it fills the airwaves and it
gets talk radio and TV and this and that. I understand that. I was an
economics and marketing major. I know what it's all about. So I can play the
game, too. But if I get a group of kids like I have now and this is the way we
can play, well then we're going to play this way. They are fun to watch, even
though I'm not saying that as their coach. What I'm saying is I like the way
our guys play off of one another, their efficiency rate, the way they take
care of the ball most of the time. But you should have seen how hot I was in
the locker room. We had two turnovers in the last minute for three total, and
that doesn't go over big.  
But anyhow, I think our game is in great shape because there`s a lot of people
who are going to watch us tomorrow ‑‑ not just us, whoever we're playing ‑‑
and they'll watch the other conference tournaments today and tonight, and
people are still going to watch the NCAA Tournament.  
I just think that sometimes we get to the point where we have to talk about
something negative so that you can talk about something positive in our game.
They're experimenting‑‑ what leagues, the NIT and another‑‑ they're going to
experiment with the 30 and the extended arc. That's fine. That's okay. You
know what? Coaches coach to the rules. They just coach to the rules. We'll
find a way.  
  
Q. What information do you study going into the tournament? How much
importance do you place if you should win tomorrow being a No.1 versus a No.2
seed in the NCAA?  
COACH RYAN: You know, I never really have talked about seeds ever, even in
Division III when they first were talking about seeding and who's going to
play where and whom and all that. I stay away from it because I want all my
energies to go towards the game tomorrow, and then we find out who we play,
and then all our energy is going into, boom, that first opponent.  
  
Q. Talk about your defense on Hammons early in the second half. You were
guarding without fouling.  
COACH RYAN: Yeah, I don't think he had a field goal in the second half. But it
was primarily Frank and a little bit of Vitto and Nigel helped in there a
couple times. But if you start to dig too much off of their perimeter
shooters, they can shoot the three, so we cat and moused a little bit, fake
dig, and then cover. But I thought one‑on‑one Frank did an unbelievable job of
not allowing Hammons to score.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 14, 2015

### [Tom Izzo](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13984)

_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  

Michigan State  62  
Maryland - 58

  
COACH IZZO: Well, we don't make it easy, I can promise you that. I think
throughout a season, you try to learn a little bit more about your team, they
try to learn about you, and it showed a lot of character. We were beaten twice
by this team, and you get down 15, 16 points, whatever we did, and some of it
was our fault, but some of it was incredible offense on their part. They hit
every shot they took at the beginning, and it wasn't all bad defense, it was
really some very, very, very good offense.  
You know, Trav kept us alive in the first half, and other guys were struggling
a little bit, and I thought in the second half Marvin Clark came in and
motivated all of us, especially the guy to the right of me. And then when he
started playing, with the energy level that he played with, we're just a much,
much, much, much, much better team.  
I thought that not only did he score on the great pass from Zel, we made a lot
of plays, Branden made his free throws, Zel played very good defense on a
tough, tough kid to handle, boy. I can't tell you how much respect we have for
Wells, and I know he had a decent game, but I thought Zel did a great job on
him. In every way each one of these guys did something special.  
But the most special part is it's fun to challenge people and have them
respond, and I think that's what you saw out of us today.  
  
Q. Travis and maybe Branden, how much did Coach Izzo challenge you?  
TRAVIS TRICE: It really started at halftime. Coach came in and said either
you're going to get the job done or I'm not going to play you, and B.J.
responded like great players do at that point. I mean, somebody else might
crumble, but B.J. stepped up to the occasion, and he came down clutch for us
in the stretch.  
BRANDEN DAWSON: Yeah, just to go back to what Travis said, at halftime Coach,
he came after all of us, and as far as myself, he told me that I have to play,
and I have to pick it up. That's what I did. He said that in the four‑minute
stretch, my energy you could tell it was different from the beginning of the
game. I think when I play like that, it just gives this team a huge uplift.  
  
Q. Branden, there were times early in the season in which you didn't play
well, you didn't pout but you were frustrated and it affected your game. You
seem to have grown past that. How?  
BRANDEN DAWSON: I would just say just having a different approach, a different
mindset. Coach, he kept coming at me. I mean, I didn't get frustrated. I knew
that I'm a senior, so seniors, you just have to step up and lead the younger
guys, and like Coach said, Marvin Clark gave us a huge spark off the bench,
and I came off and came in and just finished the job off.  
With that being said, it's just not getting frustrated and just keep playing,
play through it.  
  
Q. I know you guys talked last night about not getting beat by a team three
times, but how much of it was that and how much of it was getting to the final
again and defending your title?  
DENZEL VALENTINE: Yeah, that was a big factor in today's game. At halftime
guys were looking a little down, and we kind of‑‑ me, Travis and B.J. just
kind of took the initiative of getting everybody motivated. We came out and we
played with more energy in the second half, and we came back against a great
team like Maryland.  
  
Q. Denzel, you made your one three ‑ball count there. Talk about that.   
DENZEL VALENTINE: Oh, yeah. We were going on a roll and I think we were down
10, and that put us up one. I knew we had just got a stop and we had momentum,
and I always want to be the one to get the lead or make that big shot. And we
called a play, and I came off the screen and just didn't think about it, just
let it go, and it went in, and that started off the spark. Everybody, Trav and
B.J. and everybody else just took over from then.  
  
Q. Branden and Travis, what does it say about a Denzel when he only scores
three points but affected the game in so many other areas that maybe get
overlooked because they don't appear on the stats sheet, please?  
BRANDEN DAWSON: Well, you know, I always tell Zel, myself and Coach, we always
tell Zel that just never let your offense affect your defense. And as far as
myself, I'm not the type of guy‑‑ if I don't score points, I'm going to come
down and get a rebound, get a defensive stop, just do something, just help me
out, so that's what Zel did tonight. The shots weren't there, but he just kept
battling and against Dez Wells, and I think that's really what stood out the
most, that he just kept battling and kept defending.  
TRAVIS TRICE: I think that just speaks to the type of player Denzel is. Other
guys might get down not hitting a shot until that point or not even taking one
really. But that's the kind of guy he is, he just rises to the occasion. He
did a lot of things that don't show in the stat sheet, but he also had seven
assists. I really think him and B.J. carried us down the stretch, just the way
he was controlling the game offensively, getting other people involved and
throwing inside to Matt. His stat sheet might not look crazy, but honestly he
was one of the key factors in why we won tonight.  
  
Q. Did you have any specific adjustments that you had to make at halftime to
slow down Melo after he started off strong in the first half?  
TRAVIS TRICE: He's a great player, but honestly we weren't getting back in
transition early on. A couple of his threes were walk‑in, wide‑open threes,
and that's something we got a jump on at halftime was not getting back in
transition.  
As a scorer, any time you can see one or two go through easy, it kind of gets
you rolling, so it's kind of hard to stop somebody at that point. Our thing
was we just had to get back in transition.  
  
Q. Branden, did the crowd help you guys today, and how many people did you
have coming from your hometown?  
BRANDEN DAWSON: Yeah, the crowd, they do a great job. Our family and friends,
they do a great job of just coming with that enthusiasm and just bringing that
spark for us. As far as that goes, I think they all do a great job of just
pushing us, getting into it. I think when we went on that run, Denzel threw
that amazing pass, I think that's what really‑‑ when the crowd really got into
it, so they definitely helped us out a lot.  
  
Q. How many people did you have here?  
BRANDEN DAWSON: I had about 13 people here, so just a lot of family and
friends. It's not too far from home, so it was good.  
  
Q. Tom, there may be a couple of games that you guys lost this year when
guys were not performing well and they let it affect other areas. To have
Dawson and Valentine both pick it up in struggling areas, what did that mean
about this team possibly peaking at the right time?  
COACH IZZO: Well, I told them you're going to get challenged a lot in your
life. They got challenged tonight and they got challenged by a hell of a team.
They got challenged by each other, they got challenged by their coaches, and
making mistakes isn't a sin and playing bad isn't a sin, but answering a
challenge is maybe the greatest thing that you can learn as a young person, to
realize it ain't easy. It's not easy. That's why there's only two left.  
A fitting two if you ask me. I think Bo and I have got the longevity record in
this league, and we've had some wars in the past. Give Turg credit, he did a
hell of a job in his first year out there, a hell of a job. I love Trimble and
I really like Dez Wells. He's just a tough, tough kid. But I thought the way
our guys responded showed some character, showed some grit. Hopefully it'll
help us down the road. Hopefully it'll help them for many years to come.  
  
Q. Following up on that guard question you got last night, what do you think
of Trimble? You said you loved him, but specifically?  
COACH IZZO: Well, you know, he has the ability to get into the lane it seems
like whenever he wants, but I think even since when we played him early, he
struggled a little bit. He probably owes me one because he was struggling from
the three by the time we played him the second time, and I think he went five
for six in the first half of that game and seems like ever since he`s really
been shooting the ball better. When he shoots the ball well, that brings a
whole other dimension to his game. He can get to the free‑throw line, he
doesn't miss, he can get in the paint. He can do a lot of different things.
He's got some size. He's got some strength. I'm a big fan.  
  
Q. Tom, you played Wisconsin two weeks ago, and they clinched the share of
the league title in Madison. What are your thoughts on getting another crack
at them?  
COACH IZZO: I think a lot of people would debate when you said we played them.
We were there. I'm not sure we played them. We didn't play very well, and it
was a hell of a night there with Senior Night and everything, and we didn't do
a very good job. I blame some of that on me. I did not think we had some
answers and adjustments that we made.  
I'm going to work a little harder today and see if we can come up with some
things because our players seem to respond to what we give them. I thought one
of the questions on Melo at halftime, we just kept talking about shrinking the
court, making him see six eyes instead of two or four and getting our bigs to
get up on those ball screens. You've got to make adjustments, and boy, we
didn't do a good job of that in the first half of the Wisconsin game. They
have so many different weapons. Koenig, I guess, had a big game today. I
didn't watch the game. I was too worried about our game, but my assistants
did, and Dekker has been playing well and Kaminsky is Kaminsky, and if you
don't like Gasser you don't like real people.  
They have a lot of people that are good. They're very well coached, and I
think it's great for the Big Ten that the two of us are playing. We've been in
some epic wars over the years, and I know I'm excited about the chance to play
them because we were kind of the dark horse.  
Just goes to show that we kind of hung in there all year and fought through a
lot of stuff, so here we are.  
  
Q. You mentioned earlier Marvin Clark stepping up and kind of sparking you
guys in the second half. How big is it to have a guy like that, especially a
younger guy step up at such a crucial time?  
COACH IZZO: You know, Marv idolizes B.J., and B.J. spends a lot of time with
Marv. As far as B.J., he`s a very intelligent player, but Marv brought us a
little more energy. His mom is here from Kansas City, I think the first time
she's seen him play was yesterday and today, and he just played with a little
bit more energy. That's what we tell our guys all the time; energy matters. I
don't know why B.J.‑‑ he takes the brunt of it because I think he has so much
to offer, but you've got to love him that he responded, and I think he said it
best. This time he didn't get down. Some of us got down on him, but he didn't
get down on him.  
I think for Marv, he saw that. We talked about it on the bench, and he just
brought some energy, the dunk, and the things he did, the offensive rebounds,
the defensive rebounds. He really did a good job in the minutes he played, and
he hasn't played a lot of minutes all year.  
  
Q. You were down 12 ‑1 to 23‑7\. I'd like to know what your message was, and
also, why does it seem like every one of these games a team gets way on top
but it means very little. At some point they all got very close the last three
or four games.   
COACH IZZO: You know, I'm not sure. I was disappointed. I thought two things,
though: I did not think we came out as strong as we needed to, but God, they
played good early, they made some shots. I think that's what the battles of
the Big Ten are. If you looked across the league all year, there were so many
tight games. You look at teams that struggled a little bit during the year,
Northwestern battled everybody, took us to overtime, Penn State has done an
incredible job with what they did, Michigan did a phenomenal job with the guys
they had injured, and everybody made it a battle because possessions matter in
this league, and I think nobody gets down.  
I think we've got a bunch of‑‑ it's a blue collar league, and that's what
happens to blue collar people. They never quit fighting.  
  
Q. You continue your success in March and this time you're the underdog. If
you had to tell a coach one thing or one way that you can get a team ready to
go and win some games into the tournament, what would you say?  
COACH IZZO: I'd say have incredible‑‑ it's a culture that's been developed,
not by me, but by the players that played here before. I say it all the time,
but it's Magic calling in this week, it's Steve Smith calling in. It's still
the same thing, and when they call me, they call the players.  
You know, like Denzel said it best in the locker room after: It's what you
expect here. But the mission is how do you live up to what the players have
done before you. That's not a coach. I mean, I love March for two reasons;
it's tournament basketball with chances to win a championship, and the weather
is getting nicer. Those two things. Days get longer and practice is over and
it's still sunny. It's just a phenomenal time of year.  
But I think because we have so many great alums that really look at this month
and they call from everywhere and they call our players, and our players, I
think, somewhat feel a little obligated. That's not a bad thing, you know, to
live up to the standards of the people that built the program. So I don't
give‑‑ my staff has done an incredible job. I give them credit on the quick
turnarounds, but boy, you've got to give all the players that were here before
that still care enough about this program, and that's made a difference why I
think we're good in March, so far.

_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  

Maryland  75  
Indiana - 69

  
COACH TURGEON: That was a really good win for us. I think Indiana is a really
good basketball team. They're really hard to guard. They're really hard to box
out because of their speed. I thought our guys were good from the very start
tonight.  
We do what we do. We're pretty good offensively, and then we'll take some
possessions off defense, but we were good, and I thought down the stretch, our
defense carried us. We couldn't score there for a while, and we defended and
rebounded better and played shots and played with great poise down the
stretch. Just another really good win for us.  
  
Q. You guys have played a lot of close games and won a lot of close games.
What makes you guys comfortable in those late ‑game situations when the score
is so tight?   
DEZ WILLIAMS: We're used to having to grind it out so that's kind of like the
stigma with the Big Ten. It's kind of grind‑it‑out kind of games with the
teams‑‑ especially like the teams like Purdue and stuff like that. We're used
to grinding it out and having to fight for every possession. This team is
battle‑tested. We've been through a lot of adversity this year, whether it be,
like, nagging injuries or people not being able to play because of injuries.
We've always had to adjust, so we're accustomed to that. Regardless of what
type of adjustments we have to make during the game, we're going to make them,
and we feel confident, and we know how to maintain our composure throughout
the game.  
MELO TRIMBLE: Yeah, just to pick up on what Dez said, we're used to it and
also we just believe in ourselves and believe in what Coach Turgeon tells us?  
  
Q. For Dez or Melo, can you talk about the contribution that Evan made off
the bench tonight, and how important that is for him as well as for you going
forward?  
MELO TRIMBLE: I mean, Evan played great today. He's was a good leader today.
He told me a lot of things that helped me throughout the game, and also just
his energy and him just being out there just made me want to play because he
was so excited. We all was, but Evan was ‑‑ I've never seen him play like
that.  
DEZ WILLIAMS: Evan is the leader. He's battled, he's been through this. He's
been in the Big Ten. He knows what it's all about. He's been in this
tournament before, so he understands the magnitude and the window of
opportunity that we have to do something really special in this tournament. He
understands it and he gets it, so whatever advice he can give any of us on the
team, he does that, and he's one of those guys that you know you can always
lean on, so Evan, he was a big part of our win today. His impact on the game
was second to none. We appreciate that. We're going to need more of that from
him.  
  
Q. Melo, a lot has been made all year about going head to head with Yogi.
Looking back over the last two months, did you become more comfortable playing
against him or on the floor against him over the course of the three
meetings?  
MELO TRIMBLE: Yeah, I played him twice, and I saw what he does best which is
use his speed. Basically just me having confidence in my defense and stepping
up playing defense was going to help me win this game, and that's what
happened.  
  
Q. Dez, what was kind of the key to slowing down Blackmon? He hasn't played
too well against you guys in all three games.  
DEZ WILLIAMS: You guard and you defend. You take on the challenge. That's what
we're all about. Whatever challenge anybody puts in front of us, we accept it
and we're going to meet it head on. It's all about competing with us. That's
all we want to do. That's really the only thing you have in this game is your
competitive edge and your work ethic. So we're ready for whatever challenges
that lie ahead of us. He's a great player. He'll be ‑‑ if he decides to stay
in college, he'll be a great player for however long he stays to be in
college. You know that's what we're about. We were competitive and we want to
win each game, but to his defense, I don't think he played his best game
today.  
  
Q. For Dez or Melo, Damonte got off to a great start today. Was that
something conscious going into the game? I think he scored the first five
points.  
DEZ WILLIAMS: Yeah, well, I think the tip play really got him going, the tip
play, and I saw how they were lined up in the tip play, and I looked at him
and I gave him the look, and I'm glad he got the tip. He got me the ball, and
he ran the floor like he was supposed to and got a foul, got to the free‑throw
line. We got him the ball early in the game, so that was really big for him,
his impact on the game. But Damonte, he's one of those guys, he's always going
to be ready for the game, he's always going to be pumped for it, and we need
that from him.  
  
Q. It seems like you guys can run your offense in the transition or in the
half court, too. What's your favorite kind of pace?  
MELO TRIMBLE: Just us playing fast and pretty much when Coach Turgeon lets me
call the card, that's basically the pace that we want to play at.  
DEZ WILLIAMS: And in practice when we're like going over things, he'll kind of
like try to confuse us. He'll call a secondary play and then he'll just throw
out, like, one of our set plays and stuff like that, so you've got to be ready
for adjustments at any time in the game, so I think that has a lot to do with
it.  
  
Q. For the players, both teams made a lot of shots in the first half. What
was the difference? I think you held them to 20 percent shooting the second
half.  
DEZ WILLIAMS: We were just, I guess, competing as hard as we can, tried not to
take any plays off. They're a heck of a team, too, man. They make it really
hard for us. But I guess it's just we wanted to win so bad. We're all focused,
we all bought into what Coach Turgeon wants from us this year, and it's a
special thing that we have. So whatever we have to do, we don't care. We just
want to get it done for each other and for Coach Turgeon.  
MELO TRIMBLE: Yeah, just in the second half we was really dialed in on defense
and we just wanted to put together a lot of stops.  
  
Q. What was the difference defensively in the second half for you guys?  
COACH TURGEON: You know, I thought we were better at guarding the basketball
in the second half. I thought the first half they got all the way to the rim.
I thought we played really smart around the rim, hands back, not fouling,
making them make tough shots, didn't help off‑shooters and they had to score
over us. I thought we rebounded a little bit better in the second half, and I
thought we did a great job of playing shots and trying to run guys off the
line. They missed a few they might normally make, but so did we. We were
tired. Very physical, up‑and‑down game, but our guys were dialed into
personnel.  
  
Q. Just to follow up on the question about Evan, how important is it for you
guys, how important is it for him and especially with Cekovsky not being able
to play? How big was that?  
COACH TURGEON: Yeah, just so you know Cekovsky had a stomach virus and tried
to play, but hopefully we'll have him tomorrow. It was great. You know, Evan
hurt his knee in the Wisconsin game, and Evan really hasn't felt comfortable
since then, but had his best practice of the year on Wednesday. It was good to
see. He's making better decisions, not forcing things. I thought defensively
he was very good, played smart defensively, his hands back and all the things
that he did defensively was great. So it's important for us, gives us more
versatility, and hopefully we'll get Cekovsky back tomorrow and be a little
bit deeper basketball team than we were today.  
  
Q. In that first game with Indiana, the perimeter defense wasn't great, they
hit 15 of 22 threes. Tonight they hit 7 of 24. How much better is your
perimeter defense now as compared to that first game in Indiana?  
COACH TURGEON: Well, it's a combination of things. I'm not sure many teams
could have beat them that night. They were really, really good. But since the
Indiana game at home, and I think we've won eight in a row now, our defense
has gotten better, I think teams are around 37 percent, 36 percent in those
eight games, and once we start rebounding the way we're capable of rebounding,
that number can go down even further. We've gotten better.  
  
Q. I know you're going to find out who you're going to play in a couple
hours, but you've got senior leadership versus a freshman phenom. Can you talk
about what you'll tell your players when you go back into the locker room?  
COACH TURGEON: Yeah, we're not going to worry about match‑ups. We're just so
darned excited we won a game. Got 27 wins now. This group has been phenomenal.
They played with great poise tonight, and things weren't going well, but they
knew they were going to win. We'll get out of here, do some ice baths and
things like that, we'll go back and eat and hopefully watch the second half.
Both two really good teams, big names, Michigan State and Ohio State. I'm just
glad we're in the Final Four. That's pretty cool.  
  
Q. A lot of coaches are using the Ken Pom numbers now. I don't know if
you're into that or not, but the one I wanted to ask you about was the luck
number. I wonder if you knew you were the luckiest team in America and what
you thought of that particular stat.  
COACH TURGEON: I'm the luckiest guy in America. If you know anything about me,
I've been lucky my whole life. If Ken Pom and his stats are saying I'm lucky,
then he's right, so good for him. But we're good, too.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 13, 2015

  

### [Shannon Scott](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25236)

### [Sam Thompson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25222)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  

Michigan State  76  
Ohio State - 67

  
Q. For each of you, you went through stretches in both halves where shots
weren't falling. It was 10 minutes in the first half, you made one or two, and
then five minutes without making in the second half. Was it their defense or
your execution? What was really to blame maybe in those stretches?  
SHANNON SCOTT: I mean, there's times where you don't make shots really. That
just happened to us. We had to get in better position to make shots. We rushed
a lot of shots, as well. We've got to do a better job as a team just getting
ready for those shots and sinking them.  
SAM THOMPSON: Yeah, what Shannon said.  
  
Q. Sam, Valentine said that some of the other top seeds in this tournament
had come out kind of flat in their first game, and they made it a point that
they wanted to come out with a lot of energy and punch you guys in the mouth
first. And I wondered as hard as they played at the beginning and the way they
executed, if they kind of got you guys back on your heels and playing from
behind?  
SAM THOMPSON: We were obviously playing from behind. I don't know how much
that had to do with them making it a point to come out and play well. We made
it a point to come out and play well. If we do so every game, we don't want to
play from behind, we want to play our best basketball at the beginning of the
game. They did a better job of that than we did.  
  
Q. Obviously you'll find out your NCAA assignment on Sunday. Just your
thoughts about having a chance to regroup and put a final bow on the season
with a run in the NCAA?  
SHANNON SCOTT: Yeah, man, it's win or go home. I'm not counting us out of
anything. I know the talent that we have on our team. I feel we can make a
great run, but we have to be ‑‑ we have to ready for it. We can't take any
days off and play lightly.  
SAM THOMPSON: Like he said, this is what all of us came to school for. This is
what all of us came to Ohio State for is to play basketball in the month of
March. We absolutely would like to be playing tomorrow, but we have a chance
to regroup. We have a chance to get back to Columbus and try and put one more
run together.  
  
Q. I'm wondering if you think that Big Ten games are called a little bit
different than NCAA Tournament games, and, if so, if that hurts Big Ten teams
in March.  
COACH MATTA: You know, I'm not sure. I've been in this league 11 years, and
that was amazing. I don't know. I mean, you hope not. You hope it doesn't hurt
us. But that was something else.  
  
Q. Thad, what was your ‑‑ how did you see the beginning of the game? You got
down by 16 in the first 10 or 11 minutes. You've obviously been in this
situation before. Was it the same old thing or was it more Michigan State
having to do with it this time?   
COACH MATTA: Yeah, we had a hard time running our offense, cutting and moving
and setting ball screens. I hadn't seen anything like that ever in the Big
Ten. But I think from the standpoint of where they got us was, it was either a
lay‑up or a three, and those were the things that we were trying to take away,
and they did a great job of running the floor. When you're struggling to score
as we were, the rebounds were coming to them and they were gone, and their
bigs did an excellent job of running the floor, and that definitely hurt us.  
They got us on the‑‑ we had just drawn up the play right before the start of
the game to watch for the double lob, they get the lob. It's like, geez, we
had to think. And that was probably the biggest thing I told our guys, you've
got to trust the system more in terms of what we're doing. We deviated some,
especially early, and it got us.  
  
Q. As I asked the players, just in your mind, it's been kind of a roller
coaster season for you guys, two steps forward, two steps backward, whatever.
Great last night, tonight not as good. Your thoughts as you try and regroup
one more time to go into the NCAA Tournament, what you feel this team can
accomplish?  
COACH MATTA: Well, I think from the standpoint of somehow, some way we've got
to find the right button or whatever it is to everybody playing their‑‑ at
their level, and it's not going to be perfect. We know that. But there's got
to be a level of consistency with what we're doing. As we told our guys, this
game with Michigan State, I don't know how many times we play, but it's runs,
it's runs, it's runs. One of the emphasis was trying as hard as we could not
to allow the runs, and I think that's something that ‑‑ getting down the way
we did in the first half, and I told the guys after the game, it can't happen.
I mean, we burn two timeouts in the first half to stop the runs.  
I think from the standpoint of what do we got to do, we got to get back and
paint the picture so everybody understands in terms of what's at stake. You
think they know, but they don't know. And you look at our two games up here
and break them down and get back to the‑‑ I don't want to say the basics, but
we can't make some of the mistakes we've made in these games up here.  
  
Q. Just one another thing. The one time ‑out looked like you were talking to
Scirotto or.  
Steratore for about a minute there. Was it a consistency thing where Sam
didn't get the call at one end, and then Trice, there was minimal contact at
the other, and was that the particular glaring incident in your mind that
typified the whole thing? You were also screaming at them. What was the
general beef, I guess?  
COACH MATTA: Honestly, I'd probably better be careful because I'm not very
happy right now with what I saw. I hadn't seen anything like that. It is what
it is. You know it's going to be a physical basketball game, but yeah, I was
just a little bit upset on one end to the other end and that sort of thing.  
But everybody did their best.  
  
Q. I was going to ask you kind of the same thing. You're probably trying to
say something you can't say, but safe to say ‑‑  
COACH MATTA: We've had 11 years together.  
  
Q. Is this the most physical game one of your teams has ever played in?  
COACH MATTA: Undoubtedly. Undoubtedly, yeah. No ifs, ands or buts about that.
Yes.  
  
Q. I was going to ask about that, too. Tom talked about ‑‑ was asked about
kind of a long conversation between you and him after the game. Can you talk
about what was said or what you were sharing or whatever?   
COACH MATTA: I think just‑‑ I have the utmost respect for Tom Izzo. Over time
we have become very good friends. I think that both of us are probably a
little bit excited it didn't come down to the last shot. But we talked‑‑ it
was more out of mutual respect, I think, in terms of‑‑ I think they got a
chance to make a run. I think he feels the same way that we do. I think we're
both kind of in agreement on what we saw out there tonight.  
But I just‑‑ I love those games against Michigan State, and I think he kind of
feels the same way, because we're both competitors, and they're typically
great basketball games. It's almost like a sigh of relief, we were like, whew.
Those are never easy for either one of us. Unfortunately they got the best of
us tonight.  
  
Q. When are you going to shave?  
COACH MATTA: You know, I don't know. My kids like it, so‑‑ I don't ever shave
in the off‑season. I always look like this in the off‑season. No, I'll
probably be cleaned up by the weekend. Thanks, guys.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 13, 2015

  

### [Sam Dekker](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25199)

### [Duje Dukan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28589)

### [Frank Kaminsky](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26750)

### [Bo Ryan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17045)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  

Wisconsin  71  
Michigan - 60

  
COACH RYAN: My opening statement is we're ready for questions.  
  
Q. Frank, I know you've played here many times, but what does it mean to you
to be a Chicagoland player and have family, friends, and have this tournament
your senior year in the Chicagoland area?  
FRANK KAMINSKY: It's awesome being able to come home and play in front of so
many friends and family. Duje and I are from this area and we have ties to
this arena. It's always awesome when you have a chance to play someplace like
this.  
  
Q. Frank, you had that unusual stretch where you missed a shot and a couple
turnovers. Talk about that a little bit if you could, and just going to the
bench. Was Coach Ryan punishing you or just giving you a little break?  
FRANK KAMINSKY: It was obviously a frustrating stretch. They took the lead
back and I just had to recuperate mentally and go back out on the court and
bring some energy.  
  
Q. Sam and Duje, can you address what got into you in the first half when
you got a little active? I think it started with a tip or play inside, and
then Duje, the same for you, it seemed in the second half it was your first to
kind of spark the team.  
SAM DEKKER: What we ‑‑ kind of were lacking energy a little bit in the first
half. We were playing harder than us, so some guys made some plays for us,
stepped up, brought the energy level of us up, and saw some opportunities to
attack and got some buckets going. Just tried to make it hard on them
defensively. It's something I've been working on, and I thought I did a better
job tonight.  
DUJE DUKAN: In the second half, Coach always preaches for the guys coming off
the bench to bring energy and contribute in any way possible. You know, the
opportunity presented itself where I got a wide open three to start it off,
hit that, and kind of carried my confidence throughout, and then just played
my game and tried to help us as much as we could to get this win.  
  
Q. Duje, you struggled a lot with your shot from January on into March and
then hit the one at Wisconsin and lost your confidence a little bit. Do you
have an idea of what was going wrong during that slump and why it's more
accurate now?  
DUJE DUKAN: Just missing shots. There's really no explanation for it. Coming
off the bench, obviously, there's going to be games where I might not shoot
the ball as well, so I just try to contribute in other ways. But yeah, I think
I've found it now and hopefully it's here to stay.  
  
Q. Sam, what type of challenge is it when a team you're playing against is
really playing like they have nothing to lose? Do you have to match that?  
SAM DEKKER: Yeah. You know, like I said, they had a lot of energy from the
start. It's not like they didn't have nothing to play for. They wanted to win
a few games here and win a Big Ten Tournament championship. I think that
should be the goal of everyone. They came out firing, and they were throwing
punches early, and they were doing a better job at that than us. So we just
had to counter that, and just try to withstand it and get a little run
ourselves, and I thought we did a pretty good job of getting a few runs,
extending the lead a little bit and then just holding them off.  
  
Q. Duje, you had that drive and slam, looked like maybe you were close to
getting a T. You were hanging on the rim a bit. Were you worried about that?  
DUJE DUKAN: Not really. I just thought it was a good play to get the guys
going a little bit, kind of a momentum swing. I didn't really worry about it.
It would have been a bad way to end it.  
  
Q. Frank talked about it a little bit, but obviously you have connections to
this arena, as well, and what does it mean to have a big game here?  
DUJE DUKAN: It's huge. Growing up as a kid, I came to games, I worked here as
a ball boy, shot around before games. It's always been a dream of mine to play
in an arena like especially this one, so to be able to come here and have a
good performance, it's definitely very, very encouraging.  
  
Q. Coach, Irvin had 21, but a lot of the shots he hit were contested. How do
you think you defended him?  
COACH RYAN: I thought we made him work pretty hard. You know, sometimes a
person answers the challenge and hits some of his own. You know, sometimes you
look at number of points on number of shots, and seeing as he didn't get any
from the free‑throw line, then his numbers are pretty good. To get 21 points
on 18 shots and not have any free throws‑‑ so he had a good game. He earned
it. He earned every point‑‑ we tried to make him earn every bucket he had.  
  
Q. What do you take from this game other than a victory?  
COACH RYAN: Well, by the way, there was a guy underneath Duje when he first
dunked and then swung back, there was a Michigan player right there. He wasn't
going to get a T on that one because he wasn't able to come straight down. You
remember those days.  
What do we take from this you ask? We get to play another 40 minutes down here
in Chicago in a great venue, and your supporters that bought the tickets, they
get to be here another‑‑ that's pretty exciting. I brought a James Patterson
novel hoping to stay here a few days. I did.  
  
Q. One of the key plays was when Frank was prone on the floor and kept the
rebound alive and Dekker ended up scoring to conclude the possession. Is that
just an indication of what kind of basketball instincts he has and the
intangibles he brings to the team that can't be necessarily judged by pure
numbers?  
COACH RYAN: He's just an all‑around player. He's a gamer. He understands every
little thing in a game ends up being something on this sheet or leads to
something on this sheet. You never have to explain too much to him. He just
had a couple rough spots there. Once he collected himself and got‑‑ hey, he
was ready to go. Some guys pout. He didn't pout. He went back out there and
played.  
  
Q. Is this team playing better than it was at this time last year, and if
so, in what ways?  
COACH RYAN: Well, I don't know. Sometimes you would hope that experience can
help you. We ran into a buzz saw in the Big Ten Tournament last year, Michigan
State got healthy and they had everybody. They were ready to go. So now we'll
see who we play next. We got bumped in the semis, now we'd like to get
something done in the semis because it's next.  
I don't compare. I don't like to compare and contrast. I just want to give
these guys their shot, their chance, and it's up to them to take advantage of
it.  
  
Q. I know you want to win the championship to win the championship, but does
any part of your motivation coincide with trying to get the highest NCAA
Tournament seed possible?  
COACH RYAN: It hasn't been mentioned once, in the locker room, in any
conversations with the players, with the coaches. I've always figured that if
you just take care of business that people in the know will know what to do
with your team. That's all we can do. We can control our destiny simply by
playing well on every possession, and if that's good enough, then so be it. If
it's not, then we just‑‑ all we know is we're going to be playing in the NCAA
Tournament, and the rest is wait and see.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 13, 2015

  

### [Branden Dawson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25081)

### [Tom Izzo](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13984)

### [Travis Trice](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26853)

### [Denzel Valentine](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26969)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  

Michigan State  76  
Ohio State - 67

  
COACH IZZO: Well, I think the first thing is it's unbelievable that we had a
16‑point lead a couple times on a very good team, and our assist to field
goals was off the charts, 23 out of 29, the unselfishness, the fact that
Branden and even Zel were flirting with a triple‑double and there's only been
a couple in the history of our school, and I think both of them should have
had one if they would have done a little bit more. And then Travis had that
stretch in the second half where he was just shooting it. So each one of our
three amigos here that need to play well had stretches where they were
unbelievable, and that's why you win games.  
We made some mistakes. We got a little fatigued. I think the week off that we
had had some good to it and some bad. We're still struggling a little bit with
some of our subs at times, but to win a game like that, not decisively but to
be in control more of it against a very, very good team, I'm pleased.  
  
Q. You all know Tom talks about it doesn't matter who starts but who
finishes, and when money time came up tonight your stats will all be seen but
Marvin's won't. Talk about having him in there at the end of the game?  
TRAVIS TRICE: Marvin did a good job. He's been doing great the last couple
weeks for us stepping up. You see at the Indiana game he came up big for us
and even in this game. Marv does a lot of things that doesn't show up on the
stat line, like where he dove on the floor to get the loose ball, or he gets
an offensive rebound and we come down and score. He gets a lot of credit for
this win.  
  
Q. Travis or Denzel, Ohio State has had a problem all season, they get down
by double digits in the first half, and I wonder just the way you guys played
the first half, did you want to come out and punch them in the mouth and get
them down quick and put them away?  
DENZEL VALENTINE: Yeah, we noticed that, you know a big emphasis was that the
top seeds in this tournament came out a little flat and Coach preached about
how we wanted to be different. We just came out with a lot of energy and we
were making plays.  
  
Q. You guys have played on this team for a while and know that this time of
year is special. What was it like to kind of start that off tonight with a big
win?  
BRANDEN DAWSON: You know, it felt good. We have a young team, and as far as
myself, Travis and Denzel, we just have to lead these guys. For us to come out
and get a huge win against a great team, a disciplined team, it was great for
us.  
  
Q. Branden, being a senior, can you just talk about what that means to you,
potentially playing in your last Big Ten Tournament game tonight and coming
out with a victory?  
BRANDEN DAWSON: It was great. We came out and it was just a focus point that
we had at the beginning of the game, and we were really prepared by our coach,
Tom Izzo. He's a great coach, and we were definitely well prepared.  
You know, just my last time with Travis, it feels great to get a win. We just
have another chance to win a Big Ten championship.  
  
Q. At halftime Thad Matta said this was one of the most physical games he's
been in coaching in the Big Ten. Was that what you wanted to do, come out and
play physical against Ohio State?  
TRAVIS TRICE: Definitely. Ohio State is a talented team. I mean, they're
talented from top to bottom, and we knew that we had to come out and be
physical and kind of make the first punch, and that's what we kind of did in
the first half. We knew we had to come out and we had to be physical with them
because they're a really talented team.  
  
Q. Branden, you missed the last game and a half of the year, but to pick it
up the way you did tonight statistically, what changed tonight? What was your
approach?  
BRANDEN DAWSON: My approach was ‑‑ it was kind of different. I always have a
different approach, different mind sets towards every game and wasn't able to
play the last game, so I knew that my team needed me. So despite how I was
feeling or anything, you know, I just told my teammates that I was going to
come and play, and that's what I did, along with Travis and Denzel with the
performance they had.  
  
Q. You guys have had a few Big Ten Tournament runs and March runs in recent
years. What is it about you guys that makes you turn it up a level if
something clicks this time of year?  
DENZEL VALENTINE: Yeah, this is a big time of year for us. This is where
Michigan State basketball has made their history, and we want to keep the
tradition going. We don't want to be the ones that let the former players
down. That's a big emphasis, and when it comes March, everybody plays better,
and our focus is a little bit more, and we want to win.  
BRANDEN DAWSON: Also on that you've got to give our coaches a lot of credit
too. Our coaches, our managers, they do a great job of preparing us every day
and every week, whether it's breaking down other teams' film, preparing us a
lot of that goes on our coaching staff.  
  
Q. Tom, you always say it matters who finishes. You had Marvin there in
crunch time. Would you talk about his performance, please?  
COACH IZZO: Well, they went real small, and God, we did some things that were
so good, and we did some things that were, to be honest with you, not so good.
We decided we had to switch 5 at the end, we didn't want to give up a three,
and I thought Marv did a pretty good job. B.J. did a great job of that, and
it's funny because I think we're the least physical team we've been in the
last 15 years, and I think games that we played against Purdue and that, made
it a little bit more so for us, and Marv is a kid that can be physical, and
got a couple big rebounds.  
I was happy for Marv. I think his mom came in, first time she saw him play, so
that was awesome, too.  
  
Q. D'Angelo Russell had a quiet 19 tonight. What can you say about limiting
his play ‑making ability?  
COACH IZZO: Well, as you can see, we call it‑‑ I don't know if it's the Jordan
rules, but it's my version of them, where he always should be looking at four
or six eyes. Anytime he touches the ball, we wanted him to look up and see at
least four, maybe six eyes, which means we were helping on both sides. He's a
phenomenal player, he really is. I thought we made him work for his stuff
pretty good, and that was our goal. But boy, there were times he just put us
on his heels. He missed a couple good shots early, I thought, and we made some
shots early, and that was the difference in the game.  
  
Q. You faced the highlight of it tonight, but I'm wondering what your
impressions of the class of freshman guards that have been in this league this
year, and do you feel like maybe the Big Ten is starting to recruit at an even
higher tier of guard talent?  
COACH IZZO: Well, I think it's sure got some good guards in this league. I
think a lot of teams got very good players. You look at Indiana tonight, and
of course Maryland, and there's no one better than this kid, D'Angelo. So who
knows what it is. I mean, I don't think anybody thought Melo was going to be
what he was, and so sometimes it's what you recruit, sometimes it's how you
coach, sometimes it's the right system, and sometimes a guy just makes
enormous improvement from the end of his senior year to the beginning of his
freshman year. I don't know, we face another great one tomorrow, so ask me
after that one. I'll tell you. I'll give you a better answer.  
  
Q. It looked like you had a bit of an exchange with Coach Matta in the
handshake line. What was that all about?  
COACH IZZO: We were just talking about how hard this job is, and we both kind
of agreed with each other. We've had some incredible games over the last, I
don't know, 10, 12 years, whatever, he's been there, and there's a lot of
respect between the two programs. I just told him to go make a run in the
tournament.  
They didn't play as well. You know, they didn't play as well. Some of it was
us, some of it was them. They made shots early when they were put under
pressure. The guy that I think is impressing me more and more, he didn't shoot
it great, but I Shannon Scott has really improved for them, too. They're like
us a little bit that we struggle at the post sometimes and it's just a shame
because Loving is a very good player, just hasn't been the same. We talked
about that a little bit because we've all been through it. So it was a
friendly exchange.  
  
Q. When they got it to five with three minutes left and they started fouling
you on every possession, with what you've been through this season at the free
‑throw line, what was going through your mind?   
COACH IZZO: You think I can say that here? (Laughter). I could try. I'll lie.
I was thinking, gee whiz, do I use reverse psychology and tell my guys to miss
the free throw like we did at Indiana, or do I stick to my guns and say would
you please make it and fall to my knees or would I threaten? I had three
choices, and I just‑‑ I don't know, we made a couple of them, so I decided to
just stay out of it.  
  
Q. You have Maryland in 15 hours, so having literally played them twice,
does it help because you've got to give guys ‑‑  
COACH IZZO: We actually played them‑‑ I think was it last year? That's the one
funny thing, and it's the same for them. That's one hard thing about the
tournament, to play in that short a time. I wish we could do something about
that, but it's kind of hard with TV and everything, so we do what we can do.
But they've got almost the same situation. We'll see what we can do. We'll
have some fun tonight, and I'll tell you, if there's a better thing to do
during March Madness than to stay up all night and work, it's the greatest
thing there is. I really mean that sincerely. I love the moment, I love the
opportunity. I'm getting a little old for it, but it's still a lot of fun.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  

Purdue  63  
Penn State - 59

  
COACH PAINTER: Well, I thought this was kind of a typical, you know,
tournament game. When it comes to playing in the half court, being able to
play half court defense, it did worry me being down 11 at one time, just
because there's fewer possessions in games like this, but our guys hung in
there, and we really played well at the end of the first half to cut it to
five. I thought that was a big stretch for us.  
We've been able to start a lot of second halves and kind of have a flurry or
have a run and make them call time‑out. And when that didn't happen, we
struggled a little bit for a couple minutes, and then we just kind of hung in
there. It seemed like it stuck on one score for a long time. But I just
thought our defense and our rebounding in the second half was really good. If
you look at their percentages and what they shot, it was even or we were one
up or one down at the half. And to be able to out‑rebound them by nine for the
game, I thought probably was the difference. But our half court defense was
really good.  
At times when the ball doesn't go in for us, we press a little bit, and we've
got to do a better job of just being patient and moving the ball and making
the defense break down. This was a huge win for us, and we're also very
fortunate from the fact that this was Penn State's third game in three days.
They've done an unbelievable job, and Pat Chambers is a great coach, great
guy, and D.J. Newbill is very, very difficult to stop. You tell your guys to
do certain things, and he still makes shots.  
I thought Ray and Jon did a good job on him. With guys like that, we always
want their shots taken, their total to be right around how many points they
get, so he takes 18 shots and gets 19 points, and when you deal with someone
that talented and that skilled, we'll live with that.  
  
Q. Ray, just as Matt said, you made Newbill take 18 shots to get his 19
points. What was kind of working for you guys in terms of really making him
work and containing him?  
RAPHEAL DAVIS: I think just staying into him, and when he passed the ball,
just try to make it hard for him to get it back. I think I went out the game,
made some fouls, and Jon did an unbelievable for job for the rest of the game.
And hats off to him because he's a tough cover, he's a great player, and Jon
stuck in there and he fought hard. I think Jon wore him out, and then when I
got back on him, his legs weren't under him anymore. But just getting to him
early and not letting him get many touches was big for us.  
  
Q. Ray, how did it change the game when A.J. kind of stepped up the way he
did, both offensively and then the way he was changing it defensively down the
stretch?  
RAPHEAL DAVIS: A.J. is a game changer on both ends of the floor. He was huge
for us. I've been telling him since we were younger, you can change games
whenever you want to. I went out and I told him, I pulled him aside, I told
him it's time for him to take over, and that's exactly what he did. You could
see by the way he played, his numbers and things like that, he was a big
factor in today's game?  
  
Q. Ray, are you okay after diving over press row, and what's going through
your head and you're flying into the tables and computers and everything
else?  
RAPHEAL DAVIS: I was just trying to get the save. I hope I didn't break
anybody's computer, but I wanted to get the save and get the ball. I think it
led to them turning it over, something like that, I think we got the ball
back, so I was just out there trying to play hard.  
  
Q. You guys had a huge rebounding advantage today, and at the end you had
about a 90 ‑minute possession where you came up with a few offensive rebounds.
What was working so well on the boards for you today?   
A.J. HAMMONS: Pretty much Coach stressed before ‑‑ yesterday when we was
walking through, it was just stressing rebounding, rebounding. They got a
couple key rebounds, a couple put‑backs, and it was something we had to step
up. Ray told me I had to step up. We just told everybody to make sure they
boxed their man out. If I had to go block a shot, just come over there and
help. We just need everybody to rebound and things, and that's what we did.  
  
Q. A.J., can you talk a little bit about the match ‑up against Jordan
Dickerson? He had a pretty good game overall today. Did he make anything
difficult over there?  
A.J. HAMMONS: He made sure I didn't go to the middle. He was just trying to
take away middle so they could help on the baseline, so it was ‑‑ pretty much
I just tried to push him up and really just get that baseline catch and then
just go up with it and make sure I keep it high. It was just something he kept
doing the whole game, making sure I couldn't go middle, I had to spin back
into their help. So it was just ‑‑ so I'm just getting better position and
then just hitting them first, and then we got the win pretty much.  
  
Q. A.J., your team has a quick turnaround before you play Wisconsin. What's
the biggest challenge for you going up against Kaminsky and going on short
rest?  
A.J. HAMMONS: Be ready as soon as the game start. Be ready as soon as the game
starts, rebound, make sure I have great close‑outs, make sure I respect every
player on the court because everybody can play.  
  
Q. A.J., have you ever felt this confident on the floor before?  
A.J. HAMMONS: Yeah, there's a couple games I felt confident. Not as much as
just ‑‑ like, I know my teammates have trust in me to do something‑‑ I put in
the work, so I feel like the shots should fall. It's just confidence level,
I'd say my confidence comes from probably hitting a jump shot or something
like that, more around the basket, so that brings my confidence up a lot.  
  
Q. Ray, there was that stretch there the last couple minutes where you guys
ran the shot clock down three consecutive times. How important was that to
shorten the game that way? I don't know if it broke their spirit or whatever,
but whatever impact it might have had on Penn State.  
RAPHEAL DAVIS: Like I said, I think Jon did a great job. Coach said it before,
I think Jon is one of the best rebounding guards in the country, if not the
best. He got two huge offensive rebounds in that stretch and was smart enough
to bring it out. He's a veteran guard. He was smart enough not to force
anything and running another 30 seconds off, get another rebound, run another
30 seconds off, then I think we got another rebound, then we ran another 30
seconds off. Possessions like that, when you're on defense, you're just like‑‑
you want to give into it. They're a good defensive team, but I don't know how
many good defensive teams can be good in the half court for a minute and 30
seconds. I mean, I think they broke down at the end, and we got something
good.  
  
Q. I'd like to invite you both to answer this. Early season losses, they
kind of ‑‑ they're hard to shake because people look at the résumé when they
judge teams. Of course you won 12 Big Ten games, you're in the semis of the
Big Ten Tournament. Do you feel like you're still having to prove that you're
a good team, that you're worthy and all that?   
RAPHEAL DAVIS: Just take it one game at a time. Those games are over with. Of
course you're going to think back on them, but we're in March, so there's
nothing we can do about it. Tomorrow is the biggest game of our season. We've
got to look at tomorrow as the biggest game of our season. We can't worry
about our résumé, we can't worry about the NCAA Tournament. We're in Chicago
at the Big Ten Tournament, and our focus right now is on Wisconsin.  
A.J. HAMMONS: Like Ray said, just pretty much the most important game is the
next game. They're a hard team, and I feel like we do have something to prove.
We started off last in the Big Ten, and we just worked our way up, so it's
something we've got to keep doing. Hopefully we make it.  
  
Q. A.J., Ray's foul trouble in the first half, how did you guys adjust, and
did that affect your play early on when you guys got down by 11?  
A.J. HAMMONS: Just not having the Player of the Year out on the court, it
hurts our team a little bit, but we've got great guys. Josh stepped up, gave
us good minutes just defensively, and whoever switched off on him, we do a lot
of switching, so whoever switches off on him did great. He was hitting shots
over everybody that were contested, so we've got to live with those, but after
really just‑‑ we just had to keep rebounding.  
  
Q. A.J., the conversation that Rapheal said where he told you he was coming
up and you had to go in and step up, do you remember that, and did that sort
of inspire you to go in and bring something else to the court?  
A.J. HAMMONS: I'm not trying to take away from Ray, but no, it didn't inspire
me. I heard what he said, but‑‑  
RAPHEAL DAVIS: I was just in the moment. I was in the moment. I've been around
A.J. so long, I know when to say things to him and when not, and I knew at
that point in time he wasn't listening, I just wanted to talk to somebody.  
A.J. HAMMONS: No, I just knew I had to come out and step it up. We were down
and Coach was getting on me a little just talking about rebounds, get better
post position, make sure you run to the basket instead of block, so it was
things like that. So my teammates was trusting me, they just kept passing the
ball, so I knew I had to do something with it, and I did.  
  
Q. Matt, were you discouraged at all back in December, Gardener, Webb, North
Florida, were you discouraged at all, and do you feel differently about your
team now?  
COACH PAINTER: Well, sure, you're disappointed more than anything when you
have some tough losses. But you can also learn from them and get better. You
have a choice. We got picked 12th, I think, in the Big Ten, so it wasn't like
people were saying, hey, you got picked third or fourth in the Big Ten and
here's where you are. But I liked our team. I liked the makeup of our team,
and even at that point.  
To their defense, I was trying to play too many people and trying to really
establish some depth. I had five freshmen. I had a guard that I knew was a
good player. I didn't know what he was ‑‑ in Jon Octeus. You've got to
understand he came on October 4th, and I wasn't playing him enough, and he
really helps us rebound. Look today, he's a point guard, he gets 11 rebounds,
he plays the whole game, he gets one turnover. He just does a lot of little
things to help you win.  
From that point on, I played Rapheal Davis more and I played him more and
they're two good perimeter defenders. I thought Hammons really turned it on
after the Illinois game, and that's really helped us in the later part of
January and the whole month of February and March, and he's been really good.
So the combination of those things has allowed us to play better since that
point.  
But we still beat BYU at NC State before those two losses, so a lot of people
don't mention that. There's nothing wrong with mentioning it, but mention the
positives too. When you see the talking heads talking about you got beat by
these two people, well, mention the fact that we beat BYU and they're pretty
damned good. Mention the fact that NC State, we beat them and they've beaten
Duke, beaten Louisville, and they're really good. Even though they had a tough
game yesterday, they're a really good team and they could do some damage in
the NCAA Tournament.  
That's what I kept telling our guys. When you're down and out ‑‑ if you're not
any good, how did you beat BYU? If you're not any good, how did you beat NC?
Just trying to drive some confidence in them and just be better defensively.
We were possibly the worst defensive team in our league non‑conference. Go
look at the numbers, and we're possibly the best defensive team in our league.
If we could rebound a little bit better, I think we would. There's just some
games we don't do a good job rebounding the basketball.  
  
Q. You might have mentioned this in your opening remarks, but did you feel
like you needed to bring fatigue to the game seeing as how Penn State was
playing the third game in three days?  
COACH PAINTER: I thought it would come into play. If you look at their stat
line, it's only three turnovers, so that's unbelievable. Playing three games
in three days, they don't play a lot of people. You have to give them credit
because that's some discipline there of being able to play on that third day
and not turn the basketball over.  
I thought fatigue came into play. I thought that 90‑second possession we had
‑‑ with the two offensive rebounds, I thought fatigue got in there. I thought
we were just a little quicker to the basketball in that stretch. I thought
they missed a couple shots that they had been making, especially in the first
half against us. But I didn't think we brought it, I just thought it was
there, because we don't play a lot of people at this point, either.  
  
Q. What's the biggest challenge in facing Wisconsin on short rest, and what
did you learn from the game up in Madison?  
COACH PAINTER: Well, I think facing Wisconsin on any rest is a difficult task.
I don't care if you have two weeks.  
I think what we learned is the same thing we knew before. They're really,
really talented. They can hurt you in a lot of ways. They have good size with
versatility that can drive the basketball, they can post. They're probably the
best team in the country in isolations and making decisions out of their
isolations. He doesn't get the credit that he deserves in terms of what
they're actually doing out there. Everybody just thinks it's a swing offense
and it's a system, but those guys are in isolations 75 percent of the time.
And then however you choose to defend those, they've seen it all, and they're
great passers. And any time you have size that can dribble, pass and shoot and
share the basketball and you throw a lot of skill around it, you're going to
be dangerous to play against.  
They have an explosion to them now with this group of guys that they haven't
had before. They had a guy before that could go make plays. Now they've got a
lot of guys that can go make plays, so it's a different‑‑ it's not a
traditional‑‑ the traditional Wisconsin team is still really tough to go
against. Now you're throwing the best player in the country in that mix. Sam
Dekker is 6'10", he can drive the basketball, Nigel Hayes is 6'9", 240, he can
dribble, pass and shoot, and then you have Bronson and Josh Gasser and I could
go on forever. It's a tough cover. When you make mistakes, they score, and you
have to be able to defend them, keep them in front of you, and then you can't
allow second chance opportunities. If you're going to do that, then normally
it's an early night for you.  
  
Q. Penn State shot 27 percent in the second half. What was working better
for you defensively, or did you feel like maybe they wore down a little bit?
How do you look at what happened in the second half?  
COACH PAINTER: I don't think there was anything different. I thought they made
tough shots in the first half. I thought we had a couple breakdowns, but for
the most part I thought they made tough shots. They didn't get fast break
shots. Ross Travis had three offensive rebounds and I thought that hurt us,
but I just thought those guys made some difficult shots, and then in the
second half they didn't make as many.  
  
Q. A year ago at this time people were asking about A.J., and you said he
had to come to ‑‑ the next progression for him was going to be winning. How
close did he come to fulfilling that this year, being an integral part of this
team's success?  
COACH PAINTER: I think he's done it. He's been someone we could count on, and
that was something before. The frustrations that the media has or our fans
have or I have with him is the same. Now he's consistent. And he'll have some
bad nights here and there, but who doesn't. Who doesn't? He's been really
consistent for us these last 12 games or so of the Big Ten and somebody that
you can get the basketball to and not turn it over. You can rely on ball
screen defense, on him doing what he's supposed to be doing, and then he's
playing with some energy, and before it took like back‑to‑back good plays to
get him going. Now he kind of gets himself going and he's ready to play and
he's talking even maybe if a shot doesn't go down.  
  
Q. An emotional ending to D.J. Newbill's Big Ten career. Do you see him
playing at the next level at all?  
COACH PAINTER: I think he has an opportunity. Any time you can put the ball in
the basket like that‑‑ he makes difficult shots, and he's just a flat‑out
scorer. Whether he can become a big point, play off the ball, I think that's
going to be kind of a question. I think he can. I think he could be like a big
point, more of a lead guard type guy, but any time you can put the ball in the
basket like that and you've got a good, physical athletic frame‑‑ he's going
to be in a camp, there's no doubt about it, and he'll get his opportunity. He
might be one of those guys that's got to grind it for a year or two, find his
way through overseas or the D‑League to get there. Each guy has got a
different journey, but there's no doubt he has the skill set to be right
there. It's a close call.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  

Maryland  75  
Indiana - 69

  
COACH CREAN: Well, we just went toe to toe with the eighth‑ranked team in the
country and came down to the very end with them in the last eight minutes of
the game. There were three field goals scored until our kid Max Hoetzel hit a
three with two seconds to go between both teams.  
First and foremost, we understand that we've got to play defense at a high
level and energy and a hustle game at a high level, and I think we've come to
Chicago and done that. Unfortunately we're walking out of here without the win
today, but we're getting better. Our defense has gotten better. We got a lot
of really good basketball from a lot of people. We needed to get better inside
of the game in the second half, we did. The second chance points in the first
half were 13‑3, and we held them ‑‑ we got nine in the second half, they got
none, all right, that's an improvement. We got to the foul line more in the
second half.  
I'm walking out of here knowing that our defense is getting better, our energy
is high. No doubt we missed Hanner today, especially around the rim, and Nick
Zeisloft according to the Ken Pomeroy rankings is the Number 1 ranked offense
efficiency player in the country. It's very uncommon for him not to have a
good game or back‑to‑back good games. Offensively he didn't, but he's going to
keep getting better. We've got some guys did some really good things, but
unfortunately so did they, and we went against an extremely good team.  
Dez Wells is not only one of the elite players in our league, he's one of the
elite players in the country, and for a lot of reasons. He can score, he can
pass, he can drive it, he can defend, he can get out in transition, he's
tough, and he makes every one of his teammates better, and that's a hard
position to cover when they have as many shooters and somebody like Melo
Trimble and people like that.  
But I'm proud of our players. I'm proud of the way we've approached the week.
I'm proud of the way we responded to a couple of tough games at the end, and
with a team like this, the youth that they have, the fact that they're getting
better this time of year is a very encouraging thing for us.  
  
Q. This is for both of you guys. Considering the statements that coach made,
can you talk about how you're going to take this opportunity for the NCAA
Tournament if you do end up getting in there?  
YOGI FERRELL: Yeah, if we're fortunate to get into the NCAA Tournament, we're
going to try and ride with these two games that we played with here. I like
the way we played, I like the way we fought for both games, moving the ball,
playing great defense, rebounding for our team, and hopefully we've done
enough to make the tournament. If not, then so be it. But if we do, we feel
like that we can play the same way going into these next games.  
TROY WILLIAMS: Yeah, just like Yogi said, hopefully we do make it. We're going
to stick to the game plan, keep playing the stuff that we did the past two
games. Like we said, it's a new season.  
  
Q. Troy, a couple of us noticed after the game you had a very emotional
conversation with Coach Crean. Would you be willing to share what was going on
there?  
TROY WILLIAMS: Coach Crean was just like another father figure to me. I'm away
from my family, so I see him as a mentor, a father, not only as a coach or a
friend, I see him as more, and we just had a father‑to‑son conversation.  
  
Q. At this time of year, some coaches feel the need to plead their case to
the selection committee. Do you feel like the résumé you guys have speaks for
itself?  
COACH CREAN: Oh, absolutely, I think it does, and when you look at the body of
work and factor the things in, and I really hope our league gets factored in.
Obviously there's a lot of really good teams in this league, and what I'm
encouraged about right now, we're getting better, and the good news with
Hanner‑‑ it wasn't good news today, but the good news with the Hanner
situation is that it is not nearly what it appeared to be. It's still
day‑to‑day, but it's our feeling that's not going to last very long at all. He
was even able to go out onto the court today and do some things. He couldn't
have played today, and I doubt he could have played tomorrow if we would have
won.  
But moving into next week ‑‑ I love their attitude. They're getting better.
They've been resilient all year long. We've asked a lot of them all year long,
and they've had to cover a lot of ground and make up for some deficiencies
when it comes to inside play and things of that nature, and I love the
improvement. When we look at the improvement a kid like Troy has made on the
boards this year and the leadership that Yogi has brought, and the amount of
minutes that Robert and James have played. And Nick Zeisloft, like I said, you
look at those Ken Pom numbers, he's the No.1 ranked offensive efficiency
player and didn't have a very good two games.  
But I love our team and the bottom line is we hope to be playing basketball
next week. We hope we get the opportunity to play in that tournament. But I
love the improvement, and I hope it showed over the season, and I certainly
hope it showed over the last two games.  
  
Q. I wanted to ask you about the conversation a couple of us noticed that it
was very emotional and you took him aside. What was that about basically?  
COACH CREAN: Well, he's growing so much, and he's been through a lot, and he's
been‑‑ he's just improving so much, and to me, I know we have a special talent
there, but more importantly, we have a very special young man who just needs
to continue to grow in all aspects of the game and understand what he's
capable of, and he's gaining so much ground. But when you have somebody like
that that's as smart as he is and that's as talented as he is, you want to
keep making sure you're pushing all the right buttons for him to keep
improving.  
But that's ‑‑ the bottom line is that he just keeps improving on both ends of
the court, and it really is just really about that, that when he really locks
into getting better, and he locks into being where he needs to be‑‑ and really
it's about taking the next step defensively for him because look what he's
done with the rebounding, look what he's done with his efficiency, look at his
shot making today. That's basically what it is.  
I'm proud of his improvement, but as his coach and his leader, I want to keep
pushing him to an even higher plane, just like I would with everybody else,
and that's basically what it was.  
  
Q. I'm wondering if you can talk a little bit about all the freshman guards
that are in the league this year, not just the depth but really the elite tier
of talent that there is, and do you remember a year where there were so many
talented freshman guards?  
COACH CREAN: No, no. The answer to the last part of your question, I can't‑‑
where there's that many guys that are capable of doing it. And I look at
Robert Johnson, he isn't getting nearly the credit some of the other ones get,
and I wouldn't trade him‑‑ he just keeps getting better. Brian McIntosh is
somebody that was in the state of Indiana. We had James and Robert and I've
always followed Bryant and he's all All‑Freshman player and going to be a
fantastic guard in this league. And that doesn't even count DeAngelo and James
and certainly Melo Trimble.  
I think it's a sign of how strong the league is. I think it's a sign of ‑‑
there's no question that adding Maryland and Rutgers into the league has
opened up a completely different avenue. We were already recruiting out east
and recruiting different parts of the country, but what it's done is it's
brought that much of a broader scope for people to go anywhere in the country
to bring players into their program, and I think the thing that‑‑ we didn't
have it this way. We had Yogi, which really helped with this, but Melo Trimble
gets to do a lot of good things because Dez Wells is so good, because Jay
Layman is so good. DeAngelo gets to do a lot of really good things because
they've got some inside players, Shannon Scott there, Thompson there, and
Bryant McIntosh does a great job of playing alongside who I think is an
All‑League guard in Tre Demps and I know I'm probably missing some other guys.  
But the Big Ten with the exception of a couple of us‑‑ Michigan is not very
old, we're not very old‑‑ but the Big Ten is usually a league that has a lot
of older players and the experience never really drops, so that helps those
guys come in and be factors and gives them a lot of confidence and a lot of
freedom because they've got people to get the ball to and people to help them
understand what they need to do defensively.  
  
Q. The first half was explosive. It was very ‑‑ I don't know how else to put
it. And then both teams kind of slowed down. What were the adjustments you
made to make that happen?  
COACH CREAN: I think it slowed down on purpose. I think it was a matter of
making sure‑‑ we need to get to the foul line, okay. And the other thing is we
don't have very good match‑ups for Dez Wells, and so it was really we're going
to make sure we're moving the ball, getting people in movement. If you
noticed, they really weren't guarding Troy very high at all in the first half,
and they really backed up and he hit those pull ups when we went into the ball
screen. So we wanted to make sure we kept the game in movement so then that we
could get into things, the 15‑second area, the 13‑second area, but still very
good running in the break running our early offense.  
But I thought our pace was excellent. I thought their conditioning was
excellent, our conditioning was excellent, and so it was a matter of whatever
the speed of the game called for was fine. But I think at the end of the game,
like I said at the beginning, in those last eight minutes, I know there's some
free throws obviously, but in the last eight minutes to have three combined
field goals‑‑ I believe, I was told that number before I came in‑‑ but three
field goals in the last eight minutes before a shot with two seconds says a
lot about the high level of play defensively, and that's why I'm proud of our
guys. We were going toe to toe with them. They made a couple more plays than
we did.  
Certainly the free throw situation, that hurt us, and nobody feels worse than
Troy on that. That hurt us. But we tried to recover from it. But it was just a
hard‑fought game, and both teams probably intensified their half court
defensive efforts a little bit.  
  
Q. How would you describe the urgency that your team played with in these
two games here?  
COACH CREAN: I would say it was fantastic, and I'd say it was because they
were reenergized. I think we really went home ‑‑ we were home, I should say,
but really looked at what we were not taking care of. It wasn't about let's
follow the bubble watch and let's read about how bad we're playing. Let's
focus in on what we can fix, and the bottom line was the rebounding, and we
had to get better at defensive rebounding the ball because we were giving up
too many points on second chance points. We were getting some offensive
boards, but we weren't getting the points from it, and we had to clean up some
points off turnovers, and we certainly had to do a better job of getting to
the foul line.  
We hit a little bit of a cold slump, and when you've got a lot of shooting and
you don't have that true, we're just going to throw it down in there and
command that double‑team type of guy, you've got to make sure you're hitting
your shots. We had a couple games where we weren't. Look at the Northwestern
game; we're flying around, doing an excellent job in the first half. We hit a
10‑minute, 9‑minute, 11‑minute lull, whatever it was, where we just weren't
making shots we were making in the first half. So you've got to play through
that. That's our team. Our team has got a lot of three‑point shooting, a lot
of movement, and we hit a little bit of a lull on that. But we knew we could
get better defensively, we knew we could get better at blocking out and
rebounding the ball. We knew we could reenergize if we got some rest, and I
think that's exactly what we did, and I think‑‑ put it this way: If we'd have
won the game, I would have felt great about us having a chance to go into
tomorrow no matter who it was, Michigan State or Ohio State because of their
confidence level, because of their urgency level, and because of their
conditioning level.  
  
Q. What's the plan for Sunday, and have you ever been in this situation
where you've got to watch Selection Sunday and not really be completely
sure?  
COACH CREAN: No, I don't have a plan yet. I'm not sure. I'm really not. I
haven't even close to thought that far ahead. I don't know. I've got to start
thinking about that tonight.  
Other part of your question, I don't think so. I don't think as an assistant
or a head coach. But you know what, it is what it is. We're getting better. I
love coaching these guys. They have grown up on and off the floor. They deal
with a lot, and yet the resiliency of coming in and getting better is
constant. They have a closeness that's been able to develop over the year.
It's growing. It's growing. It's not all the way there yet, but where they
will‑‑ they have started to learn how to hold each other accountable, and they
will get on one another to be better, and I saw some of that the last couple
days, again, too. I love coaching them, and I'm looking forward to continuing
it next week.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 13, 2015

  

### [Patrick Chambers](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22067)

### [D.J. Newbill](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24994)

### [Ross Travis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28532)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  

Purdue  63  
Penn State - 59

  
COACH CHAMBERS: Proud of my team. Really competed to the end. Three days,
three games in the Big Ten is very difficult, and the way these guys competed
today in the second half, they gave it everything they had, and I think this
is a stepping‑stone for our program, and I think they have everything to do
with it, the legacy that this group has left for Penn State and Penn State
basketball. I think you're going to see it for a long time because this was a
critical step in the process of becoming an elite basketball team, and it's
because of them.  
  
Q. How much of a factor was fatigue in the final five minutes?  
DJ NEWBILL: I don't think fatigue played a role in how we played in the final
minutes.  
ROSS TRAVIS: I don't think fatigue played a role at all. Minutes are winding
down and adrenaline kicks in.  
  
Q. D.J., you talked the last couple days about continuing to play in this
uniform, and now that you guys are out of the tournament here, what can you
look back on about how you career wrapped up?  
DJ NEWBILL: I competed every game, every practice, every workout, from the
summers to the fall to the winter, and that's why I look at my career and just
know that I gave it my all. I think everyone around me knows that, too.  
  
Q. D.J., how good of a defender is Ray Davis, and how did you feel about the
way they played defense on you today in particular?  
DJ NEWBILL: That team as a whole is a great defensive team. They're excellent
defending. I think he played me great. They did limit my good looks. They made
sure almost every shot was contested. I give them credit.  
  
Q. You mentioned the stepping ‑stone for your program these last three days.
What are the specific things that you guys learned and that you learned as a
head coach?   
COACH CHAMBERS: Oh, man, what an incredible year. You know, as far as our
leaders and our staff, you know, it's never going to be 70 and sunny, and
we're going to go through some difficult times, which we did. I learned that
our program has got a lot of heart. It's got a lot of grit and work ethic. We
have a terrific attitude, because you don't come into the Big Ten Tournament,
win two games and give yourself a chance in the third game three days in a row
in the Big Ten without all those characteristics, and we can build off that.
It's an incredible foundation.  
Those guys are hurting in there. There's not a dry eye. That means we're
headed in the right direction because when you're invested, it hurts. There's
tears. There's pain. There's suffering when you're invested. When you're not
invested, it's easy. Those guys are invested. Very different.  
  
Q. I know Ross and D.J. obviously said that fatigue wasn't a factor, but it
seemed like a lot of loose balls went to Purdue and a lot of the shots were
short. Did you notice any signs of fatigue in the last five minutes of your
players?  
COACH CHAMBERS: That's why I burned the quick time‑out in the second half. I
thought we were a little bit slow to start, and I knew it was a full time out,
so I wanted to give them a little bit more of a break. But during the game I'm
not going to talk about fatigue or being tired. We're just going to‑‑ positive
reinforcement, keep fighting, keep battling, dig deeper, little things like
that. We only gave up five in the first half, obviously seven in the second,
it hurt. Octeus had huge rebounds down the stretch. Came back to get 20 for
the first night, 19, did a much better job with 12, but they had three in a
row, and that really hurt at that time at that point in the game.  
  
Q. Talk about what the younger players learned from this tournament and
battling like this, and what's it say for the future of the program?  
COACH CHAMBERS: Well, they're going to learn they have to play hard every
possession and mature and grow. We all want freshmen to be seniors and we want
to speed up the process here. It's a process. Shep is going to learn a lot
from the last two days, Geno Thorpe is going to learn a lot, how to compete
every day and focus on what you can control. There's certain things you can't
control, but you can control your effort and your attitude and continue to
play hard, and I think that's what they'll learn the most.  
I'm excited for the off‑season already. I know that sounds crazy because I
probably need some time off, but I know these kids want to get back to work
because they're disappointed with our conference record and disappointed with
losing today when you're right there, to take it and grab it and head into the
weekend. It's what we wanted to do.  
  
Q. How do you handle the frustration of being so close all year long? You
look, there's not much difference between you and Maryland in terms of points
scored, your games with them, the close losses, but how do you handle that
frustration and can you channel it and build on it?  
COACH CHAMBERS: First, I would say you need a great AD to support you. That's
one. Second I would say you need a great wife at home who loves you up. And
third, I would say a great attitude. And that's what Jay Wright has taught me.
That's what my life has taught me. Keep a great attitude, make sure these kids
have a great attitude. Keep it exciting and fun and be creative in your ways
of teaching and getting better and driving them, understanding that we're
close, and there's no turning back.  
And I need to get better. There's a lot of situational things today I was
disappointed with that I need to continue to coach and do a better job, and
I'll reevaluate myself. You're always learning as a young coach, you're always
trying to get better, and I'll do that, but it's definitely my attitude, I
think, that gets me through these tough times.  
  
Q. On Wednesday you talked about Philly toughness leading you into that win
over Nebraska. Do you think the entire team embraced that mentality during
this run?  
COACH CHAMBERS: Yeah, I would say‑‑ Ross is from Minnesota, so I can't quite
coin that phrase. That's not fair to him, and Geno is from Pittsburgh, so I
would say toughness is definitely something we're about, and everybody says
you can't, you won't, you're not good enough, you name it. Throughout the Big
Ten season, we've heard it. I've heard it. And we just kept plugging along,
and that's called toughness.  
Again, it's easy to do when you're 12‑1 like we were in the non‑conference,
but we knew that there were some weaknesses. We knew. These kids are tough.
They're resilient. Those two guys who just sat to my right, they're going to
be super successful in life. They're going to be really successful because
they know how to handle adversity and challenges.  
  
Q. Will you guys accept a postseason bid if given one?  
COACH CHAMBERS: I'll sit down with Sandy Barber tonight or tomorrow and we'll
discuss it and see what's best for the program, see what's best for these
players and go from there. But that was the goal, and hopefully something
comes our way.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 13, 2015

  

### [Spike Albrecht](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25289)

### [John Beilein](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13675)

### [Zak Irvin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28524)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  

Wisconsin  71  
Michigan - 60

  
COACH BEILEIN: If anybody watched this game you see how talented Wisconsin is.
They've got a great game plan, but their size, their age, their strength, it
was a huge part in the game. They got so many second‑chance points that it's
really a 50/50 ball many times around the rim, and they're just longer and
stronger and more experienced than us in some of those situations, and that
was really a key to their victory today was getting extra opportunities.  
Proud of our kids, however, because we shoot 50 percent from the floor, 40
percent from the three‑point line, but can't get a W. They played their tails
off and lost to certainly today a better team.  
  
Q. Spike, you guys have played these guys really tough both times you've
seen them. What is it that you guys are feeling when you're going up against a
team of that caliber and a team that you guys can handle pretty well?  
SPIKE ALBRECHT: They're a really good team, extremely experienced,
senior‑laden. But I think the one thing we do well against them is we take
care of the ball and we can make shots because they force you to hit toughs
two and wild lay‑ups, and those are things we work on every day in practice. I
think we executed our offense extremely well today and made shots when we
needed to. We just didn't get the stops.  
  
Q. You want to keep playing? Are you excited to keep playing this season? Do
you feel like you've maybe unlocked something here and have a chance to keep
playing well?  
ZAK IRVIN: Yeah, I would love to keep playing with these guys. I think
especially these last five games we're really starting to come together. We've
had to fight through a lot of adversity this year. I'm just proud of how we've
stayed connected and hope we can keep it going through the rest of their
season.  
SPIKE ALBRECHT: Yeah, just piggy‑backing off of Zak, I think we're really
starting to kind of gel out it. It took us a while, it's been a process with
so many young guys, but I think the past couple of weeks we're really starting
to figure it out, and I definitely don't want the season to end, and I'd like
to finish with a winning record for sure.  
  
Q. In a lot of these conference games, there's been a stretch where you've
gone a while without a field goal, but today it looked like it was a lot more
consistent scoring throughout. What was the key?  
COACH BEILEIN: I think that our kids are getting more and more comfortable
with making shots in difficult situations, just watching Zak Irvin grow here,
to have an in between game and not just be a three‑point shooter. Aubrey
Dawkins‑‑ Spike in the first half was really good, and then we just ‑‑ we
seemed to find an answer, we just couldn't stop them. That was the big issue
today. You can be on the other end of some of these teams like Wisconsin where
the final score is like 70‑40 because they just get away from you with their
defense. So really proud that we were able to score that many points, shoot 50
percent and get some threes to go down, as well.  
  
Q. If you're invited to a postseason tournament, will you accept?  
COACH BEILEIN: To the NIT. We would go to the NIT. We're not interested in any
other tournament. It's an NCAA Tournament. It's one that I've fortunately been
involved with several times. Two of our teams went to Madison Square Garden,
one won the national championship, won the NIT championship, and Bob Huggins
then took that same team and took them to the Final Four. Many times this type
of opportunity is a precursor to future games, and if we could get that
opportunity in the NIT, we would gladly accept it.  
  
Q. You mentioned Zak and his performance today. What was it like to see him
not only get the big point total but also get a bunch of rebounds?  
COACH BEILEIN: Yeah, we were all watching what we've been‑‑ he's been working
at. Our coaches have been coaching him, and he's such a really‑‑ coaches are
only as good as their students, and he's a tremendous student of the game.
He's learning more and more about it, and it's showing every day for us. So
the 11 rebounds, I'll tell you a story. Last spring we were done and we were
just playing pickup, and I was just saying, just go get a rebound. He didn't
have hardly any rebounds last year, just go get a rebound in that scrimmage.
He got one. Go get another one. He got another one. Go in there. I said all
you've got to do it just go in there. You've got nose for it, you can do it,
and 11 rebounds for him today, a double‑double in that area with the assists
he's had, this is big steps for him.  
  
Q. Was Walton available today or was it decided beforehand that he was a no
‑go?  
COACH BEILEIN: If he was available, he would have played, yeah. We've been
waiting for him to come into the locker room and say, Coach, I'm at 100
percent, and he couldn't do that. He's still in some pain. We're not going to
play him with pain just from the standpoint that we don't think he's going to
be as effective with the pain. And that's the way it's been for at least the
last couple of weeks. The first three or four weeks we didn't do anything with
him, but he's been trying to practice with us. He can't go through a full
practice.  
  
Q. Even in all the adversity and disappointment that you guys have fought
through this year, how big is it for you to see Zak and Muhammed and Aubrey
grow in the last couple months as much as they have?  
COACH BEILEIN: Yeah, and I wouldn't‑‑ we sort of try to roll with the cards
that are dealt us, so it's not like disappointing, it's just the job to just
get better. You have to formulate a plan and then you just grow from it. We
didn't wallow in this. We just continued to just work really hard, and if you
try to‑‑ as hard as it is, it's hard for me personally, to see that silver
lining, and it's great to see these type of things. Those small victories,
they may not be in a win but in a particular action that they read or do,
those are the victories we've been looking for, as well.

## March 12, 2015

  

### [Thad Matta](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17026)

### [D'Angelo Russell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28568)

### [Shannon Scott](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25236)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  

Ohio State  79  
Minnesota - 73

  
Q. Just talk about how this last four or five days has unfolded and the
importance that you guys put on coming up here and playing the best basketball
that you could and really laying on the line tonight?  
SHANNON SCOTT: First off, we want to congratulate Coach Matta on his 298th
win, becoming the all‑time Ohio State Coach winning percentage. With us our
main thing is we've got to play our best basketball now. We've got to put the
regular season behind us. We ended the season the way we didn't want to end
it, but we've got to move on now. We've got to play our best basketball.  
D'ANGELO RUSSELL: Like he said, congrats to Coach. Like Shannon said, also, if
we're not playing our best basketball by now, I mean, it would be hard trying
to pick up for the tournament and whatnot. Like he said, we want to start
playing our best basketball right now.  
  
Q. D'Angelo, what did you do to your left hand in the first half? We saw you
kind of get being stretched out on the bench?  
D'ANGELO RUSSELL: I just broke a nail.  
  
Q. Did it bother you for the rest of the game?  
D'ANGELO RUSSELL: No, I'm good.  
  
Q. D'Angelo, you've had an uncanny ability throughout the season to take
over a game and hit the big shots, and even though you're 0 for 5 from three
in the first half and they came back at the half, what allows you to make
those big shots, especially today?  
D'ANGELO RUSSELL: Coach Matta thought I was playing around. I give a lot of
credit to him. He told me ‑‑ he pulled me to the side and, he said, Yo, it's
time. And like I said in previous interviews, it just clicks for me. And I
knew my teammates were looking for me and putting me in a position to score
and capitalize. Coach Greg Paulus was doing the same, and I was just making
shots.  
  
Q. Shannon, you had a career high 21 points tonight. Did you have any extra
motivation or a different mindset after taking a big loss on Senior Night?  
SHANNON SCOTT: Not really. I mean, our whole main purpose of this trip right
now is just to play our best basketball. That's the main thing I'm focusing on
right now. I can't think about the Senior Night loss. That's behind us now.  
  
Q. The two possessions there at the end of the game where you were holding,
trying to take as much time off, but then you got baskets at the end of each
of those possessions, if you guys would talk about those two plays.  
D'ANGELO RUSSELL: Coach made a great call. Amir set a great screen which you
seen, and Shannon made a great pass and they I just made the shot. I give a
lot of credit to those guys for just making the play and coming to me when it
was a crucial point in the game.  
SHANNON SCOTT: A lot of times when teams get up like that in late games, they
try to hold the ball and don't take the right shot. We found an opening, and
we needed to take the shots, and we took them, so that's the main thing with
that.  
  
Q. You guys have Michigan State now tomorrow. Any thoughts on how that first
game went and what you need to do to come out victorious in that?  
SHANNON SCOTT: Yeah, man, we lost to them in a nail‑biter but we're going to
watch film on them tonight and tomorrow and figure out their actions again,
and just get going from there.  
D'ANGELO RUSSELL: I mean, I give a lot of credit to them. They beat us by a
buzzer beater last time at their home. Now it's a more hostile crowd. We've
got their crowd and our crowd, it's not a home game for them. We look to keep
the crowd involved and just keep energy.  
  
Q. Marc has struggled these past few weeks, kind of got him going tonight.
Tonight in particular how nice was it to kind of see him ‑‑  
COACH MATTA: Well, yes. I think it was huge to see that first shot go in for
him. We've been waiting for Marc to kind of come out of it, and tonight I
thought he was really, really good. Everybody thinks offense, but he really
made some spectacular defensive plays from the help position, which was good
to see, because a lot of times when a guy is not playing well offensively,
he'll shut down defensively. But I thought his energy, all that was great to
see, and hopefully he's ready to go.  
  
Q. And then just going forward, how big would it be if he could kind of get
in a rhythm and be another reliable offensive threat?  
COACH MATTA: Well, it definitely makes us a stronger basketball team. It gives
us a lot more options, and J.T. got‑‑ Jae'Sean got in some foul trouble early,
and that's what you want at this time of year where the next guy comes in and
fills his role and does a little bit more than that. Like I said, I'm happy to
see Marc play that way.  
  
Q. Not that this is the biggest blip on your radar screen, but what's that
record mean to you, standing there holding that shirt with 298 on it?  
COACH MATTA: You know, I think from the standpoint of‑‑ and I've said this,
nobody ever remembers the past. Nobody remembers where we came in or what we
took over in this program with sanctions and visits and post‑season banned and
all that stuff. You know, I've always said this: I give credit to Matt
Marinchick, Tony Stockman, and Brandon Fuss‑Cheatham. They were our first
senior class and they kind of helped us set the tone. I.  
Think, personally, for me, people ‑‑ it probably means the most for me is my
wife and my two daughters. Because I've gone probably‑‑ well, going on eight
years with a disability, and they're the ones that have suffered the things
that I can't do as a father. I can't do as a husband. And they've never
wavered. I have some really, really bad days in terms of coming home after
games and they've got to help me get my shoes and socks off, and for them to
stay the course with me, it means a heck of a lot more to me for them than it
does for myself.  
  
Q. After that loss to Wisconsin, how important was it for you to kind of
clear that away and win that game?  
COACH MATTA: Yeah, well, it was huge, I think. You know, I give our guys a lot
of credit for‑‑ I talked to them after the game Sunday and just said, look, as
hard as this is for me to say this, we have to wash this game down the drain
in the shower, and we've got to pick ourselves up and get ready to go again.
We had a couple great practices leading into this. I talked about it before
the game tonight, I think, in terms of the way we came out. I was excited to
see that. I knew tonight's game was going to be a dogfight. I think every year
I've ever been in this tournament, the first game is always the hardest one.  
But I'll give them credit because we got punched in the face and they got back
up and fought tonight.  
  
Q. Could there have been lingering effects if you'd have lost that game?  
COACH MATTA: Oh, no question.  
  
Q. Going into the NCAA Tournament, you're coming off this and that?  
COACH MATTA: Yeah, you're limping in. From the standpoint, that was something
we talked about at the team meeting on Monday. As Shannon said, really the
only thing I asked them to do was attempt to play their best basketball and
fight and claw. I don't think we played perfect tonight by any stretch, but
played well enough to win. In the back of my mind I was thinking like, well,
we really, really need this win for a lot of different reasons.  
  
Q. D'Angelo, this is his first postseason game in college. Is there anything
about him that surprised you how easy that transition was for him, and what is
it about him that made it look so easy as someone playing in this type of
situation for the first time?  
COACH MATTA: Well, he's obviously a very talented basketball player, and as he
alluded to, he was not all the way dialed into the level that I wanted him
dialed in. And he and I had a conversation during the game, but I think from
the standpoint‑‑ he's one of those guys that he wants people in the crowd. He
wants spotlights. He wants competition. He wants to play the best. That makes
him special.  
I knew he was struggling the first half a little bit scoring the ball, but I
had great confidence that he would get going, and sure enough, he did.  
  
Q. I'm pretty sure looking ahead a little bit you're an even .500 with Tom
Izzo. Seems like every match ‑up with these teams is a tough, close games.
What is it about these programs that they just seem to match up so well with
each other and have the same sort of games?  
COACH MATTA: You know, it is interesting. I think from the standpoint of the
battles over the years, that we've had, you know, honestly, tomorrow what we
should do is just start with one minute on the clock and save ourselves
because they always seem to come down to the last minute of the game.  
I'll be honest with you, I have so much respect for Coach Izzo. When I got to
Ohio State 11 years ago, that was one of the programs I looked at and said,
boy, if we could ever get this program to that level, I'd be a happy man. He's
stood the test of time. He's had great players, we've had great players. He's
a heck of a coach. I get lucky every now and then.  
I think from that perspective, it makes it a lot of fun. As crazy as it
sounds, I actually look forward to tomorrow night because you know it's going
to be a heck of a basketball game.  
  
Q. With Michigan State again tomorrow, how much of the next 20 hours do you
look back at that regular season loss?  
COACH MATTA: We'll look at it. We can walk right now into film‑‑ our guys are
prepared through film and all that stuff. I don't think they've changed
drastically. We haven't changed drastically. You know, we'll take a look at
that game, but it's all the other little things. They're going to do what they
do, we're going to do what we do, and hopefully we score more points than they
do tomorrow night.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 12, 2015

  

### [Andre Hollins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23369)

### [DeAndre Mathieu](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26127)

### [Richard Pitino](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25315)

### [Maurice Walker](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28569)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  

Ohio State  79  
Minnesota - 73

  
COACH PITINO: Well, certainly proud of how hard these guys fought. To be down
13 with nine and a half to go, had a couple of opportunities to cut it to one
or two, shows the type of heart that we have on this team, and a lot of that
is attributed to the seniors. So I'm proud of them. They set a school record
for wins last year with 25, won an NIT. Mo and Andre certainly went to an NCAA
Tournament, and DeAndre, what he's been able to do in the last couple years to
get to where he had to get to, he should be proud, too.  
Disappointed that the NCAA Tournament‑‑ we knew it would be tough, but
disappointed certainly we can't go back to that. Hoping we get invited to NIT
so we can keep playing, but we'll see. We lost to a very good team. That's a
very talented team and a well‑coached team, so you've got to give them credit,
as well.  
  
Q. DeAndre, we were talking in the locker room about the season. Did you
guys expect coming in that you would be going to the NCAA Tournament?  
DEANDRE MATHIEU: Yeah, we definitely came in with the mindset of making a run.
Winning five games in five days and getting chosen to play in the NCAA
Tournament.  
  
Q. For any of the players, can you talk about where you were down. Coach was
talking about making up that ground and giving yourselves a shot right to the
end of the game there?  
ANDRE HOLLINS: You know, Dre made some great moves to the basket, got an
and‑one. I think that's when the momentum changed a lot. Mo also got an
and‑one that really shifted the momentum. You know, we were right there.
Russell is a great player. He hit a big‑time shot. I mean, and we still clawed
back. The only thing I can say is I'm just proud of being a part of this team
and the way that we fought tonight.  
MAURICE WALKER: Like Andre said, we all made plays down the stretch, and we
just needed stops defensively, and they hit big shots. Got to give them credit
because they are a good team.  
  
Q. Andre, you had that late missed three ‑pointer, I think, with
30‑something seconds left and then fouled Loving after that, and it looked
like you were beating yourself up a little bit on the way to the other end.
What was going through your head?   
ANDRE HOLLINS: I was upset that I kind of lost the ball. I didn't have a clean
grip, and that's what I was upset about. I should have just sidestepped or did
something else.  
  
Q. Mo, can you just talk about coming into the tournament in these last few
games, if any of the seniors, if you guys sat the younger guys down at all and
tried to tell them about what is going to be expected of them moving
forward?  
MAURICE WALKER: All season ‑‑ it's been a process all season. The younger guys
have really grown. Practice every day, they're always willing to learn,
they're always working hard. I know personally Bakary, I really sit down with
him and I talk to him often about things on and off the court or during the
course of the game. I try to give him little pointers and things that he can
do that I see out there. All the young guys have really grown, and they all
have very bright futures.  
  
Q. DeAndre, for you in particular, the way that Nate has kind of led of team
at the point guard spot toward the end of the season here, what have you seen
from him to make you think that he can kind of take the next step next year?  
DEANDRE MATHIEU: Nate brought it every day in practice. He works hard. He
knows the game. I thought he was mature beyond his years the first day I seen
him. If he just continues to work, continues to think basketball and learn the
game, he's going to be a really, really good player for the next three years.  
  
Q. Coach, did you get a sense down the stretch there when you were making
your comeback, that the seniors kind of took it upon themselves because this
might be their last game?  
COACH PITINO: I thought from DeAndre, certainly he was playing at a tremendous
speed. It was tough with Mo, the foul trouble really hurt us just because
offensively we couldn't get a lot going when he was in foul trouble. But
DeAndre, I could certainly see it just from an offensive standpoint.  
  
Q. You were obviously forced to sort of piece together some different
lineups with Mo on the bench. In the first half you did play Bakary and Gas
together a lot, but you guys were able to tread water. What do you think that
says about ‑‑  
COACH PITINO: Yeah, you know, about the future? You know, I thought we did
kind of tread water, but I think something we're really going to miss next
year is a true low post presence with Mo. I don't know what he shot on the
year from the field. I'm sure it was very good. When he got it, it was pretty
good. Obviously Bakary, he's going to need to figure that out. What I like
about Bakary, he's a huge target. But he's got to just continue to get better.
We're going to miss Mo offensively because a lot of what we did was kind of
inside‑out. But I did think those guys did a good job holding serve in the
first half.  
I thought in the second half we started playing zone, we just were not
rebounding the ball, so we had to get out of it.  
  
Q. Obviously you're not the one who makes this decision, but do you think
that you guys are an NIT team, and if you did not get an NIT nod, would you
take any lesser tournament?  
COACH PITINO: No, I don't think we would take a CBI or CIT. I hope we're an
NIT team. I want to keep playing with these guys, keep coaching them. We
enjoyed it last year. I get it, you're kind of labeled in sports today. If you
don't make it to the NCAA Tournament, you're labeled a failure. I mean, I
understand that. I don't look at it like that with these guys. We enjoyed the
NIT. We got a lot out of it, so I'd like to keep playing. Almost 95, 99
percent sure I wouldn't take a CIT or a CBI bid.  
  
Q. I know it's a ways off, but the way Nate played in the point guard role
this year, going into next year you're going to have some options with a
couple of recruits. Do you see him possibly being able to move over and maybe
have a role like Andre did next year at the 2?  
COACH PITINO: Yeah, I think he'll play both. I think we've got to figure that
out a little bit, but he's definitely going to have to play both. I kind of
see him doing it, just because Kevin Dorsey can't play the 2. Jarvis may be
able to play the 2 a little bit, but Nate will definitely play the 1 and the
2, so that's definitely something we'll look at. That's a ways away, but
that's definitely something we'd look at.  
  
Q. Since this is the end of the season, what do you want to see from Nate
developing in the off ‑season?   
COACH PITINO: Probably consistency from the foul line. I don't get why he's
not a great free‑throw shooter. And from the perimeter. He shoots it different
off the dribble than he does off the catch. That's something he needs to get
more consistent with. But I think as a freshman he had a tremendous year. He
was arguably one of the best freshmen in our conference. His big thing has got
to be he can't be like‑‑ the target will be on his back. He needs to get
better this off‑season. He can't fall into that sophomore slump, which a lot
of people do fall into. He can't do that.  
  
Q. We talked about you guys treading water without Mo a little bit in the
first half, but how much do you think that foul trouble really did hurt you
tonight?  
COACH PITINO: A lot, a lot. Yeah, just from an offensive standpoint. I thought
we were getting stops because of the zone, but we weren't getting scores. I
thought if Mo was in the game, we probably would have had a lead. We were
getting stops, just they were choking down the driving lanes and just our guys
weren't real confident throwing it to BK, so I just thought it cost us from
building a lead because we were getting stops in that zone and turning them
over and doing some good things.  
  
Q. The way that Joey has shot the last two games coming into this one make
you think that maybe he has another level he can hit next season?  
COACH PITINO: Yeah, I mean, I think he's always been a pretty good shooter.
He's playing with great confidence. My biggest thing with him is become an
awesome leader because he's got the respect of everybody in the program, but
now become a vocal leader. Sometimes younger guys wait their turn a little bit
when you've got as many seniors as we had. They sit back and they wait. And I
think he'll take that role over really good next year.  
He improved greatly. He's a guy who came from Drake, wasn't even
all‑conference, and to think of how good he was towards the end of this year,
I'm excited about him.  
  
Q. Looking back at the season, do you have any major regrets or things that
you would have done differently?  
COACH PITINO: Not really. Not really. I mean, any time you lose a bunch of
close games you're always trying to figure out what you can do differently.
No, not really. I mean, I think our guys, what I thought we all did a pretty
good job of with them, when you lose so many close games in kind of today's
world, everybody piles on everybody. They're just looking to point fingers.
That's natural. It's not any one place. And I thought our guys did a really
good job of staying positive, staying together, you know, and more than
anything, keep on working. I'm sure there's things we all could have done
differently, but I don't know that it does a whole lot of good to look back on
that.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 12, 2015

  

### [Mike Gesell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25017)

### [Fran McCaffery](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18323)

### [Aaron White](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23347)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  

Penn State  67  
Iowa - 58

  
Q. What do you attribute your troubles with scoring throughout the game? Was
it more of something you guys did or was it something they did on defense?  
AARON WHITE: Yeah, I think they played good defense. But I'd also say we were
a little stagnant on offense, not moving like we usually do, not screening,
cutting with a purpose to score. You have to attribute them for some good
defense but also take credit as a team that we didn't play like we usually do.  
  
Q. Mike, you guys only hit three shots as guards. From your perspective,
what was the reasoning for that today?  
MIKE GESELL: They were getting in us. They were being aggressive, and you
know, as guards you can't always force it, you've got to look to guys other
guys open, too. Just because we only made two or three shots, it doesn't
really mean much in my opinion. We were looking to get guys open and looking
for scoring opportunities when they happened. They really had a stacked
defense, and sometimes it's hard to get shots against that as a guard.  
  
Q. Aaron, what's making Penn State such a tough team to go up against there
in the last few days and today for you guys specifically?  
AARON WHITE: Yeah, they always play hard. All 18 games of the Big Ten season,
you know it's going to be a fight from there. I think D.J. is playing well
right now. They've got some other guys stepping up for them. When you have a
team that plays that hard and that aggressive, once they start hitting shots,
they're a pretty good team. You've got to credit D.J.; he's having a good Big
Ten Tournament so far. We kind of let him get away from us there in the second
half.  
  
Q. You guys shot 26 percent for the game, and I'm just wondering was it more
of their defense or was it just one of those days where you couldn't put it in
the basket?  
MIKE GESELL: I'd say it's a little bit of both. You know, every game is a
little bit different, and the flow of this game was really defensive oriented.
Penn State is a team that's really going to get in your space, try to mug you
off ball screens, try to get you out of rhythm. That was just the flow of the
game. And also we weren't shooting as well as usual, but I think I attribute a
little bit of both.  
AARON WHITE: I'd say it's both, but at the same time we give up 48 points in
the second half. That's more where we lost the game rather than the shooting
percentage.  
  
Q. Aaron touched on it a little bit but going from 19 points in one half to
48 points in the second half, what changed defensively for you guys?  
COACH MCCAFFERY: Well, nothing strategically. They shot it well. We made some
mistakes, I think. They took advantage of those mistakes. But they made some
shots at a critical juncture in the game, which changed a lot.  
  
Q. The technical foul, what did you see ‑‑  
COACH MCCAFFERY: I can't talk about the technical foul. You should know that.

_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  

Michigan  73  
Illinois - 55

  
COACH GROCE: Obviously we're disappointed we didn't play very well today.
Certainly don't want to take anything away from Michigan. I thought they were
terrific. We didn't have any answers for stopping them. I didn't think our
defense was very good. When we've been good this year, our defense has been
good, and we just didn't have any answers on that end of the floor, and when
we played well here late, we've been able to get stops, and we weren't able to
do that today very successfully.  
Then, on the other end, I thought the ball stuck too much. Obviously we didn't
have the assist number we would have liked on the ratio of made field goals.
Thought the ball was really sticky, just did not play very well. Give them a
lot of credit. I thought they had a lot of energy, thought they executed well,
and did what they needed to do to win the game. Obviously, again, we're
disappointed because we played better than that, a lot better than that, and
obviously we didn't have it today.  
  
Q. Surprising to start slowly and not have a push, an answer in the second
half? Does that really take you back at all?  
NNANNA EGWU: We're disappointed in the way we played. We practiced better than
that, and there was just a point where we didn't come out‑‑ we came out, we
punched back once they struck first, but there was a point we couldn't make
the second effort to come back.  
  
Q. Can both of you just address the last two games? You had a lot riding on
both games and both were disappointing efforts. What do you think changed?
What do you think happened the last two games?  
RAYVONTE RICE: They just threw the first punch, and we was just unable to
answer. Just gave it all we got. They were just a better team.  
NNANNA EGWU: I mean, regardless of what we have riding or anything, at the end
of the day, when we play for Illinois, we've got to play hard and we've got to
play with effort. The last two games we didn't do that for 40 minutes and
that's the reason we lost. It was nothing about what happened. It's just when
you come here to play, we expect to play hard, and at the end of the day, we
lost because we didn't play hard enough.  
  
Q. How do you describe the disappointment of losing this game?  
RAYVONTE RICE: I mean, we can't control like what the committee decides, but
we're just going to look at the film tomorrow, see what we can get better at
and just see where we end up.  
  
Q. Would you agree that the effort was lacking the last two games, and today
‑‑  
COACH GROCE: No, nothing against Nnanna, I love Nnanna like he's my own son. I
didn't think we were necessarily desperate enough during Purdue's run to end
the first half and the beginning of the second half. That was an 18‑7 run in
the span of about three minutes. The other 37, like, played pretty well, did
some good things. But the room for error is small as we know in this league,
and certainly when you're playing on the road. I thought that was the bigger
culprit there in that one.  
Today, I would probably agree with them a little bit more. For whatever reason
we just didn't have it. I liked our response when we got down 14‑2 and we came
back. I thought it was a big, big, big swing when we went foul, technical
foul, they make two free throws, they get the ball back and then they make a
25‑foot bomb. My assistant says, that's a hard shot, and I said, no, it's
karma. Don't get the technical foul. We've got to be more poised than that.
That led to a five‑point play, and I think that really spurred that run,
David, at the end of the first half. I thought we had more energy than we did
today, which was disappointing because you've got guys that played 38, 39 and
38, we're playing an eight‑man rotation today basically. I just was
disappointed in that.  
But at the end of the day, it's easy to blame it all on that. There's going to
be an execution part of this, too, now. You can't give them transition threes,
three of them in the first half, or we don't get matched up in transition.
That's not just effort, that's the old analogy I give them with Christmas
Vacation when the guy comes out to the front lawn and the daughter says to
grandpa about Chevy Chase, he worked real hard, and the grandpa says, so do
washing machines. There is an execution piece to this too now. You've got to
talk. You can run real hard back, but if you don't talked and get matched up,
your effort could be spectacular, but your execution doesn't merit, then
that's a problem. I thought today it was both.  
  
Q. Did the official tell you what precipitated the technical foul, what it
was?  
COACH GROCE: Just‑‑ I trust those guys. We have those guys all year. They're
really good. They said, I looked at the monitor, it was a no‑brainer. Leron
has got to be a little more poised there. I think it was an elbow or
something. That was their take on it, so I trusted those guys' judgment.  
  
Q. You were really pleased a year ago with the way the players connected
with what you were telling them. Do you feel like you're being heard, as well,
this time, this year?  
COACH GROCE: I don't think it's about being heard. We just didn't play very
well today. Obviously we've taken a lot of pride in doing very well in
tournament settings for years. Today we just did not play very well, so we're
all going to have to look ourselves in the mirror and own this one and figure
out how to be mentally and physically more prepared the next time.  
I didn't see this one coming. Nnanna said, we practiced really, really well,
had a great spirit about it, got a very close group, just didn't play very
well, and I thought they played really well, so again, I don't want to take
anything away from them. I thought their execution was terrific and they had a
lot of answers on the offensive end.  
  
Q. Down the stretch it seems like Malcolm and Kendrick have struggled to
find their shot consistently. Is that just them going cold or is there more to
it?  
COACH GROCE: I'll have to watch the film from today, but the Purdue game I
thought we missed shots, in particular Kendrick. I thought he had great shots.
I thought Malcolm had a couple chances to finish lay‑ups around the basket
today, and he didn't. I thought the one at the end of the half would have been
huge on the side‑out play to kind of maybe give us a little bit of momentum,
and he drove it left, and for whatever reason it didn't go in, and he didn't
make it. Sometimes that happens. But you're right, those guys are better
shooting the ball than what they have shot here lately.

_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  

Indiana  71  
Northwestern - 56

  
COACH COLLINS: I want to congratulate Indiana. They played a very good game
tonight. I thought they were a very determined team. Their physicality
tonight, I thought, knocked us back in the game, and the proof is in the
pudding, 20 offensive rebounds, points in the paint. I thought defensively
they really did a great job on our two guys and made it tough on us.  
Conversely, we got off to a tough start in the game. I don't know if it was
just a little bit of jitters or just we had a hard time getting going. I
didn't think we were moving the ball the way we normally do, and then,
defensively, I actually thought defensively we did a pretty good job in terms
of how we played on the initial defense. It was the second shots that just‑‑
they really crashed the boards. It's an area of growth for our program.  
Overall it's been a great year for us. I'm very proud of what our team
accomplished this year, year two of building. It was a step forward, and I
don't know that I would have said that when we were sitting at 1‑10 a month
ago. But it's a testament to the guys I had in my locker room, a lot of young
guys that kept fighting, they kept working. We have our whole core back. We'll
be adding some pieces as well, and the future of our program is incredibly
bright, which I'm proud of. I'm upset about the loss tonight because you want
to keep playing. Competitively, you want to keep winning.  
The thing I love about the locker room afterwards is it was an emotional
locker room because ‑‑ that's when you know you've had a good year because
there's only one team at the end that's going to be jumping around and
celebrating. Everybody else at some point, it's going to be over for them. And
when you see guys getting emotional, hugging each other, it means you've got
something good going because we've got great guys in our locker room, we've
got good players, and I'm looking forward to getting these guys a little bit
of rest, and then we've got to get to work. We've got to make a jump. It's
time going into next year. We'll have a lot of key guys back, and it's time
for us to make a jump, and a lot of that is going to be predicated on what we
do here in the off‑season.  
  
Q. Coach talked about areas of growth and learning experience this season
and just kind of from tonight specifically, what can you take from what
happened?  
BRYANT MCINTOSH: The physicality of the game got ramped up for the Big Ten
Tournament. It was much different than in the season, and I think that's one
thing that as a whole we can do better at is we can get in the weight room and
get prepared for this next season with this game. It kind of showed us where
we need to go.  
  
Q. Bryant, what did the pressure of Indiana's guards do to impact the way
you guys were able to run your offense as a whole?  
BRYANT MCINTOSH: Yeah, they forced us out on the floor a little bit, and
offensively they sent our ball screens to the baseline, and it didn't give us
as much room to operate, and then our post‑entry passes are now extended out
on the floor so it's a harder pass to get in there to Olah. They just pushed
us out on the floor, and you can't play offense at 35 feet.  
  
Q. Alex, why do you think Indiana had so much success inside, both in terms
of points in the paint and defensive rebounding?  
ALEX OLAH: They're a lot physical, they're physical, and they just crashed the
boards so hard. Everyone was just going so hard, and it was hard for us to
keep up with their athleticism. They had so many points because they had so
many second chances‑‑ they had 20 offensive rebounds which gave them 20 more
shots, and you can't do that. You have to limit their offensive rebounds to
just be one‑and‑done.  
  
Q. During the drought stretch in the first half, what was the hardest part
about Indiana's defensive scheme in terms of getting the ball back to you?
What did they make the hardest?  
BRYANT MCINTOSH: Well, I mean, they made it hard by pushing the ball out on
the floor. They're taking us away from the scoring area when we catch it. Now
they give themselves time to rotate, which helps side defense. When you push
the ball out on the floor that far, when you make a drive, they have more time
to help when you're at 35 feet rather than 20. That's what made it difficult.  
  
Q. What did you accomplish this season as a team and what do you hope to
accomplish moving forward?  
BRYANT MCINTOSH: You know, I think our resiliency this year is something to be
really proud of and the growth that we made, and continue to grow. I think we
could have a pretty good group coming back. Like Coach said, we have our core
coming back and we have some really good pieces that we're adding, and we're
excited about it, and we just have a lot of room to grow, really. It's about
growth. We have to continue to work hard this off‑season and we kind of found
out the areas that we really have to work on in this game.  
  
Q. If your team got into the CBI, would you accept it?  
COACH COLLINS: No. We're going to be done for the season. Nothing against any
of those tournaments, just we're‑‑ it's time for us to start getting ready for
next year. The finality of ‑‑ we're a little bit banged up, everybody is, and
we wanted to put everything into this tournament and see where it could lead
for us. It's time for our guys to get a little rest, and then we need to get
to work. Really with the way our academic calendar is, we get an extended
spring to work with our guys because of it being on the quarter system. We're
in school longer and we can work with our guys, which is big.  
This is a huge off‑season for our program. I really feel our talent level is
up where it's been, but now we have to develop. We have to get a lot stronger.
We have to get a lot tougher physically and mentally, and then we have to
develop our skills, everyone. A lot of times you see the biggest area of
growth from a freshman to a sophomore, and with five guys in that class, to me
it's a huge growth summer for them, but it's a growth summer for the returning
guys, for Sanjay and Taphorn as sophomores and for Demps and Olah as seniors.  
The guys coming back, it's going to be a huge off‑season. For us it's time to
get going with that. We feel good about what we did, and we wanted to put
everything into this tournament and see what we could accomplish. You know,
it's time to put this season to bed and get our legs underneath us and get
ready for the future.  
  
Q. Every program has goals out there that drive you through the off ‑season,
to lift weights a few more minutes and run a few more drills. For
Northwestern, how much is it to get to the NCAA Tournament one day?  
COACH COLLINS: Yeah, it's a goal of all of ours. It's not what we talk about
daily, but yeah, in the back of our minds, that's why a lot of these young
guys came here. That's why I came here, to elevate the program to that level.
Like I've said, it's about not just going once, it's about being a program
that goes consistently. But there has to be that first time, and sure, we're
striving for it, and I think we're closer today than we've been. Last year at
the start of the year, I mean‑‑ I feel great about the trajectory of our
program. I love the talent in our program right now. I love the quality of
young men that we have in our program. I love the quality of play that we had
at the end of the season. Even the games early in the conference, we showed we
could go toe to toe with the best in this conference and compete, and now it's
about continuing to build and go to the next step.  
We won more games this year than last year. One of our goals this year was to
be a better home team than we were last year. We won two games at home in the
conference last year. This year we won four. I thought we played well on the
road. Last year we got a couple more wins, but we won two on the road this
year, and we played Maryland, Michigan State, and Michigan to the last shot on
their home floors. Five of our nine road games were right there to win, as
well.  
You know, I feel like the future is great. I'm upset about tonight because I
wanted to keep playing and all these guys wanted to keep playing because we
really enjoyed being around each other, and we felt like we were really
hitting our stride. It wasn't there for us tonight. Some of it was us. A lot
of it was Indiana. That's what happens.  
The finality of the end of the college season is so crazy emotional because
you're in the game, you're in the fight, then all of a sudden, you lose, it's
over, and it hits you, like, man, it's over. And that's an emotional thing
because we put a lot into this and our guys put a lot into the season, just
like every team does.  
But yeah, our goal coming into this year was to be a post‑season team, but as
we go into this off‑season, I want our guys working every day thinking about
making that next jump because I think we're capable of it.  
  
Q. Speaking of emotions, what was your thought when Tre, looked like he was
directing Scottie Lindsey and then Alex told them both to cut it out.  
COACH COLLINS: Yeah, it's unfortunate because that's not really‑‑ I think the
frustration of the game, obviously it was on the other end of the floor, but I
did kind of see them getting at each other, and we addressed it in the huddle,
and it is what it is. It's heat of the battle. But in order to be a winning
team you can't‑‑ when things aren't going well, you can't self‑destruct.
You've got to come together. To me that was a teachable moment, especially
because where we were in the game, it was right at the end, we probably knew
we weren't going to win even though we were continuing to fight.  
We used a good point of that media time‑out to have that be a teachable
moment. Those guys will grow from it. To me it was just the frustration of how
the game was going.  
  
Q. Describe the emotions when you substituted out Sobolewski and Cobb, and
what did you say to them?  
COACH COLLINS: Yeah, I just thanked them because it's not easy. You have two
guys that are both really good players, and it's not easy midway through their
careers to just have everything upended, a brand new head coach, an all‑new
coaching staff, a new style, a new system. Not like one way is good and one
way is bad, it's just everything is new and it's different.  
I thanked them for their belief in me and our staff to hang with us, to not
jump ship, to run to another school, to be a part of this build. I think we
all knew it was going to be a build, and I think the three guys, you had Drew
last year and you had Dave and you had JerShon. I want those three guys to
really feel like they've laid the foundation for where our program is headed,
and I'm really proud of those guys. They've been great leaders. They've been
good guys. They've been great representatives of not only our basketball
program but our school. I was emotional for them because it stinks, you put
your‑‑ it stinks when you've played your last game, and these guys have played
so much basketball and have loved it, and now it's over, and you feel for
them. But I want them both to feel great about where we're headed, and I want
them‑‑ when we do get there, I want them to know how big of a part they played
in us getting where we need to go.  
  
Q. When you look back on the season, what will you feel was accomplished,
and then how do you go about that moving forward?  
COACH COLLINS: I thought we got better as a team. I thought we got better
individually. A lot of guys showed tremendous growth. You know, we have to
become‑‑ this year we were not‑‑ we have to become a better defensive team. We
were a much better offensive team this year, which was great, and it was more
like I'd like to play, and I think we'll continue to get better on that end.  
Going forward as we go into the summer, we need to get back to guarding people
at the level that you need to to win against really good teams. I thought this
year our defense slipped a little bit, but I think as a whole, like I said,
you try to look from each year, are you getting better, is the arrow moving
up, is it moving sideways, is it moving down. If everybody doesn't see that
the arrow is moving up with our program, then I don't know what they're
watching. You've got really good young players, you've got guys that are going
to get better, we're going to keep working at it.  
We've got a big core coming back. We're excited about what we'll add, and to
me it's an exciting time, and it's going to be fun to watch and see where we
can take this group of guys over the next couple years.  
  
Q. With the decision on the CBI, did you consult the players at all and do
you think they're wishing they had more basketball to play?  
COACH COLLINS: I think they're wishing there was more basketball. I think they
know that it's time. Yeah, I mean, we talked about all those things.
Ultimately, that's my and my staff's decision. I just feel like it's time to
move forward. We've got a lot of banged‑up guys. We've got older guys who are
banged up. To play in a tournament like that, it can bring a lot of positives,
but also you've got to be revved up and you've got to really embrace‑‑ for us,
we're a little bit of a different calendar than most, and we're also going to
have a foreign trip this summer. For us we're going to get those practices
this summer. We're going to get games this summer.  
I felt like where we are, the pulse of our team, physically, emotionally, it's
time to shut it down, and I think they all support me in that decision.

COACH CHAMBERS: Wow, what a rock fight out there, just two teams playing
incredibly hard, intense, giving it up for their teammates and coaches. We're
fortunate to come out as winners. I'm really proud of my team. Our first half
we really struggled. Give Iowa all the credit for that. Their defense was
really tough. And then in the second half, we found our confidence. We saw the
ball go through the basket a little bit more. We got a few more stops than we
did in the first half, and you know, luckily made some plays down the stretch.  
D.J. had a stretch where he was unbelievable. Ross Travis's play at the end
really was pivotal. For a senior to step up like that knowing that the shot
clock is going down, and doing the right thing for his teammates to get to the
basket.  
The team really contributed in every way. I'm really proud of them, and we're
happy to stay in Chicago another day.  
  
Q. Ross, just talk about senior leadership and the fire you guys have to
keep the season going.  
ROSS TRAVIS: Man, it's huge, that senior leadership. Me and D.J. right here,
the seniors, the younger guys all look up to us to lead them through this
tournament, this journey that we're going through right now, and we're going
out there and giving it our all.  
DJ NEWBILL: Well, definitely the senior leadership is helping out, but I think
the main thing is everyone is holding each other accountable. We're out there
playing for one another, playing for pride, playing for the name on the front
of our jerseys.  
  
Q. D.J., you scored four points on a possession after McCaffery got the
technical. Did that fire you up in any way?  
DJ NEWBILL: I mean, I wouldn't say it fired me up. Just out there just trying
to help out my teammates. I'm fired up for the whole game just to be out there
to play another game and wear the jersey again, not one play going to change
my mindset.  
  
Q. Ross, at the end of the game there, you had the three ‑point play that
was really big. Did you expect that the ball may be in your hands in a clutch
situation like that?   
ROSS TRAVIS: You know, I just saw the shot clock winding down and the ball was
in my hands, so I just had to baseline it to make the play. It went in, I made
the free throw, and it was a big moment in the game.  
  
Q. There's some media members saying, like, Penn State is the team that
nobody wants to face. Talk about the toughness that you guys are bringing and
all the close games this season and now it's the end of the season and you
guys are dogfighting it out. Talk about how nobody wants to play you guys.  
DJ NEWBILL: I think that the culture that we created, the senior leaders,
Coach Chambers and his staff, they just played relentless, playing gritty,
playing tough, playing physical. I think everyone knows when they play us it's
going to be a dogfight, that that's how we like to play.  
ROSS TRAVIS: You know, like he just mentioned, playing gritty, we don't quit.
We come back every day and we put in the work. It all starts with D.J. and
Coach Chambers down there. They instilled hard work in all of us, and we just
go out there and play.  
  
Q. As you mentioned, you guys have had a lot of close losses, and one of
those was the opponent you're going to play next, Purdue. What do you remember
about that game, and those close losses, did they help kind of give you guys
some resolve coming into the Big Ten Tournament?  
ROSS TRAVIS: Yeah, I think we could take something from each of those close
losses. Those close losses hurt the most, but we could take a whole lot from
them. One thing that I remember from Purdue is they play hard, just like us,
so we're going to have to go out there and play harder than them.  
DJ NEWBILL: Well, yeah, definitely. Being in those late game situations,
four‑minute games, two‑minute games, coming down to one possession, one stop,
one rebound, I think we learn from that because we've lost so many. But yeah,
I think we're a different team then than we are now. We're looking forward to
a dogfight. Purdue plays hard, like Ross said, and we play hard, so it's going
to be a great one.  
  
Q. D.J., I heard you say yesterday very candidly that you were kind of
disappointed being left off the First ‑Team All‑Conference Team. Do you feel
like the deeper you go into the tournament the more you're kind of showing
that you belong with that top group?  
DJ NEWBILL: I'm just focused on playing hard for my teammates. The voting is
over, I can't go back and change it, so right now I'm just focused on playing
game by game.  
  
Q. Just talk about the senior leadership, Ross stepping up, and just how the
seniors kind of put this team on their back today and dug it out.  
COACH CHAMBERS: Yeah, they really stepped up at a critical point in the game
to give us a little cushion, D.J.'s little run, and Ross did it throughout the
entire game. He played really hard, battling those guys inside. They're huge,
and he was fearless in there.  
I was really proud of them for this fact: It's noted that he's not a great
free‑throw shooter, and everybody knows that. He was five for six today, and
that's what seniors do. They step up, they seize the moment, and they take
care of business, and I couldn't be happier for Ross Travis and our team.  
D.J.'s leadership in huddles was amazing. Him and I were both coaching the
team in huddles, coaching, what are we doing if this happens, if this occurs
this is what we're doing.  
Give Brandon Taylor a lot of credit, he put the ball out, a junior that we're
trying to develop him into the next leader, so those guys really did a
phenomenal job, all game long in game, but more importantly in the huddles.  
  
Q. Ross's baseline drive, had you ever seen anything like that from him
before even in practice?  
COACH CHAMBERS: Yeah, actually we have. We have a drill we call lay‑up drill,
so we work on‑‑ lay‑ups are so critical on any level, and if you can make
lay‑ups, it's really going to help you out, and we work on baseline drives
from the corners, and we work on that reverse to exactly what he did. I've
seen him do it for four years. But the tenaciousness of him driving so hard,
knowing time and score, knowing how to get to the‑‑ we were saying just get to
the free‑throw line. Whatever you do, drive it hard, straight line drive, get
bumped, you'll get to the free‑throw line, we'll win the game from there. But
we were fortunate enough for him to finish strong, and he's a really great
finisher. Ross is really good filling lanes and doing the little things for
us.  
  
Q. It is being said that nobody really wants to play you guys, you guys are
on a roll, you're a tough team. Talk about how you're being perceived out
there and the style of play you've developed here.  
COACH CHAMBERS: I'm happy for the players. For January and some of February,
we were getting knocked around pretty good in the media, in the social media.
I'm really happy for them. You saw us play, and we competed almost every
single game in the Big Ten except for a couple, and that's hard to do when
you're losing. It's really, really hard. Ross and D.J. said it. We instilled
come back to work. That's what men do. They come back, try to get better, try
to correct the problems, but be solution driven in everything we do and
prepare ourselves to be the best team we can be by the end of the year.  
I was hoping it would be in January. I was hoping it would be in February. It
just happened to be in March. I'll take it, but I'm happy for them.  
  
Q. What do you remember about the Purdue game, being one of those games that
sort of got away ‑‑  
COACH CHAMBERS: Do I have to? Do I really have to? I'm going to be old and
retired somewhere and I'm going to wake up, and it's going to be that three in
the corner after we fouled and we had the rebound right there in our hands. We
had four guys around it. Hammons does a great job and deflects it out, and it
just so happens Stevenson gets the ball. Think about the percentages of that
happening. But we learned from that. We really did learn from that experience
because we didn't play very well in overtime at all.  
But we take that, you learn from failure, and hopefully you turn it around.
But Hammons has played just terrific. Matt has done a great job with them this
year. I mean, where they were predicted and where they finished, top four,
there's something to be said for the job he did this year. I know Bo and Turg,
they got those awards, but Matt Peters is right there in my mind.  
  
Q. Coach, Iowa's guards made a combined three points. Talk about how you
guys made that happen, made those stops?  
COACH CHAMBERS: I don't think anyone gives Gesell enough credit. He's the
little engine that could, and they all just look at him, kind of 6'0", not a
great three‑point shooter. However, our game plan was try to slow him down. If
you could slow him down, it might affect the flow of their offense, and I'll
watch film, I'm not sure if we did that effectively, but I think we did a
pretty good job of it on him and Jok, and Uthoff is terrific, and Clemmons.
But I thought we did it as a team. Obviously we did it‑‑ we over‑helped
sometimes because they got 19 offensive rebounds, so again, we've got to clean
that up, 24 the night before, 19, and now we're facing Hammons and that's
going to be a challenge. But our game plan was to slow down Gesell.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 12, 2015

  

### [James Blackmon, Jr.](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=27872)

### [Tom Crean](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13756)

### [Yogi Ferrell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25209)

### [Emmitt Holt](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=27947)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  

Indiana  71  
Northwestern - 56

  
COACH CREAN: We're extremely proud of the way our players played from start to
finish, and in a 40‑minute game, you're going to have some runs, and it's how
you get back to the next run. When you hit a lull‑‑ we hit a little bit of a
lull, but we reversed it and played right through it. Some of the things we
really need to get corrected were second‑chance points and doing a much better
job on the defensive glass, and in turn doing an even better job on the
offensive glass. We did that. We moved the ball extremely well, but the
pressure of our defense, the energy, the tenacity, all those things were
really, really strong, and extremely proud of the es and the way that they
prepared them and the way these guys and their teammates, the way that they
played.  
  
Q. Yogi, how much emphasis was put on improving the defensive disposition of
this team, and speak to the job you and Robert did on Tre Demps?  
YOGI FERRELL: Yeah, we wanted to come out here and just get a defensive
mindset. We felt like Buckley prepared us well for playing Northwestern, and
we knew basically their sets. We knew their tendencies. So it was just all on
us to get out there and get stops. We felt like we had the mental will to go
out there and get stops and play for one another, and everything else falls
into place.  
  
Q. In preparing for this game, was there a big emphasis on attacking the
offensive boards, especially because they play zone?  
JAMES BLACKMON, JR.: Well, like said, we wanted to attack the defensive
boards, and that led to offensive boards, as well. And like Yogi said, our
main thing was defense, and I think tonight was all about our mindset.  
  
Q. Yogi, especially in the first half, you guys were really flying around,
the bench was up a lot. Seemed like there was more in this game. Was it the
NCAA bid? Was it the atmosphere around the program the last couple weeks? What
led to that extra spark?  
YOGI FERRELL: The thing that led to that extra spark is everybody coming
together, saying we're not going to lose this game. We've got that mental
mindset to go out there and play for one another. We don't want to lose. I
felt like tonight we went out there and created our own energy, and when we
create our own energy, we get rolling off of one another and everybody plays
as a team, and we all look good.  
  
Q. For anybody, I think IU fans are probably asking the question: Why isn't
it like this all the time? How would you answer that?  
EMMITT HOLT: Well, I would say that‑‑ well, basically we just come together.
When we get on runs like we did tonight, we just come together like Yogi said,
create our own energy, and when we don't do that, we don't perform like we're
supposed to. So we've got to hold each other accountable, and when we do that,
we perform like we did today.  
  
Q. Looking ahead to tomorrow night, how do you feel about playing against
Melo Trimble? Seemed like you guys had a back and forth your first two
games.  
YOGI FERRELL: Yeah, we played Maryland the third time, both times have been
close. We know they're a great team. They've got great guards with Dez Wells
and Melo Trimble, great bigs inside, so it's all about diving into that film,
taking away some of the tendencies. It's just going to be a fun game.  
  
Q. Dealing with a seven ‑footer like Olah and looking at the numbers and how
many offensive rebounds you guys got, what was your mentality or your plan for
getting on the offensive glass with Olah there?   
EMMITT HOLT: Well, with us, it's all about the fight because, as everybody
knows, we don't have the tallest guys on the team. emphasized about the fight.
We've got to run right into it and take on the challenge, and that's what we
do.  
  
Q. Was it just the mindset or the intensity that was different tonight about
the last time you saw these guys?  
JAMES BLACKMON, JR.: Yeah, it was about the mindset. We felt like we owed them
one. We learned a lot from the film, the ing staff, and we basically knew
everything we had to do to win, and we're just going to try to carry it into
tomorrow.  
  
Q. Tom, is that the best sustained defensive effort you've seen from your
guys this year or at least in a while?  
COACH CREAN: I'm not sure. We've had some really good defensive efforts
throughout the season. Pittsburgh at home, SMU at home. I thought we did some
really good things against Maryland. I'd have to go back and really think
about it. But for this time of year and in a situation like this, this week to
come in here and play that way with the youth of this team that we have and
for them to be recharged and energized and doing what we needed to do
defensively and really understanding what we wanted to take away, and the
bottom line is, it all starts with Tre Demps. That's the bottom line. I think
he was averaging 14 the first time we played them, he had 23. So really
getting after a player like that is crucial, putting pressure on the ball.  
But the biggest thing for us is we had to do a much better job when we look
back over the last three games if we're going to find a common denominator.
We're giving up too many second‑chance points. We were not making our free
throws as much, but more importantly, we weren't getting nearly as many
attempts and were giving too many attempts to the other team. And then we were
getting beat a little bit on points off turnovers, and then when you add a
Demps situation when we're giving up too many points to the best player, those
are all things that have to be part of the mindset.  
And I thought our players did an excellent job of, again, locking into that,
playing over the time of year and the significance of this part of the season
and really locking into what they had to do to get better this week, and
hopefully it continues on for us.  
  
Q. When Collins took JerShon with about a minute left, you called him over.
What did you say to him?  
COACH CREAN: I told him he had a great career. Really proud of the career he's
had. He's dealt with a lot of different things with injuries and the ing
change. I don't know the young man, but I thought he handled himself extremely
well during his career here. And the same thing with Dave Sobolewski. It's a
class program. Bill did a great job recruiting those young people in there.  
Chris has done a fantastic job of building down there. Chris is one of the ‑‑
forget youth or I shouldn't say youth, forget age. Chris is one of the best es
around. He's tremendous. He's been not only raised into it and worked into it,
but ‑‑ it's one thing to have the father that you have and have the former
boss that you have, but you have to be able to come in and do it, and that's
exactly what he's done. And he's outstanding, and we knew it would be a great
battle with them. I just wanted to tell him I was a big fan of how he played,
handled himself.  
  
Q. How is Hanner, and will he play tomorrow?  
COACH CREAN: It's too early to tell. He reaggravated an earlier injury. He's
being x‑rayed, I believe, here. I love our medical team, so whatever needs to
happen to help him, it'll happen, and we'll hope for the best.  
  
Q. Do you think you're in the NCAA Tournament now?  
COACH CREAN: Well, I don't know. You know, I really don't know, and no one
knows. That's the beauty of it all. I would think when you look at criteria, I
would think when you look at what we've done with the RPI wins, what we've
done with the non‑conference scheduling and winning some of the games that we
did, who you choose to play, I would hope so. I think when you win 20 games
and you end up winning now the tenth conference game in this league, I know it
was 9 and 9 during the league and beat some of the teams that we've beaten, I
would hope so. We're getting better.  
Colin is not all the way back yet, but I love what happens when this team
starts to get that jolt again, what they're capable of on the defensive end,
what they're capable of on the glass, and it makes our shooting so much
better. When we're not guarding as well as we need to, when we're not
rebounding as well as we need to, it puts a lot of pressure on our offense.
That's what they're learning and what they've learned at different times
throughout the year, and I think it showed today. When their defensive
rebounding is at the forefront of everything, that drives our offense to a
high level because we're playing a very good offensive and defensive team
today. They wouldn't have had the finish to the season they had if they
weren't. I love our capabilities, I love our potential, and I certainly hope
that we are, but we have not spent any time talking about that, and we didn't
spend any time talking about it in the locker room in the short time we were
together, and we haven't spent any time talking about it tonight. It's all
been focused on what they need to do to get better, how we can continue to get
better, and then getting ready for each and every game.  
  
Q. Nearly half the shots taken tonight were three ‑pointers. In general do
you think that's a position where your team can succeed?  
COACH CREAN: I'm not sure. I think what worked tonight worked tonight. I think
the ball moved. I think the bottom line for us is that the ball go through the
paint and what did we make here, 11 threes? When the ball goes through the
paint, whether it's in a post‑up situation, whether it's in a kick‑out
situation, that's the most important thing for us.  
  
Q. I asked the players this question. I think Indiana fans watch tonight and
wonder why this team can't play that type of defense all the time, and how
would you answer that?  
COACH CREAN: Youth. If anybody could get everything, with the exception of a
few teams, absolutely cornered, then it would be a really clear‑cut answer.
It's not. I know this, they work hard, extremely, extremely hard every day,
and sometimes they press in the sense of trying to make it happen and trying
to make a play. And some of our turnovers have been almost over‑passing at
times, but we're just going to focus on the way that we played today and get
ourselves ready for the next game.  
  
Q. Looking forward to tomorrow, what's the challenge of stopping a team that
has two guards as good as Dez Wells and Melo Trimble?  
COACH CREAN: We've got to stop the team. It's not about individual match‑ups.
Obviously those are two very good players, but once you start focusing so much
on them, then Jake Layman, Evan Smotrycz, the freshman guards like Wiley and
Nickens and Pack, those guys make you pay. We've got to do a really good job
all the way across the board. They're extremely well ed. They play well on
both ends of the court, extremely well. They can score inside, and they can
score outside. They've got great penetration, they do a great job of getting
to the foul line. We've had a couple of good battles with them, one we won,
one they won, and we're looking forward to it.

### [John Beilein](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13675)

_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  

Michigan  73  
Illinois - 55

  
COACH BEILEIN: Really proud of our team because we know Illinois is a very
good team. We've been seeing some things in practice over the last couple of
weeks that showed some growth, even though we may not have seen that in a
couple of our losses at the end of this year. Every day these kids are
embracing the growth mindset we've tried to have.  
Really proud that we could show that today, and our kids really played the
best defense we've played in a long time, really connected. And then our
offense, we're finding multiple ways to score right now because of multiple
ball handlers now rather than just one or two, which we had earlier in the
year.  
  
Q. Aubrey, talk about the team's mentality coming into this game, the one
‑and‑done mentality. I know Coach talked about how UConn could do it and win
all those games, you guys could do it. Could you talk about how you embrace
that mentality?   
AUBREY DAWKINS: We're just looking for every game, not to look too far in the
future, but to play every game and focus on that game, not looking ahead and
who we're going to play next. Just trying to win the game we're on, and that's
helped us stay focused and turn up the aggressiveness we need to get a win.  
  
Q. Zak, the coach was saying that he saw growth over practice. Specifically
what type of growth, and what was it that we saw in that game that kind of
exemplified that growth?  
ZAK IRVIN: I just think our unity that we had. We came up with a great start,
up 14‑2 and Illinois was able to make their run, but I think we were able to
stay connected and stay together and were able counter that run and make ours.  
  
Q. Muhammed, first few minutes of the first half and then again in the first
few minutes of the second half, you took it right Egwu for a lay ‑up. What did
you do differently against their defense today that allowed you to have more
success?  
MUHAMMED‑ALI ABDUR‑RAHKMAN: Just being more aggressive, not being passive and
let them get up in you in defense, and I was just being aggressive from the
start.  
  
Q. Muhammed and Aubrey, you guys have taken on much bigger roles as the
season has gone on. What has been key for you guys growing into those roles
and embracing them and playing well?  
AUBREY DAWKINS: I think a lot of it's just been understanding what the
situation is and knowing what we need to step up, and with our aggressiveness,
our focus in the game, from the scouting reports, everything, we need to step
up and focus on what we're working on.  
MUHAMMED‑ALI ABDUR‑RAHKMAN: Studying the game to know what's going on in the
game, things like that, strategy against us is definitely a big part of our
growth, and we just want to continue to be growing.  
  
Q. How much of that studying is Coach Beilein? Is that something he's been
telling you guys to focus on every single day?  
MUHAMMED‑ALI ABDUR‑RAHKMAN: I think it's both Coach B and us. We all want to
become better players and that's one way to become a better player.  
  
Q. What did you do today against Illinois to get the win?  
ZAK IRVIN: Once again, I just think we stayed together. We went to Illinois,
we had the lead for most of the game, but we weren't able to finish. And I was
just proud of all the guys and how hard we competed today. With the run they
made, we were just able to counter that and really had control of the game for
the most part.  
  
Q. Aubrey, it's been a while since we, the media, have discussed Michigan
without talking about the injuries, injury ‑depleted Michigan and all that. Is
that part, do you think, of your team's identity? Internally do you guys sort
of look at yourselves that way, too, and somehow use it as motivation?   
AUBREY DAWKINS: Yeah, it's definitely motivation. We're not going to be slack
or upset about the things that happened to our team in the past. We're going
to try and step up and keep get being better. We're not going to let a couple
setbacks hold us back. We're going to try and get better, no matter what the
situation is.  
  
Q. You talked about the growth process. Sometimes in sports we see when
teams go through adversity situations where younger players have to elevate
their roles, then next year you see the benefits of that. Are you starting to
see that a little bit early with this team, though?  
COACH BEILEIN: Yeah, that was our film session last night when we got here.
There was about five or six plays yesterday‑‑ I watch every practice, I go
over it again, and then I try and show them clips that I think are really
important to the next game or something down the road, and there was five or
six things that happened in that game that flat‑out weren't happening, let
alone two months ago, weren't happening last week. Just the game, especially
Aubrey, Muhammed and Kam, the game was just slower. All of a sudden it was
hitting in some areas, and obviously to keep that focus is hard, but that's
all we did. We saw the cards we were dealt. It just became, all right, we're
100 percent‑‑ not 100 percent‑‑ we're going to be half development of this
team and half trying to win that next game because we've got to think about
the future as well as today.  
  
Q. Illinois threw in the second half everything they did at you the last
meeting when they were coming back and you didn't let them come back this
time. What was different? Why were you guys more ready?  
COACH BEILEIN: I don't know. I mean, when we were up by 20, it's tough on
Illinois's part to get motivated to expend all that energy when things are
slim that you can win the game. We did a couple just new things against their
pressure, but we didn't turn the ball over a lot last time, we just turned it
over a couple key times, and we didn't have those times today, thank goodness.
We had one late.  
Our guys, every day they grow, and they recognize things, and the coaches
recognize what they can handle and what they can't handle, and that's the key,
how we can cut that off and make sure that we're all on the same wavelength
while they still can grow.  
  
Q. What were the new things you tried?  
COACH BEILEIN: Zak in‑bounded the ball a lot. Zak Ervin had six assists today.
You can look it up, Zak had five assists after eight games this year, I think
it was eight games. So he wasn't showing that‑‑ see the whole floor. As his
numbers have grown, one of the big things, now you put a taller guy there. He
was not able to do that earlier, and we've been working with him sort of on
the side, just his passing, it all sort of came together. And now we can get a
better guy taking the ball out of bounds at times. It depends, if it's a dead
ball, it was Zak today.  
  
Q. You've been experiencing it for the last few months now, but how
continually impressed and proud are you of these guys for stepping up with
some of the injuries you have?  
COACH BEILEIN: We love going to practice every day. We have zero issues off
the court or in practice, other than throwing the ball to the other team or
not being able to make a shot sometimes. They are just all in, how can we get
better. You look at those freshmen, we couldn't think about putting them in
the game earlier in the year. They just were not ready defensively, and every
day the scout team was beating them and beating them and they were missing
switches and missing assignments, and every day they've gotten better. We had
no other choice.  
It's really good because they're such great kids from great families, they
deserve this because it has been difficult. They've seen more losses with
Michigan than we've seen in a long time. I'm really proud of them.  
  
Q. If you could just comment on Spike Albrecht's leadership and what he's
brought to the team, especially baling through the injury he's had this
year.  
COACH BEILEIN: Yeah, we obviously could not do this without him. He's our only
primary ball handler that can really play, and it's made other people get
better. But I'm just telling you, he works hard every day. I've got to be very
careful and try to rest him because he reminds me of the Zach Novak types that
we've had that they go hard every day in practice, and you've got to sort of
channel him back.  
The last couple of weeks, Dakich got as many reps as he did because I wanted
him to rest because he goes after it. The way he sees the floor and does some
other things, we'd be in tough shape without him right now. Some people would
probably argue with you've got some good players. Some people have to argue
who's been the most valuable. Some people would have to say that guy has been
incredible all year long for us.  
  
Q. Given last year's tournament game against Illinois, they gave you more
than a lot of people expected them to. I don't know about you, but in this
year's overtime games, both of them, were you surprised to see the Illini just
start slowly and then not have any kind of an answer at all in the second
half?  
COACH BEILEIN: You know, all these games, well over 1,000, never surprised by
anything you see. The teams will just come out in a funk sometimes, and
coaches have no control, players have no control. It's just difficult.  
And same thing can happen to us, as well. We've had some games here where I
think Ohio State‑‑ when you ‑‑ the Big Ten champion, and one of the big ‑‑
with Ohio State, and it was like a 30‑point mismatch in the semifinals game.
Teams are going to come out, and you just don't know in this atmosphere what
can happen. It doesn't mean that tomorrow they couldn't beat us the same way.
They're 19 years old, they're 20 years old. It's been a long season. Men's
basketball plays the toughest, most rigorous schedule of any sport in college
basketball, and kids go through a lot, getting up at 2:00 or 3:00 in the
morning midweek. You don't know what's going to happen, particularly this time
of the year.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 11, 2015

  

### [Tim Miles](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18102)

### [Terran Petteway](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26714)

### [Shavon Shields](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25003)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  

Penn State  68  
Nebraska - 65

  
COACH MILES: Even though the outcome didn't go our way, I thought our kids
really battled hard all night, even when things weren't going our way. I'm
proud of them for that, and I'll always be proud of them for that because a
lot of teams would maybe send it in, but with the streak we've been on, but
these guys have not done that and will not do that, and I'm‑‑ if you would
have told me we were going to stop at 13 a month, five, six weeks ago,
whatever it was, I would have bet you any amount of money that that wouldn't
happen. But unfortunately it has, and so we just regroup, get ready, and we'll
respond and be ready and be better for next year.  
  
Q. Coming from Nebraska to Chicago, what was it like to play in the United
Center?  
TERRAN PETTEWAY: It was pretty special, came in here with these group of guys,
like Coach Miles said, anybody would have probably shut it down after we just
went on losing six or seven in a row. We came here with the mindset we were
going to be here until Sunday, it just didn't happen that way.  
SHAVON SHIELDS: Yeah, I agree.  
  
Q. Terran, can you talk about the frustration that you're out there
competing and clawing and trying to get it done, and team ‑wise just nothing
drops, goes in the basket? Can you talk about that just not tonight but the
last stretch?   
TERRAN PETTEWAY: Yeah, like you said, it's been happening the last stretch.
We've been playing great defense in conference play, even all season long.
It's just shots don't go our way. It seems like that's been happening night in
and night out. We get shots that roll in and out. Like on a fast break I think
Shavon had a floater that rolled almost down and came right back out. It's
very frustrating, man. I can't even really explain it.  
  
Q. Do you find yourself in the last few games getting to a point in the
game, here it goes again? Is it impossible to keep that thought out of your
mind?  
TERRAN PETTEWAY: No, I think we stop feeling sorry for ourselves the week we
was preparing for Illinois, so we was just going in there with reckless
abandon. They kept coming out and we were still going there. As you seen
Shavon I think he got hit a couple times. He kept going in there. We didn't
care. We was going to keep going and keep fighting until the very end.  
  
Q. How hard has the last few weeks been for you?  
COACH MILES: You know, as a coach your essence‑‑ when they introduce you at
the rotary club they say Tim Miles had this record and that record. They
define you on winning‑‑ it's not like they define you. It's a bottom line
business for our guys. That's what's really difficult. You can sell a house
and take a smaller price and maybe take a small hit, but you either win or
lose the game, and when you've lost‑‑ I don't know and the guys don't even
know. I know that his number was wrong, like seven or eight in a row, I
think‑‑ you know, it wears on your‑‑ like I say, you go to the shopping center
with your head down, and you go to the grocery store with your head down and
hope you don't run into anybody and regurgitate what you're going through and
the whole deal.  
It's difficult, but at the same time, it's a big‑boy business, and these guys
know that. Like I told them, how you regroup and handle yourself, losing
doesn't make you a loser, winning doesn't make you a winner. How you handle
yourself with dignity and how we respond from this as a team and as a program
and these other guys moving on really is what matters most.  
  
Q. What is it like to come in here to Chicago, the tournament is not going
to be here for another couple of years. What makes playing at the United
Center special?  
COACH MILES: Well, Chicago is a great town, one of my favorites, and United
Center obviously with Jordan's statue out front and everything that they've
had such a strong franchise for a long time, it's a great event for our league
and our kids especially.  
  
Q. When you watched the film from today, whatever you might find that you'd
like to do better, what is it that you'd like to see a chance ‑‑ like the
rebound at the end, and what's it like to have it come down to that?  
COACH MILES: Yeah, well, that hurt because we had one guy with two hands on it
and the other guy thought it was an opponent, so he knocks it out of our own
guy's hand. Kind of a microcosm of our season.  
That was difficult because I knew we could get a stop. I knew that‑‑ I really
believed we could‑‑ we did the same thing against Maryland right at the end,
and we didn't get that stop, but we were all over Dez Wells. I just believe in
our guys, and it was really difficult to watch that. We dug our own hole when
we got down 16 or whatever it was with those three straight threes.  
  
Q. What helped you guys get back and claw back down from that lead early in
the second half?  
COACH MILES: I think we got like 11 straight stops, 16 out of 19 possessions
we got stops. Just defense. We pressed them a little bit. They kind of get us
running around and not thinking about anything. When you press, you're kind of
mindless. And that's good. You take your mind off the big deficit, you take
your mind off the shots, they're going in or not going in. You're able to just
kind of run around, and see if you can make some plays. And we were able to
and get them hurried up a little bit and at least get on the attack. I thought
it helped our offense, too.  
  
Q. There were several moments where Petteway kind of just took over. What
was it like having him out there today?  
COACH MILES: Well, Terran is that type of player. He can take over a game. He
can put up a big number any night. He's really a special player.  
  
Q. I don't know how many fans you had here today, but they were certainly
loud. What would you say about your fandom when you've struggled here
lately?  
COACH MILES: Our fans have been just terrific. We've oversold our arena
capacity the last two home games with a losing streak, sitting there looking
at a losing streak, and I don't know how many fan bases would do that. But the
Husker faithful have been unbelievable for us. They've really rallied around
our basketball programs, men and women alike, and it's a really special place.
It's great for the student‑athletes. They go out there against Maryland the
other night, we're dead in the water as far as postseason goes unless
something crazy happens, and there's 15,800 people at the game, and it's
crazy. The guys are really inspired by our fans. There's no doubt, our fans
make a huge difference in what we do, and tonight it was having them here,
just cheering us on, letting the refs know what's going on. They were right,
too, by the way. But it was good. It was great to have them. They're
unbelievable.  
  
Q. Was there any sign that the team that made the tournament last year was
going to have a season like this?  
COACH MILES: Well, we talked about it as a team even last summer. I talked
about it this fall in Big Ten press, media day. Like I'm curious to see if
we're a good team or just a team that got hot. Well, it would appear as though
we were a team that got hot.  
We had some guys with career years last year almost, kind of came out of
nowhere. Terran was one of them, but he kind of backed it up against. Walter
didn't quite put up the numbers that he had, but Walter has been battling a
hip flexor the last three games too and it's really affected him. We didn't
even take him to Illinois. But he tried to do what he could, but we just
couldn't get enough force on the glass.  
You know, I'm excited about our future. We've got an excellent recruiting
class coming in, a couple Chicago kids, Ed Murrow and Glenn Watson. I saw
Glenn get 31 last night. I'm going to watch Ed on Friday. Michael Jacobson
just lost in the Iowa State tournament today, and then of course Andrew White,
III was one of Virginia's best players his senior year of high school and
played at Kansas and has been sitting out this year. So I think we're going to
add some real talent, and every program has retraction or whatever we call it,
restructuring, transfers, so we'll see what happens here at the end of the
year with our year‑end meetings, but I'm really excited about what we're
building.  
  
Q. The excitement of last season and everything you kind of built for the
program, how do you summarize the disappointment of this season for you
personally?  
COACH MILES: Equally. As excited as I was last year is as disappointed as I am
this year, and I talked a lot of trash on the golf course last year, so I was
pretty pumped up.  
  
Q. You mentioned the fast start or the fast finish you guys had last year.
Oftentimes that brings expectations.  
COACH MILES: Oh, yeah.  
  
Q. Does a program that maybe hasn't seen that, is that something new you
have to deal with? Is that a factor in what happened?  
COACH MILES: Pat Riley wrote the whole book: This is what you're going to go
through. Last year was the innocent climb, and this year is your test of will.
The one thing I'm proud about is although we didn't handle things well early,
we really had some‑‑ just the way our guys behaved. It wasn't bad, on the
court, I mean. It really affected our chemistry.  
I always just watch how tight‑‑ what a coach can't control, like for instance,
how tight are their huddles, how much are they communicating, and you can
always tell what a team is like or what they're doing or how into each other
and the event that they're going through is by those things. I thought our
kids were really good tonight, even when things were bad. And they've been
that way down the stretch, and that means a lot to me because there were some
times when it felt hopeless.  
This league is a bear, and there's no let‑up. Penn State has got a player like
D.J. Newbill that is going to play professionally for a long time somewhere,
and they were 12‑1 coming into the league. And I think they lost six or eight
in a row or whatever it was, Northwestern lost 10 in a row, we ended the way
we did. There's some teams that can do some major damage that can get
overwhelmed, too. I'm excited about where we're going. I think we'll be back.
I'd say get us while you can.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 11, 2015

  

### [Joey King](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24795)

### [Nate Mason](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28499)

### [Richard Pitino](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25315)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  

Minnesota  80  
Rutgers - 68

  
COACH PITINO: Well, obviously I thought we showed great will and determination
to win that game. They came back, cut it to, I believe, six, and then we kind
of took that punch and went and delivered a very good punch right after that.
I thought that the bench guys, Nate, who‑‑ not that he's a bench guy, but was
tremendous. Joey obviously was great. Bakary and Gas are starting to give us a
lot more.  
The defense was good. The rebounding not so much, but it got a little bit
better in the second half. Excited about a win like that, and to do that with
Andre scoring zero points and Mo not being at his best was certainly something
we're proud of.  
Get rest, focus on Ohio State now.  
  
Q. Nate, I know that Coach Pitino told you a couple days ago he wanted you
to be a little bit more aggressive. What's been your mindset?  
NATE MASON: Just do anything I could do for the team to help us win. I try to
come out, set the tone, push the pace, and get my teammates the ball but also
look to my scoring, so I felt like I did a pretty good job today of doing
that?  
  
Q. Joey, that's ten threes for you now in the last two games. Do you feel
like you're shooting as well right now as you have this year?  
JOEY KING: Yeah, you know, the way I've been playing recently it's just kind
of what I came here to do. You know, Coach‑‑ all the coaching staff and all my
teammates have been giving me all the confidence in the world to just let it
fly whenever I'm open. Yeah, I love to shoot, so having all the confidence
from all the people around me feels really good.  
  
Q. Joey, just talk about the pump fake, it works to your advantage now.
Teams obviously respect your three ‑point shot, but you were able to get past
them and get to the rim a little bit today.   
JOEY KING: Yeah, a little bit. I was obviously shooting a little bit more
today rather than pump faking, but when I'm not open, I was really just
looking into Mo and trying to find other guys on the perimeter.  
  
Q. Joey, you guys went on a couple big runs in the second half. What do you
feel like was the difference just from an energy standpoint with the team?
What was starting to click for you guys?  
JOEY KING: Well, we really got after them in the full court, got a couple of
easy transition baskets from steals. Even when they scored, we were getting
the ball out quick and pushing it down the floor. So I think that really gave
us a boost and a jump start there in the second half to really push out the
lead.  
  
Q. Joey, what's practice been like for you guys the past few days when you
know you're facing teams you've already played this season?  
JOEY KING: Well, it all comes down to the little things, just being more
prepared than the other team, and you know, just being as fresh as possible.
We've just been working hard, whether that's mentally or physically, depending
on the day. Coach was really smart about all of that.  
  
Q. What was the environment like in Chicago?  
NATE MASON: It's like a dream come true playing in the United Center. It
almost felt like playing in Madison, so we just try to come out here and get a
big‑time win, so just keep going.  
JOEY KING: You know, it's a great experience, and it's always fun playing in a
big‑time arena under the lights. You know, obviously the Big Ten Tournament is
a big‑time stage, and it's just a lot of fun to play at.  
  
Q. Speaking of the crowd, you got a nice little ovation there as you checked
out. What was that like?  
JOEY KING: It felt really good, just to represent the home state well on the
national stage. It just felt really good, and just glad we could come out with
the win today.  
  
Q. Joey, you talked the other day about starting to realize that you'll be
the leader next year when the seniors are gone. Do you feel like this play at
the Big Ten Tournament is going to help springboard that?  
JOEY KING: Yeah, in the games I obviously have to become a better vocal
leader, but I think that'll come with time in the summer once our seniors move
on and graduate. In the games I just want to do the best I can to compete on
every single possession, but I'm sure I'll become much better this summer.  
  
Q. You guys almost beat Ohio State earlier this year. Does that give you
confidence going into tomorrow combined with the fact that Ohio State has been
a bit streaky themselves this year?  
NATE MASON: I mean, yeah, we look back at the film. We feel like we let them
go. All we have to do is just come out, play our game and just focus on the
little things, rebound, play defense, and don't let them get off to a hot
start.  
JOEY KING: Yeah, like Nate said, we've been playing with everybody all season,
so there's really no team that we don't have confidence against. We've just
got to come out and play our game, and that's when we have success.  
  
Q. Nate, having gone against D'Angelo this season, what do you look forward
to tomorrow night?  
NATE MASON: Just making his life miserable, just try to contain him the best I
can, try to do whatever I can do against him.  
  
Q. Coach, talk a little bit about Ohio State in that overtime time game back
in January.  
COACH PITINO: You know, to be honest, it's not real fresh, just because I
haven't watched it yet. But obviously what D'Angelo Russell was doing in the
first half, that's what lottery picks do. I can't believe we held them without
a basket for the second half and all of overtime. But we know that's a team,
too. Now, Wisconsin went into their place and played great. Now, Wisconsin
does that to a lot of teams, so we know we're going to have a very hungry
basketball team, so we've got to be rested and ready to go because Ohio State
certainly can play with anybody in the country.  
  
Q. Nate now has had several big games in big games. Does that give you
confidence, I guess, that he doesn't shy away from that going into next year
with him playing such a big role?  
COACH PITINO: Yeah, yeah. I think he was a little bothered that he wasn't
all‑freshman on that team, certainly, and I said, listen, there's only one way
to do it is to take it out on everybody else. He is not‑‑ normally freshmen
hit a wall of some sort. He has not done that. I'm very, very excited about
him. I think he will be one of the better guards in the league, and again,
like you said, he does it in big games. That's what's very, very encouraging
and exciting, and I thought what he really did today, he was the guy huddling
everybody up, talking, communicating, so you could tell he's trying to start
doing that now, which is nice to see.  
  
Q. Andre has gone scoreless in the last 66 minutes, going back to the last
game ‑‑  
COACH PITINO: How do you figure that out, so 40 and‑‑  
  
Q. So like four minutes left in the first half of the Penn State game was
the last time he scored.  
COACH PITINO: That's not real good.  
  
Q. Is he pressing? Is it just another little ‑‑  
COACH PITINO: I don't know. I wish I had the answer. I'll tell you what I
don't like, I don't like that he's not getting to the foul line. That's
something I don't like. He needs to get fouled more, but I thought he was a
great teammate today. You know, I'm not trying to avoid the question. I don't
really have an answer to be honest with you. I don't think he's pressing. I
think the biggest gripe I have, he needs to get to the foul line more.  
  
Q. I apologize in advance for the dad question, but you're undefeated when
your dad is in the house. How did it come about him being at this game when
he's got one tomorrow?  
COACH PITINO: It was a little weird, and he texted me, and he said‑‑ I gave
him a little crap because I think he felt bad, because I said you haven't been
to one of my games this year. So it was nice of him to come, and he texted me,
and he was like, I want to speak to the team a little bit before the game, and
I said, where were you at Wisconsin? Could we have gotten you then?  
It was great. For him to do that, and especially they're playing at, I don't
know, 1:00 or 2:00 tomorrow, it was great to see. Obviously he's got his own
team to coach, and this year was a little bit different in terms of the
schedule. We were playing a lot of the same days. But I want him to be a part
of that. I want him to be a part of our team as much as he possibly can, much
like Doug Collins with Chris Collins. That's always great to see because he's
got such incredible knowledge. He watches every single one of our games.  
But again, I've been to a lot of his games the last 20 years, so hold the
father of the year trophy. It's nice, but he owes me. He's got a long way to
go to pay me back for me coming to all his games, and I remind him of that all
the time. I did get paid, but not during the Celtics days. Nobody was paying
me during those days.  
  
Q. Joey was one of the guys that you stuck with, with Andre all year in the
starting lineup. There are times you I you were wondering why you had so much
faith in him, but he's obviously paid it off toward the end of the year.  
COACH PITINO: Joey or Andre? We don't have any other options really with Joey,
so that was an easy decision, just because we don't have any other options.  
He does a lot of things‑‑ he reminds me of my dad's player Luke Hancock from
Louisville. He's kind of got that similar type game, plays with great
confidence. Again, I said if there's a guy that everybody would vote is the
hardest worker on the team every single day, every single possession, they'd
say Joey without a doubt. He's not a great verbal leader. That's the next step
for him. But I've never wavered from starting him. A lot of that has to do
with there's nobody else to start, but I haven't.  
  
Q. You guys got better on the defensive boards in the second half, but in
the first half they were ‑‑ had ten offensive rebounds. What do you want your
guys to see them do differently?  
COACH PITINO: I thought the biggest thing was the guards were not coming back
and rebounding. They were playing some big guys certainly, but I thought
DeAndre set the tone with six rebounds. That was really good, obviously.
Carlos did a couple good things, as well. But bigs are blocking out, guards
need to come back and rebound the ball. That's a big team. They played big
lineups.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 11, 2015

  

### [Kadeem Jack](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26632)

### [Eddie Jordan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16808)

### [Myles Mack](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24970)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  

Minnesota  80  
Rutgers - 68

  
COACH JORDAN: Last year our season ended with one Pitino. This year our season
ended with another Pitino, so I hope there are no more Pitinos out there we
have to play against at the end of the season. These guys have been a pleasure
to coach, and we understand what this league is about. It is a tough, tough
league. It was a pleasure to step up to the challenge, to be successful. I
told my team you don't measure your success in numbers as you move forward in
life, even now. So we don't measure what we have done and what we tried to
accomplish this year in numbers. It's about what was in our heart, what was in
our head, how we developed, how we became a team, how much we had a
competitive spirit. So all that was right above board for us.  
Did we have enough to be successful with the 12th toughest schedule in the
country? We're not built for that yet. We will be, and we're working every day
to be that way. That being said, congratulations to Minnesota and Richard.
He's a terrific dude. He's a terrific coach. They turned us over at opportune
times for them, not for us, and they made shots. So when they turned us over
and they made shots, that broke the game open, although we had the ball with
four points down and we had chances to take the thing back to a tied game. But
they did enough to overcome what we tried to do, and that's where we were.  
  
Q. First year in the Big Ten finally over, how would you categorize the
experience, and especially today at the Big Ten Tournament?  
MYLES MACK: The experience was great. Every arena we went to, the atmosphere
was great. They had great fans. It was great competition, great players. The
experience for me was A+. I love the Big Ten. It's a great conference.  
KADEEM JACK: I pretty much second that. I think the Big Ten had a lot of
different opportunities going to big floors, playing in different arenas, and
also people coming into our arena. I think it was real, real big
opportunities.  
  
Q. I was wondering what you would like to be remembered for, your legacy
with Rutgers, obviously a lot of ups and downs your four years here.  
KADEEM JACK: I'd say passionate. That's about it. Passionate.  
MYLES MACK: A great teammate, always wanted my teammates to just do better, be
great guys on and off the court, and just play as hard as they can. Just a
leader out there.  
  
Q. In the second half when they kind of started to pull away a little bit
and get that cushion, what sort of happened when the pace of the game got away
from you guys a little bit and they sort of pulled away?  
MYLES MACK: They started pressing and they sped us up and they turned us over,
and they hit big threes and got easy lay‑ups, and it was hard for us to come
back after that.  
  
Q. I was just wondering what are your thoughts knowing this is the last time
you're going to play in a Rutgers uniform collegiately?  
KADEEM JACK: Just thankful. I think a lot of people don't get this
opportunity, and I'm very, very thankful for this opportunity, and I'm
thankful for everybody that helped me through my four years, especially Coach
Van Macon. He did a lot for me, and I really appreciate that.  
MYLES MACK: I'm also thankful. A lot of kids would kill to be in a Rutgers
uniform, so I just appreciate the school for giving me the opportunity to come
here and being a student‑athlete, and I just want to thank everybody for
believing in me.  
  
Q. You guys were looking for a third scorer to support you guys and you got
15 today from Bishop in the second half. Talk about his effort.  
MYLES MACK: We broke the press and that pull‑up jumper is his shot, and every
time he got to it, it went in. He got hot and kept breaking the press and took
those shots, and I think those are good shots for him.  
KADEEM JACK: I think him having a game like that kind of gave him a lot of
confidence coming in, probably carry over to next year. Just get in the gym,
work, and do what he has to do next year.  
  
Q. Was there anything that necessarily surprised you about this first season
in the Big Ten or something that you found out that was maybe unexpected?  
COACH JORDAN: No. I thought we knew that the league was going to be tough from
1 to 14. Last year we were in the AAC, they had the defending champions in
Louisville, they had the future champions in UConn, but we had success against
the bottom half of the league. It's tough in this league. There's no real easy
bottom half.  
But I thought we were competitive, we had some chances. We just didn't have
enough. We didn't have a third scorer. We didn't have another playmaker. I
thought Myles was wonderful converting from a small 2 guard to trying to keep
us organized as a point, and that was a process in the last two years, but he
did everything for us. He tried to score, kept us organized. Kadeem had an
up‑and‑down year, I thought. It was probably on me. I didn't do enough things
for him to be consistent enough.  
It's a tough league. Wonderful coaches, wonderful venues where you go to
different places, and we're looking forward to being ‑‑ next year with a new
type of team and new style of play.  
  
Q. What would you say the fan turnout was for Rutgers today obviously being
very far from the school, and just what was the difference do you think
between the Big Ten Tournament and the tournament experience from last year?  
COACH JORDAN: Well, we won a game last year in the first round of the
tournament, and then we saw the big Pitino. We weren't really concerned about
Rutgers' fan turnout. We were concerned about that locker room and how we
would compete and what kind of positive spirit we would have. We weren't
really anticipating a crowd for us, for anybody necessarily. But we love
playing here in the United Center. I think it was a great experience for our
guys. We got a shootaround today, we even took a group picture in front of
Michael Jordan's statue. And again, I told them moving forward in their life,
this team has been great for us. They going to graduate, all our seniors will
graduate in May, and you measure yourselves by your heart and how you develop
and how you get along with people and how you learn.  
They left a lot of things for our future team, and hopefully our guys
understand what it takes to be successful in this league. It's a tough league.  
  
Q. Speaking about the team of the future, obviously losing Kadeem and Myles
is going to be a tough loss. What is your thought process on moving forward?
You've been talking about getting a consistent third scorer, now you've got to
get a consistent first and second scorer. Has that been a worry of yours?  
COACH JORDAN: Absolutely. Of course. I'm a coach. Coaches always worry.  
Yeah, I think we have some good recruits coming in. We have two redshirt
freshmen stepping up next year that had a year to develop, 6'10" Ibrahima
Diallo, and a 6'5", 6'6" 2 guard in Ryan Johnson. We look forward to Michael
Williams and our three freshmen that are playing, Shaquille Dorson, Michael
Williams, and D.J. Foreman to step up now that they have a year of experience.  
Yeah, I'm always worried about who's going to be the next scorer, but when I
got here, my first year last year, Kadeem was coming off a year where he
averaged four points and two rebounds, and last year he averaged 15 and 9. We
think that's going to happen. Someone is going to step up.  
Look, even if it's by committee and it's across the board, we can average
pretty much the same. We don't need a major scorer, just consistent scoring.  
  
Q. After there was that tough stretch in the second half where they were
pressing, for the most part were you pleased with the way your guys were
handling the traps and pressing, especially in the first half when the pace
was ‑‑  
COACH JORDAN: Yeah, I mean, we really don't have‑‑ other than Myles, there was
no one throughout the year that could make plays for us if Myles didn't have
the ball. Bishop had some moments today that were good. He had some moments
that were bad. But we feel moving forward that we have‑‑ we're going to have
people coming in the program who can do that sort of thing and will be good
for us.  
Yeah, they sped us up, and I didn't mind being sped up. I really didn't mind
it. I thought if we could get in the open floor, that's Bishop's kind of game,
that's Myles' kind of game. We put Kadeem at 5 so we were small, we could run,
we could match up with them, and we just turned the ball over. We didn't‑‑
just make simple plays is all I said.  
I thought they did a wonderful thing, they being Minnesota, when some timeouts
they came out and trapped us in the corners, and on the wings they were sort
of game turning plays. So give them credit for having a game plan that way.  
  
Q. We spoke about Mac and Kadeem, what they meant to the program. What was
your message to them and to the team following this loss?  
COACH JORDAN: Again, like I said before, you don't measure success in numbers.
It's what you leave for the next generation, and they've left some lessons for
our future team. They've been terrific guys to coach. They will graduate, and
through the tough times they remained vigilant in their practice approaches
and in the way they communicate with each other. There was no cracks in the
armor for us. We stayed together, and they were successful for our program.
We've got great support from our staff, from our AD, who is here now, and
Sarah. We've had from our president all the way down, they support where we
are, what we have to do. They understand the process we have to go through.
Again, we're not built to be successful, to have the 12th toughest schedule in
the country. But again, that's what we're striving for, to be good enough to
be in that‑‑ be successful with those other programs.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 11, 2015

  

### [Patrick Chambers](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22067)

### [Shep Garner](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28486)

### [D.J. Newbill](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24994)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  

Penn State  68  
Nebraska - 65

  
COACH CHAMBERS: Another Big Ten battle, which IS ‑‑ this league is so amazing.
It's always going to come down to one or two possessions, and for us all year
that's the way it's been. I think that's our 13th or 14th game in single
digits in tight ones. I'm really proud of my team and the leadership of our
seniors. When things got tight there, we responded. We attacked the situation,
and we made some big plays and got some‑‑ finally some timely rebounds, and
Geno Thorpe hit some really big‑time free throws for us.  
But these two guys to my right really played consistent throughout and carried
this team to victory.  
Like I said, really proud of this group.  
  
Q. 45 of your points came from the Philly guards. Talk about your toughness
and what you guys bring?  
DJ NEWBILL: I mean, well, you know, it's really tough when you're not scared
of the moment, just going out there trying to give it up for our teammates.
Today we had it going. Coach wanted us to stay aggressive, so we did. We never
wanted to get rattled even when they went on their runs. Nobody on our team
really gets rattled. I think that's a testament to Coach Chambers. He brings
his Philly toughness too.  
SHEP GARNER: I think just think Philly toughness, it brings the best out of
you. Coming out of Philly you've got to be tough at everything you do. You
know, we showed that tonight.  
  
Q. D.J., you had a very impressive line all the way across. The four blocked
shots, how does that factor into what you were trying to accomplish?  
D.J. NEWBILL: I mean, those guys were attacking the basket. I was fortunate to
be able to get some clean looks at the ball, just trying to make defensive
plays for my team. We got stops. Wasn't really playing, it was just how the
game went.  
  
Q. Share your thoughts on playing the University of Iowa next. It's a team
that you guys played a very close game with just a couple of weeks ago.  
SHEP GARNER: They're a good team. They came and beat us, but we were in the
game. I'm happy to see them again.  
D.J. NEWBILL: You know, those guys got the job done at our home, so we've just
got to come back and play our game for 40 minutes. I think we played about 32
minutes of Penn State basketball. We've got to put together a 40‑minute game.  
  
Q. This is for Shep and D.J. both. You're going against a team tomorrow
whose coach is a Philly guy, too. How does that translate in this game? Is
Iowa tough to play against, and do they reflect the toughness of their
coach?  
D.J. NEWBILL: Every team in the Big Ten is tough. You see, we just went down
to the wire with Nebraska, so Iowa is no different. It's going to come down to
a few possessions, who can get the stops, who can make the plays.  
SHEP GARNER: You know, I just feel the same way. Try to go out there, play
harder than them. That's what's going to win the game, the team that plays
harder.  
  
Q. What do you think of the atmosphere here at the United Center? Playing a
first ‑round game of course it's not full, but does it matter to you guys, the
size of the crowd?   
SHEP GARNER: It doesn't matter to me, but it's great. I love the Big Ten
atmosphere. It's alive and everybody is loud. I just like it, coming from
Philly, I like it.  
D.J. NEWBILL: It's definitely big to get a chance to play at the United
Center. This is the place Michael Jordan made famous. We play for each other,
so whether the crowd is loud or quiet or there's a lot of people in the stands
or not, we play for each other.  
  
Q. D.J., the All ‑Big Ten team, you weren't on the First Team. Are you on a
mission here to finish your career and show everyone how good you are?   
D.J. NEWBILL: As a unit we're on a mission, the whole team. We're disappointed
how we finished in Big Ten play, so we've got another opportunity to come out
here and prove to ourselves and prove to everybody that we're better than what
we showed.  
  
Q. Same question about the Philly toughness and what those kids bring. 45
points came from your Philly guards. Talk about their style and what they
have.  
COACH CHAMBERS: You know what, Shep and D.J., they have a lot of guts and a
lot of grit, and I think that's what you need in tournament play. Really
important that you don't get deflated when other teams go on runs. You've got
to stay even, and you've got to know that you've just got to win the next
possession. And if we just take it a possession at a time, they'll find
success, and I think that's what they did, and I think that's why you're
talking about Philly toughness and Philly guards, and that's what they've
done. If you know the history of Philadelphia and the great guards that have
come through there, you put those guys right on that list of courage and not
fearing failure and putting themselves on the line. And guess what, if they
look bad, they look bad, but you know they're going to get back up and play
the next possession.  
  
Q. You guys set a Big Ten tournament record for blocks tonight. Just talk
about the block party and what you guys accomplished.  
COACH CHAMBERS: The block party, huh? That's good. Look, they were driving the
ball, we had high hands, we were trying to wall up and chest, and good things
happened. Again, that wasn't the game plan. The game plan was to keep them out
of the paint, and obviously keep them off the offensive glass. But I'm proud
of my guys for playing as hard as they did as a collective unit and giving us
an opportunity because statistically this is amazing. This is just amazing.  
But we all contributed in some way.  
  
Q. What do you think of this atmosphere at the United Center, and how do you
think it perhaps inspires and motivates your players?  
COACH CHAMBERS: Yeah, I said this to Sandy Barber and Phil Esten earlier: I
just love Chicago, I really do. There's something about Chicago that I
appreciate. I'm not from Chicago, but when I visit here, I just enjoy the
people, enjoy the city. Went for a walk along the lake. I know friends and
family are here shopping. There's so many great things to do. And then the
walk in where the Chicago Bulls play and a great friend of mine is the
assistant coach in Eddie Pinckney, just so much excitement around it.  
We're fortunate to come away with the win, but we really are enjoying this
experience.  
  
Q. I know you and Coach McCaffery go way back. What has impressed you the
most about his team and the way they've played, especially down the stretch
here?  
COACH CHAMBERS: You take Wisconsin out of this league, I think they're the
hottest team in the Big Ten. I think he's done a phenomenal job closing out
teams. They never get rattled. We were in a close game. Aaron White makes a
huge play. But I've seen that all year. Somebody makes a big play for them, so
they find success. Think about last year, they were in a ton of games, but it
went the other way for them, but now they've learned from those experiences,
and now they're winning those games. And he's a terrific coach. He really gets
his players to buy in, plays a ton of guys. He's a great motivator, and I
think that's why you see Iowa having a lot of success under his tenure.  
  
Q. You called the last game against Nebraska a rock fight. This game seemed
pretty physical, as well. How are you guys going to get ready and come back to
play tomorrow early afternoon?  
COACH CHAMBERS: We're going to rest up. We're going to do some cold tubs.
We're going to get some treatment. But if you're an 18‑ to 23‑year‑old kid,
come on, they don't want to practice, they want to play games. I feel
confident that they'll be ready to play and they'll play with great energy
tomorrow.  
  
Q. How much extra motivation do you have? This Iowa team came into Happy
Valley a couple weeks ago and won on your home court. What does that do for
the guys?  
COACH CHAMBERS: Yeah, they totally understand that we let one slip away there
at Penn State. But again, it's typically about us and our mindset and what
we're capable of doing as a team. Iowa is big. They've got really good
shooters, really good scorers. Aaron White, first team, All‑Big Ten, what an
incredible accomplishment for him and what he's done there. He's all over the
record books. But we've got to go out and play Penn State basketball for 40
minutes, give ourselves a chance.  
  
Q. Just what's it like to have D.J. be able to go out and have that kind of
performance on a nightly basis like he did today?  
COACH CHAMBERS: You know what, I'm disappointed he didn't make First Team. I
think I've shared that quite often over the last 48 hours. But he showed you
why he should be. He's very consistent, usually very efficient, and he's a
great leader. What did he have, four blocks today? He's probably had four
blocks in ten games. But that's just the type of player he is. He was
unbelievable in huddles, especially when Nebraska went on their run, calming
everybody down, really stepping up his leadership, and saying we've been here
before, we can get this done.  
You know, his performance today was‑‑ I'm happy for him, but he's got to do it
again tomorrow.

CLASSIC](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=CBS+SPORTS+CLASSIC)

  

## December 19, 2015

  

### [Roy Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14130)

### [Brice Johnson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25959)

### [Joel Berry II](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30534)

  
_Brooklyn, New York_  
  
North Carolina - 89, UCLA - 76  
  
COACH WILLIAMS: Really small locker room. I could care less. It could be the
size of a phone booth right now because the last 26, 27 minutes of the game, I
thought we were pretty doggone good. The first 12 or 13 minutes, I didn't
think we were very good at all.  
  
Youngster Hamilton, I think, makes four threes in the first seven or eight
minutes of the game. We talk about trying to do a better job of covering the
three. We got to do a better job of it during the game as well.  
  
Brice and Joel, Marcus, Isaiah, Justin, all the guys that got in there and did
a nice job. We went small a little while because of our foul trouble and
played Theo at the four, and I think that helped us a little bit as well.  
  
Foul problems for both teams weren't very good, and I think we both would like
to stay out of foul trouble more than we did today.  
  
Second half, again, I thought defense -- the second half and the last six or
seven minutes of the first half, I thought we were really good.  
  
Q. Brice, you sat for about eight minutes there in the first half. We
didn't see you score until about the seven minute mark, and then you got a
career high. What happened there that led to you sitting on the bench for a
while, and then what was your mindset coming back in?  
BRICE JOHNSON: Well, I can't really say --  
  
COACH WILLIAMS: Coach got mad at him and took him out, and I had my reasons,
period, the end. It's not a story.  
  
BRICE JOHNSON: I kind of used some bad language, and coach was really pissed
off at me for it. So he sat me for it. It put a fire under my butt. When I got
back in there, I was ready to go. I've got to learn from that.  
  
Even my dad tells me the same thing, I need to change my language sometimes.
Sometimes it gets the best of me. I've just got to make better decisions when
I come off the court, not yelling profanity and saying things like that.
Probably if I'd have been in the game a little bit longer, I could have gotten
a couple more --  
  
COACH WILLIAMS: I'll take him 11 for 12 and letting him sit over there a
little while.  
  
Q. Brice, you've had your career high the last two games. How much
better in these games can you play going forward, and how good can this team
be if you continue to play like that?  
BRICE JOHNSON: I can definitely do a lot better. I'm still messing up on the
defensive end here and there. Those are the shots I shoot in practice every
day. If you let me get it down there, that's what I do. You want to be able to
make that shot. I practice it every day. I've been practicing for the last
four years of my life.  
  
If you give me that opportunity to get in the paint and get my right hand jump
hook, then I'm going to score it.  
  
Q. [ No microphone ]?  
BRICE JOHNSON: The team, the sky's the limit for us. We haven't been playing
great, but we did get a big time win for us today outside of our building.
Like Coach always says, he wants us to be able to get wins outside of the
Smith Center.  
  
Just got to keep going. We can learn from this, learn from our little mistakes
that we made and just be able to keep going, because we didn't play well in
the first 14 minutes of the game. But the last six minutes of the first half,
we did some really good things. That's what we need to do the entire game and
not wait.  
  
Q. Joel, when Brice came back in, he was playing with a lot more
passion, obviously, than in the first few minutes. How much did that infuse
the rest of you guys?  
JOEL BERRY II: That helped us out a lot. We needed an inside presence, and he
was out in the first half, but he came in and helped us out inside. Like I
said, that's what we need. We want to attack inside out, and we can -- I don't
know what our threes look like, but we didn't hit a lot of threes tonight or
today, but Brice gave us a big presence down low.  
  
Q. Was his energy infectious the rest of the game?  
JOEL BERRY II: I think so.  
  
COACH WILLIAMS: [ Laughter ]. Not the first half. Brice's energy infectious.
That's a good one.  
  
BRICE JOHNSON: I think it does. I think it did, yeah.  
  
COACH WILLIAMS: I've tried my entire four years to give my man more energy.  
  
Q. We're coming to Christmas. The league season is obviously a week or a
little more away. Is this where you guys expect to be at this point? Are you
happy where this team is? Do you feel like you guys could be more along than
you are at this time?  
BRICE JOHNSON: I think we could be a little better, but it's a process. We
just have to get better down on the defensive end. I mean, if we could stop a
team from scoring, that's what we want to do. I think we're where we want to
be, but I think we could still be a lot better going forward.  
  
Q. [ No microphone ] that second half probably what kind of defense
you'd like to play. How do you follow it up and play that way consistently?  
BRICE JOHNSON: We just got to do it as a team, I guess. Everyone has to take
their individual role and be responsible for what they're doing. Whether it's
Brice, whether it's me, whether it's Marcus or Justin, we just have to come
together as a team and sit down defensively.  
  
Q. Brice, when you were on the bench the first half, UCLA was kind of in
control at that point. What was going through your mind as you were sitting
there waiting to go back in and watching?  
BRICE JOHNSON: I was wondering if I was going to get in the game. Because
Coach told me, he said, hey, you can go sit at the end of the bench, but if
you say anything else, you can go to the locker room. I said, well, I'm not
going to say anything. I'm just going to sit here. I was worried if I was
going to get back in there.  
  
He looked past me about four times in the rotation. They did take control of
the game, but I knew, if I got another chance to go in there, I was going to
be able to do what I needed to do. I wasn't going to hold back. I wasn't going
to regret getting my second chance. I did mess up in the beginning of the
game, and I've got to stop doing stuff like that.  
  
Q. Roy, you were talking about Brice and his energy level. How much of
just finding a consistent motor, not just for him but for the entire team is
the solution for this team going forward?  
COACH WILLIAMS: I think I get on Brice and Kennedy more than anything else,
there's no question about that, because of their energy level. I think the
rest of the guys do a pretty good job of getting it up pretty high. Brice and
Kennedy do it at moments. I'm definitely not telling you guys anything that I
haven't told them. But they've got to get it up there.  
  
When Brice shows some effort and gets across the lane and draws outside the
lane and gets a charge or deflects a shot, the rest of the defense gets so
much better because he has the ability to block some shots. Kennedy has the
ability to do some things as well.  
  
So those two are the main ones, and yet I do think that Brice's energy level
was so much better in the second half. I almost hugged him and kissed him one
time, but then I realized who it was. You've got to do that on a more
consistent basis, and if we can get that out of them, I feel pretty doggone
good about Joel and Nate and Justin and Marcus with that intensity level,
getting it up there. Those two guys are so important to us. They need to get
it up there as well.  
  
I didn't think very long about that, though.  
  
Q. For Joel, did you feel like just the defensive pressure forcing the
turnovers is what really turned it around by getting into your fast break that
way and using your speed against them?  
JOEL BERRY II: Yes, sir. I think that was one of our strong points today. I
just tried to stop my man from scoring. He's a big key to the team, and I just
tried to keep the ball out of his hands.  
  
In the first half, we were able to force a lot of turnovers from our traps and
everything, and we work on that in practice, and I think Coach wants us to get
to a point where we can run it a little bit more. Today in the first half, we
did a great job of that.  
  
Q. Joel and Coach, what did you guys see in the second half in terms of
offense, in particular, when things went really well for you all? Is there
anything in particular that stands out?  
COACH WILLIAMS: Shooting 61 percent. We got good shots. I can clap and sit
down a lot quicker, but I think we attacked them. Don't know how many points
we had on the break in the first half, but we had some in the second half as
well. Most of the points off turnovers were in the first half. They had 11 in
the first half and only six in the second half.  
  
Fast break points, we had 14. First half and second half, it was more
secondary break kind of level. It wasn't pitch ahead and go down and dunk it.
I thought Joel did a nice job of forcing the tempo. Nate did a nice job of
forcing it sometimes turning a secondary break into a primary break by getting
all the way to the basket.  
  
Anything to add?  
  
JOEL BERRY II: Not at this time.  
  
Q. How important was it to start the second half so strongly after
pulling even after a big deficit by halftime?  
BRICE JOHNSON: We just wanted to keep it going after the last six minutes from
the first half. I mean, we just wanted to kind of get out on them and just try
to take them away from the jump and not give them any confidence to try to
stay with us. So it was big for us, and I think it helped us out a lot.  
  
JOEL BERRY II: I definitely agree with that. I don't have anything else to
say. You said it all.  
  
Q: (Coach Williams on today's game)  
  
ROY WILLIAMS: Well it’s important; we’ve had some marquee games this year.
Maryland at home, Texas at Texas, we didn’t play very well last weekend. The
difference between winning and losing is so small. We needed to bounce back
and play well today. It was good to have practice time this week because last
week we had almost no practice time, five guys sick, so this was a good week
for us to get practice time in. I did tell them it’s time to play well outside
our building too, not just at home where the crowd is really helping us.  
  
Q: Do you know what it was that made Brice Johnson so mad?  
  
ROY WILLIAMS: Nope, Didn’t care.  
  
Q: What did you learn about your team?  
  
ROY WILLIAMS: I like that we got some turnovers out of our scramble stuff,
because we haven’t done that very much this year. We had some time to work on
it this week. I liked the way we kept staying aggressive offensively. Rex
Walters, who’s the head coach at San Francisco, the best player I’ve ever had
about secondary breaks and primary by attacking the basket. I thought we saw
that Joel and Nate both did a better job of that in the second half. And then
again in the second half we didn’t do as many scrambles, because early in the
second half, three out of four of their baskets were on offensive rebounds and
so we tried straight man-to-man, I thought we did a better job of that too. I
think we did get some positive things out of that and all those things that
are going to take us forward, but we need practice time. The last couple of
weeks we haven’t had any.  
  
Q: (No microphone)  
  
ROY WILLIAMS: It’s not a love-hate relationship, it’s coaching. I think that
you need to push some guys harder than others. I treat my players like their
own children. I don’t ever hate any of my players. I may not like what they
did at that moment, but there still my players. It’s like Scott and Kimberly
are still my kids. You do have to set an example sometimes; it’s not a big
thing taking him out. I just didn’t appreciate that and we’re not going to be
like that. With Brice it’s a 24-hour job, trying to push him every day to get
his intensity level up to where it needs to be, and that’s okay, I have no
problem with that. Kenny a little bit of the same kind of thing. I haven’t had
that kind of relationship with many guys, not that I can remember, but that’s
okay too. I need something unusual to keep me even more fired up. It’s my 43rd
year coaching. You need to have some Brice Johnsons.  
  
Q: (Question regarding Luke Maye).  
  
ROY WILLIAMS: Well, three offensive rebounds were big. I think we needed that
because we don’t have Kenny and Isaiah in foul trouble, I’m mad at Brice and
the ranks are getting a little thin up there. So that part and the other thing
is when (Tony) Parker went out they didn’t have a true post player, because
Welsh likes the mid-range game so it wasn’t the type of game for Joel (James).
Joel was huge for us this week in the middle of the week and played great for
18 or 19 minutes against Tulane. Today I wanted to give Luke a chance. Luke is
a good shooter, he hasn’t really shown that yet in games, but he’s really a
good shooter and he did help us win today, no question.  
  
Q: (On why he used Theo Pinson when playing small)  
  
ROY WILLIAMS: Theo has quicker feet and a little more ability to get around in
front of the post if there’s someone posting up, and it really doesn’t make a
heck of a whole lot of difference. Justin (Jackson) I still believe is a
really good outside shooter, his numbers just don’t show it. I thought Theo
would be able to take the ball and drive it to the basket a little bit better
maybe with the matchup he might get.

_Brooklyn, New York_  
  
Ohio State - 74, Kentucky - 67  
  
Q. So to either one of you guys, your coach said he knew you were going
to win today. Did you have the same belief, and if so, why?  
MARC LOVING: I mean, being an underdog, we had nothing to lose. We had a chip
on our shoulder from the beginning. We felt very, very prepared for the game.
We executed our system.  
  
KEITA BATES-DIOP: Same thing. We needed this win. People underestimated us,
and we came out and showed them.  
  
Q. Marc, you mentioned the chip on your shoulder. What put it there?
What was that about?  
MARC LOVING: Just playing a team the caliber of Kentucky, everybody thinks
you're going to lose the game except for the guys in the locker room. Just
having that bond together and that tight knit group made us be able to pull
this victory out.  
  
Q. Marc, do you have any explanation for what happened to Trevor
Thompson today?  
MARC LOVING: Trevor played a phenomenal game. He was blocking shots and
protecting the basket. That's really what we need from him. I mean, I can see
Trevor playing like this from here on out.  
  
Q. For both of you guys, you had a 16-point lead, and they cut it down
to three. You were able to withstand. There were times in the season you
haven't been able to answer when teams put a run on you, but you did today.
What was the difference today?  
KEITA BATES-DIOP: I think we were tired of giving up leads. They were a young
team, (indiscernible)  
  
MARC LOVING: Just poise under pressure. JaQuan and A.J. really ran the show.
We have to follow those guys. They handle the pressure the majority of the
time other than us. I mean, hats off to A.J. and JaQuan. They really withstood
the pressure throughout the whole game.  
  
Q. Marc, how hot was Jamal Murray, 23 for Kentucky. How hard was it to
try to contain him?  
MARC LOVING: He's 7 for 9 from three. He got hot very fast. Just had to know
where he's at the whole time. Try to corral him and make him take as difficult
a shot as possible.  
  
Q. For both of you guys, eight players scored, four were in double
figures. Is this what you envision the offense being? Not necessarily carrying
the load, but different guys setting up different times, and in the end
everyone chips in a little bit.  
KEITA BATES-DIOP: For sure. We're all talented. We're all good players. It
doesn't have to be one guy trying to take all the shots to take over a game.
We all trust each other to make plays.  
  
Q. Coach Matta, this is my question -- I have actually two questions for
you. How big of a win is this for you guys against a team like Kentucky? Do
you feel like your defense was effective today?  
COACH MATTA: I think that, obviously, it's a big, big win for us. I think the
defense was -- you know, we had two days to prepare for this. It was a little
bit of a different game plan. These guys did a tremendous job of understanding
in a short period of time of what we were going to attempt to do.  
  
The fact that Murray got rolling today, that was one of the best performances
I've seen in a short period of time. Keita a couple of times was right there.
He just shot over him.  
  
The defense was definitely the key for us. We did not let our offense affect
our defense. We had some tough stretches, and that was big.  
  
Q. For both of you guys, a week ago, it was a really tough result at
Connecticut, and a week later you come up with a win like this. I just wonder
if you could describe what the feeling is coming off the court, hearing the
fans cheering, getting in the locker room to celebrate. How different is it
from a week ago?  
MARC LOVING: I feel like it's an awesome feeling to know we played as hard as
we possibly could, and we came out with the result we wanted.  
  
KEITA BATES-DIOP: Same here. Complete opposite feeling than last week. We're
going to celebrate it for a little bit and then move on to the next one.  
  
Q. Thad, you talked all year about playing hard enough to make your own
breaks. Was that it?  
COACH MATTA: There's no question some things happen, but we got on the floor
for loose balls. We deflected passes, and guys laid out and got them. We had
some guys get rebounds out of their area. We had some things go -- JaQuan's
shot at the end of the half was a huge shot.  
  
Hopefully, we made our own breaks. I'm excited they were able to stay with
what we were trying to do in the timeouts, and guys did a great job executing.  
  
Q. Thad, Kentucky kind of went to that full court pressure there in the
second half, and I think late in the game you made the switch to A.J. At that
point, how do you think he responded to that, and what went into that
decision?  
COACH MATTA: A.J. -- JaQuan was exhausted. He was under duress for however
long he was in the game today. A.J. was a fresh body. He's got some quickness.
He's got some speed. I thought his composure, his understanding of what we
were trying to do. So we just sort of stuck with him because we knew he could
get the ball in the press.  
  
I thought JaQuan Lyle was really, really good today, but there was a time when
he looked at me like I really can't breathe right now. So A.J. did a terrific
job for us.  
  
Q. Thad, Murray's second half, how much of that was sort of something
that you could prepare for in the planning and exit zone. How much of it was
like an improv performance?  
COACH MATTA: We knew this, that he is a tremendous basketball player. He's the
one guy that we feared going in, in terms of him having the capability of
getting hot now, we had no idea he was going to get that hot.  
  
But that's what great players do. He kind of put them on his back and got him
back in the game. Like I said, Keita was there on a lot of those.  
  
We made a couple of mistakes, but he made us pay for them. But that was a
tremendous -- it reminded me of a few years ago the kid from Illinois had 40
on the exact same type of shots. It was unbelievable.  
  
Q. Thad, sorry, just to follow on that, I guess what's going through
your head when he's on fire like that, and what was the difference in his
mentality between the rest of the Kentucky guys who seem -- you inspired them
a little bit.  
COACH MATTA: I'll tell you. I think Cal did a tremendous job of creating
different ways for him to score because it wasn't the same way every time. He
knew he had a hot hand, and he got them open.  
  
I turned to the bench at one point, and I said, is there anybody that can
guard him right now? He did just a great job. Fortunately, we challenged, I
think, one, and he missed it. That was a great performance by him.  
  
Q. Thad, Trevor's been playing pretty good the last few games and really
came on tonight, 10 points, 5 rebounds, 5 blocks. What did it mean for you in
this game, and what does it mean for your team going forward to have that
strong of a presence on the inside?  
COACH MATTA: I think that something's very important for us. Trevor has been
playing well. To watch Trevor's growth in the year and a half that he's been
with us, I'm very excited for him to play the way he's playing now. We've got
to make sure that he has the maturity to keep working, to keep doing the
things that he needs to do. That was a good performance.  
  
He and Daniel were, I thought, dynamic together in terms of what both guys
brought to the table.  
  
Q. Thad, the play with Giddens getting the loose ball the intentional
foul on Ulis, when that happened prior to, did you feel like the boat might be
swinging a little bit? Were you just waiting on some sort of play to swing
back your way? How critical was that play? A deciding play to the game
perhaps, in your mind?  
COACH MATTA: I think that was definitely -- I can't remember the score. 63-60?
Yeah. But that was huge. I love to see our guys play with that that they did
today, just in terms of that energy. Daniel was laid out like Superman flying
through the air to get that ball.  
  
We always tell our guys, good things happen when you play extremely hard, and
that was definitely one of those things.

## December 19, 2015

  

### [John Calipari](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13700)

### [Marcus Lee](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26973)

  
_Brooklyn, New York_  
  
Ohio State - 74, Kentucky - 67  
  
Q. Marcus, there was a lot of pressure on Skal coming into this year,
people talking about him being a potential Number 1 pick. It hasn't turned out
as far as he would hope. Do you feel like he's pressing at all right now?  
MARCUS LEE: You forget he's a freshman. He's going to do freshman things, like
all basketball players. Here at Kentucky, he has to speed things up and figure
things out quicker. Once he starts figuring out the flow of Kentucky
basketball and what he has to do for us to win, he'll be fine.  
  
Q. Marcus, the game had a lot of wild swings where one team had a lot of
momentum than the other. What do you attribute that to?  
MARCUS LEE: The game of basketball. Do you want to be one sided? That would be
kind of boring. That's just how basketball is played. The person down doesn't
stay down the whole game. It's just big basketball players battling.  
  
Q. Marcus, if you take something positive out of this, what Jamal was
able to do to sort of ignite you guys in the second half, is that what you
guys need him to be? And maybe is this a coming out party for him, do you
think?  
MARCUS LEE: That's exactly what we need him to do. We need that fire at all
points of the game. We can't light it under him and then he goes, just so we
can start going. We need him to start picking it up earlier and getting into
it earlier.  
  
Q. Marcus, 30 percent shooting in the second half, is that what
ultimately led to your loss tonight?  
MARCUS LEE: They came into the game fired up and made a whole lot of threes
and made a whole lot of buckets, and we just couldn't get into the flow.  
  
Q. Marcus, it seemed like you guys were fighting and scrapping and
diving for loose balls and rebounds. Yet there wasn't much of a reward. At the
other end offensively shots weren't falling. Did it feel that way to you? How
frustrating does that get to be?  
MARCUS LEE: The game as a whole was just frustrating. Seeing our team dive to
the ball and trying to win the game and not worrying about anything else is a
good thing coming out of the game, a good thing that we've learned to battle
and that's something we've always worked on. So that's always a plus.  
  
Q. Marcus, with Murray in the second half, I think he made seven threes.
How much of this was called plays, exact called plays, and how much of it was
someone just feeling it?  
MARCUS LEE: Once somebody feels it, we understand it immediately. If we don't
see it, Ty will see it or Coach Cal will see it. We go back to it over and
over again. It's like if Skal's having a great game, we go straight to him.  
  
Q. With Louisville coming to Rupp next weekend, how do you regroup for
that big game coming up?  
MARCUS LEE: Louisville is always a big game for us. It's in-state rivalry. We
have a really long way to go from our goal, and Louisville is just another
game, another step for us to get to.  
  
Q. Marcus, if you could take stock of the team right now, what are some
of the things you like about what you're seeing and what are some of the
things you guys need to do to grow in the next two, three, four weeks to be
where you want to be by March?  
MARCUS LEE: Right now we're learning fast. We need to learn a whole lot
faster. This is Kentucky. Yeah, he's a freshman. Yeah, we're pretty new at
this. Alex is coming off an injury. I haven't played very much. We need to
learn a whole lot faster and pick it up to get to where we need to be in
March.  
  
Q. Marcus, how do you think the freshmen are going to handle kind of
setbacks? In the past, freshmen have gotten off to such great starts. Do you
think these early losses can help them?  
MARCUS LEE: I mean, freshmen go through it differently. Not all freshmen are
the same. Once they get pushed through diversity, they have to start figuring
it out. Right now we're still trying to figure that out.  
  
Q. Marcus, just defensively, specifically, both your performance and the
team's. Besides execution generally, what's one thing you want to be better at
next weekend?  
MARCUS LEE: We really picked up defensively-wise in the second half, and we
picked up the aggression, and we were able to be the aggressor. That's
something we'll really try to do here, especially with our guards and us being
able to switch a lot of the pick-and-roll. We just need to play to our
strengths.  
  
Q. John, do you have any concerns with this team or challenges with this
team that you haven't had with previous teams while specifically at
Kentucky?  
COACH CALIPARI: Well, we still have to learn how to win. We had the plays.
First of all, we didn't start the game. They were the aggressor, and they came
after us.  
  
So you're down -- the way we ended the half wasn't winning basketball. We took
a bad shot. They make a three. Fifteen seconds to go, you take one shot, and
the kid came down and went nuts. Threw it, five seconds and another three. Now
you're down 12 instead of 6. That's not winning basketball.  
  
Again, these guys have just played basketball in the past. Now we've got to
teach them how to win and what it means defensively, what it means rebounding
the ball. I mean, late there were three, four rebounds. You bring that in,
we're right there. We have our chance. You don't bring it in, they lay it in,
and it's an and-one or whatever, and you don't have a chance to win.  
  
We fought in the second half and did some good things. We're a ways away. I've
been saying it. I thought Skal was better today, but when the game got a
little rough in the end, I just didn't want him to -- I just went with Alex
and Marcus Lee.  
  
But you know it's going good. You foul a kid on purpose because he's shooting
28 percent and makes two, swishes both. That's when you look down and say,
this is about done, boys.  
  
But give them credit. They played. They made a bunch of threes to start the
game. Five of them were tough. NBA, guy's hanging on him, and a guy makes it.
That happens against us. Guys have bigger muscles and they start making plays
they don't make all year. You've got to give it to them. They outrebounded us,
out toughed us, beat us 50-50.  
  
We probably should have done some things in the first half playing that pick-
and-roll. We did a better job in the second half. That's not on the team.
That's on me. It's just disappointing. I want them to be farther along than
they are, but we're where we are right now.  
  
Q. Sort of a two-parter on Jamal. One, your impressions of watching him,
what he did scoring 27 points in the second half?  
COACH CALIPARI: Again, let me start. The way he started the game, I had to
take him out twice because you're not being aggressive. You're just coming
down and dribbling and throwing it. We're throwing it ahead for you to score,
and you're throwing it to a point guard underneath the basket with a 7-footer
on him. Excuse me.  
  
Now in the second half, he got going, where we're down. We need to play
winning basketball where we're up, taking good shots, taking care of the ball,
you pick up fumbles. You pick up fumbles. You don't try to advance it. You
don't try to go on the floor like I'm going to throw a lefty hook pass. Bring
him in. He's got a lot to learn, but he's really talented. He can do some
stuff with that ball. We've just got to get him playing right.  
  
I thought Isaiah took three or four shots he had no chance of making. They got
blocked. I mean, he had no chance. Why did you do that? Why did you -- again,
not playing winning basketball.  
  
Now, without Isaiah, it's not close. He made every tough rebound. He came up
with tough plays. But there's the guts of the game. We just don't do it for 40
minutes. This is like probably the statement of statements. We play like
freshmen.  
  
Q. You just sort of answered the second part of my question. First to
the other part, you talked about wanting to know who you have that can make
those plays at the end of the game. Is it good to know that can come out of
Jamal Murray when you're in a situation like that?  
COACH CALIPARI: Yes, absolutely. Another team, they're playing well because of
them, not us. Like we start right, we're doing it right, we're playing, and
they're executing a little bit better. They're making more free throws. You
get down, you've got to make those kinds of plays. I like the fact that we
didn't give up. Again, when we had it, we missed front end of a 1 and 1,
almost shot an air ball. Then we don't come up with two rebounds. You've got
to bring those in. That's winning plays.  
  
Then there was a loose ball that we were trying to advance instead of just
grab the ball, we're good. It's our ball. We're fine. A tie up was ours. But
then again, I'm coaching young kids, and I'm being tough on them and
challenging them and happy Skal did better. Still a ways away. I'll tell you,
he does the jump hook, everybody's happy. The next time, he shoots a fadeaway.
Shoot the jump hook again. Shoot the jump hook. Learning, that's all part of
the process.  
  
Q. John, you said you felt Skal was better. Do you feel like this helps
his confidence today?  
COACH CALIPARI: Yeah, just, like again, there were two plays, two rebounds,
and a missed lefty late, and we're trying to win the game. We don't have time.
We'll work on that later. But I thought he made strides today. He's been
pretty good in practice, and he's making strides now.  
  
Q. John, when you talked about your team not being where they are, I
guess the question is what's missing? Is it effort? Basketball intelligence?
Something different?  
COACH CALIPARI: Freshmen.  
  
Q. What do they need to do?  
COACH CALIPARI: They're freshmen. They're going through this for the first
time. They're learning what it takes to win. They're learning what it means to
be tough. Tough doesn't mean you fight, you push, you swing. Tough means you
play people before the play happens. Tough means, when you go in there and I
have nothing, I'm not trying to make a fabulous play. I'm tough enough to know
it's done. I'm throwing it back out. We're going to go again, which we did
late. We did not early.  
  
All that stuff is -- it's going to be through experience. I wish we were
farther along than we are, but I've been saying it. I mean, when you don't
come up with those 50-50 balls, especially when you're a veteran and you
don't, now you're counting on freshmen to do it. That becomes even more of a
challenge.  
  
Q. (Question on veterans needing to help teach those traits)?  
COACH CALIPARI: The older guys, Tyler is trying to do what he can do. Alex is
coming off the injury.  
  
I thought Marcus Lee, I thought, had a fabulous -- we would have been down 20
at the half if it wasn't for Marcus Lee. This is a combination of everything
and us still trying to figure out how we need to play. We're still trying to
look at us offensively and say how did we play? Second half, we shoot 60
percent, you say what did you do different? First half we shoot 30 percent,
can't make a three, not close.  
  
Did we do stuff that much different? Not really. I think a lot of it was we
made stops. Then again, the end of the half, we stopped him for four straight
minutes, couldn't make a basket.  
  
Q. Coach, Duke also lost today. Does this year look more wide open to
you than some previous years in college basketball where there's no dominant
team and a bunch of teams could win it?  
COACH CALIPARI: To be honest, I'm not following anything else or anybody
else's score. I'm just trying to get my team right.  
  
I would say that I know this: We're not as good as we were a year ago. It's
pretty obvious. I still think we have a good enough team to do some good
things. Just you must play to win. You must play to win. That means
defensively you don't take chances. You come up with balls. You win 50-50
balls. You're ahead of the action.  
  
On offense, you're making easy plays. You're creating different shots. You're
offensive rebounding. If it's not there -- if it's a big time play, I'm either
getting fouled, or I'm making this play. I'm not throwing a ball up that I
have a 20 percent chance of making. That means you're going to lose.  
  
When you come down and you throw a lefty leaner and just throw it, that's
losing basketball. You get to that rim and get fouled or pass it to somebody
else. That's all stuff we're still learning.  
  
Q. John, it seemed like your kids were throwing themselves on the floor,
loose balls, going after rebounds, and yet there wasn't much of a reward at
the other end offensively. How frustrating did that become?  
COACH CALIPARI: In the second half, I thought we -- we shot 60 percent in the
second half, or 50. Is that us? Yeah, 52 percent in the second half. We did
some good stuff.  
  
When it became winning time -- say it again. You miss front end of the 1 and 1
and almost nick it for an air ball. You come down and have two rebounds you
can get. You don't get it. You have a loose ball at half-court, all you have
to do is pick it up, we're fine. We don't pick it up. We're trying to scramble
to throw it to somebody. You didn't need to. Just pick the ball up. Just lay
on your back and hold the ball. They tie us up, we can call a timeout, there's
a lot of stuff. That kind of stuff adds up. Now all of a sudden -- especially
when it's a one-bucket game.  
  
A couple other plays that are slipping my mind that I talked to them about
after. I just went down to seven, eight plays that were made -- you know, just
can't make. We're good enough. We'll learn.  
  
It's just now the schedule doesn't get any easier from this point, next game,
next game, next game, you're in the league, you're in the league, you're on
the road, and people smell blood, they'll come after us. That's just how it
is.  
  
Q. How much of this process has been psychological versus the mechanics
of what they're doing? And the maturity process for them, how are you trying
to get through to them teaching-wise, almost like a parent? I hear some of the
things you're saying, and it's almost like you're trying to get through the
things that are as much psychological as they are mechanical.  
COACH CALIPARI: They have to experience it. What's happened is we've talked
about all this stuff, but they'll fight you a little bit because -- and I say
this to kids all the time. What got you here is not going to get you to there.
So things you were able to get away with that you think were impressive, but
those things have to change if you're going to get to here as a player and
just keep going.  
  
Yes, some of it is mental. They must believe in themselves individually and
believe in the team, and I think they do, but I think they get rattled at
times, and that's just natural. I've coached a lot of freshmen, and it's a
process.  
  
It would have been nice for them to come out of the gate and play better to
start the game and not look passive, not look -- you know, we were on our
heels. We really were. And then they make some shots. Like I told them at
halftime, I'm not worried about them making shots. I'm worried about how we
ended the half.  
  
So in the second half, they didn't make all those threes. That's just kind of
how it goes. And we got back in it. But that ending of that half and those
three or four plays, missed rebounds and loose ball, you don't get it, and it
becomes intentional foul. Those are huge plays.  
  
We're talking like six plays in the game. We're not a team that's going to
beat people by 25. This isn't a year ago.  
  
Merry Christmas, everybody.

# [CBS SPORTS
CLASSIC](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=CBS+SPORTS+CLASSIC)

  

## December 19, 2015

  

### [Steve Alford](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17050)

### [Isaac Hamilton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28550)

### [Tony Parker](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13882)

  
_Brooklyn, New York_  
  
North Carolina - 89, UCLA - 76  
  
COACH ALFORD: I'm really proud of our guys. We have had a really good stretch.
We've shown growth and improvement. I thought we did that again in the first
half of this game. We did a nice job in a lot of areas. We just had two
glaring weakness today. That was turnovers, which we've done a really good job
in the past two weeks of limiting turnovers. We had too many turnovers and we
just couldn't get stops in transition. This is a really good basketball team.
It's got a lot of experience, a lot of seniors, depth, big. They're just
really good and really talented. I appreciate how our guys fought. We've shown
growth in the past two and a half weeks. What this game proves is that there's
still a lot of growth to go. Hopefully, that's the message our guys can get
out of it. We have one more non-league game. We take a little break. Then, we
come back and have about eight days before we start a very difficult league.
We've got the better part of two weeks to continue that growth. Hopefully, our
guys see that.  
  
Q. For Tony, what do you think the impact was of you getting the four
fouls and not playing very much for quite a stretch there in the second half?
Because it seemed like that was where they really attacked the basket.  
TONY PARKER: It was huge. It was big. I let my teammates down. That was just
-- foul trouble cannot be a problem in this game, and it was. It really hurt
us in the second half.  
  
Q. How tough was it to stop when Brice Johnson was pulling, especially
in the final 4:27, he had 11 shots? How was that?  
TONY PARKER: He runs well. When you're in foul trouble, you tend to be less
aggressive. Me and Tom just got to stay aggressive and keep our bodies moving.
I think that's where he got us. We stopped moving on a lot of plays and cross
screens. We've got to stay active and keep moving because he's a very active
player.  
  
Q. Isaac, last year against North Carolina was probably worse than last
season. This game you come out and make four in a row to start the game. What
was it that gave you confidence early on? Same thing against Gonzaga, how did
you get the rhythm on the rim?  
ISAAC HAMILTON: I felt like I was open. Just took good shots. Once one went
down, I feel better, and I feel like the next one will go down as well. So
just keep shooting, keep playing, being aggressive, and basically that's where
I get my confidence, builds from that.  
  
Q. For the players, on the first day you built up the lead, feels like
you had a few opportunities to stretch that even more. Do you feel that's
where you lost the opportunity to really open this game up?  
TONY PARKER: No, we came out, and it was even. We knew North Carolina was a
great team. We knew they were going to make runs. We weathered it. The game
was tied. We didn't do what we needed to do in the second half. That was the
big thing.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for coach.  
  
Q. Coach, could you just evaluate what you saw from Brice Johnson. What
kind of threat he was?  
COACH ALFORD: He's a pretty good threat. 11 for 12 and 9 rebounds. He's
definitely taken up the slack since Meeks has been out. This is a scary team.
You look at this team and add Meeks to it, it's as good a team as we've
played.  
  
I think Johnson is playing at a really high level now. We thought a key was
going to be which bigs got in foul trouble, and our bigs got in foul trouble.
That's going to affect us. I thought it eventually caught up to us because the
difference was points off turnovers and points in the paint. Obviously,
Johnson has a lot to do with that.  
  
Q. You mentioned turnovers, but you had improved. Since December it's
been pretty low. How much of that was what North Carolina does defensively and
how much was sloppiness as well?  
COACH ALFORD: Well, one of the things that happened, we got in foul trouble.
Then the pressure came. We had a good rhythm going, and they went to our
traps, which we knew just through film that's something they were going to go
to. I didn't think we handled the traps very well. A lot of it was bigs not
being able to pass out of the traps. We were hoping it was going to be guards
that got trapped, but it ended up being bigs that got trapped.  
  
Early on, our turnovers, if I'm not mistaken, 8 of our 11 turnovers at the
half were on the bigs. We've got to look at that on tape and we've got to
really work on. It's something we've been working on, catching pivots. It's
something our bigs have got to continue to work on and improve on. That's
where their ceiling's got to be. We've got good passing big men. They can pass
the basketball. I just thought we got a little bit sloppy. But a lot had to do
with the defensive pressure. They did a really good job.  
  
But, again, like Tony said, they weren't playing in foul trouble, so they
could be aggressive. It was hard for us to be aggressive in the paint or
anywhere around the rim because of the foul trouble that we had.  
  
Q. Coach, you mentioned with Pac-12 play coming up, you've just got the
game against McNeese, and then your conference schedule starts. How do you
evaluate where you are and what you see across the league?  
COACH ALFORD: We're going to have to have that growth because our league is
phenomenal. It's the Number 1 RPI in the country right now. Utah just beat
Duke. We've had really big wins throughout our league. It's been one big win
after another. It's great. It makes for a great run here once league play
starts.  
  
So proud of our league. Proud of the teams we've had in our league that have
really shown themselves in the nonconference. I told our team that. If we can
get McNeese, we'll get nine wins through what's easily the most difficult
schedule we've had in three years. Last year, we're going to be sitting at
Christmas playing all these teams but have no wins over the top 50. This year
we'll have wins over the top 50. So we've improved in that area and that's a
positive. That's a plus.  
  
Now the trick is can we just with one game over the next 10, 12 days before we
start league play, we've got to have growth in those 12 days. Obviously we're
going to have Christmas break where guys can get home for a little bit, but
there's going to be eight, nine practices we're going to have, and we have to
show growth during that time to get ready for Pac-12 play because we start on
the road. So it's not easy playing in this kind of league this year and you're
starting on the road. So we've got to be primed and ready once we take that
trip to Washington.  
  
Q. Coming out of Maui, you had six games against -- three of them were
against top 20 teams. Sitting there coming out of Maui, did you have a goal in
mind, maybe not a win total, but for what you wanted to see in those next six
games?  
COACH ALFORD: Well, I'm really proud because coming out of Maui, I was excited
about what happened against UNLV. I knew it was going to be a tough
turnaround, less than 24 hours with a team like Kansas. Kansas won by 50. We
had a knockout, drag-out with UNLV. That was going to be a tough game
regardless. Just a little disappointed leaving Maui of how we responded to
Wake. I just thought we would respond better to Wake.  
  
So I left disappointed because I just think we weren't very good defensively
at all. So I wasn't really thinking about the next whatever stretch that was,
six games, I guess, of what our record might be. I was just hoping we could
get better defensively because I felt we were so bad at that point. We've
shown growth.  
  
We took a step back tonight, defensively maybe a little bit and offensively,
because of our turnovers, but we also know this is the best team, top to
bottom, we've played. I think they're right there with the Kansas group.  
  
All that said, to get a win at Gonzaga, to beat the home teams that we beat,
where not just Kentucky, but Long Beach and Louisiana-Lafayette, to get those
wins at home, we played some pretty good basketball. So I didn't have a win
total in mind, but I'm proud of our guys of how they left Maui and how they've
improved the last 2 1/2 weeks.  
  
As I told them in the locker room, make me proud again and make sure we get
better in two weeks where we're only playing one game. Now we've got a two-
week stretch here where we only play one game, so that's going to be a pivotal
time for us to get prepared and ready before we start league play.

INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=MAUI+JIM+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 25, 2015

  

### [Kevin Stallings](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13784)

### [Luke Kornet](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26641)

### [Wade Baldwin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28558)

  
_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
KANSAS - 70 VANDERBILT - 64  
  
THE MODERATOR: We welcome Vanderbilt. Coach Stallings, Luke Connette and Wade
Baldwin. Coach, an opening statement, please.  
  
COACH STALLINGS: Well, I thought that we played a lot better in the first half
than we did in the second. I'm guessing that Bill felt like they probably
played a lot better in the second half than they did in the first. But, you
know, shots that we are pretty accustomed to making, we didn't make today.  
  
One of the things that stands out about Kansas is their speed and quickness
and their closing speed to get the shot. So I don't know how much they
impacted our shooting. I'll have a better feel of that when I see it on tape
again. But they're a hard team to play. They're a very good team, and we
congratulate them certainly.  
  
We're disappointed in how we played the second half, particularly defensively.
And, again, they're fast and quick and shoot the ball awfully well. We felt
like we had to take away the three-point line from them today in order to win
the game, and we were not able to do that. I thought we were effective taking
away transition for the most part. But I did not think we did a good job of
taking away the three-point line, and that kind of ended up being the
difference in the game, I thought.  
  
Q. Luke, what was the difference in each half?  
LUKE KORNET: The first half I felt like it was pretty even. We just came out
and we made a couple shots. Outside of that, both teams played pretty solid
defense.  
  
In the second half, they just came out and -- we got a little lazy and had
some misses defensively. And they just came out made shots and we never really
made the shots to counter it. Really in the second half -- in the beginning
there were definitely some defensive flaws, but after that they did more stuff
to win the game than we did in terms of making shots and the things you have
to do to separate yourselves when there are two good teams playing.  
  
Q. Luke, overall for the tournament, how would you assess your team's
play?  
LUKE KORNET: I thought we did a pretty good job. I thought defensively,
especially, we made a lot of strides. I think that's something that we'll try
to carry on throughout the year. I mean, with the exception of this last game,
I feel like we've played pretty solid offensively as well. But I think the
main thing was playing hard and being committed defensively. What cost us the
tournament in the end were the moments that we didn't. So I think that's
something we'll learn from, and I just think we need to do it for 40 minutes
and that's something we need to do down the road.  
  
Q. Wade, can you talk about how tough Selden was to guard tonight?  
WADE BALDWIN: I didn't do much guarding on him, but from what I saw, he's a
very strong player. He can really shoot the ball. You've got to give him
props. He had 25 points, 7 rebounds. Kid's a hell of a player.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Stallings.  
  
Q. You addressed the shooting and stuff, but what did you think of
Selden? Did he surprise you at all?  
COACH STALLINGS: No, he didn't surprise me. Honestly, he's got the easy job.
He's got Mason and Graham in there just penetrating and breaking down your
defense, and he's standing out there catching and shooting. Don't get me
wrong, he made some really nice plays, made some nice drives too. But there
was nothing about him that surprised me.  
  
What surprised me was how many times we helped off on penetration when we
weren't supposed to. That was the disappointing thing. I didn't think he was
making terribly difficult shots, and that is a credit to their offense and a
testament to the fact that we didn't guard the way we have to guard to beat a
team as good as they are.  
  
Q. Can you talk about what this week means to just the rest of the
season and what you're going to take away from Maui?  
COACH STALLINGS: Well, first of all, it was an absolute pleasure to be here.
You just, there is a reason why it's the premier, early-season college event
in college basketball. We were thrilled to be a part of it.  
  
I think we accounted well for ourselves. Our basketball team played very, very
well. We didn't have a great sixth half, but other than that, we played five
pretty good halves of basketball. I've got a lot to look forward to with my
team. I really enjoyed coaching them this week, and I enjoyed watching them
play and watching them compete. And I was particularly happy when I got in the
locker room and saw how disappointed they were, because this was a game that
we thought we could and would win, and we got beat by a team that was better
than us.  
  
They were better than us tonight, and we give them all the credit, because,
you know, we had control of it in the first half and they did some stuff at
halftime to make adjustments and come back and do what championship programs
do and that's certainly what they are.  
  
Q. I guess since the Kentucky game last year, this was the first time
playing in this type of game, I suppose. Do you think that this experience can
help your team down the road the next time they're in this type of
situation?  
COACH STALLINGS: Well, this is not the first time we've played in a situation
like this since the Kentucky game last year. But I certainly think that this
experience, this entire experience will help us tremendously. I think that all
eight teams that were here will benefit greatly from this and that's why you
come. That's why you're honored to be invited because you come out and get to
compete and test yourselves against some of the best basketball teams in the
country, some of the best basketball programs in the country.  
  
Like I said, I'm going to leave here with a lot more positive thoughts and a
lot more positive feelings than I am negative. I don't feel very good about
that last 20 minutes, but I'm really proud of my basketball team and really
looking forward to seeing what the future holds this season for them.

## November 25, 2015

  

### [Bill Self](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13713)

### [Wayne Selden, Jr.](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26682)

### [Cheick Diallo](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=29918)

  
_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
KANSAS - 70, VANDERBILT - 64  
  
THE MODERATOR: We now welcome Kansas to the media room, your 2015 Maui Jim
Maui Invitational Champion. Coach, an opening statement?  
  
COACH SELF: It was a great win for us against a terrific opponent. Kevin
obviously had his guys ready, and they were far better than us early on in the
game, and Wayne kind of kept us in the game offensively by scoring the ball.
So impressed with their team. We're fortunate they missed some shots, but we
also defended them very well.  
  
But it was a game in which there was no rhythm, and I think those are fun
games to win because late in the season on conference play that's how good
games are. So hopefully it's a good preparation for us moving forward.  
  
Q. Wayne, I know you probably don't want to talk about yourself, but you
resembled the Wayne of South Korea maybe. What do you think of your
performance here today and especially in the first half?  
WAYNE SELDEN, JR.: It's just getting open and teammates finding me, Frank
getting in the paint, Devonte' getting in the paint. I was getting open shots.  
  
Q. Wayne, I think you shot something like 62% in the second half. What
was the key to playing better offensively in the second half?  
WAYNE SELDEN, JR.: Coming out at first, I felt like they had us rattled. They
pressured us and we didn't really move the ball. We spread a lot like we did a
couple of weeks ago against Michigan State.  
  
Second half we were able to penetrate and get the ball moving and a lot of
things opened up for us.  
  
Q. For both guys, Frank and Wayne, can you both answer this, how much
fun is it to share the MVP award and who is going to get that trophy?  
FRANK MASON, III: It's a lot of fun. I definitely think Wayne deserves it, the
way he played throughout the tournament. But we just happened to get the win
as a team, and we're looking forward to it next game.  
  
WAYNE SELDEN, JR.: Yeah, we're excited. We're going to share the trophy. It
will be in my room for a month, and go across the hall to his room for another
month. We'll just keep rotating it.  
  
Q. You mentioned this, but what did you see from Wayne tonight?  
FRANK MASON, III: I saw the Wayne that was in South Korea. He was very
aggressive, major shots. He didn't let us down. He got in the paint, found
teammates. We didn't knock it down for him, but that's what we need for him to
get in the paint. Just get open shots for us and move the ball. He was great
tonight.  
  
Q. Frank, moving away from the game a little bit, can you just talk
about the reaction today of the team? How do you feel about Cheick Diallo
being cleared?  
FRANK MASON, III: Everyone was excited. We were going to each other's room and
asking each other if we heard the news that Cheick got cleared. Everyone was
just excited. We are looking forward to getting back to practice and getting
him in the rotation and helping him learn and looking forward to having him
throughout the season.  
  
Q. Wayne, what was it like going up against the two 7-footers? Have you
guys just adapted to that?  
WAYNE SELDEN, JR.: At first it was a little bit difficult. They were
alternating shots and stuff like that. But once the ball got moving, they had
a big on Frank, and they were just penetrating to get in there.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Self.  
  
Q. What do you think of the first half? Were you still feeling pretty
good at halftime?  
COACH SELF: I wasn't feeling great at all at halftime. We hadn't done anything
to show that we could attack them. We only had 33 points, so it wasn't our
defense. We were fortunate. I think they were 4 of 15 in the first half, and
it felt like in the first half they got some good looks. But we were just
terrible standing offensively. I think we were taken back a little bit by
their length and size.  
  
But the second half, the ball seemed to be moving a little freer. And big guys
finished in tight. Obviously some guys made some timely shots.  
  
Q. We talked a little bit about this last night. But what does it do
when Frank and Devonte' can both get in the paint and create and get guys open
shots like they had the last few days?  
COACH SELF: Tonight, we hope that we're better offensively a month from now
and guys can actually run what we have in. We don't have much in, but we don't
execute what we have in for the most part. So we were kind of becoming a stale
team and rely on players to make plays, which is fine if you've got good
enough players to do that. I think Devonte' and Frank, the best offense is to
beat your man, and certainly they do a great job of forcing help. But we have
a tendency sometimes to drive a score as opposed to drive and pass, and that's
what we did early in the game was play right to their hands.  
  
Q. Coach, talk about the co-MVPs and the role they played this week?  
COACH SELF: Well, Frank's right, Frank gets it. Wayne's the best player in the
tournament. He was great. But we had no chance to win unless Frank plays. He's
got the ball in his hands and he does so many good things. So I think things
like that are cool to share. And Wayne's fine with it.  
  
But if I was picking, if it's a month in Wayne's and a month in Frank's, I
think I'd give it to him six weeks and he can keep it two, because Wayne was
absolutely fabulous in the first half when we had nothing going on. He kept us
in the game by making, I think, three threes that were guarded and basically
kept us within striking distance.  
  
Q. Frank mentioned it was the Wayne of Korea. I mean, what did you see
that reflected?  
COACH SELF: The way Wayne played tonight was the way we saw him play,
basically, eight games in Korea. I mean, he was aggressive. He was powerful.
He shot a great percentage, but he didn't just rely on jump shots. Three games
in three days and played 40 minutes in the humidity like this, he's obviously
a very well-conditioned athlete also.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll bring in Cheick Diallo for some questions.  
  
Q. Cheick, can you just tell us when you got the word, and what were
your teammates' reactions when they heard about it?  
CHEICK DIALLO: Oh, first of all, my first call -- I was in my room and they
was calling me to come to the media room. I just came. I knew something was
going to happen. I was so excited to hear what they wanted to tell me. Just
told me like you got cleared to play. I was so nervous, and I was happy at the
same time. Everybody was texting me and calling me and all saying we've got
great news. But even right now, I'm still -- I'm not a hundred percent. I'm so
happy.  
  
Q. Cheick, what's it been like going through all of this the last
several weeks, a month?  
CHEICK DIALLO: I mean, it's been very tough. Sometimes I cannot even sleep.
I'm only thinking about what I'm going to do. I want to thank all my high
school people and KU people. And I want to say, What's up, Coach. You know
exactly what I mean. Every time I text I say, What's up. You know exactly what
I mean. So I want to everybody, all my fans and people supporting me every
time, 24/7.  
  
Q. Cheick, during the pregame tonight, what was that feeling like? The
last time you have to be out there in street clothes and won't be able to go
through the warm-up with your teammates.  
CHEICK DIALLO: Oh, wow, I can't wait, man. Even from the bench I was cheering
for my team. I was supporting them so hard. I wanted them to win. Even game
was a close game today, I still wanted to push my team. Let's go, let's go.
Give energy every time to my team.  
  
Q. Did you have a chance to talk to Kassoum Yakwe? He was declared
eligible today as well.  
CHEICK DIALLO: Oh, Kassoum? He's my best friend, of course. Texting me like,
Do you have news? I'd be like, I know. I'm trying to joke with him and I say
no. I said, no, I'm not going to play this year. He said, wow, are you
serious? So every time I call him, he's my best friend. He's kind of like my
brother.  
  
Q. As excited as you are to be able to play now, is any part of you mad
or bitter about everything that's happened in the last three or four months?  
CHEICK DIALLO: I mean, I'm kind of mad because I've been suspended for five
games. I don't even know what I did. I don't even know. So that's the kind of
thing. I still play to my game. I don't know why they said I was suspended for
five games. I don't know what I've done. I don't know.  
  
Q. I know you were thanking people before earlier, but how much do you
realize all the people that went to bat for you in this thing and trying to
help you?  
CHEICK DIALLO: I mean, I cannot say so much stuff, you know, because every
time I called my high school coach, they always say same thing. Oh, my gosh,
people are trying to give me strength every time. Don't let it go. Don't quit.
Sometimes.  
  
I'm just here like I want to, I just want to let it go, and I want to quit
because it was getting hard. I don't have anything to do if I didn't play this
year. I really want to play this year so hard. People still, I have a lot of
fans supporting me. Even my high school coach called me every time, every day.
Oh, Cheick, I want you to stay strong, stay strong. I'm like, wow, it's
getting hard, you know.  
  
Since June until now, it's almost like four, five months. I was getting
frustrated. I'm trying to stay strong, but that's happened today. I'm so
excited.  
  
COACH SELF: When you said how many people "went to bat" for you, I don't think
that's Mali talk. So I don't think he knew what you meant.  
  
Q. Are you ready to play a game? Are you game ready?  
CHEICK DIALLO: I can't wait. I can't wait. I'm ready.

## November 25, 2015

### [Ben Carter](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=29914)

_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
UNLV - 72 INDIANA - 69  
  
THE MODERATOR: We now welcome UNLV to the interview room. We'll start with an
opening statement from Coach Rice.  
  
COACH RICE: First, tremendous respect for Coach Crean and for the tradition of
Indiana. First time since 1987 that these two teams have played, so there is a
rich tradition with both programs. So we knew it was going to be a tremendous
challenge. Indiana is one of the best offensive teams in the country, so we
knew what we were up against, especially third game in three days.  
  
Cannot be prouder of my group than I am. The response starting at halftime
yesterday, the leadership of these two upperclassmen, halftime yesterday, when
we were down 6 to Chaminade, and then the way we played for 40 minutes today.
Obviously some execution issues we had to deal with.  
  
But one of the reasons we came to Maui, other than it was exciting for our
fans, in this prestigious tournament. Play against the best. See how we match-
up. See where we're good. See where our deficiencies are, and now we'll have
all next week to practice.  
  
Could not be prouder of the character of our group. These two guys were
instrumental. I just thought from start to finish we were engaged. We were
together. Bench energy was fantastic. Our fan base was phenomenal. And we're
excited to go home and spend Thanksgiving as a team together, practice, and
get ready for a game on Saturday.  
  
But, again, great respect for Coach Crean and the job he does. Game could have
gone either way. We just made enough plays in the game to get it. Win or lose,
I would have been extremely proud of how hard we played and what our response
was.  
  
Q. Ike, can you talk a little bit about how much the defense kind of
triggered everything and got everything going early in the game with a couple
of early steals that led to slams by you?  
IKE NWAMU: Coming in, we knew since Indiana is a great offensive team, we
really had to lock down and play defense. It was really paramount for us to
execute defensively, and those two players are part of that really, everyone
doing their job.  
  
Q. Hey, Ben, on that last play where they get the ball to Zeisloft on
the three attempt, and the tip on the shot, how were you able to get there for
that?  
BEN CARTER: I knew my man set the screen. I knew they were looking for a
three. I saw Pat was trailing his man a little bit, so I knew I had to help.
Luckily I was able to get the tip on the ball and it was a pivotal play.  
  
Q. Ben, when you came back and you were on this type of stage, is this
kind of what you thought you wanted to be in terms of coming back to this
program and helping it win and getting it to a tournament?  
BEN CARTER: Oh, definitely. This is -- when Coach Rice recruits his players,
this is what he tells us. We're going to play against the best because we want
to be the best. We were looking forward to this trip all off-season, and
unfortunately we weren't able to win our first game, but we can still say it
was a successful trip. We won two and beat a ranked opponent.  
  
Q. I wonder if you prefer your dad eating or dancing because he's very
excited. Do you see him during games?  
BEN CARTER: Oh, yeah. Who doesn't? I'll let you know that my dad is one of the
biggest fans not only that I have, but our team has. He cheers for each and
every guy as hard as he can. It was so special to be able to have him and my
brother out here to support me during this trip. Obviously my mother wasn't
able to attend, but for my father to be out here and have so much energy, I
just try to feed off him because I think he had more energy than anybody else
in that building.  
  
Q. Can you talk about how much this win means for this team?  
IKE NWAMU: It's huge. Because we knew what our goals are at the beginning of
the year. To be able to play well against a very good ranked opponent, it just
speaks volumes to our growth from where we first started this thing. So it was
a good first test for us.  
  
Q. Ben, same thing to you. Can you talk about the significance of
beating a top 15 team?  
BEN CARTER: That was our goal coming into this tournament to play against
great competition. It was good for us to beat a ranked opponent. Obviously,
this is just the beginning, because we have a lot more tough teams coming
ahead in our schedule. But it was a great test for our team, and we responded
well.  
  
Q. Ike, I think this is the type of game that a lot of people were
expecting to see from you and when you come to UNLV know that you're capable
of. Was it completely different for you out there or were you getting some of
the same shots and things just working better for you?  
IKE NWAMU: Everything was just a product of in the flow of the offense and
just playing off each other. We have a really talented group, so we're going
to have people with good nights or different people with good nights on
different nights. So I guess it was my turn this time. It was a product of us
just playing together, really. It's not anything different like different
types of shots, so, yeah.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Rice.  
  
Q. You talked all year about wanting to see the way that your team
responds to the next game after a win or after a loss. I don't think a lot of
people felt good even after the win yesterday. Talk a little bit about the
response of your players for the full 40 minutes tonight.  
COACH RICE: I think when you're a coach and you're around your guys all
spring, all summer, all fall, you get a sense of where they are. I was very
concerned after the UCLA game, and I was very respectful of Indiana but very
confident that we'd give a great effort from start to finish today. I could
tell we've got a big-game team.  
  
I told them before the game, we've got a big-game team, and there is no doubt
we have to play that way against everybody in our schedule, and that's what
we'll work on. But when we play UCLA or Kansas, we have guys that step up and
do a great job.  
  
We have tremendous respect for what the tradition of Indiana is, but I knew we
would give it everything we had and we'd play together. I just thought the
chemistry of our group today was at an all-time high. This is a group that
likes each other, spends time together, and you could see it today.  
  
Q. Did you think Indiana was going to run with you? What was your plan
of attack? Obviously you guys hit a lot of shots in the first half and got out
to a big lead.  
COACH RICE: We anticipated that they would. If you look at the Ken Pom
rankings, and all the analytic stuff, we knew it was one of the best teams in
the country. It would be a high possession game. We knew we would have a hard
time getting them stopped in transition. We knew we needed to score. And as
much as defense was the key, probably as big a key today was making sure we
played inside out and got some shots to go. Because if you're playing on your
heels the whole game, if you're playing off your own misses or turnovers,
you're in for a long day against Coach Crean's group.  
  
Even though they shot a higher percentage from the floor than we'd like to
have had them shoot, I think we forced turnovers against a very good group of
guards. We forced 21 turnovers today, and that was a huge number. We got some
run out baskets, and those one or two extra baskets were the difference in the
game.  
  
Q. You pressed full court and trapped some, but you pulled that off a
little bit today. Was that because of Ferrell and Blackmon being such good
guards, you didn't think you could turn them over too much?  
COACH RICE: Yeah, it's all about Yogi Ferrell and the respect we have for him.
The other thing too, we've got nine guys in our program averaging 15 minutes
or more. And I suspected I would play Jerome and Pat more minutes today than
I've been playing them over the course of the season. I didn't know if that
was the case or not. So we wanted to press and trap off free throws and dead
balls, and we want to pick up full court but not trap on made baskets.  
  
Indiana is a very good press break team. They take the ball out with multiple
guys and it's hard to get them stopped. At the end of the day, they've got one
of the best, if not the best, quick point guards in the country in Ferrell.  
  
Q. Indiana tied the game at 46 and then after that, 0 for 5, like three
turnovers. How big was it right there? If they take the lead, then you don't
know.  
COACH RICE: These kind of games, it's so much about momentum. It's about a big
stop here, a big basket here. We always focus on what happens at the end of
the game. And that's obviously critically important. The big plays are when
you're tied with 17 minutes to go in the game or you're up 6 and you don't
score a basket. Or a chance with a three-pointer that gets to nine and a run
out and cut it down to four. It's an entire game. That's why we focus on it's
every play throughout the course of 40 minutes.  
  
I just thought that we showed a lot of composure with our group in terms of
answering their runs, and they're going to make runs. We got up 13 late in the
game, and they came down and we didn't close that very well in the first
dribble hand-off three. Then they hit a transition three. They're just always
a factor. You get so many shooters out on the floor. And again, we just had
enough in the end to close it out.  
  
Q. Can you describe the Ben Carter who left Las Vegas, and the one we
saw today as a player? When he left, what did you think?  
COACH RICE: I think a lot of that credit goes to Grant Rice, my brother, and a
lot of credit goes to Ben Altman. Ben Carter left Vegas and came back to Vegas
a different player. He matured, he got better. Red-shirt year was huge for
him.  
  
Last year he obviously is a son of a coach. Maybe a guy, Coach Carter may
dance a little bit, but he's a heck of a basketball guy. Ben just is a
stabilizing force.  
  
I went to Ben this morning, and I said, Ben, I know you've been starting. But
for rotation sake, I need you to come off the bench. Okay, Coach, whatever you
need me to do. When you have guys like Ben Carter who have been starting and
in a big game like this, I say you're going to come off the bench and his
response, 16 points and five rebounds, that's all you need to know about Ben
Carter.  
  
Yeah, just, it helps our rotations if I can bring Ben Carter off the bench.
Just with our defensive rotation, defensive substitutions.  
  
And Dwayne Morgan has earned the right to start. His energy level has been
tremendous. Indiana starts with four three-point shooters on the floor, so it
helps to switch four, so we can try to take away three-point shots. The
biggest thing is we needed to get off to a great start. And Dwayne Morgan
always brings energy.  
  
Q. They went zone and Cornish did a quick three, but the next three
possessions you found a gap. That has to make you feel good. They came out,
but did it make you feel good they found gaps and attacked?  
COACH RICE: Yeah, we were disappointed with our execution obviously against
UCLA. We got off to a great start against UCLA and we didn't execute nearly as
well against zone defense. So that's one of the other things coming to a
tournament like Maui is all about, is we come and see what our deficiencies
are, and there is no doubt we've got tomorrow off for Thanksgiving, a practice
day Friday, and game Saturday.  
  
Then all next week it will be zone offense, that will be the primary focus of
what we do. Because we're pretty good, as you see, in man-to-man offense. We
can play inside out, and we have a lot of guys that can dribble penetrate the
ball. We're going to see a lot of zone this year. So that's our job as coaches
to put us in spots and play inside out against zone. But I thought we were a
lot more effective zone offense today than we were during that stretch of the
UCLA game.

INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=MAUI+JIM+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 25, 2015

  

### [Chris Mullin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16805)

### [Federico Mussini](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=29912)

  
_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
ST. JOHN'S - 100 CHAMINADE - 93  
  
THE MODERATOR: We now welcome St. John's to the media room. Questions for
Federico Mussini?  
  
Q. Federico, can you just talk about the three-point shooting today? You
guys were on fire especially early. Did you see something that you might --
knowing that you might be able to do that against Chaminade?  
FEDERICO MUSSINI: I know that I have to shoot when I'm open, and I have
confidence in my shooting. And everybody on the team knows when they are open,
they are to shoot. So just a lot of confidence. Sometimes the shot doesn't go
in, but we have to keep shooting and just believe in ourselves and keep going
like that.  
  
Q. How big is this win after a couple losses here? How big is it to go
home off of this win?  
FEDERICO MUSSINI: It's very important. It's really firm between 3-3, and 4-2.
We had two losses against two really big teams, but we improved every day
since we got here, so that's the important thing. We need to improve every day
like we are doing and we're going to do good, I think.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Mullin.  
  
Q. Coach, how important is getting today's win after the two losses here
and as you go on and go home?  
COACH MULLIN: Yeah, I mean, obviously a win makes the long flight home a
little more bearable and enjoyable, but probably more important to be able to
bounce back. It's important to be able to respond to adversity, and I think
after the first night we took a step on responding and tonight we got rewarded
for that.  
  
I've got to give a lot of credit to Chaminade. They're a very skilled team.
They played beautifully together. So it's a really nice style that they play.
They're always in the game because they can shoot the ball so well. I was very
impressed, not only the way they played, but their demeanor.  
  
Q. Coach, were you comfortable with it, getting into that kind of a
shootout against them?  
COACH MULLIN: I would love to play that way. With six guys, probably not. But
I'm all into sharing the ball and body moving and ball moving and playing
free. Motion, I think that's the beautiful way to play. Until we get more
bodies, we've got to be somewhat diligent on how we do things. But long-term,
yeah, I think that's the way to play basketball.  
  
Q. Coach, speaking of more bodies, how big is the news today that Yakwe
is eligible next Tuesday?  
COACH MULLIN: Great news. He's a beautiful kid, and I'm happy for him. It's
something that he's very grateful for everything that he gets. He works hard.
He's a great teammate and very excited about that.  
  
Q. How do you sum up this trip for you early on in this first season for
you as a college coach? What have you learned or taken away from it?  
COACH MULLIN: I think it's good for the guys to be together as far as bonding
goes and getting to know each other, because we have a whole new team. That's
worked out well.  
  
Then playing against really high level talent, big bodies, athletic was good
for our guys, so every experience for us is going to be mocked up into
something that's going to help us build. Obviously, when you win, it's more
enjoyable. But when you talk losses, you're going to look back on them, and
you might learn more from them, actually. They just hurt more.  
  
So with the young team, and we're aware, rebuilding each and every day is
going to be valuable, just some are more enjoyable.  
  
Q. This might be the last chance to rock the shorts for the year. Just
talk about the Maui experience and being able to play these games?  
COACH MULLIN: I love Hawaii. I've been here so many times. We had training
camp a bunch in Honolulu, and I've been over here several times. Yeah, when
I'm done, I'll be in shorts and flip-flops for sure, each and every day. I
might break them out at the Garden, you never know.

# [MAUI JIM MAUI
INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=MAUI+JIM+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 25, 2015

  

### [Danny Manning](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23674)

### [Devin Thomas](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25010)

### [Cornelius Hudson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=29916)

  
_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
WAKE FOREST - 80 UCLA - 77  
  
THE MODERATOR: We now welcome Wake Forest to the interview room. Coach
Manning, Devin Thomas, and Cornelius Hudson. We'll start with an opening
statement from coach.  
  
COACH MANNING: This was a very hard-fought ballgame. I thought both teams
competed very well. For us -- we lost Bryant Crawford right before tip off. He
came down with the flu, and he couldn't go. We brought two guys back from
suspension, Rondale Watson and Cornelius Hudson, and they played very good
minutes for us today. They helped us win the ballgame.  
  
But this was just a hard-fought game. I think both teams went out there and
laid it on the line. I think multiple times throughout the course of the game
you had a lot of guys diving for loose balls and making multiple effort plays,
and it was a fun game to be a part of. It's probably easier for me to say
because we won. But I thought both teams competed very hard.  
  
Q. Devin, can you talk about going 2-1 here, two quality wins. You go
home from this, how much is it going to mean this trip going 2-1 here?  
DEVIN THOMAS: It feels pretty good going 2-1 in such a great tournament like
this. We would have loved to go 3-0, but we laid an egg yesterday against a
very good Vanderbilt team. It just shows the resilience of our team bouncing
back from that game yesterday and coming up with a big win today.  
  
Q. Cornelius, how did it feel to be back in the lineup today? Talk about
your contribution.  
CORNELIUS HUDSON: I just did whatever coach asked me to do. Unfortunately we
missed Bryant, our key point guard. Codi's out, so someone had to step up
handling the ball, so that's what I did.  
  
Q. Just talk about the free throws and how you guys were able to use
that to an advantage tonight, getting to the free-throw line, being
aggressive, et cetera?  
DEVIN THOMAS: We were aggressive, taking advantage of the new rules that they
tried to do this year. In the end, we made most of our free throws where we
probably should have made more. But it was enough for us to get the win.  
  
A lot of us work on our free throws a lot after practice, especially when
we're tired. So, I mean, you could tell that was the difference in the game
today.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Devin. Anything else to add, Cornelius?  
  
CORNELIUS HUDSON: No.  
  
COACH MANNING: He left two down the stretch.  
  
CORNELIUS HUDSON: Yeah, I don't want to talk about that (laughing).  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. We won't talk about that. Questions for Coach Manning.  
  
Q. Coach, Coach Alford said he's got to study up on the new rules
because 42-14 on the free-throw line, only 28-22 fouls called, but can you
just talk about that?  
COACH MANNING: I don't know them either, apparently. I can't help you. I'm not
the one to ask. Every game changes. Every game changes. It's based upon what
the officials call, and some officials view certain things a foul and some
don't. You just have to adjust.  
  
For us, we want to be an aggressive team and try to get the ball into the
paint. I thought UCLA did a really good job in that. You look at the stat
sheet, and they scored 50 points in the paint. For UCLA that's great; for us,
that's terrible. We've got to do a better job of trying to stay in front of
the basketball to make them shoot over us. That's a category we'd like to try
to win.  
  
But getting back to your question, I don't have it figured out yet.  
  
Q. Could you talk about going 2-1 here, what that means? Two quality
wins for you guys after just 13 wins last year?  
COACH MANNING: We're getting better. To come to this tournament and walk away
with two wins is not exactly what we wanted. We stepped on this island and
wanted to win the tournament. Unfortunately, for us, that didn't happen. So
the next best thing for us is to come away with two wins. And I thought our
guys did a great job of fighting and doing whatever they had to do to help our
team be successful.  
  
Going into this game tonight, bringing back Cornelius and Rondale from
suspension, I had no idea that they were going to log the minutes that they
were going to play. But I also didn't know Crawford wasn't going to be
available until -- we had already put the starting lineup in, and we get the
-- I get the unfortunate news that he can't go. So that was a big blow,
because Bryant has played really well in this tournament, and he made a big
shot for us against Indiana to help us win the game. So I think that Rondale
and Cornelius coming in gave us great lift.  
  
I think Mitch was solid. Mitch goes out there, and he does what he does, which
is be solid, make shots, very calming influence on our team. I thought Devin
played very, very hard today. Tony Parker is a load down in the paint. And
Devin picked up an early foul, and I yo-yo'd him in and out, but he stayed
focused. And he played exceptionally well for us.  
  
So this was just a great team win for us. We need to continue to use this
momentum when we get back to North Carolina, get prepared to go play a tough
Rutgers team on the road.

## November 25, 2015

  

### [Tom Crean](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13756)

### [Nick Zeisloft](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26456)

### [James Blackmon, Jr.](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=27872)

  
_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
UNLV - 72 INDIANA - 69  
  
THE MODERATOR: We now welcome Indiana to the media room, Coach Crean, James
Blackmon, Jr., and Nick Zeisloft. Start with an opening statement from coach.  
  
COACH CREAN: It was a hard-fought game. We knew it would be. I'm sure a Vegas-
Indiana game brought back a lot of memories for a lot of people. It was really
in the scheme of history, it was an honor to play the Runnin' Rebels. It
really was.  
  
I've got great respect for their coach, tremendous respect for him. Don't know
him great, but I was following him as an assistant with what he was doing at
BYU with Dave Rose before he became the head coach at Vegas. I would say that
there are -- I'm not alone. I like to be in the fan club, but I'm not a single
member when it comes to the coaching fraternity. People have a tremendous
level of respect for Dave and what he's doing.  
  
That game shows a lot of ways what they're capable of, because they were right
there on Monday night. And then they got the second half going, and they
really moved the ball. And they're getting better. When you look at some of
their percentages from even some of the guys that have transferred in, that
year off has made them a lot better.  
  
We knew we were going to be in a battle, and what we've got to learn in this
young season is we had it happen here and we had it happen in the wake game,
and we did a pretty decent job with it yesterday, but momentum is always up
for grabs. That means when you get it, you've got to hold it. When you don't
have it, you've got to find something to get it back. We had a couple moments
today where we did get it back, but we also had some moments where the game
was up for grabs and we didn't do a great job.  
  
We got ourselves in a hole at the beginning with our turnovers, and you're not
going to beat any type of team, let alone one as talented as UNLV, when you're
giving them 22 points. It's unacceptable with the guys that have the ball in
their hands for us to be giving the ball that way, and we've got to get that
fixed. We really do, or we've got to fix the lineup.  
  
We're a growing team right now in a lot of ways. The most important thing that
we could grow into is understanding where our responsibilities lie as
individuals and improvement, and as a team for how we can be collectively
better.  
  
This is a great tournament to learn about that in. A great tournament. No
question disappointed with a loss today, but we've got to turn this into some
positives. It's all going to come down to how people view where their
improvement level is. I'll be very clear where our improvement level has got
to be. But you've got to have enough players that understand that they have to
take a real, real stake in that to make themselves better.  
  
Q. James, I guess we'll start with you. How do you rate your performance
overall as a team going 1-2 in this event?  
JAMES BLACKMON, JR.: There are just things that we need to improve on. That's
how I look at it. Like Coach said, we're going to go look at the film, and
guys like us just want to get better from it. So I just feel like we could
have done a lot better to change the outcome of how the game went.  
  
Q. Nick, talk a little bit about obviously you were really hot shooting
the three-pointer. What were you trying to get at the end? I know the shot was
blocked, but was that the shot you were looking for?  
NICK ZEISLOFT: Yeah, that was the set that we have. There are several
different options on that play, and it just came to me. I wish I might have
shot faked or something better, but that play's over. There are other plays
and another game that we have to worry about to get better.  
  
COACH CREAN: We wouldn't change that play. That was excellent. They made an
athletic play. But he did a good job taking the shot. I know it wasn't my
turn, but I wanted to clarify that.  
  
Q. James, defensively, what did UNLV do early to turn you guys over?  
JAMES BLACKMON, JR.: Really it was just us. I feel like they didn't do too
much of anything. I feel like it was us that made turnovers that we could have
prevented. But their pressure was good. We knew that they would come out and
pressure us and it was going to be a dog fight from the beginning. So I feel
like we should have just prevented that more.  
  
Q. Nick, during the three days you guys played here, the TV commentators
really hit on Indiana's defense and questioned it a lot. Where do you think it
is, and where do you think it needs to get to?  
NICK ZEISLOFT: Well, it definitely needs to improve in all aspects, whether it
was zone or man, on ball defense, help-side defense, it's a process and we
definitely have to get better at it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Crean.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the free-throw shooting? I think it's like 67% so
far this year.  
COACH CREAN: That's not good. That's not good. You're exactly right.  
  
Q. What do you have to do to improve it?  
COACH CREAN: We've just got to make free throws. That would be the most
important thing. I wouldn't change a lot about the free-throw shooters that
are up there, so we've just got to make free throws.  
  
Q. Just to follow up on the question to Nick. The TV commentator really
questioned the way IU played defense these three games. What did you see when
you look out there?  
COACH CREAN: Well, you're way ahead of me on the TV commentators. I've
actually been preparing for games so I haven't seen or listened to any of the
broadcast, so I'll make sure I do that. We have a lot of room for improvement
defensively. No doubt about it.  
  
We're playing with three freshmen on the front line. We don't have the front
line that we were projected to have. We don't have the front line that we
thought we were going to have. So we've got to get that down. They've got to
deal with the different coverages that are there and all that different type
of stuff. There is no question we can get better at every aspect of the game.  
  
Q. I guess, forgive a blunt question, but are you worried about this
team's confidence level after a week like this? Or do you think with the
experience level and what they've been through, particularly last year, you
talked about overcoming low expectations last year, that they have the mental
whatever they need to get past a week like this?  
COACH CREAN: Well, we're six games in. Okay. It's the end of November. They've
got a lot of improving to do, and I think the confidence will come from the
improvement.  
  
So in answer to your question, I'm not worried about that at all. I think the
bottom line is the level of improvement that everyone has to make, that's
where your confidence comes from. It's the bottom line. Bill Parcells said
confidence comes from demonstrated ability. Well, we've got some young guys
that haven't had a chance to put those experiences together yet. Well, these
three days certainly provided some of that. We also have players that have
demonstrated ability.  
  
So the bottom line with any team at any point in the season, whether it's late
in the year, middle of the year, early in the year, no matter what sport it
is, is what is their desire to improve? It's so much more than what you just
do as a program with your practices, with your preparations, with your film.
There's got to be just a real mental desire that turns into a strength and
turns into a mental toughness level about how important it is to get better.  
  
This is a test. The eight teams walking out of here, no matter what, in three
days are getting tested. All right? Even if the champion tonight blows through
it, whoever the champion is, they're still getting tested because you're
playing three games in three days against very high level competition.  
  
So these are the types of things you learn from. They bank them. They put them
together. And it all goes back to how much you want to continue to improve
your individual aspects, take responsibility for what you have to get better
at, and work that much more diligently to make your teammates better.  
  
Q. Twenty turnovers, ten came right off the bat. But was there a common
theme in what players were doing to cause them?  
COACH CREAN: Home runs. Trying to make plays that weren't there. We knew we
were going to deal with speed and pressure, and we weren't as -- we just have
to keep the game simple. The hardest thing for good players to learn -- and
when you play like this, you don't play like a good player. The hardest thing
to learn is you look really good when you keep it simple. When you're not
really good or you don't have a lot of talent is when you have to try to
manufacture a lot of things at times that aren't there.  
  
For us, we can't have it -- Troy can't throw a no-look pass. He can't do that.
That's not what we're doing. I'm not just using Troy -- I'm using Troy as an
example, but we're making too many turnovers. We made too many mental
mistakes, okay, that ended up looking physically wrong because of the way we
passed the ball because we weren't as aware as we needed to be. And their
pressure sped us up some, but our lack of fundamental passing at times with
stuff that's just common sense things.  
  
I mean, the way we throw pocket passes, the way we look, the way we see. The
way we're not trying to throw no-looks and things like that, we just can't do
that. We've got to continue to get better there.  
  
Q. You mentioned keeping it simple. At some point do you slow it down a
little bit to keep it from speeding up too much?  
COACH CREAN: I don't think it's that. I'm going to look at the film. I think
about that, but I don't think it's that. I think it's when we're playing fast
and that ball is moving, we're pretty good.  
  
Look at Nick Zeisloft's numbers. When it's moving and you're driving with your
head down, okay, and you can't see the cutters or you can't see the open guy,
that's not good. Now those both happened out of speed. But some of our best
offense is out of speed. Right? But at the same time, we've got to continue to
play through the post. We've got not just one or two guys we can throw it into
there that can get fouled and make plays.  
  
The free throw shooting was an aberration right now. It's got to get better.
It's got to get better. We have guys that are high-level, career free-throw
shooters missing free throws during the game. We're not even talking
necessarily about the end-of-the-game-type free throws that we had the other
day.  
  
But, no, I don't think it's that. We've got to get fouled. So getting fouled
is running. Getting fouled is offensive rebounding. Getting fouled is driving
through the paint. I tell you the numbers that are phenomenal are the numbers
of what we do when we go through the paint or post, or when we don't turn the
ball over. Now those numbers are great.  
  
So what do we have to do? We have to figure out a way to get to more of that
and less turnovers and less not playing through the paint.  
  
Q. Just sort of bringing it all together, can you trace some of these
issues, the turnovers? Are they a more central source or are they separate
problems that aren't related to one another in your mind and you have to deal
with them piecemeal?  
COACH CREAN: I think what we'll do is put all the turnovers, we'll put
everything after these six games now on film, and really get a feel for some
trends. Your ball screen game, your postgame, transition game, all the
turnovers, those type of things. I would say, again, like I said a little bit
ago, all right, getting a team that's got some guys that can score and shoot
to understand, all right. And some of you have seen us in practice, so you
know what I'm talking about here with the fundamental drills of driving the
ball with your head up, changing direction, getting the ball out, making the
quick pass, making the on-time, on-target pass.  
  
But we've got some accuracy issues we're getting better at. But making the
game simple. Continuing to break away from how I beat my man to how I get the
help to respond to me so I can get it to my teammate. That to me is -- because
there were times even in this game, and I can think of a couple of them, where
we made tremendous plays in the press offense and things like that because we
stayed committed to the spacing. That's what we've got to continue to get
better at.  
  
So I'd much rather have a team -- this goes back to Mike's question -- I'd
much rather have a team that you have to slow down some than one that you
can't get to play at a high level of speed. Our turnovers, they're coming all
over, right? They're coming all over. They're not just coming because we're
playing fast. They're coming in the half court too. So we'll get better with
it. We'll get better.  
  
I'll be anxious. I know everybody will be looking forward to the time here and
certainly we have Thanksgiving. But I'll be looking forward to our next
practice.  
  
Thank you to everybody. Thank you for what you've done. This tournament has
been awesome. It's my fourth trip here as a coach. Everything has been first
class from the time you arrive. Your atmosphere out there for the games, it's
always phenomenal. It keeps getting better and better all the time. The
atmosphere here is unreal. I wish we could bottle it up. The atmosphere is
tremendous. We really appreciate being here. Indiana really appreciates being
here.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Happy to have you. Thank you.

# [MAUI JIM MAUI
INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=MAUI+JIM+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 25, 2015

  

### [Eric Bovaird](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22849)

### [Kevin Hu](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=29913)

### [James Harper](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=29911)

  
_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
ST. JOHN'S - 100 CHAMINADE - 93  
  
THE MODERATOR: We now welcome Chaminade to the media room. Coach Bovaird,
Kevin Hu, and James Harper. Coach, an opening statement?  
  
COACH BOVAIRD: Yeah, I thought we had more intensity and enthusiasm in the
second half, as you can tell. We started off the game not ready to play and
handle the ball and make passes at game-time speed.  
  
So that's something we'll work on. We'll work on trying to be ready for the
opening tip. First possessions is just as important as the 44th. So we need to
make the most out of them.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about this week, what it was like having dad in the
stands all week, how cool that was?  
KEVIN HU: I really appreciated that he came. It was his first time, and it was
his first time seeing me play in America. He never actually came here before,
and I just really wanted to show him and do my best for him because he's one
of my biggest supporters. So I really appreciate it.  
  
Q. James, can you talk about, I know nobody likes moral victories, but
today you guys battled back a couple times, getting within five or so. How big
is that going to be for you guys down the line being able to do that against a
St. John's team like that?  
JAMES HARPER: Yeah, I agree that we don't like moral victories, but we take
these games as learning curves. We use them to improve our game throughout the
season. Coming back against a team like St. John's, a Big East team, that's
going to help us down the line when we play Division II teams in our
conference when we really need to make a run.  
  
Q. James, Chris Mullin was in here before you guys and was very
complimentary of your team's style of play and how you play together and shoot
the ball. Hearing that from a guy like that, what's that mean to you?  
JAMES HARPER: That means a lot. I think we have a unique team where we have a
lot of scorers and a lot of offense on our team. When it's your opportunity to
step up and hit an open shot, you have to step up with confidence and make it,
because all the other guys around you can do the exact same thing. So we
really have a unique team in that sense.  
  
It means a lot from a big-time coach and player like that to say that about
our team.  
  
Q. Coach, same question, I know you don't like moral victories, but can
you just talk about how encouraged you were by the runs you guys were able to
make today against a team like St. John's?  
COACH BOVAIRD: It's encouraging, but that's something I already knew
throughout practice and throughout exhibition games and scrimmages and all
that kind of stuff. I know we're capable of making runs, but are we capable of
keeping the other team from scoring 100 points on us? What did they have at
halftime? 59? That's what my question marks are. I know we'll always be good
offensively, but my biggest question is how good are we going to be
defensively?  
  
Q. One glaring thing about the team yesterday was the turnover issue. It
seems like you got that number way down today. But just talk about having to
shore that area up for the season.  
COACH BOVAIRD: Well, when you play fast and you're constantly attacking and
driving and kicking and making decisions, and given the freedom to do those
things to everybody on the team, it's a completely different style and system
that most teams operate that you have to count on those guys to make good
decisions. We don't have a primary ball handler that handles the ball 80% of
the time and gets you in your offense. Everybody has the ability to shoot,
drive and score.  
  
The biggest factor in today's game in that fact is we had eight or nine
turnovers at halftime because we started out the game not ready to handle the
ball and make those type of decisions at full game speed. So turnovers are
going to be a big factor for us and percentage on defense is going to be the
two primary factors to whether we have a good season or an average season.  
  
Q. Coach, we've talked about it before, but this is now your fifth
chance to do this. How do you kind of handle coming down from the national
spotlight and going into the season that counts most for you guys from here?  
COACH BOVAIRD: Well, I handle it fine. In fact, that was part of my speech in
the locker room to the guys. We could be going and playing in McCabe Gym on
Saturday right after Thanksgiving. I said there is only going to be one camera
in the gym unless Ian decides to come, but there will be one camera
videotaping the game and that's it. We may have 50 fans there, we may have
more than that. But now that the spotlight and limelight is over, you have to
be ready to play. You have to be ready to get after it.  
  
These games, as important as they are for us and as important as they are for
Chaminade, we could win the Maui Invitational, it wouldn't help us one bit
getting into where we want to get into. So only our Division II games count
towards making the NCAA Tournament. We play a Division II team Saturday night,
and we better be ready to play.

# [MAUI JIM MAUI
INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=MAUI+JIM+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 25, 2015

  

### [Steve Alford](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17050)

### [Tony Parker](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13882)

  
_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
WAKE FOREST - 80 UCLA - 77  
  
COACH ALFORD: I thought our guys competed. This was a team that was plus 12 on
the backboard. We beat them 8. We hold them to 40% shooting.  
  
We've got to get back, we've got to watch the tape as coaches because we've
got to figure out the new rules because we're doing a bad job of teaching the
new rules of emphasis.  
  
42 free throws to 14. I've been doing this 25 years. I've been on the short
end of a lot of things. I've never had an experience where I've had a team get
out-shot 42-14 at the free-throw line. That was the difference in the game.  
  
I thought we competed hard. We did the things we wanted to do. We shot the
ball pretty well, 46%. Didn't turn the ball over. But you lose 30-8 at the
free-throw line, it's going to be a long night.  
  
Q. Tony, what were your impressions on the fouls as well?  
TONY PARKER: It really wasn't an impression on the fouls. It's just we've got
to come out and play harder. The fouls, we lost that game because there were
too many 50-50 balls we didn't get.  
  
Toughness is what it comes down to. It's nothing coaches can change. It's
something we've got to soul search. We've got to go home and soul search. We
played like we were supposed to be here. They played like they were blessed to
be here, like they really wanted it. We acted like it was a privilege tonight
from starters to scholarship guys to walk-ons. We didn't come out with the
enthusiasm as if we're in Hawaii. We came out with a soft mentality, and we
got beat. We'll continue to get beaten until we toughen up and we get together
and play together on both ends of the floor.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Alford.  
  
No questions for coach. Thank you for your time.

INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=MAUI+JIM+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 24, 2015

  

### [Kevin Stallings](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13784)

### [Damian Jones](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18170)

### [Jeff Roberson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=29905)

  
_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
VANDERBILT - 86 WAKE FOREST - 64  
  
THE MODERATOR: We now welcome Vanderbilt to the interview room. We'll start
with an opening statement from coach.  
  
COACH STALLINGS: I thought that our guys played, again, very inspired. We got
great production from our bench again, and Damian certainly led our charge
today, as did Wade. I felt like Wade played very well also. But I thought
fatigue might have played a little bit of a part in that game. I thought maybe
our team being a little deeper than theirs had an impact. They made a great
run after we ran on them at the beginning. They made a great run to get back
in the game.  
  
Then I thought from that point forward we were able to establish control and
never really relinquish it. I was really proud of our team with that because
they hit us with a solid shot. They really made a nice, nice run there in the
first half to get back in the game. So just proud. I like how we're playing.  
  
We put them on the foul line too many times. That was certainly a negative and
something that we talked about. But nevertheless, I thought that we did a nice
job. We did a nice job defending and did a nice job defending the three-point
line. So all in all it was a very, very good performance.  
  
Q. Damian, can you just talk about what a Maui Invitational title would
mean to the program and then just you guys and for the rest of the year?  
DAMIAN JONES: I mean, it would be huge for us going into the season, having
that under our belt. It would really help our confidence going into conference
play.  
  
Q. Damian, yesterday Coach Stallings basically said that you need to
kind of lead the team as far as production if you guys wanted to go where you
wanted to go. So what was different for you today as opposed to the first few
games this season?  
DAMIAN JONES: Stayed out of foul trouble.  
  
Q. Jeff, how does it feel the way you guys won decisively today and
making the championship game? What does that mean to you?  
JEFF ROBERSON: That's what we expected coming in. We worked hard to get to
this point. We didn't expect anything less. We just feel like we're a good
group, we work hard and we want it all to pay off.  
  
Q. Damian, can you talk about the interior defense? You guys really made
them shoot the ball not too well. Can you just talk about the inside
defense?  
DAMIAN JONES: Just playing hard, walling up whenever the person drives. Trying
not to stick our hands out and stuff like that. Just playing solid defense.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Stallings.  
  
COACH STALLINGS: I know your first thought is that Damian's going to have to
stop talking so much.  
  
Q. Coach, why do you think Damian was able to stay out of foul trouble
today?  
COACH STALLINGS: I don't know. Maybe it's because Coach Richardson made fun of
him last night, I'm not sure. We talked about running one of our plays for
him, and we wanted to get it in early in the game. And Coach Richardson said
in our team meeting you're probably going to have to get it in by the 18:30
mark because he'll be in foul trouble. I think Damian played with a little
more discipline today.  
  
Wake's big guys are good players. Thomas is a load in terms of a match-up
because he can put the ball down, and he's going left, and he's going back
left-handed. It's still difficult. He draws fouls on you and he does it to
everyone.  
  
But I just think Damian staying in the game and not having to sit out
significant time in the first half kept him in the flow and allowed him to
play better.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the defense in and out? You forced him into 3 for
18 from three and 33% or so shooting overall?  
COACH STALLINGS: Yeah, just trying to wall up and get our hands out. Thanks.
No, I'm kidding. We've got some length at the goal, and I think that's one of
the things that has really been an advantage for us starting probably midway
through the season last year.  
  
Luke and Damian are understanding how to play together on the defensive end.
They're good about challenging other people's shots. We're not always trying
to block our guy's shot that we're guarding, but we want to challenge other
people's shots. So I think that -- I do think that interior defense, good
interior defense starts on the perimeter, and we did a good job on the three-
point line. Though I did think they had a few looks that, again, I don't know
if it was fatigue or we were able to rush them a little bit.  
  
But other than that one stretch there in the first half, I never felt like
they got into a comfortable offensive rhythm, and hopefully that had something
to do with our defense.  
  
Q. I know it's been a long time, but you were part of two Final Fours at
KU. I wondered if anybody's recognized you this week? And if you do play KU,
would that matter to you personally?  
COACH STALLINGS: It will matter to me personally no matter who we play
(laughing). Somebody mentioned it the other night at the banquet and you had
Bill and you had Danny, and you had me. Three guys that had been a part of
KU's basketball program. Now let's see which guy kind of came in third in
terms of their impact on the program. You've got Bill who has won National
Championships. Danny won a National Championship. One of the greatest players
to ever play there, and I was just a lowly assistant coach.  
  
But I was there for five great years with Roy Williams and very proud of my
time there. Wonderful place. It's just a wonderful place. My son was born
there. He's 25 now. And we have great memories of coaching there and Phog
Allen Fieldhouse, and having lots of success.  
  
My son was actually on the cover of one of the programs while I was coaching
there. Not the program, the media guides. He's a little bitty shorty, and he
looked really cute back then. A lot has changed since then. That was supposed
to be funny.  
  
But anyway, it was recognized. But, again, I recognize the role that I played,
and it was a lot less significant than the other head coaches that are in this
tournament.

## November 24, 2015

  

### [Bill Self](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13713)

### [Devonte' Graham](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=29906)

### [Perry Ellis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25064)

  
_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
KANSAS - 92 UCLA - 73  
  
THE MODERATOR: We now welcome Kansas players to the media room, Perry Ellis
and Devonte' Graham.  
  
Q. Perry and Devonte', what was the key to getting off to such a big
lead?  
PERRY ELLIS: Just defense. That was the key, getting stops and we were getting
those stops and we were running, running great, running the floor great and
got some easy buckets.  
  
DEVONTE' GRAHAM: Just like Perry said, coming out with energy on the defensive
end, especially I felt like we were getting stops early in the game which led
to easy buckets, run outs. And we were getting whatever we wanted to early on
the offensive end.  
  
Q. Devonte', what was the assignment for you on Alford tonight? Was that
a key to the game plan?  
DEVONTE' GRAHAM: It was definitely a key to the game plan. It was make things
tough for them, don't let them be comfortable. I just tried to get through all
the ball screens, staggers, double screens and baseline runners and just make
them make tough plays, shoot tough shots.  
  
Q. Perry, you were able to score in a bunch of different ways tonight.
How do you feel your game has come along over the course of your Kansas
career?  
PERRY ELLIS: It came a long way, I feel. Each year I feel like I started
shooting the ball better and better. I'm shooting it really well. Just overall
I felt like I became a better player and it's been good for me.  
  
Q. What do you think of tomorrow's game and again tonight, Perry, were
you very comfortable shooting the ball?  
PERRY ELLIS: Yeah, I definitely was comfortable. Just tried to play within the
rhythm of the game. It's going to be a tough game tomorrow, good team, so
we've just got to get prepared tonight.  
  
Q. Perry, speaking of specifically the game tomorrow, the front court
that Vanderbilt has between Kornet and Damian Jones, couple strong games to
open this tournament, what are your thoughts on those guys and the challenge
tomorrow?  
PERRY ELLIS: Yeah, from what I say saw, they have a great team and their bigs
are good. So it's definitely going to be a team effort, have to grind, grind
the game out and just try to get a good effort.  
  
Q. When Perry's out there and he can stretch the floor and shoot the
three as well as anybody or any of the guards, how difficult does that make
you guys to defend?  
DEVONTE' GRAHAM: Very difficult because that just opens up the court even
more. It helps me and Frank be able to drive, Wayne just to get in the lane.
Then most of the time, it's a big guy guarding in Perry, so he just sinks into
the paint, which gives Perry a wide open three-point shots, and when he's
knocking them down, he's tough to guard.  
  
Q. How much fun has it been the last two nights scoring this many points
both of you?  
PERRY ELLIS: Oh, it's been fun. We've been out there as a team moving the ball
and good things will happen.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Devonte', anything to add to that one?  
  
DEVONTE' GRAHAM: It's been really fun. Like I said earlier, it all starts on
the defensive end. Coach just preaches defense, defense, defense. Once we play
good defense he just wants us to run, get easy buckets, get the inside out and
just play how we play.  
  
Q. Perry, you've been around for a while, obviously, but do you think
this team has maybe more offensive firepower than any team you've been on
since you've been at Kansas?  
PERRY ELLIS: I think so. I think we have a lot of scores. We just, you know,
out of the people we have on the team being around also so we know each
other's tendencies. It's just going to be a great year.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We now welcome Coach Self to the interview room.  
  
COACH SELF: We played great the first half. I mean, that's about as well as we
played. We played fast and we made shots and we created some points off our
defense. So we built a big cushion.  
  
In the second half we just traded baskets. It was a horse contest the second
half. But I was really pleased with how we played.  
  
Q. Coach Self, how do you feel like Perry Ellis has come along as a
player in the last four years?  
COACH SELF: Well, he was a McDonald's All-American. He was highly recruited.
He's certainly gotten better every year.  
  
Last year, in my opinion, he was right there to win Player of the Year in the
league until he got hurt. Not saying he deserved it, but he was right there.  
  
This year I'd be very disappointed if he didn't put himself in that same
position. I think he can play to an All-American type level. He played so well
tonight. He shot the ball well. But he's become a much better all-around
player.  
  
Q. How important was what Devonte' did on your defense tonight?  
COACH SELF: I didn't think we guarded Hamilton or Holiday well at all. I
thought we really struggled guarding the ball and they got where they wanted
to.  
  
But to me the key to their team is cutting down on good opportunities for
Bryce and they still want to play inside out through Tony. Early on we did a
pretty good job on Tony, but Devonte' did a great job on Bryce the whole
night. He made one field goal and four free throws, and I'm not sure he scored
in the second half. So I thought that was as big a key as anything for us.  
  
Q. What do you think about the way you guys have run? I know you always
tell the players to do it the last two nights.  
COACH SELF: Yeah, we're playing faster. The thing about it is we didn't run
the second half because we didn't get any stops. Your defense should lead to
your transition as much as anything.  
  
I thought the first half, whether it be missed shots or when the other team
shoots 34% or whatnot, you're able to run through passes or create pace off of
your defense. It makes it a lot easier. I thought we really pitched ahead
great tonight and I thought we attacked the rim very well.  
  
Q. Another low turnover game for your team. Was it the two guards you
had playing together or just an experienced team?  
COACH SELF: I don't really know. I think we're a better, although Devonte'
didn't have a lot of assists tonight, but we had 15 assists in the first half
and just four the second. I think we're a much better passing team than we
have been. I think we move the ball better. We drive it better than we have
the last couple years.  
  
Even though we look better physically playing big on the wings, it hasn't been
as good an offensive basketball team because we've eliminated easy baskets in
large part because we haven't been able to feed the post or get our shoulders
past guys.  
  
Q. With Luke Kornet and Damian Jones, how much are you looking forward
to the match-up with them and Perry Ellis tomorrow and the match-up in
general?  
COACH SELF: First of all, they're a lot bigger than we are. Their standing
height, Perry's 6'7.5", and what are they? 7'and 6'11", the two guys that you
mentioned. So we're going to have to play bigger than our standing height.
We'll have to utilize our quickness inside. It's a hard match-up for us.  
  
Vanderbilt would be extremely difficult to play and defeat no matter what. But
with no day to prepare for a team that runs 100 different sets and they're
experienced and they share it. Kevin said it's the most unselfish team he's
ever had. After watching him, it's like open man is the go-to guy. They do a
great job of sharing it.  
  
Of course, they can stretch it. I heard today, nine guys are shooting 40% from
three. I mean, that's unheard of. So to think that you've got to defend all
over the court and then they can throw it to two big guys down low that can
score on anybody one-on-one, it's going to be hard. They're unorthodox the way
they defend in some ways, without me studying it, because he doesn't care if
they switch big on little or little on big, so it kind of creates something
that you haven't really practiced against a whole lot. It will be difficult.
It will be fun, but it will be very difficult.

## November 24, 2015

  

### [Dave Rice](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23393)

### [Patrick McCaw](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=29899)

### [Derrick Jones, Jr.](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=29904)

  
_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
UNLV - 93 CHAMINADE - 73  
  
THE MODERATOR: We now welcome UNLV to the media room. Coach Rice, Derrick
Jones, Jr. and Patrick McCaw. Coach, an opening statement?  
  
COACH RICE: First of all, Chaminade was really good in the first half.  
  
Our team was really down after last night. I think that's probably human
nature. It's one of the things that's tough about that quick bounce-back after
you have a tough loss. But we come to Maui for a variety of reasons.
Obviously, we come because it's a very prestigious tournament, there is always
a star-studded field. This is one of the best fields in a long time. But you
come here as a group, as a team, trying to find out your identity, trying to
see who in your program has toughness, who can bounce back?  
  
We talked about it last night. What is our response to success? We've had that
starting 3-0 and then what's your response to adversity? Last night was an
adverse situation. There is no doubt these two guys on the stage, Patrick
McCaw and Derrick Jones found it for us in the second half.  
  
We regrouped at halftime, had great team leadership. Our guys challenged each
other, and we went from down 4 to up 20 at the end of the game. Quick
turnaround again tomorrow.  
  
Tremendous respect for Coach Crean, Indiana and their program. We'll be
challenged, no doubt. But was very proud of our team. It was one of those that
we had to fight today, and it was way more about ourselves than anything else.
But we found a way to play hard in the second half. We found a way to play
together to share the ball to play inside out, and we only turned the ball
over ten times for the game, which was a huge thing.  
  
I thought Patrick McCaw and Derrick Jones made huge plays down the stretch,
and we did a good job guarding them.  
  
Q. Derrick, what was said in the locker room at halftime when you guys
were down? What were you thinking personally because you were a lot more
aggressive in the second half?  
DERRICK JONES, JR.: The coaches just told us we've got to be more aggressive
and lock down on defense a lot more and get a lot more rebounds. So we all
went out and we all played aggressive and got the win.  
  
Q. Pat, Dave talked about it a little bit, the frustration of last night
seems like it bled over into the first half here. Is that accurate? Do you
think it was a little bit of a hangover? Just what are your thoughts on what
you guys were able to do then in the second half?  
PATRICK McCAW: Yeah, for sure it was. It was a tough loss. We wish we would
have come out with a win against UCLA. But we came in, we got together as a
team once we got back to the hotel.  
  
We just said get ready for Chaminade. We have to fight through adversity and
bounce back. We took a tough loss. Coach Rice ensured that we'd come prepared
for Chaminade. I know we came out a little slow. We had to fight through the
aches and pains. But in the second half, Coach was just preaching we've got to
bring energy and effort in the second half and play running rebel basketball,
and that's what we did.  
  
Q. Pat, there seemed to be a couple of times mainly in that big run in
the second half you decided to kind of take over on offense, whether it was
threes, driving. Do you kind of change your mentality throughout a game? You
can't be the point guard. You're kind of 1 through 3. Are there times you
decide, okay, these next few possessions, I'm going?  
PATRICK McCAW: No, I just try to find myself playing the flow of the game.
Coach Rice wants me to be aggressive and assert myself on the floor. The
opportunities come for me, I'm just ready to take them. But, no, I just try to
play in the flow of the game. I don't try to be too aggressive or take too
many shots. I just play the game.  
  
Q. Derrick, could you sense the team was down a little bit after last
night and not quite ready to play in the first half?  
DERRICK JONES, JR.: I mean, yeah. I mean, we were down, but we had to come
back and battle through adversity and come back and get this win today. So we
were watching film last night and we came back and we played hard and we got
the win.  
  
Q. What was Coach Rice's attitude like at halftime? Was he ticked off at
you guys? Were the coaches trying to light a fire under you? What was going
on?  
DERRICK JONES, JR.: The coaches know what we can do and they know what we're
capable of. They just wanted us to go out and play a lot harder. They knew we
weren't playing at our full potential, so they just wanted us to go out and
play a lot harder. So if they came in the locker room and they were fired up,
they had a reason to be. They just came in and got us fired up too.  
  
Q. That dunk you had where you got a running start in the second half,
what did you see and what did you think of that play maybe compared to the one
you had that kind of made the rounds on TV last week?  
DERRICK JONES, JR.: I don't know. I mean, I just caught the ball. They
overplayed me, so I just crossed over, went down the lane and did what I do.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Rice.  
  
Q. Just to follow up on that, what was your, I guess, attitude towards
the team at the half? Obviously you weren't happy with the team energy, the
lack of defense, and a lot of things you saw in the first half?  
COACH RICE: Yeah, I think it would be easy going into the locker room and
making it all about getting a pound of flesh. But confidence is a shaky thing.
When you've got a group that came in, prepared hard and played extremely hard
last night and had things not quite go our way down the stretch and lost a
game, there is a fine line between going in and blasting them and giving them
confidence.  
  
So at halftime, no doubt that we got after them, I got after them pretty good.
It was more about planning an attack. Giving them confidence that we can go do
this together, when we have to go do this together. We've played hard for four
games of the UCLA game, and we didn't play as hard as we need to play in the
first half. We didn't play nearly as well together. It's time. Everything
we've got to have an opportunity to achieve this year is still there.  
  
I thought the guys really responded. I thought Ben Carter and Jerome were
really fantastic. I thought one of the keys today in the second half was
Jerome looking for other guys. Even though he only got three assists in the
game, he only took five shots because he was making a conscious effort to be a
point guard and get other people involved. I thought that was a big difference
in the game, particularly in the second half.  
  
Q. How concerned are you with the free throw issue only five games into
the season? Other than just putting up more shots in practice, what can be
done to maybe make it more consistent?  
COACH RICE: I think the biggest challenge for me right now, the challenge all
season long is that we've got a very deep, talented team, and only five guys
can start and only five guys can play at a time. We've got to continue to bind
the team. That is the biggest challenge of the season so we can have a
successful season.  
  
I think the biggest challenge for me right now is finding that balance. Our
guys are playing with a tremendous amount of pressure. My job as a coach is to
make the game fun. Basketball's supposed to be fun. When you play in Las
Vegas, it's a privilege to put that UNLV uniform on. There is great tradition.
But I don't want our guys to have the weight of the world on their shoulders.
That's my job, that's the coaches' job. They came to UNLV to play.  
  
Our fans were fantastic. Our fans were so good through in those runs. They
were great last night against UCLA. They were great today. Hundreds of UNLV
fans are here. But my job is to take the pressure off these kids. The pressure
is to play hard and the pressure is to play together. But our guys are playing
with such an expectation level on them and I think it's taking some of the fun
out of the game. Because we have good players and we're going to have a good
team, but we've got to find that balance, and that's my job to do that.  
  
Q. Can you talk about tomorrow's match-up with Indiana? I'm not sure how
much you've seen of the Hoosiers, but they've got two dynamic guards in
Ferrell and Blackmon, and if you can talk about that match-up and the
importance of this game?  
COACH RICE: We've watched those guys. Yogi Ferrell, I watched in AAU with
Indiana Elite, and Blackmon I watched at Indiana last year. They're fantastic.
Troy Williams on their interior attack, it's similar to the UCLA game.  
  
It's great balance. It's interior players. It's perimeter guys that can shoot
the ball, handle the ball. Yogi Ferrell is a tremendously difficult match-up
for anybody. I've watched Indiana a lot the last many years. I have a lot of
respect for Tom and how hard his teams work.  
  
We watched them a little bit yesterday and our coaches watched them today. It
will be a battle. We've got to keep the ball in front of us. We've got to
contest shooters and limit our turnovers. The formula's the same for us all
season long: Plan an attack, get to the free-throw line, make our free throws
on the defensive end. Contest shots, rebound the ball. It's the formula for
everyone across the country.  
  
Q. Back to the expectations and pressure. Where does that come from
then? In terms of the NCAA and tournament conference titles, that hasn't been
there. What is the pressure?  
COACH RICE: I think these kids are just great kids and they want to do well.
They want to please our coaching staff, our families and they want to please
the fans. It's not a bad thing. It's not a bad thing. It's just a matter of
making sure it's fun and we play hard, and understanding that good things will
happen for us. The only pressure there is is to play hard and play together.
If we do that, we'll have a successful season. We've got great kids and I
thought we played very, very well in the second half.  
  
Q. Can you just expand a little bit on what Ben Carter has been able to
do? It seems like both games he's been a consistent guy at both ends for
you.  
COACH RICE: Ben's our glue guy. Makes big plays. He's a leader on and off the
court. He's a terrific rebounder. He's got a high basketball IQ. We can run
anything with him in the game. He plays multiple positions. He's a coach's
son. So that's something that's positive for him. He's a guy that's got the
respect of his teammates because of how hard he works and how much he has
committed a team.  
  
But he was certainly a difference maker in today's game, and he's been good
for us all season long.

## November 24, 2015

  

### [Chris Mullin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16805)

  
_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
Indiana - 83 St. John's - 73  
  
THE MODERATOR: We welcome Coach Mullin to the interview room.  
  
COACH MULLIN: I thought today's performance was a gutty performance. Thought
that we took care of the basketball. For the most part, we rebounded and
competed. I thought it was a good bounce-back game, defense was much better,
and I told the team if we play like that, we'll be rewarded.  
  
Q. Coach, you started slow, but you battled back. That has to be a good
sign going forward.  
COACH MULLIN: Yeah, the guys have worked hard. It's never from a lack of
effort. Sometimes other things creep in. A lot of it is a lack of experience;
that you can't fast forward. Experience is something you have to go through,
and when you go through it, it's going to be some painful nights, but I keep
telling them, that's what's going to make us better.  
  
It's not going to happen right away. Any good team, any good player, that's
what you go through. That's the price you have to pay. The people that are
willing to do it, they get rewarded in the end.  
  
Q. Did Indiana seem fatigued to you?  
COACH MULLIN: No.  
  
Q. No? Okay. Obviously you played in the NBA and you know the league
very well. Curious on Troy Williams as it relates to the next level?  
COACH MULLIN: He's an NBA athlete, for sure. He's a versatile player. He can
play several positions, probably guard several positions. Multi-talented and
versatile, which is very valuable at the next level.

INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=MAUI+JIM+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 24, 2015

  

### [Danny Manning](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23674)

### [Bryant Crawford](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=29895)

  
_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
VANDERBILT - 86 WAKE FOREST - 64  
  
THE MODERATOR: We now welcome Wake Forest to the media room, Coach Manning,
John Collins and Bryant Crawford. Coach, an opening statement?  
  
COACH MANNING: This afternoon Vanderbilt came out and delivered the first
couple blows, and we didn't respond well. From that point on, we played catch
up. They're very-well coached, Kevin does a wonderful job. They shoot the ball
exceptionally well.  
  
We didn't do enough things tonight to prevent them from having the night that
they had. I thought in spurts we did some things, but over the course of the
ballgame we have to do a much better job defensively. But they played a very
good ballgame.  
  
Q. Bryant, as far as their length defensively, what are some of the
challenges of having to finish over that length?  
BRYANT CRAWFORD: Like you said, they had length, so when I drive, I either
have to adjust my shot or I had to find the next open guy.  
  
Q. Danny, I know it's early in the season, but after watching Vandy a
few times on film and playing them, how impressed are you with their team?
What sticks out the most?  
COACH MANNING: I think they do a lot of things exceptionally well. I don't
know if we'll see a better shooting team across the board. They returned four
guys that shot 40% from the three-point line last year. You know, they shot
the ball right at that average today. They were a little over 41%. So they're
a very good shooting basketball team, and they're a very good continuity, flow
type of offensive team. In order to have some success against them, you have
to be a little bit more disruptive than we were tonight defensively.  
  
When they're able to get into that flow offensively, they're certainly much
tougher to compete against because they do shoot the ball very well, and they
also pass it well.  
  
Q. Were you pleased with your team's effort and energy level throughout
the game?  
COACH MANNING: In spurts. But overall, no. Never pleased when you lose a game.
Hell, you're never pleased all the time when you win, but certainly when you
lose. We have to do a better job of coming back and playing after a win. We've
been in this situation now a couple times, and we haven't responded the way we
probably should have or the way that I would like. That's something that we
have to get better on.

INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=MAUI+JIM+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 24, 2015

  

### [Thomas Bryant](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=29871)

### [Tom Crean](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13756)

### [Yogi Ferrell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25209)

  
_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
Indiana - 83 St. John's - 73  
  
THE MODERATOR: We welcome Coach Crean, Yogi Ferrell and Thomas Bryant to the
media room. Coach, an opening statement?  
  
COACH CREAN: I thought for the fact that we played less than 24 hours
completely differently today was a great sign of the aptitude of our team, the
attitude of our team, and the desire of our team. I think that's how it played
out.  
  
We didn't play great. It wasn't always pretty. They made baskets. But it's not
going to be when you're playing against other competitive teams when you're in
this environment. But we played with great purpose. We went to a game plan
that really was where we needed to end the game yesterday, and we didn't end
it that way, but we came at it and established it right away.  
  
I thought Yogi and Rob did a fantastic job of getting the teams centered early
and Thomas did a great job of getting the team anchored. And then Collin and
Nick were all over the court. That's exactly what it has to be. Thomas came
out for a very young freshman, and after a tough day, one where he certainly
could have played a lot better, we all could have played a lot better. We all
could have done everything better. We came out and did a much, much better job
of that today.  
  
Offensively, defensively there are still things we've got to get better at.
We're the product right now on that front line of three very inexperienced
freshmen and a senior that's transferred in, and our deck is not stacked when
it comes to dealing with some of these other teams in low post defense and
isolation abilities and things like that. But we made enough adjustments and
these guys did a very good job with their teammates of playing with great
resolve today.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about how tough it is to get up and play a 9:00
a.m. basketball game?  
COACH CREAN: Well, I feel like we basically prepared for this, I'd say, just
playing AAU. AAU has games as early as 8:00 a.m. and you can play three or
four. So I feel like a bunch of us have done this before.  
  
It is a little bit tougher waking up, you're tired. But you've got to wake up
early, take a shower, eat right, get your mind focused for a 9:00 a.m. game.  
  
Q. Was the game plan to go down to you in the first few minutes? What
kind of adjustments did you make from yesterday's game?  
THOMAS BRYANT: The type of adjustments I made was just staying on the attack.
Just let the process go through and just play with my teammates and trust
Coach and all my teammates out there. I just know if I just keep playing, keep
running and posting up, that those guys will give me the ball, and they did.
Luckily, I made some moves and got some buckets in there and just took it from
there.  
  
Q. Yogi, Coach mentioned that you kind of centered this team after the
loss yesterday. What was the role of getting the team to regroup and
focused?  
YOGI FERRELL: We were upset with the loss yesterday, but we looked at this as
another opportunity for us to go out and show everybody what we're made of,
and I felt like we did that today. We showed a lot of toughness. It starts off
in the first half.  
  
Last game we played, we didn't start off with that mindset that we were going
to go out and try to beat these dudes. So I think that didn't transition over
into this game. I think this game we started off very well defensively and
offensively.  
  
Q. Yogi, just your thoughts on how you guys started getting up 15 and
then it was a fight the rest of the way. Was it fatigue? Was it something they
did? What happened in the last 25 minutes or so?  
YOGI FERRELL: Well, when they score on, I think it was six of the last eight
possessions in the first half, you can't have that for us. That's what we're
still working on to this day. It's a matter of us getting up, staying up. Just
kind of finding a way to keep that lead playing against such great competition
in this tournament.  
  
Teams can make runs, and when they make runs, you've got to find a way to stop
the bleeding.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for coach.  
  
Q. Coach, the start was really good. You got up 15 within 12 minutes and
then they really hung around and got it within four or five. What happened
that you guys weren't able to just kind of put the pedal down and put distance
there?  
COACH CREAN: I think they wanted to win. I think St. John's came to win as
well, and I think that's got a little bit to do with it. But in the scheme of
it, they're very good in the isolation game, and they found match-ups.  
  
This is new for Thomas, being in those type of situations. And Chris does an
excellent job, and he just kept finding match-ups that he wanted throughout
the game. We zoned some, but we haven't spent enough time on the zone to be a
good zone team, but we wanted to change it up a little bit.  
  
But he's got very good players, all right, and they're going to grow and
become a very good team. He's done an excellent job from the start of the
exhibition and now I think Chris has. And I just know him just a little bit,
but obviously what he did as a player and as an executive is going to transfer
to him as a coach. I don't think there is any question about that.  
  
But we were a little ruffled today. There is no question about that. It's been
a short turnaround. We didn't play that well. It's not like we went back and
hung around our rooms and played Call of Duty and 2K. And we've had hard
feelings. Bottom line, they came out and showed an edge and a level of
toughness today, and we had to compete. We'll get a lot better, especially on
the front line, as we get a better understanding of how to guard isolations.
We're giving up strength maybe and not necessarily size.  
  
But we also turned the ball over. They scored too many points off the
turnovers. But today, if it was going to be a 15-round fight, we wanted to
make sure we could be in it all 15 rounds, and I think that ended up happening
that way. It's not easy to win.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about the challenge of playing a basketball
game less than 18 hours or so after you're done with the last basketball
game?  
COACH CREAN: Well, I think you get times in your life, but you certainly get
times in your season, and this is one of them, where you can really look at it
as a measuring stick. The measuring stick for us is are we going to turn back
around and play, because I didn't like what I saw on the court yesterday, and
I liked it even less after I watched the film. They liked it even less after
they saw the film.  
  
So bottom line, it was about coming out with an edge. It wasn't like we were
going to put a lot of new things in. It wasn't about the Xs and Os and the
schemes as much as it was coming out with an edge and a resolve. Even though
we didn't play great throughout the 40 minutes, and they had something to do
with that as well. I thought we played very hard and competitive, and we had a
different level of urgency today than we did yesterday.  
  
Q. I know you don't want to put too much stock into starting lineups.
You always said you care more about who is on the floor at the end. But I
guess did you get at some level the response you were looking for from a
couple guys that were pulled out of that lineup, and a couple guys that went
into that lineup?  
COACH CREAN: We need to change the dynamic based on the way the game was
yesterday. In all honesty, there really wasn't -- it could have gone a lot of
different ways today. It wasn't like you look back.  
  
Collin did a nice job yesterday, but he only played 11 minutes because of the
foul trouble. But it wasn't like anybody that we would walk out of there
yesterday. None of us did a good enough job yesterday.  
  
So the bottom line becomes we're going to change the dynamic a little bit and
make sure that we understand that there's got to be certain standards that
have to be met, especially in the hustle game. Those are the type of things.
They weren't met yesterday, and hopefully they'll look like they've been met
today. That's why we made the changes.  
  
Again, if you're trying to build a two-deep team, then starting lineups to me
shouldn't matter as much. The competitiveness of what you bring day-in and
day-out should matter much more, and that's what we tried to utilize today.  
  
Q. What was the process of moving on from that loss in the hours after
that game yesterday? When you talked about going back to the hotel and not
playing video games and not really enjoying a trip to Hawaii, what was the
process of moving on? Do you guys practice?  
COACH CREAN: We had gym scheduled. We scheduled the practice late, but the
film session ended up being a little long. Fortunately we're on a break right
now, so we don't have to worry about the 20 hours and the 4 hours and things
like that. But we needed to get some points across. So really for me and for
the staff, it was dive into the films. I did the grades myself yesterday.  
  
Then getting into St. John's to a degree, but it was more about our team
understanding how much better we have to play. The flabbergasting news was
that we had just put 40 minutes together at a pretty high level against a
pretty good team on Thursday night, and I didn't want to overdo the fact that
we were only into four games, because at the end of the day we're only into
four games and it's still November.  
  
But the level of detail, the level of awareness, the level of effort and
hustle yesterday wasn't anywhere near where it needed to be. So that needed to
be addressed and it needed to be seen. Then we needed to fix some things, and
fortunately we have a very big ballroom over at the Hyatt. We're very thankful
that they moved us one day. It was almost like we had a full court in there.  
  
Q. To follow-up on that. As much as we've talked about this team having
more experience, did they see it without being told, kind of watching film,
running back through yesterday, what went wrong, what they did wrong? Was
there enough recognition without anybody having to point it out to them?  
COACH CREAN: We didn't have a lot of personal meetings, so I don't know. When
we really grow up, we'll have guys that will have already watched the film
before I get down there. That's not common. There are very, very, very few
players let alone programs that are going to have many players that are going
to look at it with a real critical trained eye.  
  
But, like I said, I didn't think we played well, and after I watched the film
I felt like we played worse. I gave us too much credit for having 16 good
minutes. We didn't. We got away from what was working. We got away from what
we needed to do, and we needed to grow up in a matter of hours.  
  
So an answer to your question, long story, short answer, I would imagine they
did because they came out and played with a different level. It wasn't all
coming out and playing hard for me. It was about coming out and playing hard
for each other and playing more competitively for each other. My job is to
make sure that I provide a level of accountability for them to live up to.

INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=MAUI+JIM+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 24, 2015

  

### [Eric Bovaird](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22849)

### [Kiran Shastri](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=27924)

### [Dantley Walker](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=29903)

  
_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
UNLV - 93 CHAMINADE - 73  
  
THE MODERATOR: We now welcome Chaminade to the media room, Coach Bovaird,
Dantley Walker and Kiran Shastri. We'll start with an opening statement from
coach.  
  
COACH BOVAIRD: I thought we played well through about 34 minutes of the game.
We had a bad six-minute stretch there in the middle of the second half with a
bunch of turnovers in a row, it led to easy baskets for them and that was the
difference in the game. For the most part, I thought we played right with them
for about 34 minutes.  
  
Q. Dantley, you know these guys pretty well. At halftime you had to be
encouraged by the way you played. Did you really believe you were going to
pull the upset at halftime?  
DANTLEY WALKER: Yeah, I think we came into the game knowing we had to play
well to win. But we were pretty confident that we had a chance to come out and
win in the second half.  
  
Q. Kiran, you guys took like 33 threes yesterday against Kansas. Today I
think you were a lot more selective and made your fair share of them. Was that
deliberate or just the way they were playing you guys?  
KIRAN SHASTRI: Yeah, I think the way UNLV played, they really wanted to stop
the three. They did a pretty good job of it, so it forced us to go to the hoop
a lot. But their goal was to stop the three. That's pretty much it.  
  
Q. To follow up on that, when you guys were up at halftime and, as coach
said, you were playing well into the second half. UNLV has a lot of athletes,
obviously. Why do you feel they broke your game open and the game got away
from you?  
DANTLEY WALKER: I think we had a couple turnovers. They got out a little bit.
Then they really hit the offensive boards well, and made a lot of second-
chance points in that stretch and kind of took the lead right there it felt
like.  
  
Q. For either of you guys, one more chance to pick up a win here in this
tournament tomorrow. How did you feel about St. John's and trying to get
something out here still?  
KIRAN SHASTRI: Yeah, we're really excited to play tomorrow. We're about to
watch some film on them. We'll get to know them well, and Coach will get us
well prepared for them, so we're excited for tomorrow.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Kiran. Questions for coach.  
  
Q. You guys obviously like to shoot the three. Can you just talk about
the 30-second clock new to this year? Does that help, hinder, change the plan
for you guys at all?  
COACH BOVAIRD: Well, not from previous years, but I imagine there are teams
that are looking to change a little bit of their philosophy because five
seconds is a long time. No coach really wants to get down to the last three
seconds of the shot clock and you're scrambling to try to force up a shot. So
our philosophy has always been we're trying to get a high percentage shot. It
doesn't matter how long it takes in the shot clock.  
  
In some games we get them really fast. In some games it takes a little bit
longer. But it's all about a high-percentage shot no matter how long it takes.  
  
Q. Was it just a case you felt like UNLV woke up in a stretch there in
the second half? Or did they have too many athletes and eventually that just
wore you down? What did you think?  
COACH BOVAIRD: We typically don't play against a lot of 6'6", 6'7" guys,
really long-arm-type of athletic guys. They were in the passing lanes.
Normally we can make those passes around the perimeter. But I think his name
is Jones and McCaw, and they are pretty long and athletic. They stole some
passes that don't normally get stolen in our level of play and that kind of
broke the game open. We turned the ball over in other ways too during that
stretch. But the turnovers were key.  
  
I'm not sure if it woke them up. I'm sure the dunk that Derrick Jones threw
down might have woken them up a little bit.  
  
Q. How would you say your team responded from yesterday's game to
today?  
COACH BOVAIRD: I thought they responded well. We knew going into the Kansas
game it was going to be a monumental effort for us to play with them. I looked
at them on film and I saw one of the best teams that I've ever coached
against. We've played the North Carolinas and Gonzagas, and UCLAs. I thought
this might be the best team we've ever gone against.  
  
So the carryover after getting basically blown out yesterday, the guys came
with a new passion to try to play today. I think that showed, especially in
the first half. I probably should have subbed a little bit quicker and earlier
in the second half. During the stretch I looked out there and our guys looked
a little winded. So I probably should have subbed quicker and a little bit
more frequent.  
  
Q. Coach, Sam Daly, who I know is a pretty big play maker for you guys,
picked up those three fouls in the first half. Maybe when he came back in the
second half, he might have been pressing a little bit. Did that hurt you
guys?  
COACH BOVAIRD: Yeah, without a doubt. He's been a good player for us. All the
three-point shooters we have, most of them rely on guys like Sam and David to
create shots for them. Sam's been really good for us and him picking up those
fouls definitely hurt us.  
  
Then I didn't start him in the second half because I was hoping I could use
him down the stretch and it would be a close game and we would have him at the
end was my game plan.  
  
I put him back in there and they started their run and he started pressing a
little bit and didn't play up to his capabilities.

# [MAUI JIM MAUI
INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=MAUI+JIM+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 24, 2015

  

### [Steve Alford](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17050)

### [Tony Parker](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13882)

  
_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
KANSAS - 92 UCLA - 73  
  
THE MODERATOR: We now welcome UCLA to the media room, Coach Alford and Tony
Parker. Coach, an opening statement?  
  
COACH ALFORD: Well, really tough first half. We haven't started either opening
half well at all since we've been here. Didn't think we started the game well
against UNLV and we didn't start the game well tonight.  
  
Give my guys credit at halftime. When you get knocked down, you either lay
there and wait until somebody picks you up or you show some character and some
toughness and some pride and do better. I thought in the second half we calmed
down offensively, and then we were able to put together some decent defensive
stops.  
  
But that's a very, very good basketball team. Definitely a top 5 team in the
country. If we play poorly in a 20-minute stretch against that, it's going to
be hard on us, and that's happened tonight.  
  
Q. What about that first half was toughest on you guys and trying to
rally from that deficit?  
TONY PARKER: Getting into an offense. Staying level headed. We took a lot of
tough shots. I didn't notice the double team as quick as I should have. We
just took a lot of tough shots. As a team, we've got to make adjustments
quick.  
  
Going in, we knew they were a really, really good team, and they played well
defensively, and that's what they hang their hat on. So we have to get great
shots. You have to get good shots to beat a team like that. We didn't take
good enough shots and we didn't get enough stops down the stretch for the way
we were shooting to even continue.  
  
Q. How much did their defense on Bryce frustrate him?  
COACH ALFORD: I thought they did a really good job. I think Bryce looked a
little tired with what happened yesterday, and I fully understand that. It's
not easy. He'll learn from that.  
  
But you've got to give Kansas an awful lot of credit. They switched some
people on him. I think Graham to start with, and then came with a bigger
Selden. That's different. There are not a lot of guys at 6'5", 6'6" that are
checking him that can defend like Selden did, and I thought he did a really
good job on him.  
  
But I thought all in all we got some good guards. I thought Isaac got going a
little bit, which we need to do. I'm sure Bryce will bounce back, if I know
him. I think I know him pretty well. But just like everybody, different games
people have to learn lessons, and I think he'll learn lessons after he watches
this tape.  
  
Q. What makes KU's guard so difficult to go up against?  
COACH ALFORD: Well, it's a very athletic team. Very deep team, and they can
shoot the basketball. Ten threes again tonight. 15, I think, last night. We  
  
had some breakdowns defensively, but to score 59 points in the half, you're
doing a lot of good things because your offense is clicking. Had five or six
guys that make threes and their guards do a very good job. Graham and Mason
are very quick. Really good decision making. You've got Mason, seven assists,
no turnovers; Graham, three assists and one turnover. They do a good job of
dictating the pace. They can play at a really, really high-level pace.  
  
We're not to the point where we can play at that pace. I think we got caught
up playing their pace in the first half. The pace got more to our liking in
the second half, and that's a credit to their guards.

INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=MAUI+JIM+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 23, 2015

  

### [Kevin Stallings](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13784)

  
_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
Vanderbilt 92 St. John's 55  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Stallings, an opening statement?  
  
COACH STALLINGS: I thought our guys came out with a lot of intensity and
purpose at the beginning of the game. The way we played the first, probably,
10 or 12 minutes of the game, I think, set the tone.  
  
We were a little disappointed in our play last time out on Thursday night, and
I think our guys wanted to atone for that.  
  
We also recognized that we caught St. John's in a short-handed situation. They
were without a couple of guys that are usually available to them, and we
certainly acknowledge that. But I thought our guys played very, very well, and
I was pleased with our play on both ends.  
  
Q. Luke, you had seven rebounds again today what’s been the difference
for you this year as far as rebounding the basketball a bit more?  
LUKE KORNET: I think a lot of it was just the mentality. Just every single day
trying to be bit of a more physical presence around the goal, and definitely
it helps when I had the whole off-season to improve my body and stuff like
that. I think most of it though is really trying to be a presence with
blocking shots and rebounding. It's all kind of the same thing and all about
my mental approach for the game.  
  
Q. Nolan, what was different for you today?  
NOLAN CRESSLER: I think my approach was better. Yesterday I got a couple extra
shots after practice and what not. Got with Coach Richardson, one of our
assistants, and I just think my preparation was better, and when my name was
called, I stepped in and made a couple.  
  
Q. You guys shot almost 53% from three. What do you think it was
today?  
NOLAN CRESSLER: Some days they go in a lot more. We've got a team full of
great shooters. I think we just executed and we were excited to play. I think
our preparation was great. We've been working hard all week, and I think if we
do that, the ball just goes in.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Stallings.  
  
Q. Did you guys imagine you would win by this much? Just the margin of
the victory?  
COACH STALLINGS: I don't think you ever anticipate winning. I told Chris, and
I meant this, their team has really, really, really improved, and I know that
that may sound a little weird, but from where they were after their first
exhibition game to where they were after their last game where they beat
Rutgers, their team has shown a tremendous amount of improvement.  
  
So, no, I did not anticipate that the final margin would be the way it was. I
was just pleased with the way that we approached the game and the way we
played. We're always pretty good about sharing the ball. You asked about us
shooting 53% from three, and honestly we're not a 53% three-point shooting
team. But there are lots of days we shoot over 50% if you count practice. Our
team can make them on most days. Some days you don't, but a lot of days we do.
So that's not a surprise to us, because we do have a team, as Nolan said, full
of guys that can make them.  
  
Q. Coach, no player with more than 25 minutes. How big was it the first
game of the back-to-back-to-back to be able to limit minutes?  
COACH STALLINGS: When we got the lead, certainly that was something that was
in the back of my mind. Damian only played five minutes in the first half. I
wanted to give him time in the second half. He picked up a couple more fouls,
and I took him out. I didn't have to, but I took him out. But we wanted to
limit minutes.  
  
Luke had 17 in the first half. I think Riley had 15 or 17, and I wanted to
shorten those up guys up in the second half given the lead that we had.
Because, again, three games in three days is a challenge, especially against
this quality of competition.  
  
Q. Just wanted to get your thoughts on Damian Jones. He's playing well
for you guys. He's mentioned as somebody who clearly has a pro potential,
sooner rather than later, most likely. What makes him so good? What's gotten
him from where he was when you got him to where he is now?  
COACH STALLINGS: I think a couple things. First of all, Damian certainly did
not have a Damian-like day, which probably makes this even better for us that
he didn't play anything close to what he normally gives us. Again, he only
played five minutes in the first half. You can't produce if you're not on the
court.  
  
But to answer your question, he's every bit of 6'11". If he's not the fastest
guy on our team, he's the second fastest guy on our team. He can run and jump
and change directions with the grace and the skill of a 6'2" really athletic
guard. Because of his own work and how hard he's worked since we've gotten
him, and hopefully some of it has to do with the way we develop guys, but you
saw that left-handed jump hook. That's pretty impressive. You saw the right-
handed jump hook, and it wouldn't surprise me at all for him to jump up and
take and make a three-point shot.  
  
So he's just really worked hard on his skill level, and there are times when
more of it shows up than others. Like today was a little bit less than other
times. But Damian is a great kid. Probably too nice sometimes, and he's
playing with a little more fire this year which has really been good for us,
and a little more intensity and tenacity.  
  
We won't do in this tournament what we were hoping to do if he doesn't step up
and kind of become the lead player in the band, because he's our guy. Our guys
know it, and he knows it. But he did what he had to do today. He didn't have
to do as much.  
  
But I would, again, long answer to a short question, his work ethic has been
the biggest thing, but he's been blessed with a great body, and a great amount
of athleticism.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you for your time, coach.

_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
Kansas - 123 Chaminade - 72  
  
THE MODERATOR: We now welcome Kansas to the interview room.  
  
Q. Was that the response you guys needed after Michigan State?  
LANDEN LUCAS: Yeah, I think so. I feel like defensively we have a lot to work
on. But it was nice to at least get some guys' confidence back. So I think a
couple guys on our team could definitely have used that game offensively.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Landen.  
  
Q. Svi, what was the key in setting your career high for threes
tonight?  
SVIATOSLAV MYKHAILIUK: You know, probably I think because of my teammates
Frank, Devonte' and everybody else was driving the balls really good, and I
was able to just make some shots.  
  
Q. Svi, it seemed you were shooting the ball with a lot of confidence
tonight. Were there nights that you feel like maybe every ball was going in
the basket?  
SVIATOSLAV MYKHAILIUK: You know, like I said, if it's an open look, it's a
pretty easy shot, so I just need to make that.  
  
Q. Landen, what did you think of Svi's threes and your team's offense
tonight?  
LANDEN LUCAS: I think people have a got rhythm back offensively, shot the ball
well. They were playing a defense we really haven't seen, so it was good for
us to kind of get out there, make some shots, and good to see Svi and some
other shooters get some confidence going. So offensively I think we got a lot
of confidence back in this game.  
  
Q. Svi, what did you think of Chaminade, and what was the key to pulling
away so early?  
SVIATOSLAV MYKHAILIUK: We were talking about them, and we know they're a
pretty good team. They shoot a lot of threes and they're driving the ball very
good. We just try to play defense, but it was not very good in the first half,
so I think we need to get better than this.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Now an opening statement from Coach Self?  
  
COACH SELF: Obviously, we made shots, and everything looks better when you
make shots.  
  
Chaminade's the type of team that if they get comfortable and score the ball
well early, which they actually did against us, it gives them confidence and
they can certainly hang around.  
  
I thought that obviously our offense was good enough to keep them at arm's
distance, and then we started guarding them a little bit better as the game
wore on.  
  
Q. I don't know how much you can say about this, but could you comment
at all on the Diallo situation with the letter that came out today?  
COACH SELF: Did something come out today? I didn't see anything today that
came out. Only thing I know, and I've commented the last couple of days and I
guess I can comment again. The only thing I know is I think our athletic
director was contacted today that they're working on it. So that's all I know
concerning that situation.  
  
Q. At this point as the frustration continues to mount, how disappointed
are you that maybe some people higher up at the NCAA, and the NCAA's
leadership, people above the investigators, I guess, haven't stepped in and
tried to expedite this process?  
COACH SELF: Well, I don't know exactly how policy works and how legislation
works, or who oversees what and who oversees the overseers. I don't have any
idea. It is disappointing that no one's stepped up to the plate so far.  
  
The thing about it is, if you talk from a macro level, from 30,000 feet, it's
frustrating and it's very hypocritical, I think of coaches and myself to say,
well, it's the leadership's problem. Because everybody that works in the
organization, the higher ups in the organization, hire people and has policies
in place under them that people are supposed to definitely work towards and to
fulfill the obligations of whatever job responsibility is. So that's what's
frustrating. Because I can't say it's leadership, because that would be
hypocritical because I don't think it's the coaches' faults, totally, when
somebody in the academic department or training department or the weight room
or what not commits a violation. The head coach is totally responsible for
that because the head coach, we do what we can to oversee, but you have people
underneath you or people that work in the same organization that may not carry
out the assignment the way it was designed to carry out.  
  
So I don't fault any blame with leadership, because if I did, and if it was
the coaches' fault -- blame in that, then the way we feel about how coaches
are being talked about and how we're responsible when we do everything we can
to make sure negative things don't happen, but we're still responsible for a
tutor in the academic department that we've never met. I think that would be
very hypocritical to say that it's all leadership's fault.  
  
I think the bottom line is there are some flaws in policies and certainly the
lack of partnership, I think is the thing that's most frustrating with
anything else with Cheick.  
  
Q. How would you rate your offense tonight and what was the key to
blowing the game open?  
COACH SELF: When you make shots, you've got a chance to score a lot of points,
and we've scored a lot of points. We were decent in transition. But I don't
know if our offense was great when you have a big size advantage and you can
throw it inside and have a 6'9" score against a 6'4, 6'5". You should get some
easy baskets.  
  
But I think we got the ball in good places tonight, so hopefully we can
continue to do that.  
  
Q. Were you pretty pleased, with that said, about the response coming
off of Michigan State, just how hard you guys played and with intensity?  
COACH SELF: Yeah, I guess we played pretty hard. We didn't seem like we
guarded very well for a good part of the game. But that's one thing with our
guys normally. There are always exceptions, but we usually do play pretty hard
and compete pretty hard and play with pretty good energy. Certainly the reason
we lost to Michigan State didn't have anything to do with those three things.
We just didn't close, and they played better down the stretch.  
  
But if you call it an answer, it was good to get back on the winning track.
But certainly we know -- I don't want to sound negative towards Chaminade, but
we knew coming in if we played well, we had a size factor, a size advantage
and depth advantage and things like that.  
  
But moving forward now every game the next two nights is going to be very
difficult.  
  
Q. I think you guys shot 29 threes tonight, and I know some of it was
the way they guarded you guys, but is that a number you're comfortable with? I
guess if teams are giving you, do you like this team shooting that many
threes?  
COACH SELF: That is a lot of threes for us. Instead of looking at how many
threes you shoot, you look at what percentage of the threes you shot. If
there's 80 shots and you shoot 25, that seems like a lot, but maybe not as
many if you shoot 18. There's only 50 shots. So I think you should look at
percentage. But I don't know exactly what that is. That would probably be
around 38% or so like that. So that is a lot of threes.  
  
But when a team plays zone, naturally you're probably going to shoot more
threes.  
  
Q. What did you think of Svi's game tonight, and Selden?  
COACH SELF: Well, I thought -- winning is a huge key to our team. I thought
Wayne did some nice things. Had a couple of bad basketball plays, but I
thought he played very well. Of course he made a couple of shots, which is
always good to see, which sets up driving for him.  
  
But I thought Svi was pretty good. We need Svi to be aggressive, especially
over here, because we're not playing with near as much depth on the perimeter.
So we need him to be one of our key players and one of our go-to guys, and he
was tonight.  
  
Q. Just going into the rest of the tournament, what do you think is
going to be the key for you guys in coming out with the championship?  
COACH SELF: Well, we've got to guard better, and we certainly can't foul like
we did. Whenever the other team is in the bonus with 15 left or whatever it
is, 14 left, you play defensive while you're on defense. You play not to foul
as opposed to play to guard.  
  
So we've got to do a better job of guarding the ball and certainly keeping
teams off the free-throw line and not putting us in a situation where we can't
be aggressive. I think that's as much of a key for us as anything else.  
  
Then, you know, you've got to make shots. When you can run bad offense and
come away with three points, that's a huge advantage. Certainly there were
several times tonight we didn't run great offense or anything, but we were
able to come away with baskets because guys stepped up and made plays.

## November 23, 2015

  

### [Dave Rice](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23393)

### [Patrick McCaw](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=29899)

### [Stephen Zimmerman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=29900)

  
_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
UCLA - 77 UNLV - 75  
  
THE MODERATOR: We welcome UNLV to the media room. Coach Rice, Steve Zimmerman,
and Patrick McCaw. Coach, an opening statement?  
  
COACH RICE: First of all, congratulations to UCLA. It was a great college
basketball game.  
  
We've got a team that's very disappointed with the outcome. We played hard for
the entire game. We just went through some stretches where we didn't execute
as well as we needed to execute against their zone. Got off to a great start
in the first half. Game changed when they went zone. We've got to continue to
play inside out and continue to plan attack. We forced 19 turnovers.  
  
Their guards, they had three point guards and their guards had 13 turnovers in
the game. We just had to continue to convert. We talk about it all the time as
a group. We've got to bounce back. What is our response going to be to this
kind of adversity.  
  
We've got a game in 14 hours, we've got to be ready to play. It's one play
here, one play there in a two-point game, an offensive rebound we give up, a
free throw we don't make, extra pass we don't make, a turnover. Whatever it
may be, that is the difference in going home extremely happy, like UCLA is, or
going home disappointed.  
  
We've got a resilient group. We're going to bounce back and come back
tomorrow. Very important game tomorrow in terms of our response. Continue to
get better. We knew it was going to be a tremendous challenge, three games in
three days, and the next challenge is bouncing back from a very difficult
loss.  
  
Q. Zim, just how sick are you, and how much of an impact do you think it
had on your play tonight?  
STEPHEN ZIMMERMAN: Oh, that's a hard one. I'm not super sick. I'm good enough
to try to create for my team and produce. I don't think it affected me that
much. I just needed a couple breathers here and there, and Coach Rice made
sure to get me out and put me right back in.  
  
Q. Pat, Dave kind of mentioned when they go zone and the ball just
doesn't get inside, is it frustrating to have kind of that same thing kind of
keep being an issue for you guys?  
PATRICK McCAW: Yes, it's tough sometimes when we can't get the ball in the
middle, and we're just sitting in hold on the perimeter, and we don't let our
big guys execute where we can get in the middle. It's tough. Then we are
forced to take the last second shots. But we had some opportunities where we
were going to go out in the middle. But I think we played well and we
executed, we just came up short tonight.  
  
Q. Patrick, you guys took the lead late and you had the momentum in that
game. Can you kind of assess how you feel about this team coming out of this
game and the way you guys played tonight? Because you had your opportunities
to win?  
PATRICK McCAW: Well, I feel very confident about this team. We're very deep.
We've got a lot of confident guys and great coaching staff. We executed. We
showed that we're a great team. We're just going to get ready and prepare for
tomorrow's game.  
  
Q. Patrick, can you talk about the pace a little bit? It seemed like an
up and down basketball game?  
PATRICK McCAW: The pace, that's how we want to play. Get out and run. Coach
Rice sells the press defense, and I think that we caused turnovers tonight.
That helps us, when we get out and run, we're very special. Guys can run, and
that's how we want to play.  
  
Yeah, it was a very up and down game. That's what we wanted. We wanted to
instill in our defense that we can trap and force turnovers.  
  
Q. Stephen, how much did that crowd kind of affect you guys there? It
seemed like in the second half, when you made the run and took the lead, you
guys were really trying to use them to your advantage.  
STEPHEN ZIMMERMAN: Yeah, it was great to have a crowd like that, especially
not at home. We definitely tried to feed off the energy, like Pat was saying.
We tried to run up and down. And we have an athletic team so that helps out
and we definitely feed into the crowd.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for coach.  
  
Q. 29 free throws, I don't know if you'd be happy with that. A lot of
them seemed rushed.  
COACH RICE: Three point shots?  
  
Q. Yes, 29 threes. It seemed in the last ten minutes, they were just
rushed or just ill advised. Is that where you think it got away? Even though
they did make 23, 24 free throws.  
COACH RICE: Yeah, we have to continue to attack inside out whether we're
playing against man to man or we're playing against zone. Having said that,
the reason they went zone was they couldn't guard us on the interior, and they
couldn't guard our dribble penetration so they went zone. We can't settle,
though. We've to continue to attack the same way.  
  
Part of the reason we went zone was to force the shooting from the outside. So
we can't settle. We have to make the extra pass. But no doubt playing inside
out is the key, and we got an opportunity. And we'll probably see a lot of
zones tomorrow against Chaminade.  
  
Q. Between the start to the game and then kind of that stretch, I don't
know, 16 to 8, is that because it's the best you've seen of this team or sort
of what it's supposed to look like when it's going?  
COACH RICE: Well, I'm proud of our group. Like you said, we forced a very good
ball handling team. UCLA started with 19 turnovers, and we've scored 23 points
off of their turnovers. We have flashes of what we're going to be, and we knew
it was going to be a challenge.  
  
For large portions of that game, we played terrific basketball. We've got to
convert free throws. We go to the free throw line 22 times. To get momentum,
we've got to get to the free-throw line and make free throws. Because that
helps to sets our press when there is a dead ball and a free throw make.  
  
We'll quick bounce back, play in about 14 hours. And told the team from day
one, how we want to be judged, what is our response to success, or what is our
response, in this case, to adversity and it's certainly an adverse situation.
We have a disappointed team that was right there, and just did not quite get
the game finished up the right way.

INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=MAUI+JIM+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 23, 2015

  

### [Chris Mullin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16805)

  
_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
Vanderbilt 92 St. John's 55  
  
Q. I was just wondering, with a game like this, where do you go from
here as a player?  
DURAND JOHNSON: You know, we've just got to move on. It was a tough loss.
Didn't go the way we wanted. But we've got to bounce back tomorrow and come
out and compete and we've got to move forward.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Mullin?  
  
Q. Chris, I know you could have never imagined a game like this, but how
do you come back? What do you tell the guys after the game? How do you bounce
back from something like this?  
COACH MULLIN: Well, we have to learn from it. We'll look at some film tonight.
You know, their size, obviously, was a big factor. We've been preaching taking
care of the ball. Actually, we had eight turnovers, and that is the best we've
taken care of the ball. In our first three games, we've been down 10 to 15
field goal attempts.  
  
So tonight we were right there, 62 shots to 60. But I thought their length,
trying to finish above their length was a problem. For a lot of these guys,
their size, that's the first time they saw that.  
  
But as far as what do we do? We come back tomorrow and play hard. I thought a
little bit on missed shots, shooting 30% had an impact on our effort, which
hadn't up until now. So we have to bounce back tomorrow, compete, and move on.
I think we'll get together tonight and talk about it. But to me, it's not what
happens, it's how you react to it. So we all go through different things, and
we lost the game, so we'll move on. And how we come back tomorrow is more
important than what just happened. What happened is over now. How we react on
to it is what we're going to focus on.  
  
Q. Coach, they went on a 9-0 run to start the game. Did you think their
defensive intensity threw off your team's offense in any way?  
COACH MULLIN: I think their length is what bothered us. I thought -- first of
all, they're a really good team. They're going to be a team to reckon with, I
think, late. You'll be hearing from them a lot. They've got shooters. They
play well together, they unselfish, they move it. With that size and length,
they can protect the rim, so they're a really, really good team.  
  
Well-coached, Kevin's a great coach. Their offense -- our defense wasn't as
good as it's been, but they're the best team we've played. So to try to
compare would not be appropriate. But, again, for us to have 60 shots and them
have 62 and have eight turnovers, looking at the quality -- we got some decent
looks, we just didn't finish them. So I don't think there is much more to
that. Team shoots 53%, you shoot 30%, you're going to lose.  
  
Q. For you as a coach in this tournament, what are you learning in this
tournament? I know this is just one game.  
COACH MULLIN: Besides the outcome, it's going to be a learning experience
across the board in each and every game we play. Then quite frankly for us, we
want to get out of here and not have anyone else get hurt. We have enough guys
sitting in street clothes. So managing our effort and then managing physically
how we approach the game.  
  
But for a team like ours that's all brand-new, it doesn't matter if we're in
Maui. Every experience is going to be a learning experience for us.

## November 23, 2015

  

### [Danny Manning](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23674)

### [Bryant Crawford](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=29895)

### [Devin Thomas](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25010)

  
_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
WAKE FOREST - 82 INDIANA - 78  
  
THE MODERATOR: We now welcome Devin Thomas and Bryant Crawford to the media
room. Let's start with questions for the players.  
  
Q. Bryant, can you just talk about the final play where you scored the
go-ahead?  
BRYANT CRAWFORD: When we got into timeout, Coach drew up a play for Tinos
(Konstantinos) to come and set a fake bust screen and for Devin to clean it
up. He just told me get to the hole, and that's what I did.  
  
Q. Devin, you guys obviously got a lot of points in the paint and you
were able to get drives to the lane repeatedly and you were able to score on
Thomas Bryant. Why did you guys feel that would work, and why do you think it
did work so well throughout the game?  
DEVIN THOMAS: Just the offense we have. If we're patient and we trust the
offense, we can get any shot that we want in our offense. I think in the
beginning of the second half we weren't patient on offense, and I think we got
a little too fast, and that's how they got their fast breakpoints and pulled
away a little bit. But we settled down. Kept being aggressive, driving to the
hole. If we weren't finishing our lay-ups, Tinos, a lot of our bigs were
cleaning it up, and I think that's how we got ourselves back in the game and
pulled it out in the end.  
  
Q. Talk about Tinos' contributions in the first half, and how it kind of
gave the team overall confidence?  
COACH MANNING: Well, Tinos for us, last year was one of my better three-point
shooters, and he's the true definition of a stretch four, a post guy that can
step out on the floor and make jump shots.  
  
Tonight, he carried us in that first half. He didn't score in the second half,
but the work that he put in in the first half and having his presence out
there on the court, the defense has to account for him, which opens up more
driving lanes.  
  
Indiana does a really good job of keeping the ball out of the paint, and we
had some really good ball movement plays later on in the second half where we
were able to get into the paint and score. But for us, we want to play inside
out, and that's something we work on each and every day. This afternoon it
worked for us.  
  
Q. I think you guys had strong rebounding games in pretty much every
game so far this year. How much do you feel like that's part of your team
identity, and how much does it play into the win tonight?  
DEVIN THOMAS: We stress that a lot in our philosophy and coach's philosophy,
trying to win the rebound war. Trying to win the fast break, second chance, a
lot of those little details. Tinos does a great job rebounding. J.C. does a
great job rebounding. I think our guards do a great job rebounding, and it's a
team effort, and I think that's why we're so successful at rebounding.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Devin.  
  
Q. Devin, talk about the last play that Indiana had with 3.2 seconds.
They kind of went for broke and went for that touchdown pass. Did that play
surprise you in the end trailing only by two points?  
DEVIN THOMAS: Not really. I think you said they had three seconds to get the
ball up. We kind of played back, expecting it. Luckily, No. 30 for Indiana
kind of threw it in my area. I didn't do a good job of catching the ball. It
got knocked out of my hands. But thank Jesus that John Collins was there to
save me and make me look good in the end.  
  
Q. Bryant, could you give me your thoughts on the way Devin played and
particularly his ability to drive against Thomas Bryant and how he used front
court tonight?  
BRYANT CRAWFORD: Like Devin said, we were trying to work inside out, and early
on things weren't falling for all of us, but Devin always brings energy, and
when I started to realize how he was kind of dominating the paint, I told him
nobody can stop you in there. And I kept going into him, and he was going in
there strong, finishing like he normally does.  
  
Q. You guys had 50 points in the first half, and you were shooting
light's out, 58 and 59%. Then in the second half it started slowly. I think
you had like 19 or 20 points through the first 15 minutes. What was the
difference? Were they doing anything different? What was the difference in the
first part of the second half?  
DEVIN THOMAS: Like I said earlier, we were rushing the offense. One pass, one
shot, we were turning the ball over, just little things like that. We settled
down the last eight, nine minutes of the game, trusted the offense.  
  
Coach did a great job of putting us in situations to be successful and score,
and we just came together and got the stops that we needed at the end, and it
just feels good.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Devin. Questions for Coach Manning.  
  
Q. Coach, you guys are making your Maui debut today. What overall
impression do you feel like you made in your first trip out here?  
COACH MANNING: I think whenever you have the opportunity to come to a
tournament like this, I think basketball-wise, it's always a great experience.
You're always going to play quality opponents in record fashion in terms of
three games in three days. So you have to prepare for that. For us, we want to
come out and we want to work hard.  
  
This is the second year that we've been together as a group, and we want to
continue to build and try to get better with each practice and each game.  
  
Indiana is a very, very good basketball team, and we all know that. They
probably missed some shots they'd normally make. But when they get the ball
out in transition, I think their back court is one of the better back courts
in the country, to be honest with you. I think Yogi is terrific, Blackmon's
really, really good, and Troy puts so much pressure on you with that dribble
penetration and getting into the paint. Then they've got shooters around and
they share the basketball, so that's a talented team.  
  
But for us, we won our first game. We get to advance on the championship side
of the bracket. That's what it means. We've got to get ready to play another
tough team tomorrow and go from there. There's not a lot of time for
celebrating, to be honest with you. We told the guys, great win, way to fight,
way to grind it out, way enjoy it, for the short ride to the hotel. Once we
hit the hotel property, we've got to start thinking about tomorrow.  
  
Q. Coach, turnovers seemed to be the Achilles heel of your squad. It
didn't seem to hurt you as much, though you did have 17 to their 14. Can you
talk about just handling the ball and the turnover situation overall? There
were a lot that didn't really hurt your club today?  
COACH MANNING: That's your opinion. I think it hurt us a lot. We turned the
ball over enough for them to score 19 points off of our turnovers, and that
number has to go down. We're throwing a lot at our freshman point guard,
Bryant Crawford. He made a big shot for us down the stretch, but he has to do
a better job of securing the basketball and making easy plays throughout the
course of the ballgame.  
  
For us, we can't go out and try to make home run plays. We just have to make
-- we use the baseball analogy a lot. We want to get a single, a hit by a
pitch, we want to steal a base. We're not up there trying to swing for the
fences. That's not who we are. We want a series of good, easy plays which
makes a great series. We're far from that, but we were a little better tonight
in certain stretches during the game.  
  
Q. You guys obviously got a lot of points in the paint, but a lot of
them came on drives. Why do you think that was successful, and was it clearly
part of your plan to go at Thomas Bryant and those guys?  
COACH MANNING: Well, we're going to go at whoever we play. That's our mindset.
That's Indiana's mindset. That's all basketball teams' in the country's
mindset. And tonight things just worked out for us down the stretch.  
  
I think Devin Thomas does a really good job catching the basketball and
putting pressure on his defender when he's attacking the rim, and he was able
to do that. Our guards were able to turn the corner and get into the paint.  
  
I thought we did a really good job of keeping balls alive for offensive
second-chance points. That's a category we stress day-in and day-out. Second
chance opportunities. We want to score points in the paint. We want to get out
and score points in the fast break setting. It's very hard to score against
any team once they have their half court defense set.  
  
Q. Last year you had so many close games against top 10 teams and you
were right there. How much did that help you win a game like today?  
COACH MANNING: Well, hopefully I think it had some type of impact on our guys,
especially the guys that have been in our program for a while. It does you no
good to have a moral victory, so to speak. So being able to, for us, break
through in the situation we were in last year and come out on top, hopefully
will give us more confidence in what we're doing and help us down the road.  
  
This is a game -- this is like an ACC, regular season game. Indiana is one of
the best teams in the country. For us to get the win in the fashion that we
did with having to grind it out late and guys had to make plays, that's
something we can lean on down the stretch in the ACC play.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about the final play? What you guys talked about in
the timeout? What was the idea for Bryant to get to the basket or whatever,
whatever the plan was?  
COACH MANNING: We had Bryant bringing the ball up the court. Tinos shot the
ball exceptionally well in the first half, so we had him come up and set kind
of a brush pick, kind of a slip out of a ball screen, if you will. And then we
had DT clean it up.  
  
End of a ballgame like that, most of the time, Dino's man is going to stay
attached to him. And DT was able to get a good pick on Bryant's man, and
Bryant was able to turn the corner and get to the rim and finish. It was a
great play by Bryant to get in there and find the seam and score. But that was
kind of the look that we were going for, and we're fortunate enough for it to
work.

INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=MAUI+JIM+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 23, 2015

  

### [Tom Crean](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13756)

### [Robert Johnson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=27877)

### [Max Bielfeldt](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=29827)

  
_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
WAKE FOREST - 82 INDIANA - 78  
  
THE MODERATOR: We now welcome Max Bielfeldt and Robert Johnson to the
interview room.  
  
Q. I guess for either of you, but Max, maybe for you, you guys are up
nine there. You kind of had them back on their heels and then I guess what
happened after that?  
MAX BIELFELDT: Yeah, we got a little bit of a run there. Just didn't execute.
That was the point we tried to emphasize all year. Unfortunately, it came up
again where we get those runs going in that eight-minute span, and we have to
beat a team that pushes that out.  
  
It's tough to say exactly what happened, but I think just being able to come
together and run our offense to perfection at that point is really what we
need to do.  
  
Q. Robert, I know defense has a lot of components to it. But they were
able to drive on you, got inside a lot, 50-something points in paint. What was
the issue on the perimeter defense and not being able to stop the drives?  
ROBERT JOHNSON: I think it came from, first off, a lack of communication, that
was a big part of it. And second thing, I'd just say a mindset. For myself and
everybody else we've got to continue to build a defensive mindset that we're
going to go out there and stop you.  
  
Q. Max, with 3.2 seconds, Collin had the ball out of bounds. What was
the plan there and what went wrong with that play?  
MAX BIELFELDT: The plan was to throw it to me and find someone cutting. They
threw it up and had a lot of hands in there for that long pass, and it just
didn't quite work out as we wanted it to.  
  
Q. For either of you, they were really the aggressor from, it seemed,
the outset. Were you surprised by the way they came out pushing?  
MAX BIELFELDT: No, I mean, we knew they were going to be a physical team and
it was going to be a test of our physicality as well. Just a lot of those
rebounds kind of came off short and they used their physicality to push us
under the basket. And we've got to adjust to that and get better and not let
that happen again.  
  
Q. I guess just to follow up on that, at some level do you feel like
there was maybe just y'all not being able to match them physically,
particularly in that rebounding game? Not that you couldn't, but you weren't
able to get that up today?  
MAX BIELFELDT: I think today stats show that we didn't, but I think we had the
potential to. I think developing some of these younger guys and really
embracing the physicality can really push us to that next level.  
  
Today we learned a hard lesson and we're going to learn from it and do
everything we can to next time we see a team like that, that we're going to
embrace it and push back as much as we can and hopefully do the same thing to
them.  
  
Q. Max, how stunned are you that you're playing in the loser's bracket
and not the winner's bracket come tomorrow?  
MAX BIELFELDT: It obviously wasn't something we planned for. We were hoping to
go all the way, and the first obstacle is tough because it just didn't go our
way today.  
  
Wake Forest is a great team though. They've got some really good players and
they capitalized on some of our weaknesses, so you've got to give them credit
there. But we feel as a team we could have played better and done more things
offensively and defensively to make this a game we could have won.  
  
Q. Max, give me your take on all their points in the paint. It was 52
for the game. All the penetrations, Devin getting inside. What wasn't working
for you guys?  
MAX BIELFELDT: I'd have to go back and watch the film, but from what I saw,
they crashed a lot of guys to the paint and they've got those 50-50 balls. We
were sometimes turning our head to look at the basket and wait for the rebound
instead of going to find the man and hit him out and clear out some space. We
kind of resorted to some bad habits there.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, your opening thoughts on today's game?  
  
COACH CREAN: Wake Forest deserved to win because they played a better game for
a longer period of time, and it's hard to beat anybody when you play 15, 16
solid minutes, and that's what we did. From the start of the second half to
where we got up 7 or 9, we were playing very well.  
  
In the first half we weren't as committed to what we needed to do with moving
the ball at an accurate rate, and we were not as committed as we needed to be
on the glass, and we weren't hitting anybody, which was disappointing. We were
trying different guys in that situation.  
  
But in the second half, we played like a team that's really capable for about
16 minutes, and then we had some costly turnovers. We had some quick shots. We
got away from what we needed to do, and we gave up the dribble too much, and
we're not going to beat anybody with 16 good minutes, especially when you come
to Maui. So we've got to turn around and get ready here in a hurry.  
  
Highly disappointed in some of our efforts, and disappointed in some of the
toughness, and disappointed in myself and some of the substitutions, and we'll
go back and look at the film and make some decisions from there.  
  
But we can't -- Troy Williams can't play 36 minutes and get no offensive
rebounds. He can't do that. And we can't be a non-factor. This team
outrebounded people by 18, they outrebounded us by 14. In the second half they
didn't, but those stats are a little skewed for us, because in the first 16
minutes or so in that half -- no, I guess the first 14 minutes of that half,
14, 15, we were really good, and then we weren't so good. We lost this game on
offense as much as we did on defense. They made the big plays, and we didn't
guard Thomas the right way.  
  
Still waiting for one of our guys to remember that we're supposed to take away
his left-hand, and we let Bryant have too much room to penetrate. We did not
guard him well at the last play, on the ball or even with the help.  
  
Q. Forgive me for being a little blunt, but you talked about those
turnovers and bad shots. How concerning is it to you that it seemed like it
was the more experienced guys that were committing some of those mistakes in
the last four minutes?  
COACH CREAN: I'm going to blame myself. Because if we're not going to be able
to play and read the flow of the game and try to make things that aren't
there, then we're going to have to play much slower and much more half-court
oriented offense. So I'll blame me. But it's not good. So that's what we have
to look at.  
  
But we want to play with great freedom, but we don't want to play reckless.
Again, just disappointed, big-time, that we got away from what was working.
Because we had momentum going at such a high rate. As well as they played,
when they made offensive plays, I think we hurt ourselves as much with half-
court basketball offensively as much as they did defend us well at the end.
And they deserve the credit. They played a great game.  
  
They beat us at their strengths, and for a while we were taking away their
strengths and playing to our strengths, and we got away from our strengths and
we let them have their strengths back, and you can't do that against anyone.  
  
Q. You mentioned some of the substitutions. Were there one or two you
might want to take back?  
COACH CREAN: Well, you can't play guys a lot of minutes that aren't being
productive on the glass, and aren't being productive with their decision
making. So I think that's what it is. I'll look at the film and kind of figure
it out from there. But it's not about the statistics. It's about the effort
statistics and the hustle statistics, and you can't give the ball away and not
take it back from them, especially when it comes to the defensive boards or
comes to getting offensive putbacks and offensive rebounds.  
  
I've got to watch the film before I look more at that, but we'll come back
with a game plan tomorrow to play a hungry St. John's team.  
  
Q. Are there points in the paint, were you more concerned about the
things Devin was doing or the dribble penetration they were getting that led
to some things?  
COACH CREAN: It was both. We didn't play the post-up game the right way. No
question that should have changed defenses on them and just gone with some of
that. But, again, it was things that we needed to take away a little bit. We
just opened up a little bit too much in our coverages on the side pick-and-
roll, which was the penetration, and we didn't get up on the strong hands.  
  
So I'm not sure if it would have mattered, zone or man. The zone was a concern
because we haven't spent a lot of time at that yet. But you don't want to let
them get a running start at the glass. We were much more physical in the
second half on the glass, but not to the point of winning the game. But we'll
see. I have to look at the film.  
  
Q. That last possession, did you intend to throw it that far down the
court?  
COACH CREAN: Yeah, we wanted it. The first look was to get it in there, if we
got the match-up that we wanted in the front there. Then we have a play set,
and they covered it well. We didn't make a great pass, and we missed the
second option. So we threw it rather than waiting for the second option to be
there.  
  
Q. At that 9-point lead, what caused a transition in momentum from you
guys back to Wake Forest?  
COACH CREAN: I think I just covered it, to be honest with you. We had some
turnovers, we took some tough shots, and rather than getting it through the
paint and we were in the bonus, I believe, at the 8:00 minute mark, and we
shot five free throws the rest of the game. That's what it is on the offensive
end.  
  
Then we just gave up too much room on the drives with Thomas, and on the
glass, and we gave up too much penetration to the guards.

# [MAUI JIM MAUI
INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=MAUI+JIM+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 23, 2015

  

### [Eric Bovaird](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22849)

### [Rohndell Goodwin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=29896)

  
_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
Kansas - 123 Chaminade - 72  
  
THE MODERATOR: We now welcome Coach Eric Bovaird and Rohndell Goodwin to the
media room. Opening statement, Coach?  
  
COACH BOVAIRD: Yeah, we'll just forget about that game, and let's tip it up
and play another one (laughing).  
  
They were what we expected. They were big, strong, and they come at you in
waves, and we were hoping that they would not shoot the ball from the
perimeter as well as they did. Our whole goal was to try to help our guys on
the inside as much as possible. We knew they were going to try to high-low us
to death, and you just kind of hope that they don't knock down outside shots,
and they did.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Rohndell now.  
  
Q. You guys took, I think it was, 33 threes. You were talking about, I
guess for Rohndell, talking about the size they have, was that sort of a
product of the number of threes that you guys took?  
ROHNDELL GOODWIN: No, size didn't have anything to do with it. We have great
shooters on our team. Tonight they just weren't falling the way we usually
shoot the ball. Next time we go, they have to start falling.  
  
Q. What was the toughest part about defending those guys?  
ROHNDELL GOODWIN: Just say the big guys. We were going over film all week,
trying to clear us out on the weak side, stealing them. They were trying to
seal us the whole game, the high-low offense. I said that was the toughest
part. They just made good shots when it was open, and we've just got to work
on our defense.  
  
Q. With your zone, were you trying to force them to make outside
shots?  
COACH BOVAIRD: Yeah, without a doubt. The zone has been successful for us in
years past against teams that had great big guys like Baylor, and Pittsburgh
last year. You've got to pick your poison when you're playing a team like
Kansas.  
  
Most of my team is 6'5" and under. They're good at every position, don't get
me wrong, but it's a heck of a lot easier to make a lay-up than it is to make
a three-point shot. So our goal was to try to take away scoring from two,
three feet from the basket and hope that they get cold outside and they would
start panicking a little bit and things could have been different. But, yeah,
I knew they were going to get open perimeter shots, and you just kind of count
on them hopefully having a cold night.  
  
Q. First few minutes, Coach, it was kind of ugly both ways. No one
really had a rhythm. Do you think that played into your favor at that point?
Could you keep that going?  
COACH BOVAIRD: Yeah, a lot of times whenever, if you watch us play outside of
maybe like tonight and maybe in the Maui Invitational, but a lot of our games
are very up-tempo, very chaotic, and a lot of fast pace. We try to get really
good at transition basketball and force other teams to play that.  
  
But it was ugly at the start. We finished at the half, 4 for 18 from the
three-point line, and I thought about eight of them were wide open shots that
we normally knock down. I think things could have been differently if we even
shot our normal percentage from wide open threes.

# [MAUI JIM MAUI
INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=MAUI+JIM+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 23, 2015

  

### [Steve Alford](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17050)

### [Byrce Alford](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=29897)

### [Thomas Welsh](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=29898)

  
_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
UCLA - 77 UNLV - 75  
  
THE MODERATOR: Back for the final press conference of the night. We welcome
Coach Alford and Thomas Welsh to the media room. As always, we'll start with
an opening statement from coach and we'll take questions for players. Coach,
an opening comment?  
  
COACH ALFORD: I'm really proud of my basketball team. I just felt they fought.
This was a really good, big, athletic team that we were playing in UNLV, and I
thought both teams came in playing pretty good basketball. I'm proud of my
guys, because we took a pretty good punch to start the game. Never did get
Tony Parker in any kind of rhythm. Isaac was out of rhythm. Jonah was out of
rhythm. Those are pretty key players for us that never really got into rhythm.  
  
For us to beat a team like this to where I thought Bryce and Tom were just
terrific all night. It was a game I couldn't give Bryce any kind of blow
because of the pressure, so we've got some concerns moving forward with that.
But I thought both of them showed a lot of toughness.  
  
Then our freshmen, Prince and Alex. Alex gave us some great minutes, and Aaron
was terrific in the second half.  
  
But to go 23 for 24 at the line, that will win you a lot of basketball games.
Obviously, we turned the ball over too many times. That's something we've got
to continue to work on, but for early season game, to win a game like this,
this is really good for us.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Let's start with questions for Thomas Welsh.  
  
Q. Thomas, 9 for 12 from the floor, eight rebounds. Can you just tell
me, were you in a rhythm tonight?  
THOMAS WELSH: I think so. I think the guards did a phenomenal job of finding
me when I was open too. The coaches tell me to be ready whenever the guards go
to the basket. This is a great shot blocking team. Whenever they drove, they
drew the help and kicked it to me. I just wanted to be ready and try to knock
down my shot.  
  
Q. Thomas, it seemed like the transition game was an up and down
basketball game. Is that how you guys are comfortable?  
THOMAS WELSH: That's a good question. I think our transition defense is one of
the things that we've struggled with for these first couple of games. This was
a great test for us too in that matter, because they fly up and down the
court. So I think we made a lot of progress tonight and we've got to keep
moving forward with that.  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right, we'll welcome Bryce Alford in the room as well.  
  
Q. Bryce, coach was talking about he couldn't get you out of there to
get you a blow. But it seemed like you really kind of hung in there with the
fast pace that we were just talking about with Thomas. Is that the way you
guys like to play basketball?  
BRYCE ALFORD: Yeah, it was good to have somebody like Aaron. Last year we
didn't have a guy like Aaron, so I was bringing it up pretty much every time
with Isaac. So it's good to have a guy like Aaron who can take a lot of
pressure off of me. It got me to get some breaks on offense and not have to go
against that kind of pressure for 40 minutes, and I had to play that tonight.  
  
Q. I think you guys shot a pretty awesome free throw percentage, 23 of
the 24, and I think you guys have been in your share of close games already.
So how much did that help you guys tonight?  
BRYCE ALFORD: Yeah, that's huge, it's something we talk about a lot as a team.
Our goal is to shoot 80% as a team every game. We haven't been doing that
exactly. So for us to come into tonight in a close game like that and shoot 23
for 24, you can make the argument that that's what won us the game. So it's a
huge job for the guards and for everybody to get to the line and make free
throws.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for coach?  
  
Q. Steve, did you feel like your use of the zone defense in the first
half there kind of turned the game around and really frustrated them
offensively?  
COACH ALFORD: Yeah, I thought Jonah, the one positive, I thought Jonah really
helped us with was on the front of that 3-2 zone. He did a really nice job
with it. He's long. That's a 7'3" wing span up there. So it's hard to see
over, hard to pass over.  
  
We extended a little bit to where we're making them maybe take some 24, 25,
26-foot shots. I think that slowed them down, because they gave us a really
good punch to start the game.  
  
They're an athletic bunch. The way they play, it's a scary bunch. So I'm
really proud of our team, because we took a really good shot from a really
good team. It's the first time we've had to play against that pressure, and
we're doing it with three freshmen. I thought those three freshmen were really
good. Then what Bryce and Tom were able to do in the first half got us back in
it.  
  
Q. Coach, I know it's early to talk about, but what do you think of
tomorrow's match-up? After a tough game, is it tough to come back?  
COACH ALFORD: Well, yeah. I just got here for the last six or seven minutes of
that game, so, obviously, they're a premier team in the country, a top 5 team.
Coach Self and his staff do ago incredible job, and they're very deep and
talented.  
  
But you want to get in that championship bracket, I think that's the biggest
key when you're coming to a tournament like this.  
  
I told our team, we made strides. Last year, the tournament we were in in the
Bahamas, we lost the first game. So we went right in against a very good
Oklahoma team, very similar to this game. We're ahead, then they'd catch us.
And we weren't able to beat them.  
  
So then we take a step forward now with this group. We get into the right side
of the bracket. When you do that, you face teams like Kansas in a tournament
like this. But this is why you're blessed to have an opportunity to play in a
tournament like this. You know that you're going to play incredible
competition. We learned a lot from this game.  
  
When we get back home, we'll be able to watch this tape, just like we'll watch
Kansas and whoever we play on Wednesday. But we're going to get three really
quality teams being on this right side now that we're going to get a really
good test of who we are and what we need to work on. That's why you want to be
here. So we're looking forward to the opportunity, but we know it's a very
tall task.  
  
Q. Coach, kind of looked like your guys felt the free-throw shooting. Is
that something you think you'll be able to count on?  
COACH ALFORD: I put 24 for 30. We always like getting there 30 times. We
didn't quite get there 30 times, but we almost made 24. If they're not going
to get there 30, and they only get there 24, I like the fact they made 23.
They did a really nice job of making foul shots all night.  
  
So I've got to hammer my son, because an Alford can't be the only one to miss
a free throw. That doesn't sit well in the household. But we did. We did,
Aaron got off to a slow start, but then was really good in the second half,
made all his free throws down the stretch. You've got a 7'1" center that goes
to the line and knocks down two free throws.  
  
I couldn't be more happy or proud for them. That was an intense basketball
game. To go 23 or 24, I thought that was the difference in the game.  
  
Q. Coach, is this a little bit of a statement game in the West?  
COACH ALFORD: Well, we're just trying to get better. Whether it's a statement
game, I think they're really good. I think they stay healthy, I think they're
going to have a really good year. I think we stay healthy, we're going to have
a really good year.  
  
This is a game where Tony comes in 16-16. He plays 11 minutes. Jonah's not
going to play 20 minutes very often and get one rebound. Isaac's not going to
have many games where he gets three turnovers. So those are three high-quality
players we had that had off nights and we were able to beat a team like this.  
  
It's not so much a statement in the West to me, as it is a statement to me as
a coach that these freshmen are pretty good; they're hard-nosed, tough kids
and getting better. So all of a sudden we have some vets that have off nights
and we can hang in there and get a win.  
  
Last year we couldn't do that. Last year we played six guys. This year we can
go nine deep and we've got GG that will hopefully be back in about three
weeks. I like our depth. This is a big test for us when they passed it. More
than a statement, it's a good feeling as a coach, because I think this team
has a chance to be pretty good if we keep working.

_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
MEGAN GODFREY: Aloha, everyone, and welcome to the Head Coaches Press
Conference and Charity Free Throw Contest. I'm Megan Godfrey with the Maui Jim
Maui Invitational and on behalf of the tournament, I want to thank you all for
joining us today. This morning we'll hear from all eight head coaches followed
by the official photo with the tournament surfboards. Then we'll begin the
charity free throw competition in which students from local Maui middle
schools are paired up with each of the coaches for a chance to win money for
their school.  
  
Finally, we'll have a 15-minute round table Q & A session in which you'll have
a chance to speak to the coaches and tournament chairman Dave Odom in a one-
on-one setting. Former Virginia head coach Terry Holland will also be
available for questions after the press conference. Holland was the coach of
the Cavaliers in 1982 when the team was upset by Chaminade which led to the
creation of the Maui Jim Maui Invitational.  
  
We ask that you hold all questions for The Q & A session, and we plan to be
wrapped up by 9:00 a.m.  
  
Now, I'd like to introduce our moderator for this morning's press conference.
A play-by-play announcer for college basketball on ESPN since 2007, Jon
Sciambi will be calling his third Maui Jim Maui Invitational this year. Jon is
a graduate of Boston College, and has served as the play-by-play voice for
Major League Baseball on ESPN Radio since 2010. Please welcome Jon Sciambi.  
  
JON SCIAMBI: Megan, thanks very much. Yeah, back here, it's as tough a gig as
we get here at ESPN, and all my friends back home let me know.  
  
First thing I want to do is recognize Bro. Bernard Ploeger, President of
Chaminade and just say thank you for all of your support. Chaminade, of
course, so connected with this event and Brother Bernie, thank you, thank you
so much. And obviously, thanks to the folks at Maui Jim and KemperLesnik as
well.  
  
It's just great to be here. An amazing field, some of the most storied
basketball programs in the history of the sport. Four of the winningest
programs, combined for 20 national titles, an amazing group of coaches right
here, and I know everybody's excited to get the basketball going tomorrow.  
  
I think all the coaches are looking forward to watching their teams play in
three games in three days. So let's get to meeting all the coaches.  
  
We start with the man, all the way down to the right, Eric Bovaird, fifth
season at Chaminade. You return three of your top four scorers. You've been to
the NCAA Division II tournament three times. Tell me about your team, but tell
me also about this event and, Coach, what makes it so special?  
  
ERIC BOVAIRD: It's a remarkable experience for our student-athletes. This
event has always been so special to Chaminade, and it's special to myself. I
remember watching it as a little kid growing up in cold Pennsylvania and just
dreaming of one day -- well, first I wanted to play in it. But Kansas never
recruited me, so now I have an opportunity to at least coach in it and it is a
phenomenal experience for everybody.  
  
As far as our team, yeah, we have a lot of experience coming back, and a lot
of good recruits that came in. We're just getting started though. We've only
played two games and we're trying to find our identity, and hopefully we can
do that this week.  
  
JON SCIAMBI: Best of luck. Tom Crean, head coach of Indiana. 8th season with
the Hoosiers. Obviously got to the Final Four with Marquette as well. Three
times in the last four years you've been to the NCAA Tournament. You've got
Thomas Bryant with you now. You've returned a team that can really score the
basketball. Tell me about the potential of this year's Hoosiers team and what
you're looking for here in Maui.  
  
TOM CREAN: I think our front line is so young, and Thomas is a very young
18-year-old. We have two other young freshmen on the front line with Juwan
Morgan, and O.G. Anunoby, and we added Max Bielfeldt from Michigan. So they're
young in age, and in Max's case, young to Indiana. But love their upside and
work ethic.  
  
I think the fact that we have experience in our back court, whether it's Yogi
Ferrell as a senior or Nick Zeisloft as a senior or Troy Williams as a junior
now or James Blackmon or Robert Johnson as sophomore, those guys can help us
along. Our team is learning to play with a consistent level of toughness every
day and with an ability to get better defensively. If we keep maxing out that
ability, we have a chance to have a really good team. That's where our
potential will be. It's going to be in our upside defensively, and our upside
rebounding the ball, which will hopefully make our offense even better.  
  
JON SCIAMBI: All right. Tom Crean and the Indiana Hoosiers.  
  
Bill Self from Kansas. Got a chance to watch you guys the other night at the
Champions Classic. Your 12th season at Kansas, 11 straight Big 12 titles.
Let's talk a little about your team. One of the things I wanted to ask you
about. What's three games in three days do for your team and what are you
looking for specific to that? Because it's something that doesn't happen
usually.  
  
BILL SELF: I think obviously conditioning will be a huge factor. Depth will be
a factor in this situation. I think all of the coaches here, especially early
in the season, we'd like to look at different combination and play maybe more
guys, more minutes than what you would during a conference game just to see
how everything plays out.  
  
But it's a grind. Certainly it's a grind here, and it should be a grind. To
finish three games, I mean, things like cramping and things like that, I think
will be very important in how the guys take care of themselves while they're
over here, because I think everybody that's been here before has had at least
players experience this. So it will be a grind, but certainly one that I know
everybody is looking forward to.  
  
JON SCIAMBI: We're looking forward to watching your team play. Chris Mullin
from St. John's. Three-time Big East Player of the Year, went to the Final
Four in 1985, and here you are back at your alma mater coaching. You start off
your coaching career, and you get to take your team to Maui. That's pretty
good.  
  
CHRIS MULLIN: Yeah, but if everything Bill said, we're going to be in trouble
because depth we don't have right now. We've got a young group, nine new
players, all new coaching staff. So this trip here will be really good for us
to bond together. Every experience we have, good, bad, indifferent, is really
a building block and a foundation for us.  
  
On the court we've got two guys speaking French, two guys speaking Italian,
two guys speaking Brooklyn-ese. So we're growing from the ground up.  
  
And as far as three games in a row, I'm going to do the best I can managing
minutes. As Bill said, we did spend a lot of time on conditioning and fitness,
so when we get our full roster, we'll be able to put that in place.  
  
JON SCIAMBI: I'd really love to sit here and ask you and Coach Alford about
the free-throw shooting contest sponsored by the Elks Club back in the day,
but we don't have time for that, so we're not going to do it.  
  
CHRIS MULLIN: I don't think either of us can remember that far back.  
  
JON SCIAMBI: Steve Alford, head coach of UCLA. Third season, consecutive Sweet
16 appearances, and here you guys are in Maui. You talked about the fact that
this is a good litmus test for your team. What are you hoping to see out of
the Bruins?  
  
STEVE ALFORD: Well, I remember the free throw contest, because Chris won his
division, and I finished third in nationals, so I've got a picture of that.
I'm really upset, and he's feeling good about himself.  
  
But, yeah, it is. As all the coaches have said, it's obviously a great
tournament. We're honored to be one of those teams and programs that get a
chance to play three games in three days. We've got a lot of new working
pieces to our team and trying to play a little different with our depth up
front. We've got some experience in our back court, and we're going to need
that because we've played three really good teams already, and we've got to
value the ball more. That's something that we've been talking about. And
defensively we've got to get better each and every game.  
  
When you're playing the quality opponent that's what we're going to get to
play in three games here, you're going to leave the island with a much better
idea of who you are and what you've got to work on early in the season.
Hopefully we'll look a lot different at the time we get to Pac-12 play.  
  
JON SCIAMBI: Steve, thank you very much. Now from UNLV, Dave Rice, you're
coaching at your alma mater. You got a chance to play and win a national title
for Jerry Tarkanian, been to the NCAA Tournament a couple of times at UNLV,
and there is excitement around your team.  
  
You've got a very athletic group. Tell me about the positives and the things
you're looking forward to watching from UNLV this year?  
  
DAVE RICE: Well, yeah, it's very good to be here. We're excited to be at the
Maui Invitational. One of the priorities for us when we took over as a staff
was to get back to Maui. UNLV, we haven't been here since 2000, and this is
one of the prestigious tournaments that takes place.  
  
But we have a team that we're excited about. It's a pretty good blend of
returning guys. We've got six returning scholarship players and a number of
new guys. And we're just trying to fit those guys in like all the coaches are
talking about here.  
  
Tremendous challenge for us certainly tomorrow playing against a very good
UCLA team. But every game at Maui is tough. So, again, I think like all of us,
we're trying to build a foundation of something special, and hopefully we'll
continue to get better as the season progresses. But, again, we're very
excited to be here.  
  
JON SCIAMBI: It's great to have you here.  
  
Kevin Stallings, Vanderbilt, I really toyed with the idea of just firing
baseball questions at you because I know you love your baseball.  
  
KEVIN STALLINGS: I'd be better at answering those.  
  
JON SCIAMBI: Longest tenured coach in the SEC, 17th season, and obviously you
guys are loaded with a lot of talent this year, and the top spot in the SEC,
I'm sure, one of your goals. But an early season tournament like this, what
can it do to help your team grow as the season goes on?  
  
KEVIN STALLINGS: I think that this tournament, obviously, as all the coaches
have said, gives your team a chance to come together. I think that you're
being engaged and playing against some of the very best teams in the country.
So we're all going to know a lot more when we leave here later this week than
we do right now.  
  
The depth thing is a challenge. The three games in three days is certainly a
challenge. I really like my team. We have a team that is as unselfish as any
as I've ever coached, and they're fun to be around. We're still very young.
We've got a lot of experience and we're very young. We start three sophomores
and two juniors, so all those freshmen that got playing time last year is
benefiting us now. But it's going to be an interesting week for all of us, and
we're, like everyone else, very excited to be here.  
  
JON SCIAMBI: All right, Danny Manning, you guys with Kansas you won the
national title. That year you guys played in Maui, and now you're in your
second season as the head coach at Wake Forest. Tell me about your team and
what you're hoping to get done here in Hawaii?  
  
DANNY MANNING: Well, first of all, we didn't fare well when we came over as
Kansas as a player, so hopefully we can do better this trip out. We're excited
about being here. We think this is a wonderful field, and it gives us a chance
to mirror some of the conference play we'll all see because we play three
great teams.  
  
We have a fairly young team. I think our guys are going out and they
understand what we want now in year two. They're putting forth great effort,
and we have to go out and play with very good attention to detail and put
forth the intensity necessary to give ourselves a chance to have success.  
  
JON SCIAMBI: Excellent. Guys, thanks so much. Look forward to watching all of
your teams play. For now, I'm going to turn it back over to Megan.  
  
MEGAN GODFREY: Thank you, Jon. All of the coaches and Dave Odom will be
available for questions immediately following the free throw contest.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=MISSOURI+VALLEY+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2015

  

### [Daishon Knight](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28313)

### [Paris Lee](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28421)

### [Dan Muller](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24792)

  
_ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI_  
  

Northern Iowa  69  
Illinois State  60

  
THE MODERATOR: Good afternoon, everyone. Tournament runner‑ups Illinois State
Redbirds are with us. Paris Lee, Daishon Knight are surrounding Coach Dan
Muller. We're going to ask Dan to make a statement about the game, and we'll
go to questions for the two student‑athletes of Illinois State.  
COACH MULLER: First of all, congratulations to Ben and his team. They're a
great champion to represent our league. They have a terrific team, and we're
happy for them.  
It's a tale of two halves. We played great in the first half, and they came
out and hit us in the mouth. We missed some shots around the rim during that
stretch, where we could have kept the lead, and just never could get going the
second half.  
But proud of my team, really, really proud of my team, their efforts the last
three weeks. They just got us in the second half.  
  
Q. For both of you guys, could you just talk about the start of the second
half, the first seven minutes. What was different about that from the first
half?  
PARIS LEE: I felt like we got comfortable. We had a big lead‑‑ I mean, the
first half, we knew it was 0‑0 and we had to build our laid, but the second
half, I feel like we just came out comfortable and took our foot off the gas.  
DAISHON KNIGHT: I think our energy wasn't as great as it was the first half.
Like Paris said, we got a little comfortable. They got back in it, and they
made a run. Unfortunately, we lost.  
  
Q. Daishon, what made it ‑‑ what did they do to make it so difficult on you
in the second half? You didn't get your first shot until there were like three
minutes left.   
DAISHON KNIGHT: It wasn't too difficult. It was just a game of basketball. If
I couldn't find my shot, I knew I could find my teammates and get an open
shot. We got great looks. We just missed some and made a couple.  
  
Q. Paris, you guys did come back and tied the game there at 47. At that
point, was the energy back on your guys' side? What allowed them to get kind
‑‑ get back the lead there?   
PARIS LEE: I would say we picked it back up. Coach Muller did a good job
getting us all together and telling us to calm down, man. We good, you know.
But like Daishon said, we still missed a couple of easy shots. We turned the
ball over a couple of times at crucial moments.  
  
Q. Could both of you guys ‑‑ I mean, can you process this yet? You're 20
minutes away from the NCAA Tournament and have it snatched away from you like
that. Can you just kind of put that into words?   
PARIS LEE: Me being a point guard, I should have brought everybody together
and brought everybody in and told them that the game was nowhere near done and
just told them to keep fighting. But I wasn't vocal. I kind of‑‑ I kind of
just fell back and didn't say too much.  
By the time I started saying stuff, it was too late.  
DAISHON KNIGHT: It was tough, 20 minutes away from an NCAA Tournament. I think
nobody likes to lose in that situation. Man, you got to learn from those
situations for anybody. I know I'm a senior. I'm moving on, but I know the
players, they'll definitely learn from the situation.  
  
Q. The first half, you guys really ran all over them, got a lot of quick
baskets. In the second half, did fatigue factor into it at all?  
PARIS LEE: I would say we just didn't have the same energy on offense, just
going in transition. The first half offense transition, we were just going so
fast. Second half, we‑‑ I mean, we couldn't‑‑ we got to stop them first in
order to get rebounds and start transition. They got a lot of shots up and a
lot of shots failed. So we couldn't get out in transition as fast.  
THE MODERATOR: Daishon, same question. Was there fatigue?  
DAISHON KNIGHT: No, I don't think it was fatigue. We didn't attack the same
after we seen them make a couple shots, which will happen in basketball. We
didn't still keep pushing, just keep playing. We kind of like backed up and
probably was a little bit hesitant about taking our shots that we were
shooting in the first half.  
  
Q. Paris, you just mentioned about being vocal. Is that one of those
learning experiences that you're going to look to take forward and be more
vocal, be more of a leader as you progress in your career?  
PARIS LEE: Yes, sir. As a point guard, period, I just feel like, if the team
hear my voice a lot‑‑ if they hear me giving them good encouragement and just
saying the right things at the right times, I think they'll be right behind
me.  
So to answer your question, yes, I plan on being more vocal in my career.  
  
Q. Daishon, as a senior, you talked a little bit about it already, I know it
might be tough to look this far ahead, but there's a possible NIT berth for
you guys out there or possible postseason basketball. As a senior, yes, this
game might be a little difficult to get by, but you might still have more
basketball to play.  
DAISHON KNIGHT: If there's more basketball to play, that's great. I'm looking
forward to it. But this game‑‑ you know, we lost. I got to think about it for
a minute, and then I got to put it past me. Hopefully, we go to NIT, and I
start worrying about the NIT.  
THE MODERATOR: Gentlemen, thank you very much for your time here.
Congratulations to Daishon Knight, who's part of the All‑Tournament team.  
  
Q. Dan, could you just talk about maybe what they did differently in the
second half that you guys weren't able to adjust to.  
COACH MULLER: They got the ball into Tuttle, and he really exerted his will a
couple baskets early. I said at the start we missed three layups in the first
four minutes that, if we make those, we keep the lead even though they're
scoring some.  
We couldn't get in transition because they were scoring so much. Morgan made
some shots. It really started with getting the ball inside to Tuttle. The zone
got into Tuttle, man, they got into Tuttle, and he was terrific in the second
half.  
  
Q. Just kind of piggy ‑backing on that, in the first half, you guys were
really effective and swarming and maybe even frustrating Tuttle, taking the
ball away from him, et cetera. Did you play him the same way, did you feel
like, in the second half? Did you feel like it was just his sheer
determination?   
COACH MULLER: He got a couple of deeper touches in the second half. We wanted
to play him physically. We sent some guys at him at times. Honestly, I think
he just came out and said‑‑ I'm sure he'll tell you. He wasn't very good in
the first half. That wasn't the normal Seth Tuttle.  
I'm sure Coach got on him possibly, but he came out‑‑ he was a different
player. We didn't do anything differently, no. He got closer to the rim,
dribbled a couple of baskets, made some tough shots, and that got him going.  
Once that happened‑‑ we didn't send double‑teams much in the first half. Once
that happened, we had to start sending guys. It opened some shots for some
three‑point shooters. And Morgan shot unbelievably well this weekend.  
  
Q. Dan, the players talked about not coming out with enough energy there in
the second half. Why is that, I guess? This is the championship game, and you
would think the energy would be there.  
COACH MULLER: It's got nothing to do with the championship game, Jim. It's
just a matter of maturity. They didn't sit in there and think, hey, let's not
play hard the second half. We don't want to be here. I mean, it's human
nature. We tried to talk about it, just like you do any other halftime.  
I don't think we came out relaxed. I think they made a couple baskets, we
missed some layups, and then we got tentative.  
But I think the mindset coming out of halftime was probably good until they
hit us in the mouth and we didn't finish. Reggie misses a layup, Devon misses
a couple shots at the rim, Teddy misses a wide‑open three. I think that took
the wind out of our sails a little bit, and we didn't respond.  
I wish I could have done a better job of helping them at that moment, but it
took us a little bit too long to respond.  
  
Q. Dan, I understand what Daishon was saying about, when his shot's not
there, he was looking for open teammates, and the shots weren't going, but he
didn't get any shots. From your vantage point, what was different? Was he not
moving as well, or was it due to the defensive changes they made on him?  
COACH MULLER: A lot of it was we weren't getting stops. We were scoring so
much in transition in the first half because of our defensive intensity. We
didn't turn it over at all, but we were getting stops and pushing it out. A
lot of guys were playing well.  
When they got to set their defense, they just kind of swarmed him a little bit
on ball screens. Most of our looks came because of our speed in transition.
Even if we didn't score in transition in the first half, we got them on our
heels, and then our plays were working better.  
Second half, it was set defense the whole time. They give up 38 percent on the
year. We shot 51 and then 33. Their set defense, they're going to‑‑ that's
really what it was, just a great team and individual efforts once their
defense was set, on Daishon.  
  
Q. Kind of lit into it here about there's still a season to play. Do you
worry about this game even lingering on to the next one? Or is there obviously
enough time that this team will kind of reenergize?  
COACH MULLER: It's so far away we don't know what will happen. Of course, we
certainly hope we get an NIT bid. You never know. I feel confident about it,
but two weeks, they may not remember who we played in two weeks. They're kids.
They'll be okay.  
THE MODERATOR: Dan, thank you very much. Good luck in your next tournament.

_ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI_  
  

Northern Iowa  69  
Illinois State  60

  
THE MODERATOR: Champions of Arch Madness are here, UNI Panthers. Per custom,
we're going to ask Coach Ben Jacobson to make a statement on the title game.
Then we'll go to questions for the student‑athletes of Northern Iowa, Jeremy
Morgan, Marvin Singleton, Seth Tuttle, Matt Bohannon, and Deon Mitchell.  
COACH JACOBSON: That was different than just about every game I've been a part
of. Illinois State, as I said yesterday, has got a heck of a basketball team.
Dan is doing a fantastic job of putting that group together. They played the
first half the way they played yesterday. They continued with that momentum,
extremely aggressive, and a lot of guys made plays for them.  
We had more than our hands full at halftime. I give our guys a lot of credit
for sticking to what's worked for us and getting that ball in to Seth and
attacking in transition, doing the things we practiced when it would have been
easy to get away from it.  
Illinois State, as we saw this weekend, is certainly a postseason type of
team. I would imagine they'll be in the NIT for sure. They're very, very good.  
Just proud of our guys for sticking with what's worked for us.  
  
Q. Seth, with all the accolades, 30 wins, top 10 ranking, what's it mean to
kind of add a trophy to it?  
SETH TUTTLE: That means a lot for not just me, but our team and our
university. At the beginning of the year, we left a slot open in our new team
room. We talked about how we wanted to fill that with trophies this year.
Obviously, that was one of our team's goals. For us to come down here and get
three wins and get those trophies to fill that slot, it's a great feeling and
means a lot.  
  
Q. Seth, you've never done this before. How does it compare to maybe what
you thought it would feel like?  
SETH TUTTLE: I've gotten told what it felt like. Obviously, you can never put
those words into how it actually feels when you get out there. I can tell you,
it felt great to be able to share it with these four and the rest of our guys
and our coaching staff and my family in the stands and our crowd. To be able
to share this moment, it felt great.  
I know we're all really excited about it.  
  
Q. Marvin, Illinois State, it looked like, really wanted to play a physical
game. Did you guys feel ready for that early? What got you in the mood?
Clearly, it turned around, and you settled in obviously in the second half.  
MARVIN SINGLETON: We knew it was going to be a physical game. They're pretty
big up front. They've got a couple big guys. They like to throw up and block
shots and chase rebounds. We knew it was going to be a physical game on both
sides of the floor.  
Second half, they just missed a couple of shots, and we were able to get in
transition and get a couple of easy baskets. That changed the tempo of the
game and the momentum of the game started swinging back our way.  
  
Q. Jeremy, how would you describe the defensive problems you had in the
first half?  
JEREMY MORGAN: It wasn't really defensive problems, I wouldn't say. They came
out and hit some tough shots right away from the beginning. When players like
that hit shots, they start to feel it a little bit. They had some momentum in
the first half, but we stuck with what we knew best and came out in the second
half and did a great job.  
  
Q. For any of the guys up there, the differences between the first and the
second half, obviously, couldn't have been more different. Was there almost a
pressure relief when you went out in the second half knowing that you just had
to go out and play to get back into it, you didn't have to worry about
anything?  
MATT BOHANNON: Kind of like J said, we had a few defensive lapses in the first
half. We had quite a few transition buckets we were trying to take away, and
they did a good job of spreading the floor and getting some of those easy
ones.  
At the halftime we had to kind of dig in a little bit and, like we have all
year, just stick to some of the things we've been doing all year to get us to
a win. Like you said, we had to cut that lead to 10 as quickly as we can, and
we did that.  
DEON MITCHELL: Like both of them said, they came out in the first half really
aggressive. They were knocking down a lot of tough shots. We just knew, like J
said earlier, just do what we've been doing, and eventually we'll come out on
top.  
  
Q. This question's for Matt. How were you guys able to disrupt entry passes
to Lynch? It looked like it was a lot tougher for him to get the ball in the
post the second half.  
MATT BOHANNON: We know they like to run their offense through him. He's a very
good player. He scores every time he gets the ball around the basket. We knew,
playing from behind, we'd have to have help from Marv or Buss when they were
in there. Hawkins is a good shooter at the forward position. So it was kind of
hard to double off him.  
In the second half, we just tried to let them know we were there, let them
know the guards were digging in a little bit or Marv or Buss were coming,
sometimes they're not. Just had to give them different looks. I thought the
second half they kind of struggled a little bit because he knew we were coming
from a different direction every time.  
  
Q. You added Andrea on the staff this year to help with conditioning. How
much does it help in a game like this?  
MARVIN SINGLETON: I think it helps us out a lot team‑wise, being able to play
a full game for 40 minutes instead of just playing the first half and then
probably collapsing or just giving up.  
We stuck with it the second half. We knew we could get out in transition if
they miss a couple shots. We knew we could get out in transition and get a
couple of easy baskets.  
We were ready for the physical game and the transition game as well.  
JEREMY MORGAN: Along with what Marvin said, Andrea helped a lot with the
conditioning through the summer and all the way into the season working us
with the warmups. Everything that he does, just like everybody else in the
program, helps tremendously. We appreciate him a lot.  
  
Q. Seth, kind of a big picture question. You guys are leading the way for a
state that's going to have three teams in the tournament. As a guy that grew
up in Iowa, what do you think that means to be part of a threesome that's
going to make the NCAA Tournament?  
SETH TUTTLE: There's a lot of buzz going around the state of Iowa, not only
for us, but the other two universities. That's exciting. It's exciting to have
good basketball around us.  
I guess we haven't really focused too much about the other two universities.
We've been concentrating on ourselves, but obviously, it just adds to the
season, adds to everything what's going on. So it's exciting for everybody.  
  
Q. Seth, what did Jake say? Maybe more importantly, how did he say it in the
halftime locker room?  
SETH TUTTLE: He stayed calm, like he always does. He told us that even though
we're down by however many it was, he still felt like the game was ours. He
still felt like we were fine. We had to get back to playing our kind of
basketball. We had to be the ones that were putting them on our heels.  
Basically, they were the more aggressive team the first half, and we were back
on our heels, and we talked about how we had to flip flop that. One main
thing, we talked about getting it under 10 right away, to put the pressure on
them, and then obviously let ourselves get into a nice little rhythm.  
We were able to do that, obviously, pretty quick there in the second half.  
  
Q. For Matt, shot making was obviously the big difference. What was the
difference that took the lid off? Is was it switching ends? Was it something
that simple?  
MATT BOHANNON: I wouldn't say switching ends. We just kept shooting. We knew
we put in a lot of preparation, every single one of us, through the summer and
the off‑season, to make those shots. We just stayed confident. We had guys and
coaches on the sidelines saying just shoot it, just stay confident, and the
next one is going to go in.  
That's kind of what happened. We just kept shooting, and fortunately some of
them fell.  
  
Q. Deon, in the first half, it looked like you were getting some good looks
around the rim, but in the second half, did the game really slow down for you?
Is?  
DEON MITCHELL: In the first half, we were getting some stops. The first few
minutes, I had some open looks. In the second half, we tried to do the same
thing. They were collapsing more and in their zone. We tried to slow it down a
bit and work it inside out and kick it out to the open three‑point shots, and
it worked well for us.  
THE MODERATOR: Gentlemen, we can dismiss you. Congratulations. We'll see you
in the Big Dance.  
  
Q. Ben, second half, Daishon Knight didn't get his first shot till three
minutes left in the ball game, after having the first half that he had. Was
that a function more of them just not getting into transition the second half
because you guys were finally making shots? Or did you change up what you were
doing?  
COACH JACOBSON: It was the first of what you said. We started to score the
ball, which kept them out of transition some. Of and the momentum got shifted
to our side. That was really the only thing that happened. We didn't change
anything from a scheme standpoint.  
  
Q. Coach, when you're down 18 late in the first half, was this really a
group with five seniors that you didn't really have to say much to them, or
what were you communicating before the second half?  
COACH JACOBSON: I thought in the first half we had gotten some good looks at
the basket. Nate was open a couple of times. Paul was open. We had the ball in
to Seth, and he didn't score it three or four times. I think our play was
better than what the score was. Sometimes your play isn't. Sometimes you're
tied and your play isn't as good as the score is.  
In this case, I thought our play was better than what the score indicated. We
just kept talking about digging in and plenty of time at halftime, as Seth
said, just talked about getting it under 10 as soon as we could and putting a
little pressure on them, and the guys were able to do that.  
  
Q. Three years ago Nate Buss probably didn't get the minutes he wanted.
Today he got the All ‑Conference team. What has he done to earn that this
year?   
COACH JACOBSON: He has put so much more effort into the teamwork it takes
defensively. He's putting so much more effort into the toughness it takes to
rebound. And he's just grown tremendously, generally speaking, in terms of
being a teammate.  
I'll tell you, I'm really, really proud of him. He's come a long ways in all
of those areas. It's one thing to do it for yourself, to get on the floor.
It's another‑‑ that's always part of it, but it's another to do it to help
your team. I think that's what Nate has really grown into and really learned.
At the beginning, it was about him getting on the floor. At this point, it's
how can I help my team win a championship, whether it's 2 minutes or 32
minutes, and I've really enjoyed being a part of that.  
  
Q. Coach, in the second half, it looked like McCloud didn't have the type of
looks he had in the first half. Was that because you were doubling less,
playing more one ‑on‑one defense in the second half?   
COACH JACOBSON: We needed to run him off that three‑point line. We made a
couple of defensive mistakes in the first half with him and with Hawkins. One
of the things we talked about was making sure we run those two guys off the
three‑point line and make them bounce it.  
  
Q. Coach, Matt mentioned confidence in terms of shooting. Where does that
stem from for these guys?  
COACH JACOBSON: The most important thing and the best place that that can come
from is putting time in every day. To answer your question, that's where it
comes from.  
All of them are in every single day. It starts at, I believe, 7:00 in the
morning with Bohannon, and shortly after that, it's Max, Jeremy, and Wyatt.
Shortly after that, it's Marvin, Deon, Seth‑‑ I could keep going. It's all of
them. It's the same every single day. They're in, and they shoot hundreds of
shots.  
The thing that I've appreciated most about our program is that this isn't the
first group to do that. There was guys before them that showed them the way to
confidence. It's through hard work. That's the only way you get there. These
guys have been great, and they had some great guys before them to help them
understand the importance of preparation.  
  
Q. Ben, you've been down this road before at the NCAA Tournament but your
guys haven't. What do you do ‑‑ it's an unusual situation for you with a week
and a half between games. How do you go from tomorrow up until then?   
COACH JACOBSON: We'll take a couple days off, let them get away from each
other a little bit. I would say probably two days off. And then get back in
the gym this week. This week just do some things. We'll be in the weight room
and do a little conditioning.  
We won't do a lot of our take a charge drills, rebounding drills, a lot of the
hard ones this week. This is a good week to let the guys get healed up just a
little bit and mentally get freshened up just a little bit.  
As we get toward the end of the week, we'll start to go a little harder again,
and then we'll see what comes our way on Sunday and then have our normal
practices next week.  
  
Q. Coach, when Seth has maybe a frustrating first half like he had today, do
you have something to stay to him at halftime, or do you just kind of assume
maybe his determination is going to take over in the second half?  
COACH JACOBSON: I talked to the team just as a group about being more
physical. I told Seth and Marv, right before we went out after the half, just
to get more physical with Lynch and with the other bigs, when they're ducking
in and posting and when they catch it. That's the only thing I talked to them
about was a little bit more physical.  
  
Q. Coach, more relief or enjoyment to get back here from where you were in
2010?  
COACH JACOBSON: Enjoyment. This has been great. One of the things I learned
going through it as an assistant and the two times as a head coach is I
allowed myself to get pretty wrapped up in the preparation and just getting on
to the next one and on to the next one. I think that's just how I'm wired.  
I've gotten a little bit better, a little bit more perspective now. I've
enjoyed this four months tremendously, and we will continue to.  
  
Q. Coach, did you put more emphasis on defense at the beginning of this year
and kind of your style of play as a defensive style than in years past?  
COACH JACOBSON: Probably just about a year ago. Last year, as I said early in
the year, we took a year off defensively, which I'm still not all that happy
about. But we did, and it was my doing. So we spent a lot of time‑‑ we got
back at it this summer and spent a lot of time this fall getting some things
done defensively and getting a little bit tougher, and it's paid off for us.  
  
Q. Coach, you'll have two Valley teams in the NCAAs. Illinois State played
you tough today. Can you just talk a little bit about the level of play in
this league and how it prepares you going forward.  
COACH JACOBSON: The league was much better this year than it was a year ago. I
think we're seeing teams and guys‑‑ we're seeing that improvement. Evansville
returns everybody again. Illinois State's got all kinds of young guys on the
floor in that championship game. Indiana State returns a bunch of guys, and I
could keep going.  
I think we've got a great foundation right now across the board in the league,
and it will continue to move forward. I think next year the league will be
better than it was this year.  
  
Q. You got the stone face, and your players say you're always calm. Is there
anything going on underneath when you're down by 18 in the first half? Any
kind of concern?  
COACH JACOBSON: Not today. Today I was okay. As I said, I thought we were
playing better than what the score was. There's been times when we've gotten
down and we haven't done what we practiced, and inside I'm as angry as I can
possibly be. On occasion, that comes out in a halftime here or there. Not very
often.  
There's a guy in the back of the room that caught the back half of one in a
time‑out a few years ago. It's more about how we're playing than what the
score is. That's our deal.  
We work hard to do things a certain way, and we work hard to prepare ourselves
and work hard enough as the guys are confident, as we talked about today. If
we're playing that way and the other team happens to be playing better, I feel
like it's my job to help the guys just kind of get on track.  
If we're not doing what we're supposed to, especially from an effort
standpoint, then they're going to hear about it. But outside of that, I really
feel like my job is to help them do well, and this is a good group that way.  
THE MODERATOR: On behalf of the Missouri Valley Conference, congratulations,
Ben. Best of luck in the tournament. Go get 'em.  
COACH JACOBSON: Thanks a lot.

_ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI_  
  

Illinois State  65  
Wichita State  62

  
THE MODERATOR: Victorious Redbirds are now with us. They have a spot in
tomorrow's championship game to be televised on CBS. Per custom, we're going
to ask Coach Dan Muller to open up with a statement on the game.  
COACH MULLER: First of all, congratulations to Wichita State and what they're
going to represent us in the NCAA Tournament. They're a great team. They got a
lot more games to win this year, and we'll be rooting for them.  
Couldn't be prouder of our guys. Second half especially, the way we fought,
the way we played together. If you're going to beat a team like a Wichita
State, you're going to have to have somebody have a special day, and Daishon
Knight had that. A lot of guys made big plays, but it kind of came down to
just going out there and leaving it all on court, and we did that.  
Our zone was terrific. Our rebounding was good. It was a good day. We came
down here to win it. We're certainly not satisfied, but we are happy about the
win.  
  
Q. Daishon, was there any extra motivation for today's game, knowing it
could have potentially been your last game as a Redbird?  
DAISHON KNIGHT: As inside our team, we look at it as‑‑ you know, we had talks
among each other. We always just talk about how it's our last chance playing
with this group of people. We kind of take that like personal amongst
ourselves. We kind of go out there and fight with each other.  
That helps us out. That helps motivate us.  
  
Q. Daishon, could you just kind of talk about the mood at the locker room at
halftime. Did you guys feel almost fortunate to be down just eight points? I
think you went 1 of 15 in a 12 ‑minute stretch during that first half.   
DAISHON KNIGHT: We came in the locker room. Coach got on us a little bit. He
let us know that it's basketball. Basketball is a game of‑‑ you know, people
make runs. He just was telling us this is fun. It's going to be a fun moment.  
We came out, and we played the way we wanted to play.  
  
Q. For both players, you came close against this team the first two times.
What was the difference in this game that enabled you to come out on the
winning side this time?  
REGGIE LYNCH: Ask me that question again one more time.  
  
Q. What was the difference in this game with this team as opposed to the
first two times you played them?  
REGGIE LYNCH: We knew that we lost to this team twice during the conference,
and we wanted to beat them those two other times. We knew that whoever was in
our way in the tournament‑‑ and it happened to be Wichita‑‑ was going to have
to get beat by us, and we stepped up to the plate.  
We're not trying to win against Wichita. We're trying to win the whole
tournament. So we stepped up, and we knew that this was going to be a tough
team to play since we lost to them twice, but we stepped up.  
The second half, we picked it up a lot more on defense. The guys made great
plays. Deontae, Teddy, was awesome. MiKyle was awesome at the end. It was just
fun.  
  
Q. Daishon, what was the difference between today and the last two games?  
DAISHON KNIGHT: I think our energy. Our energy was unbelievable the second
half. I kind of looked at players and players‑‑ it's the 11‑minute mark and 9
minutes played, and people are not tired at all. Even Coach asked me, he was
like, are you tired? But we wasn't feeling it because it was just fun and it
was just basketball, and we wasn't even thinking about fatigue. I think it was
energy level.  
  
Q. Daishon, you guys go into the locker room shooting 32 percent, come out
shooting 63 percent in the second half. What changed for you guys? What
allowed you to get those scores going?  
DAISHON KNIGHT: We got some great shots. We used ball screen, and people make
good plays for other people and got our teammates a great shot, and we knocked
them down.  
  
Q. Daishon, you guys were down 58 ‑56, and you hit that three from the side.
It looked like you were well guarded on that shot. How tough was that shot?
How confident were you on it?   
DAISHON KNIGHT: It was a tough shot. For some reason, whenever I'm over there
in that corner with Justin McCloud, I feel like I've got all the confidence in
the world to shoot the ball.  
  
Q. When the clock winds down and the game's over, what is that initial
feeling that you guys have when you realize you just upset the No.8 seed and
you're moving on to the championship?  
REGGIE LYNCH: Well, I fell down at that point, but when I was watching my
team, I knew guys were going to step up to the plate and get it done. We all
know that last year we lost in the first round, and we finally won the game
yesterday and we got farther than we wanted to ‑‑ or not farther than we
wanted to, farther than we did.  
So the fact that we were up with the clock winding down, we just‑‑ we knew
that we needed to just play as hard as we can for as much time that was left
on the clock, and we did.  
DAISHON KNIGHT: It was a good feeling. It felt great to win another game with
your team. You try to stay composed and know that you got another game to play
tomorrow.  
THE MODERATOR: I have a note coming off that question, by the way. This is the
fourth straight year that Illinois State has beaten a top 25 team. That came
to me late.  
  
Q. Daishon, that three ‑pointer that you were talking about just a few
seconds ago, looked like Wichita State switched to zone. You looked at it and
said, that's our best option at this point because you don't have much else
working?   
DAISHON KNIGHT: I'm not sure. I felt a little bit of space there. I think it
was‑‑  
REGGIE LYNCH: Carter.  
DAISHON KNIGHT: Carter was kind of guarding me. He was guarding me for the
drive. Coach say you've got to step up and make some shots. So I took it with
confidence, and it went in.  
  
Q. Daishon, how much motivation was it for you to today, knowing they had
shut you out in the game in normal?  
DAISHON KNIGHT: I put that game way, way, way back. I didn't even think about
that game. I just wanted to go out and compete as hard as I can with my
brothers.  
  
Q. Reggie, talk about what you guys were able to do in the second half to
really slow down their scoring and take a hold of this game.  
REGGIE LYNCH: We went to our defense, our zone defense. That really worked
well in the second half. We stayed with those, and we were able to take care
of the middle of the court. I was able to get a few blocks down there. Guys
were defending well on the perimeter, and we just did really well, got in some
nice steals that led to some breakouts. It was a good feeling to have.  
  
Q. Reggie, yesterday the team had trouble, as far as fouls go, but the
message still from the bench, you could hear it today, was to be physical. How
tough is it to be physical inside but not commit those fouls?  
REGGIE LYNCH: It's hard. When you're trying to block some shots or contest
some shots, but you have to stay down on shot fakes and make sure the posts
don't get the ball close to the rim.  
But I've been working on it a lot of our guys have been working on it. I've
been defending the post a lot better. I got some nice blocks tonight. So I
guess it worked.  
  
Q. Talk about that last play on defense where you had to get one more stop
in, the emotions and just the excitement of getting that last stop, for both
players.  
DAISHON KNIGHT: You talk amongst your team, and the coach tell you what to do,
but he's not out there to play with you. You talk among your team, and you
tell them just ball in for the last little time remaining and go as hard as
you can. When that shot go up, miss or make. If it's a miss, go crash, get the
rebound. If it's a make, get ready for your offense.  
  
Q. Reggie, during that first half run, where you guys made only 1 out of 15,
what wasn't working? How did you guys get through that and not get blown out
of the game by Wichita State in that time?  
REGGIE LYNCH: I was watching the game yesterday, Wichita State playing against
Southern Illinois, and they were getting some steals, and they went on a nice
little run in that game. Similar to what was happening in the first half in
our game.  
We know what happens when Wichita State goes on runs like that. We needed to
immediately stop what we were doing and play with confidence like we were at
the beginning of the game and in the second half, and we got back to it.  
  
Q. Reggie, now you guys have to think about tomorrow a little bit. How much
maybe did the experience in the Virgin Islands help you guys prepare for that
game tomorrow?  
REGGIE LYNCH: Repeat the question, please.  
  
Q. Three games in three days tomorrow. You guys have done it earlier this
year, and you weren't able to pull it off in the Virgin Islands. How is that
experience going to help you tomorrow?  
REGGIE LYNCH: The Virgin Islands tournament, we won the first two games. We
know we can't come out sluggish, especially in the championship game. We know
we've been in a situation like this before, and we know the team we're playing
tomorrow is going to be coming out and trying to win it. So we need to come
out, and we need to win it.  
THE MODERATOR: Gentlemen, thank you for your time. Congratulations.  
  
Q. Coach, obviously, coming into the game this afternoon, your bigs are
going to have to play well today, and they really rebounded well. Can you
expound on that a little bit? Especially inside the paint, where you had six
blocks by Lynch today.  
COACH MULLER: We got whooped on the boards our last game. We knew it would be
a physical game. Wichita State is an extremely physical team. They're tough.
They play without fouling. John Jones has been playing great basketball.
Reggie Lynch had a terrific game on the boards. But it was a team effort, of
course.  
When that ball goes up, those guys, they go after it. We showed some tape this
morning of offensive rebounds from our last game, what we did wrong, and I
thought we did a good job. They still had too many offensive rebounds, but I
thought our effort on the boards was terrific even though they still got 15.  
  
Q. Coach, did you tell your team anything specifically to handle the full
court pressure that Wichita State is using?  
COACH MULLER: We worked on it a little bit. At this point of the year, you've
worked against everything, and we have a quick turnaround. That was one thing
we walked through last night. Really the only thing we walked through because
they have three different presses.  
What they do is they kind of methodically press, press, press, and they hit
you with the run sometimes. First half, we had a lot of turnovers, but they're
in the half‑court. Second half, we had five. I thought our ball care against
the press was critical to our offensive efficiency.  
  
Q. Back at the preseason thing, you said, boy, I think my team is going to
be the best team by the end of the year in the league. You got one more game
to prove it. You've got to feel pretty good about the way the team has
developed here at the end.  
COACH MULLER: I do, and I did. I thought we'd have a chance, if we stayed away
from injury, to be one of the best teams in the league. Northern Iowa and
Wichita State, to be honest, are better than I thought they might be, and I
thought they'd be really good. So I might have overestimated us a little bit.  
But as you can see, we've got some talent. We had some injuries we had to deal
with and some learning experiences, and we had to grow up. But we have talent,
and that's what I saw. I don't know who we'll play tomorrow, but they'll be
really good. They'll play really hard. We're going to go out there and do our
best.  
  
Q. Coach, the alley ‑oop earlier in the second half, as well as the clutch
three in the corner at the ten‑minute mark, can you just talk about your
emotion and your team's emotion on those two plays.   
COACH MULLER: There were a lot of plays that were pretty emotional for me.
What a terrific pass and dunk, and Justin's three‑‑ he passed up a three right
before that. We got an offensive rebound. And I said in some different words,
I said, you'd better shoot the next one, and he did. Justin's a great shooter.
He's been terrific for us lately.  
I can name ten plays that I thought were so critical on both ends, but to
shoot 60 percent against that team in the second half‑‑ I told the team, I
told them last night, we're going to have somebody have to play special, and
you've got to let it all hang out, and you've got to make some shots. You've
got to make shots against Wichita State. You're not going to out trick them or
grind them. You've got to make shots.  
Luckily, we did, and those were two really good ones.  
  
Q. Dan, after Daishon's free throws, did you guys think about fouling them
before VanVleet was able to put that up?  
COACH MULLER: We usually foul in that situation. I didn't love my rebounding
group if they went to the foul line. I thought we could take enough time off
the clock with our press to, at the very least, force an incredibly tough
shot. We've been playing so well, and our guys have been executing what we
wanted to do so well that I trusted our group.  
He took a tough shot. He'd have to make a tough shot, but I didn't like our
rebounding group.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the last two weeks about being able to get ‑‑
especially the two games with Evansville helped the team in this situation
today?   
COACH MULLER: I think that was critical. Those were our two closest wins‑‑ we
had a great win at DePaul that was very close. We had a great win at UAB that
was close, not quite as close as this one. In the conference, we hadn't won a
close one like we did the last two games. To go back to back against a good
Evansville team gave us confidence.  
We work on special situations all the time. We work on eight seconds left,
down three. So you just got to trust your players at that point. Huge free
throws by MiKyle. Huge free throws by Daishon. Huge blocks by some guys. Got
to make enough plays.  
  
Q. Dan, what were you ‑‑ what did you get out of the zone? What were you
trying to accomplish with the zone? I know you play it some. Is that the most
you played it all year?   
COACH MULLER: We played a full game against Bradley. We played it more
recently. We played it a lot at the beginning of the year. We got hurt. Our
length was bad. We went to man. When we got healthy, we played it more since
then.  
I thought we'd have to mix it up in this game. We couldn't guard them in man.
They were killing us. So we went to our zone. I'll be honest, I didn't expect
it to be that good against, but those guys are just locked in.  
They scored 22 points against us in the first half, except for just giving
them dunks, breakaways. Our half‑court defense in the first half after the
start, when they torched us, was terrific. It was just turnovers for buckets
and then the start of the game.  
  
Q. So on the three by Daishon at 8:56, you were good with that shot?  
COACH MULLER: Absolutely. The clock was running down. They had gotten switched
on different guys. Reggie was open in the post, but Carter was on him. He was
backing off of him. I think there was about 8 seconds left. Daishon had been
playing well. He'd been shooting it well. I always want my guys to play free
and confident, understand what a good shot is.  
But like I said, if you're going to beat a team like that, you've got to have
guys step up and be special, and Daishon decided to be.  
  
Q. In that run in the first half, where you missed 14 out of 15, what did
you do to be able to stay in the game? When that's going on, are you thinking,
this is not something you can do against a team like Wichita State?  
COACH MULLER: Well, you think that against anybody. It was, again, mostly our
offensive efficiency, turnover for dunks, a long rebound for a layup.  
The reason why I wasn't too worried, I thought our half‑court defense was good
enough, even during that stretch. We started the game great offensively. We
turned it over, and we got shook. So our offensive execution after those
turnovers, not that they did anything different, was really poor because we
were scared to turn it over.  
Sat them down at halftime: Execute and make plays. But I do think our offense
was good enough to win.  
  
Q. Coach, looking forward to tomorrow, national televised audience. Your
team has played a lot of close games this year. In preparation for tomorrow's
contest, how do you discuss that with your team? Will you make that a factor,
remind them that you've been in this situation before this year?  
COACH MULLER: I think you always want to draw on your experiences from the
year. That's why experience is critical in college basketball, unless you're
Kentucky.  
So we've been in close games. We've seen presses. We've seen zones. We've
played against this team two times. Anything that gives you focus and keeps
your mind on what you want to do. It always helps if your talents are close or
similar, execution. Game plan and execution. Ball care, playing with
toughness, and efficiency.  
I think this was a huge win. I think this group truly isn't satisfied‑‑ I
think. I'm pretty sure. We'll find out tomorrow, again, against whoever we
play. But I think we truly came down here to win three.  
  
Q. Your bench has been very good this year. I believe you're 18 ‑6 when your
bench has outscored the opponent's bench. How deep is this team, and how much
do you rely on them?   
COACH MULLER: Deeper than we got tonight. I rolled with those guys who
started. Our bench has been terrific all year. It showed up when guys have
been injured and guys have had to step up and move in. Since guys have been
healthy, other guys have been playing more than the guys that were playing
during the stretch.  
MiKyle McIntosh comes off the bench and plays more than our starter. Justin
McCloud has been unbelievable. John Jones playing his best basketball of the
year. And Tony Wills and Bobby Hunter, love those guys. I can put them in at
any point.  
Love the bench. We can play them tomorrow, but we've got 10 or 11 really good
players.  
THE MODERATOR: Congratulations. See you tomorrow.

_ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI_  
  

Northern Iowa  63  
Loyola  49

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Jacobson is with us, along with Jeremy Morgan and Marvin
Singleton.  
COACH JACOBSON: I thought our defense was good today, took some things away
from them. We were active, did a better job of making some of the passes
difficult than what we did at Loyola when we played them last. So that part of
it, I really liked.  
Then we got a great lift from our guys on the bench. The second half, they
were able to move the lead for us. That period in the game, I thought, was
really key. We had four of our guys in off of our bench, and they extended
that lead for us, and I really feel like that was the key to this game.  
  
Q. Jeremy, that play right before the half, you stole it and got the layup,
how much did that give you guys a boost going into halftime, just kind of
swing it in your way?  
JEREMY MORGAN: I think it had a lot to do with it. Nate did a great job of
showing them the ball like he was supposed to, and I just kind of made a read
and made a play on it. I think it did help give us some momentum going into
halftime.  
  
Q. Marvin, talk about just the physical play today, how it compared to
yesterday.  
MARVIN SINGLETON: Every game in the tournament is going to be a physical game.
Today probably a little bit more physical, being with Christian Thomas. He
takes a lot of rebounds, like myself, offensively and defensively. So to keep
him off the glass with that one‑on‑one battle as a team, I think we did a
great job tonight.  
  
Q. For Jeremy, lots of long twos today. Was there something in the scouting
report that maybe they were fighting on a shot take early and you wanted to
get something out that have?  
JEREMY MORGAN: We knew they were going to run it off the line coming off the
double take. We did a good job of using the ball take and making the read.  
  
Q. Jeremy, in the first half, Milton Doyle had a couple of possessions where
he was able to score. You came back in and really started to lock down him on
defense. Was that part of the game plan, to key on Doyle and give you that
assignment?  
JEREMY MORGAN: Doyle is a great player. He knows how to put the ball in the
hoop. I just try to play as aggressive as I can on defense. He's a great
player. I've just got to play as well as I can.  
  
Q. Marvin, I'm not going to say you got away from the way you guys played
defense earlier in the season, but how nice is it to see guys scoring 50 again
and just giving up less points?  
MARVIN SINGLETON: Could you repeat the question?  
  
Q. How nice is it to see that teams are struggling more? There's a couple
weeks in there when you were giving up more points than you were earlier in
the year? Now you're back in the 40s and 50s playing games. Just how nice is
that to see?  
MARVIN SINGLETON: Being that it's postseason play, conference tourney play,
possessions are going to be less. So we have to key on every possession, make
sure we play our best and do our defensive scheme like we talked about and
make sure we come up with the rebound instead of giving the team a lot of
second chance points. And we make sure we don't turn the ball over. That
limits a lot of teams scoring the way we're playing and the way we're rotating
and playing, play together as a unit. So it feels good.  
  
Q. Marvin, how important was it to keep them with a single offensive rebound
today?  
MARVIN SINGLETON: I don't know we did that, but that's a great thing. I'm sure
Coach Jake is pretty happy about that.  
  
Q. Jeremy, first off, talk about your play right before halftime, what you
were seeing and kind of how you got that turnover and layup. And then the two
three ‑pointers in the second half, was that something where you feel
uncomfortable, or were you just the open guy?   
JEREMY MORGAN: Going into halftime, we knew they were going to come out and
set the ball screen and I actually heard Coach Jake yelling, we've got a foul
to give. I actually tried to reach in there and take the foul if I needed it.
If I could get it, and I ended up getting it.  
Just the two threes, that came out of their double‑team. Yeah, I just felt
comfortable and knocked them in.  
  
Q. For either player, get Illinois State again for a third time, how hard is
it to beat a team three times in a season? And what challenges does Illinois
State pose now this time of year?  
JEREMY MORGAN: Yeah, it's always hard to beat a team three times in a season,
especially in our conference. Illinois State is a great team. They're really
big up front. They've got some bigger guards, and they're really big inside
too.  
So being really physical inside and boxing out and rebounding is going to be a
huge key to the game.  
MARVIN SINGLETON: Pretty much what Jeremy said about them being physical. With
their bigs up front and their guards get in the passing lanes and play really
aggressive. It's going to be a real tough game, a pretty good game tomorrow.  
  
Q. Jeremy, take us through kind of the player perspective a little because
you're trying to concentrate on your game, and all of a sudden everything is
going nuts as Illinois State finishes it. As you guys take the court for
warmups, are you aware of it? Are you trying to shut all of that out? How
cognizant are you of what happened the game before?  
JEREMY MORGAN: We were in the locker room getting the warmup and watching it
on TV. As soon as the game was over, we huddled up real quick and said, now we
just need to focus in on our game because our game is the one that matters to
us, and we went out and take care of business.  
  
Q. Marvin, it's your senior year. You get to play for a conference
tournament championship tomorrow. Talk about that, and then also are you
disappointed it's not Wichita State? A lot of people looking forward to the
two big schools going head to head. Comment about first being able to play for
a title.  
MARVIN SINGLETON: It just feels good to get this far in the tournament. Just
taking it one game at a time, one game at a time. It just feels good to be
able to play on Sunday and about playing Wichita State. I'm not going to worry
about what me and my teammates are doing and what coaching staff is having us
do as a team.  
I'm not worried about who we're playing against, us playing Wichita or
whoever's on that side of the bracket. We're just going to show up and do what
we can do.  
THE MODERATOR: Gentlemen, thank you very much. We'll dismiss you.  
  
Q. Now that I just asked Marvin that question, what about you? How happy are
you you didn't allow an offensive rebound today?  
COACH JACOBSON: That's a really good effort. Not happy enough to not be mad at
Jeremy for fouling the three‑point shooter, but that's a great effort to not
allow an offensive rebound. And that's going to be important tomorrow. There's
no question that Illinois State is good at a lot of things, and offensive
rebounding is one of them.  
  
Q. Coach, as much as your guys' identity is defense, I'm just wondering,
what was the reaction either from the coaching staff or the players when you
guys gave up 74 at Wichita State?  
COACH JACOBSON: I guess we went about our stuff the same way we always do. I
didn't‑‑ we went through the film, and it felt like we gave up some transition
baskets and gave up a couple of offensive rebounds. So we really focused on
those things. We hadn't done that very much for a long stretch. We'd been good
in both of those areas. So we went to work on that.  
Those things resulted in a higher number, but we just went to work on the
things we had to get a little bit better at.  
  
Q. Coach, Deon's obviously been your starter all season, but talk about Wes'
makeup. Even though he's not scoring a lot, he keeps that tempo and pace. What
kind of responsibilities do you put him on to keep the pace going?  
COACH JACOBSON: His personality is such that he's going to be going at a high
level no matter what the situation. He wears his emotions on his sleeve.
That's been really good for our team. It's great for his teammates to have
somebody like that.  
So for him, it doesn't much matter who we're playing or where we're playing.
He's going to play the same way‑‑ highly competitive and with a lot of
emotion.  
  
Q. Do you have any reaction when you found that Illinois State pulled off
the upset?  
COACH JACOBSON: No. Like Jeremy said, we were‑‑ I might have been standing out
in the tunnel watching the end of it. No, I walked back in the locker room,
and the guys were walking out, and we were getting ready for ours.  
  
Q. How hard is it to beat a team three times in a season, and what do you
expect out of the guys tomorrow in terms of rebounding and defense? Kind of,
again, what I asked the guys.  
COACH JACOBSON: There's some challenges certainly with beating a team three
times. Illinois State is so good up and down their roster. That's the
challenge that we've got in front of us now. Their guard play is very, very
good, and they're able to do some things with their defense in the full court
and the half‑court. They're able to play some zone and be aggressive in it.  
They do as good a job as anybody in our league for sure and maybe most teams
in the country, in it terms of taking turnovers and turning them into points.
So that's a real challenge in and of itself.  
And then at‑‑ boy, on our defensive end, when that shot goes up, you've got to
find a way to block them out and keep them off the boards. Then you've got to
deal with Reggie Lynch inside, and he's as big as a guy that we've seen all
year long, and he's obviously played very, very well for a good month and a
half or two months now.  
As I said, their lineup and their roster is very, very good, and they've got
size and length at positions, and they've got quickness out front. It's a heck
of a basketball team.  
  
Q. Coach, it seemed like in this afternoon's game, you guys did a very good
job of creating and taking advantage of transition opportunities that were
presented. Was there any additional emphasis placed on that heading into the
weekend? Also, how important might the transition game be heading into
tomorrow afternoon?  
COACH JACOBSON: That's an area of the game that it feels like we're getting a
little bit more as the season has gone on, and it's an area that I think our
team's really good. Deon, as he's shown in the two games here and really shown
his entire career, he's very good on the open floor and very good in
transition. I felt like last night that opened up the game for us.  
So it's something that we talk about all the time. There's an emphasis for us
to attack early and see if we can get something good before they can set their
defense. It's going to be that same way tomorrow. Illinois State's going to
play the same way in transition. So there's a chance this thing could go up
and down a little bit tomorrow.  
  
Q. Ben, what was the difference between the two games? Illinois State,
obviously, was a lot closer. Just home and away, was that the difference? What
was the biggest difference?  
COACH JACOBSON: Boy, we caught a night at our place. We had a lot of stuff
work for us. We had a lot of guys‑‑ we started the game, and I thought
Illinois State started it great and knocked in shots and a lot of toughness,
as we expected. But we made some threes early, so the game was tied after a
pretty good effort by both teams.  
In the second half, same thing. They came out and got a couple steals, got in
transition, but we had two or three guys throwing threes. So it was hard for
them to get closer. It was one of those games for us where we made a lot of
threes. Some things really went our way.  
But as I've talked about, they're terrific. Their lineup is terrific. They've
got a lot of guys that can really play and get a lot of things done.  
  
Q. This time of year, upsets happen, and the underdog ‑‑ quote/unquote,
underdog team has that certain level of belief. What do you say to the guys to
prepare them for a team that doesn't have anything to lose, let's say, and is
going to play with a little more looseness than you might see out of a
different matchup.   
COACH JACOBSON: We won't do anything different. I've mentioned it before. I
don't talk about the fact that we hadn't won here for four years in a row. You
can pick out the different things, and no different tomorrow. We're playing
for the championship.  
So we're going to prepare the way we always do. We'll get up tomorrow and do
what we always do, and we'll come over here and play the best we can.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much. Good luck tomorrow.

### [Porter Moser](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26501)

  
_ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI_  
  

Northern Iowa  63  
Loyola  49

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Porter Moser is here of the Loyola Ramblers. We're going
to ask him to make a statement about the game and probably go right to
questions.  
COACH MOSER: You have to really play well to beat Northern Iowa. They just do
so many things. They make you have long possessions because they take so many
things away defensively. There's a reason why they have 29 wins or 30. There's
a reason why they're top seven, eight in defense.  
We just never could get any type of pace going because they just grind you out
defensively. You've got to credit their defense. You just have to play really
well and physical to beat that team.  
THE MODERATOR: I'll take questions for the student‑athletes, Milton Doyle and
Montel James.  
  
Q. For both players, what does Northern Iowa do in defense that makes it so
difficult to consistently find good shots against them?  
MILTON DOYLE: They play very sound, make very few mistakes, play together,
talk, just energetic, made you make extra plays.  
MONTEL JAMES: They just play hard. That's the bottom line. They played hard,
and they just stuck together on the defense. they talked everything out. They
were just tough on the ball, tough grind on the post, and that was the break
point.  
  
Q. Montel, they were doubling you most of the game in the post. How
frustrating was that for you offensively?  
MONTEL JAMES: I kind of saw it coming. The coaches told me. But I just wanted
to be strong with the ball and make good passes out of it. Just be effective
enough to get the ball where it needs to be.  
THE MODERATOR: Gentlemen, thank you very much.  
  
Q. Porter, where does it put the program now at this point going through the
season getting the win last night and playing in the semifinals today?  
COACH MOSER: I'm proud of how far we've taken the program to date. The move
into the league was just harder than people think. For us, I'm proud of where
we've moved it, but I'm not satisfied where we are, and I'm hungry to get what
Northern Iowa and Wichita has, the two elite teams in the league. Obviously,
Illinois State getting that championship game.  
Very proud of the effort, the culture of where we're going. We've taken it a
long ways, but by no means satisfied. Very hungry to be on this stage and be
sitting here talking about Sunday's game.  
It should fuel us in the off‑season. We talked about last year fueling us, and
then this year we were picked unanimous tenth in the league. Milton was out 12
games. So very proud of the guys. I think the arrow's definitely going up. The
excitements going up, but unequivocally not satisfied.  
  
Q. Porter, I saw you pull your three seniors aside out of the locker room.
What were you saying to them right there?  
COACH MOSER: It was a moment between the seniors and I, and I just‑‑ those
three mean a lot to me, mean a lot to the program. I know they wanted this
badly. It's their last chance to play in an NCAA Tournament, didn't happen.  
So we just had conversation about a couple things, moving in the future here,
what could be happening in the next week or two with our team possibly, and
also just let them know how much they mean to me and the program.  
  
Q. Is Northern Iowa one of the more frustrating teams to play against? You
have to guard ‑‑ I don't know, taking chances‑‑  
COACH MOSER: It's a great word. Frustrating is the word. We felt last night we
were trying to get tempo. We're not the biggest team, but we want to try to
get tempo. They don't want to let you get tempo. They take away so much. It's
like going to the dentist. You're sitting there trying to‑‑ I think we only
took 39 shots. We shot 46 percent. We only took 39 shots.  
Because they grind out long possessions. They don't give you anything. I know
your question to the student‑athletes, but my take on what they do is their
huddle just orchestrates so much. They're so versatile, they'll jump out on a
ball screen, then they'll lateral, then they'll switch it. They change it up.  
They don't‑‑ they're always‑‑ they got five guys in sync that don't miss their
assignment defensively. Sometimes you get young teams, you got guys missing
their assignments. It seems like they're always on point defensively, and it's
a credit to Jake and his staff and those young guys.  
I think it's an amazing stat with Northern Iowa, someone said it's like minus
16 points allowed from last year to this year. That's a complete focus in the
off‑season. You achieve what you emphasize. That's an unbelievable stat. To
have that big a difference in how much they let up last year to this year,
that's a program focus and emphasis, and you got to credit them.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much and best of luck.

### [Gregg Marshall](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17087)

_ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI_  
  

Illinois State  65  
Wichita State  62

  
THE MODERATOR: Wichita State Shockers are with us. Fred VanVleet, Ron Baker
represent the student‑athletes. Coach Gregg Marshall is in the middle. He'll
open up with a statement on the game.  
COACH MARSHALL: We lost to a team that played really well, especially in the
second half. We obviously didn't shoot the ball well. We've got to do better.
We know we're going to be in the NCAA Tournament. So we'll get a chance now to
get back and get rested, hopefully heal and try to make a run in the
tournament.  
  
Q. Question for both players, after the final buzzer sounds, just describe
the feeling, the emotions going through your head.  
FRED VANVLEET: Just upset, obviously. Our guys are really competitive. We
don't like to lose, especially not in that fashion, coming down to a
one‑possession game. It's just heartbreaking. In that moment, you're just
numb. You don't feel it until you get back to the locker room.  
But we've got some high‑character guys, and we're going to stay gracious even
when we lose, the same way we do when we win. So we'll just take it.  
  
Q. For both players, the difficulty against their zone today, were you
surprised that they were as effective playing that zone inasmuch as they
played it?  
RON BAKER: We're pretty familiar with their zone, especially Fred and I. They
ran it a lot last year. We just didn't have a lot of presence down low today.
We weren't able to get quick ball reversals against the zones and sit‑ins
inside to stretch them out a little bit.  
We handled it well on a couple of possessions and got good looks at the rim.
Just came down to one possession. Wish we could have hit a couple more shots
today.  
FRED VANVLEET: I think you just got to beat it inside out. Surprised by it, I
wouldn't say that. Once you start not being effective and they're successful,
obviously, they get more aggressive, and they start extending more and more
and more, and that's just how it works. Got to beat it inside out. We didn't
do that consistently. We did it a few possessions, and it worked really well.  
You don't get anything inside from guards or bigs, and then you're just
resorting to three‑point shots. We shot 4 for 18. So that's that.  
  
Q. This one's for Ron. Ron, you've come a long way since your days at Scott
City. Can you describe your passion for helping underprivileged children and
the support of the Shocker community as a whole? Also, if you had one piece of
advice for people looking to follow in your footsteps, what would that be?  
RON BAKER: I always like treating younger kids with a lot of respect when they
come to our games. For one, I was in their position before, looking up to
players that meant something to me. So I was trying to treat those kids with
the most respect and give them my time of day.  
If I give them any advice, it's just be coachable in life. Listen to your
peers. Let your guidance from your peers take you where you want to go.  
  
Q. Fred, could you just run us through that last possession, the shot you
took. Did it feel good? Did it look good?  
FRED VANVLEET: I mean, it always feels good. That's not always the end result.
We had to play John up, and obviously we expected them to press, and they did.
It was zone press. When I got to the half‑court, I contemplated calling a
time‑out. I probably should have.  
But just trying to make a play. I had Ron in the corner, and I was looking for
him and couldn't get it to him. I was trying to put one up in the air and give
it a chance, and it didn't go. That's probably as best as I can describe. If
it doesn't fall, you suck. If it does, you're a hero.  
That's just how it goes, and I'll take those chances every day.  
  
Q. Ron, with the weakness of the zone, offensive rebounding, is that where
you guys were able to kind of stay in it by crashing the boards?  
RON BAKER: I'm not sure what the numbers are, but it felt like in the second
half, that's only where our points came from is second‑chance shots. A couple
of shots, when we did get it in the middle of the lane or in the post and we
kicked it out or penetrated and kicked.  
But I think there's a couple instances where we did get a couple of offensive
rebounds late. I took a three, and Darius had a nice rebound. I think he ended
up getting fouled.  
  
Q. Ron, you came out to a hot start in the first half. Was ISU doing
something specifically in the second half to slow you down?  
RON BAKER: I was just real aggressive in the second half. I think their zone
in the first half was more of a 1‑3‑1 with Lynch at the high post, and we were
able to stretch it out, and I was able to get a touch early in the first half
with him on me a couple times actually.  
In the second half, they were just extending it with three or four guys above
the free‑throw line, and it was putting a lot of pressure on us guards. We'll
put that on us. We didn't handle it very well, and obviously didn't execute it
well enough.  
  
Q. In the second half, they shot 62 percent from the floor. What were they
doing in order to get those shots off?  
FRED VANVLEET: Getting to the foul line helps. When you get in the bonus with
so much time on the clock, it puts us on our heels naturally. They've got a
lot of touches close to the rim for the big guys. Obviously, Daishon Knight
had a really good game. So he made his open looks. I think the game was won at
the free‑throw line for them.  
Then they knocked down the shots when they needed to. So you give up that type
of shooting percentage, bad things happen.  
  
Q. Ron, can you just talk about in the first half, you held them to 2 points
in a 12 ‑minute stretch. How is not being able to extend the lead by more than
eight at halftime, how crucial was that to the outcome of the game?   
RON BAKER: To be honest, we missed a lot of open looks in the first half. We
felt like we should have been up maybe 12, 16, around that mark. We did a good
job early on getting the scouting report into the game. A lot of their
actions, we were able to deny. Fred had some good ball pressure at the top of
the key, and we extended them out.  
  
Q. Fred, Ron, so how do you ‑‑ how long do you keep‑‑ how soon before you
get past this and start thinking about selection Sunday and practices this
week and what's coming up next?   
FRED VANVLEET: For me, it's a double‑edged sword. You don't‑‑ can't just throw
it out the window. You've got to sit with it and let it motivate you and learn
from it. But at the same time, we've got a really bright future ahead of us,
got things to play for still.  
If you hold on to it too long, it can affect you later on. I'm sure we'll
break it down and see where we can get better, get back to work. Get some
practices in, get your body right. But it's not going to leave our minds any
time soon. But I guess selection Sunday time, it will be time to move on.  
RON BAKER: Like Coach said, this next 8 to 12 days will be good for us. We'll
get back to Wichita, get home, rest up, get healthy, and obviously we'll break
down this film and learn from it. Obviously, other teams in the nation are
going to see how somebody beat Wichita State. We've got to get better at
attacking the high pressure, two‑three zone, I guess, and different things
from the game.  
THE MODERATOR: Gentlemen, thank you for your time. We'll stay here with Coach
Marshall.  
  
Q. Coach, they got into the bonus pretty early in the second half, and then
they shot 85 percent from the line. How difficult is it to defend whenever you
know that they're probably going to make it when they get to the line?  
COACH MARSHALL: It adds difficulty to your defensive principles. I don't know
how they got to the bonus that quickly. Just all of a sudden, I looked up, and
we had seven fouls. So I'm thinking‑‑ you know.  
And we were trying to pressure them a little bit, which we do from time to
time, and credit them. They went to the line and made their shots,  
It kind of reminded me of the Kentucky game last year here in this building,
same situation. They kept going to the foul line at the end. We had more
baskets, and Fred had the ball at the end down three.  
  
Q. Coach, obviously, this was a very emotional game today. Could you just
speak for the character of these two young leaders that were up here sitting
by you and your team as a whole.  
COACH MARSHALL: They're just dynamite. They really are. That's what I told
them. We've got to get back, and we've got to get healthy healed and well, and
we've got to use this as motivation. We can't splinter. We showed a little
frustration on the court today because we didn't play great, and things
weren't going our way. That's not us. That's not going to be us.  
But I'll go to the ends of the earth with those two guys and the rest of them
in that locker room, and I'm not talking coach speak here. You asked the
question. They're as fine a group of young men as I've ever been a part of. So
we're good.  
  
Q. Gregg, did you expect to see that much zone out of them today? What was
the major issue in trying to resolve that?  
COACH MARSHALL: They ran zone exclusively last year, and they tried to run
some man‑to‑man this year, and we were scoring pretty well. So they went to
it, I guess, midway through the first half, and they had some success with it.
So they were smart to stay with it.  
We normally knock down a few more jumpers. We normally get a little bit more
post presence. But we outscored them 42‑16 in the paint. So I guess‑‑ somehow
we got some post presence. We scored 42‑16 in the paint. We were 16‑9 on
second‑chance points, and 13‑6 on points off turnovers. 10‑0 on the fast
break.  
I don't know. It doesn't add up other than they just made more free throws
than us, and we've got to do a better job of keeping them out of the bonus.  
  
Q. Illinois State got the ball with about 17 seconds to go. What was kind of
the plan as far as how long you were going to trap and cause a turnover before
you fouled?  
COACH MARSHALL: What was the point spread at that point, Paul? We're down one
or two? One? I think we're down one, okay.  
We were going to press in the backcourt. Once they got it over half‑court, we
were going to try to foul the first available guy, and hopefully he was a bad
foul shooter. They beat the press that time. They had struggled beating it
previous possessions. And then there was one play‑‑ I have a hard time
recalling exactly what happened, but we had the ball, Ron had the ball, and
all of a sudden we fell down in between half‑court and the top of the key.
Somehow it ended up with Evan, and I think Fred took a tough shot that was
blocked.  
I have to go back and look at that one. That was a big, big swing there. We
had the ball down one, two, or three and didn't fare so well in the scrum.
That was our plan, to foul after half‑court.  
  
Q. Greg, Ron took a pretty hard collision ‑‑ fall, collision there. I think
it was Tekele there. How much do you think that affected his performance in
the second half?   
COACH MARSHALL: You'd have to ask him, Jim. I know that he's a tough kid now.
He's physically‑‑ all of them are, but he, Tekele, Fred, Evan‑‑ they were
checking Evan for concussions all day today. They checked him two or three
times. I don't know if he was lying to the doctors, but he took a big spill
yesterday and got a cut on his face and got a couple of lesions. He looked
like he'd been punched a few times. So he was able to go.  
And then Bake, that was a hard fall. You could hear it. You could hear bones
crashing on the floor. I don't know how it affected him. You'd have to ask
him. I know, if he's able to physically be out there, he's going to be out
there.  
  
Q. Gregg, what's your view on how you digest this and then move on to what's
coming up the rest of this week?  
COACH MARSHALL: Me personally? As I said, we're going to go home and get‑‑
hopefully, get healed and feel better. I've been diagnosed with pneumonia for
the last 48 hours, so I'm looking forward to getting some bed time and some
rest and knowing that we're going to the NCAA Tournament. We've got, what,
eight days now before we decide where we're going to go.  
We'll practice intermittently during those eight days and practice after we
find out, and we'll start preparing for an opponent.  
I love the fact that we're in. I love the fact that we're going to get a good
seed. I don't care really where we go. My wife wants to go to the West Coast.
I might want to go to the East Coast. I don't care.  
We're in the NCAA Tournament, so that's what we're going to dwell on. We're
going to dwell on getting better and healing and getting our bones and bruises
to heal and find out where we're going to go from there.  
  
Q. As far as the seed, how much thought have you put into where you might
fall?  
COACH MARSHALL: I don't know. I have no idea. They pay Joey brackets and Jerry
Paul, saw him over here, they play those guys to do that. And they have a lot
of big executives that sit on that NCAA executive committee to make the
high‑dollar decisions. My job is just to get in and be a part of the party.  
  
Q. Gregg, you guys were able to do a great job on Knight in normal. You
really shut him down. What was it that allowed him to get going today?  
COACH MARSHALL: He did a good job on us in our place, but we did a good job on
him in normal. 40 percent of the time‑‑ we've played him five times now‑‑ he's
really gotten off. He did it in our place this year. He's just a talented
player.  
Makes pull‑ups, uses the ball screen well, he gets to the rim, and he can make
the three. His line was incredible tonight.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much. Best of luck in the tournament.

### [Ben Richardson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28377)

### [Christian Thomas](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26504)

  
_ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI_  
  

Loyola  81  
Indiana State  53

  
THE MODERATOR: Christian Thomas and Ben Richardson will flank head coach
Porter Moser. We'll have a statement from Porter on this game and go to
questions for the student‑athletes and then come back to the head coach.  
COACH MOSER: Proud of our guys. They had a tremendous‑‑ they played hard.
Obviously, when you make shots like that. I've been on the other end of a
snowball like that.  
We have a lot of respect, so much, for Indiana State and their program. They
got us earlier this year, and our guys really took it to heart. Watching the
first two games when they beat us earlier in the year.  
The preparation these guys did, the focus, and the belief. Our defense created
some offense. Obviously, when you make shots.  
  
Q. Christian, can you talk about what you saw in those first two games, what
you corrected, and just the emphatic nature with the way that you corrected it
tonight.  
CHRISTIAN THOMAS: For sure. Something that we talked about a lot was we felt
that they just outmuscled us everywhere. They were more physical than us, and
they really just pushed us around. So we decided this time, not only were we
going to match in intensity, but we were going to be the aggressors. We were
going to try to use a lot of our strengths to our advantage, and I think we
did that tonight.  
  
Q. Christian, just playing at home today and having such a nice night and
also getting a chance to play at home at least one more time, what's that mean
to you?  
CHRISTIAN THOMAS: It means a lot just because I had a lot of family and
friends in the crowd today that haven't really gotten a chance to come up to
Chicago to catch a game. So getting to come back and play a great game in
front of them tonight and getting an opportunity to win another one tomorrow,
it's going to be great.  
  
Q. Ben, when you look up and you see that you guys are up by 39 points
against Indiana State in the second half, does it kind of seem almost unreal
to have a game go like that?  
BEN RICHARDSON: You know‑‑  
CHRISTIAN THOMAS: Answer yes.  
BEN RICHARDSON: We haven't had a game like that, but I think it's a good
reflection of how we've worked in preparation for this tournament. I think we
all believed that we could play like that. I think the coaches all believe
that. All of us in the locker room did before the game.  
It was just a matter of us, like Christian said, going out there, being more
aggressive, taking the game to them, and executing the game plan.  
  
Q. Ben, as a freshman, just what are your first impressions of Arch Madness?
You had such a great night tonight.  
BEN RICHARDSON: It's legit. I know last year, going through the recruiting
process and after deciding to come here, I was looking forward to this
tournament for sure. Getting to play close to home in a great venue, we had
lots of good support down here also. It's been real exciting, and it's been
fun. Looking forward to keeping it going.  
  
Q. Christian, you talked about wanting to be the aggressors, and I imagine
you feed off of that from your own aggressiveness, but when you start to see
your opponent react in a way you want to to your own aggressiveness, how much
do you feed off of that as well?  
CHRISTIAN THOMAS: It means we just turn it up even more. We had a mantra going
on in our time‑outs that we weren't going to let up because they hadn't let
up. They had beaten us‑‑ the past five times, they hadn't let up on us. So we
had to keep taking the fight to them. We weren't just satisfied with playing
hard for 30 minutes. We had to execute for 40.  
  
Q. A lot of St. Louis guys that have come back here have struggled to play
here. What are the pressures? Why is it difficult? You obviously were able to
overcome that tonight. Have you talked to Coach Looney lately?  
CHRISTIAN THOMAS: Honestly, I didn't feel any pressure coming back home. To
me‑‑ I can't say it was just another game, but I just know that I have a lot
of support from my family and friends. I could have gone out there and had the
worst game of my life, but I knew they would still back me up with everything
I was trying to do.  
  
Q. I'm not picking on, but Christian answered the last one, and it's your
turn. With the defensive stops you were getting, how easily was the offense
coming? You guys just seem to have gotten in a flow there. How was it?  
BEN RICHARDSON: It's always good when you're excelling on defense because it
does fuel your offense, and you can get good transition opportunities off good
stops. I think that was a big thing for us, stopping them, stopping their
penetration, keeping their shooters covered. It definitely feeds into offense.  
Getting the ball pushed and putting the pressure on them was real important, I
think, in that game.  
  
Q. Thoughts on the next round, playing Northern Iowa.  
CHRISTIAN THOMAS: Just another great opportunity for us. We're getting a team
that's beaten us twice during the regular season, just like Indiana State did.
I think we'll be up for the challenge. I know we'll be up for the challenge.  
THE MODERATOR: Gentlemen, thank you very much for your time. We're going to
dismiss you and stay with Coach Moser.  
  
Q. Porter, when you hear your players talk about wanting to be the
aggressors and really taking it to heart to do it and perform, what kind of
gratification does that give you as a coach?  
COACH MOSER: I've said all along we've got great character guys in the
program. We've been talking. Obviously, you get some time to repair when you
get to the Friday game. We talked and showed film, the pregame, everything we
talked about was that.  
I told them I made a mistake, and what Christian just‑‑ I made a mistake the
last‑‑ talking to them the first time at Indiana State. I said, you've got to
match their toughness. I told them I made a mistake. I said, you can't just
match their toughness. We've got to be tougher. We've got to do all that, and
they just took it to heart.  
We showed them so many plays where they outmuscled us, out physicaled us in
the first two games. They get it going. They really hurt us in transition the
first two games, and we came in at halftime, and the first thing I said was
they had zero fast break points. Like they all erupted.  
As a coach, you really try to‑‑ you achieve what you emphasize, and there was
about three or four things we were really trying to emphasize this week at
practice. Credit to them that they did it. I have just a tremendous amount of
respect for Greg, his program, and what they do.  
I said it before, I think they've got a ton of pieces, and we just got on one
of those rolls. But I'm really just proud of our guys.  
  
Q. Porter, when you first walked into the arena and had this huge smile on
your face, are you able to put into words how much you love this tournament?  
COACH MOSER: I love the Valley. I said so many times in my career, I said, God
has a plan, and it sent me to St. Louis with Coach Majerus. And now it sent me
to Loyola, and all of a sudden, we're in the Valley, back to the league I
played in and coached.  
I told the players, I'm totally jealous of you. I'd love to play in this.  
It's just walking out and seeing all the maroon and gold scarves. Loyola,
there just wasn't much excitement there. Now you're seeing people get excited.
That's how you want to elevate your program.  
We're not there yet. I told the guys, last year when we beat Bradley, we
thought it was like a National Championship. We got back to the hotel and saw
all the fans. I told these guys, it's just one game. We want to learn from
last year and be focused and come back and obviously be one of the top teams
in the country.  
I just love the Valley, and I love Arch Madness. I just think, when you walk
into that arena, it's something special.  
  
Q. They had shot well from three ‑point against you guys in the first two
meetings, and they missed their first 19 tonight. Anything‑‑ obviously, that
had to be one heck of a defensive change whatever it was because it worked
darn well.   
COACH MOSER: They did such a good job of penetrating and kicking. We were
really trying to guard the dribble drive and not get beat so much to where we
didn't have to help. We saw our stances. We were so open up with our stances,
and they were just driving by us and creating because they're unselfish kids.
They can create shots for others. They can drive by and shoot it.  
So I thought we did a better job at that. Did we do a good enough job to
(indiscernible) for 19? Sometimes you get on a roll, you get tight. We've been
on the other end of that. I know how well they can shoot it and drive it, and
that was just a focus of ours.  
Sometimes when you get in that snowball and it gets tightened up, like I said,
every coach has been on the other end of it.  
  
Q. Porter, my question was kind of asked, but to feed off of that point, it
was a snowball offensively, but it was a snowball defensively.  
COACH MOSER: I was really proud of that, absolutely. I was really proud of our
defense. We kept talking about deflections being tough. I thought our post
defense was good. We were trapping the post. I thought our post doubles were
very quick, and I thought we were getting deflections, and that was creating
offense.  
We were getting‑‑ we were really trying to‑‑ you know, we talk about we're not
the biggest team. We're one of the smallest, as a matter of fact. But we
wanted to be quicker and create some offense with our defense, and I thought
we did. I thought we got a lot of deflections that led into some fast break
points.  
  
Q. Coach, you mentioned last year that it seemed like you guys won the
National Championship after you knocked off Bradley. Did you notice in the
immediate aftermath of this game a difference in the mentality?  
COACH MOSER: We were able to talk to the guys on the bench right there. How we
won was in dramatic fashion last year. It was hard not to get so excited when
you hit a 25‑footer at the buzzer, but it was‑‑ we kind of said something with
like 30 seconds left, and we talked about it in the locker room. Our guys
know. We've got a huge challenge of ahead of us. I mean, huge challenge.  
In a tournament, you want to string it together. When you get that mindset,
that culture, teams that have won it before, they know. They know it's going
to be a three days of locking in. Focusing in. That's where we're trying to
head our program, and I really felt it in that locker room right there.
They're excited. They know what they just did.  
But there was still a respect about coming back tomorrow and preparing
tonight. We've got to prepare tonight. It's a late game. We've still got to do
a lot of preparation.  
  
Q. Porter, talking about that, just talk a little bit about facing the
Panthers tomorrow. And secondly, how happy are you for your seniors? They're
really achieving some success in their final go round.  
COACH MOSER: I tell you, those three seniors‑‑ they were here our first year,
and they had to endure a lot. I can't say enough about their character and
resiliency to keep fighting. Christian being my first young man that I signed
to come along. Probably never heard of Loyola coming from St. Louis, and to
believe in it what we could do here, to having him come home and play like
this, really happy for those guys.  
Second part of your question, Northern Iowa, what can you say? Just a very
good team. Another team with a lot of seniors. And they're on a mission.  
A lot of respect for them. I know we've got our hands full. When we walked in
the security gate, it was 36‑32\. We got our team set, kind of thing, and I
looked up, and it was 21. I don't even know what happened. I'm going to have
to go watch that tape. It seemed like they went on a snowball too, which I'm
going to‑‑ I'll watch that tonight.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Porter.

## March 6, 2015

  

### [Justin Gant](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24850)

### [Jake Kitchell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28379)

### [Greg Lansing](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21764)

  
_ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI_  
  

Loyola  81  
Indiana State  53

  
THE MODERATOR: Sycamores are with us. Jake Kitchell, Justin Gant will surround
head coach Greg Lansing. He'll start off with a statement on the game, and
we'll go to questions for the two student‑athletes.  
COACH LANSING: First of all, congratulate Porter and his crew. I knew they'd
be ready to go. Apologize for us not even giving them a test to help them get
ready for tomorrow. That was‑‑ there's no easy way around it. That was a butt
kicking from start to finish.  
I apologize to our fans. I thought our band and the cheerleaders and dance
team were much more into it than we were for the entire game. We got a great
group of fans that come down here. We've played better and fared better in
this tournament in the past four years, and they were excited about it. So I
apologize to them and our administration for the product that we put out there
tonight. That's not Indiana State basketball.  
Our character was revealed a little bit, and that starts with me, and it
filters down through everybody else.  
But I do want to say with these two guys sitting up here, they've done a lot
for us, and they're outstanding young men and are going to do tons of great
things in their lives. Really sorry that we had to have their last game be
something like that because they deserve better than that. Hopefully in time,
they can put that behind us.  
As a coach, that's all I'm going to be thinking about until we start practice
next year.  
  
Q. For Justin and Jake both, Loyola said that they wanted to be the
aggressors in this game. I guess how disappointing is it that you weren't able
to respond with aggressiveness of your own.  
THE MODERATOR: Jake first.  
JAKE KITCHELL: It's very disappointing. They came out, and they punched us
right in the face and played harder than we did. Just straight up, they wanted
it more, and it was clear in the way that we played.  
It's frustrating for the whole team, but it's simple. They just wanted it more
and played harder than we did.  
JUSTIN GANT: Like Jake said, they came out and threw the first punch, and we
never really responded. We were careless with the ball and didn't do what we
wanted to do on the offensive end. Then on the defensive end, we didn't fight
hard enough and didn't take anything away from them like we wanted to.  
They just ran their offense the way they wanted to and got the shots they
wanted.  
  
Q. Justin, it was 9 ‑7\. For a while, you guys hung in there defensively.
But do you think the accumulation of some of the missed shots eventually had
an effect on the defensive end?   
JUSTIN GANT: Yeah, I think so. It's frustrating when you're not hitting the
shots you usually do. Offensively, we weren't really playing as a team. We did
a lot of things one‑on‑one and didn't look to pass and get other people open.
So we did a lot of one‑on‑one game, which makes things tougher and makes us
take tougher shots.  
So I think that affected us on the defensive end and took away our
aggressiveness, took away our mindset from the defensive end, and we were more
worried about the offense and missing shots than we were about going down and
locking up on the defensive end.  
  
Q. For both of you guys, as Greg said, he wanted to reflect a bit on your
careers and just talk about your time at Indiana State. It obviously didn't
end the way you wanted it to, but kind of reflect on the entirety of it and
what you take away from it.  
THE MODERATOR: Jake.  
JAKE KITCHELL: I'm going to take a lot away from being a part of Indiana State
basketball. I've been very blessed and very humbled to be a part of such a
great tradition and such a great basketball culture.  
I'll never forget any of these guys that I've played with or been through the
good and the bad with. It's been a great five years for me at ISU, and I'll
cherish it for the rest of my life.  
JUSTIN GANT: We've made a lot of memories over these years, things that we
won't forget. I think I've taken‑‑ I'm going to take a lot away from it. I
think it's helped me become a better person and a better player, and just
thankful for the coaches and for the players. They've done a lot for me. I'm
going to miss it.  
THE MODERATOR: Gentlemen, we'll dismiss you. Thank you very much.
Congratulations on your careers.  
  
Q. Greg, I imagine you were as surprised as anybody was when ‑‑ not with
Loyola's intensity, but with your own team's response to it. What was going
through your mind as you started to see that unfold?   
COACH LANSING: Disbelief. I really don't have any excuses. I thought we were
ready, thought our practices were good. We probably could have went longer to
prepare for them.  
We do have a lot of new guys, but we have a lot of veterans to understand
tournament basketball. We were The Finals last year with these guys and how
hard people play. I mean, it's survival mode.  
Just disbelief. Surprised and disappointed, really disappointed in myself
because I take it very personally, as you know. I got to do a much better job
of getting them ready, and I'll learn from this, and I'll be better as well.
It's an extremely disappointing way to end the year.  
  
Q. Greg, same question I had for the players. 0 for 19 or 0 for 18 ‑‑  
COACH LANSING: 0 for 17 before we made one.  
  
Q. And a lot of the other shots weren't falling either. Do you think the
offensive woes had an effect on the defense and it all kind of snowballed?  
COACH LANSING: No question. We talked about it before. As a staff, you talk
about it all the time. The one constant has to be your defense. With young
guys sometimes, they don't see the ball go through the basket, they forget
what they're doing at the other end and don't compete like they need to. So it
definitely affected us tonight.  
And it snowballed. I mean, it really did. I give Loyola tons of credit. They
were the aggressor throughout. They had‑‑ they played with a tremendous
purpose. They were more determined than we were.  
Again, I think we've got to look in the mirror. Some of our character was
exposed, and it doesn't sit real well with me.  
  
Q. Since you beat them twice this year, do you think for some of the guys
there was an element of it's going to be easy ‑‑ maybe not easy. Maybe that's
not the right way to put it, but it's not going to be as hard as it was.   
COACH LANSING: Easier. You come out of the hotel lobby, and your fans are in
there packed and fired up. I think our guys are‑‑ maybe they had a little bit
of that. Maybe they just assumed they were going to beat them since they beat
them twice, and get another chance at Northern Iowa.  
You go back to what Kitch said, when somebody wants it more than you, it just
tears my guts out because that's not Indiana State basketball and the way we
should be.  
There's a lot of young guys there, some immaturity there, that that certainly
could come into play.  
  
Q. After halftime and you guys get the feeling of scoring on the first
possession, at that point, was there hope? Obviously, you had talked at
halftime about what they needed to do. Was there a brief glimmer there?  
COACH LANSING: Yeah, and then they went on a 12‑0 run. Looked down, and I
couldn't believe what the score was when I looked up a couple times. I really
thought we'd play better. We're a much better basketball team than we put out
there today. That's on me.  
  
Q. Moving forward, Greg, with some of these guys that are coming back and
some of the character that you saw tested today, what do you take out of that
and kind of use in the off ‑season to get them to not have this happen again?
  
COACH LANSING: It's going to be a tough spring. It will be difficult. If you
want to be a part of something as special as Indiana State basketball and the
way we take care of these guys, you're going to do the right thing, act right,
compete at a high level. It's an honor to wear our uniform and represent our
tremendous fans, and we did not do that today.  
So we're going to take this and learn from it, and my guess would be some guys
are going to get challenged. It's not going to be an easy spring. We're going
to learn from it.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Greg. Best of luck.

_ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI_  
  

Northern Iowa  71  
Bradley  46

  
THE MODERATOR: Josh Cunningham and Omari Grier represent the student‑athletes
for Bradley. Coach Geno Ford is in the middle.  
COACH FORD: Kind of a tale of two halves. First half, we didn't‑‑ we were able
to keep it junked up a little bit by changing defenses and kept them out of
rhythm, I thought. Second half just kind of ran into a buzz saw. They didn't
miss. That's why they were ranked 10th in the country.  
That was as well as they've played for a ten‑minute stretch. They do that,
they're not going to get beat.  
I thought that our offensive struggles in the second half exasperated it
because it led to run‑outs, and they got some easy opportunities in transition
that you can't afford them to get.  
They're a great team, really, really well coached, excellent players. I think
they could‑‑ we may be seeing them play for several weekends in a row. They're
really good.  
  
Q. Josh, what is it you guys were seeing out there that allowed you to go on
that run at the end of the first half.  
JOSH CUNNINGHAM: We've seen that we can trap the ball screens, and that was
working, and we were just trying to fly around and make them get out of the
things that they were used to doing to set shots. So that was working for us
at first.  
  
Q. Omari, you didn't play last night, but did you take that upon yourself to
be more aggressive looking for your shot tonight?  
OMARI GRIER: Most definitely. Coach Coleman, one of our assistant coaches,
always tells us to be ready when your name is called. So when Coach Ford had
called me to go in the game, he was just telling me just to be aggressive and
to look to score.  
I just felt like, me being a leader on the team and myself being a scorer, I
felt like I had to take it upon myself to be aggressive in order for us to
win. So that was my mindset.  
  
Q. Josh, your three ‑point shot was kind of come and gone this year, but it
was on tonight. Were you feeling comfortable with the gym, or what was the
difference tonight?   
JOSH CUNNINGHAM: Yes, I was feeling comfortable with the gym. Coaches always
tell me just shoot the ball and don't think about it.  
  
Q. Omari, you guys were able to keep Seth Tuttle contained, at least points
‑wise for the majority of the first three fourths of the game. Just talk about
what you guys were doing to keep him off the scoreboard.   
OMARI GRIER: I felt like we were trying to limit his touches a bit. We were
running a diamond and two, where we were just space guarding Seth Tuttle and
one of the other primary players. I felt like us limiting his touches created
a little bit of confusion for them, throwing them off, not allowing them to
run their offense. So I feel like that was huge for us in the first half,
which allowed us to stay in the game for the most part.  
  
Q. Josh, not to make excuses, but you guys did play an overtime game last
night. Did that have any effect on your legs in the second half?  
JOSH CUNNINGHAM: No, not at all. I just‑‑ we just couldn't keep the intensity
up like we had at the beginning of the game.  
  
Q. Omari, you've been with the program now for a while, and you had a great
anticipation in this season. It didn't turn out, obviously are the way you
guys had hoped. What was the mood like with the team at the end of the game
and in the locker room?  
OMARI GRIER: I just felt like it was very emotional for us. We've been through
so much adversity this year, both on and off the court. For the most part, I
would just say it was very emotional. We all care about each other in the
locker room, coaches as well.  
Before every huddle when we break it up, we always say family at the end of
every huddle, and that's what it is. We all look out for each other on and off
the court, and I felt like it was tough for us to go out this way, but we did
everything we could. I just feel like that's all you can really ask for.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much.  
We'll dismiss you. Stay with Coach Ford for a while longer.  
  
Q. Geno, you alluded to the switching up of defenses in the first half. They
still seemed to score some, and they built the lead up on you. And then when
you hit your run, was there something in particular that triggered that?  
COACH FORD: Well, we were trapping them, trying to keep them out of rhythm. In
the first half, they shot 45 percent, which is below their season average.
That would be awfully good for most of us. Might be a season high for us. They
just‑‑ you hold them to 45 percent, you don't feel like you did a poor job.  
It was a little tougher in the second half because the traps we were doing, we
were being more random with them in the first half. We were right in front of
our bench. So it was a little easier to orchestrate some of the late shot
clock traps, and at the other end, we weren't able to do that. They just got
it going at such a high level.  
It's kind of funny because Nate Buss, before the game up there, he was out
shooting around before the game, and I just said to him, could you ever miss
one shot against us? Just one. And he kind of laughed. It's unbelievable
because we played him that night, and he couldn't miss. And tonight‑‑ if he
played Bradley every night, Nate Buss would be the Naismith National Player of
the Year. He doesn't miss. When he sees us, he hits another level. He's a
really, really good player. He plays well against a lot of teams, but the
stuff he does to us is just disgusting. He kicks our rear end.  
He's good, and when he's making shots in transition a couple times. The one
difficulty of changing defenses as much as we were doing, in the second half,
you're away from your bench. They got two or three little interior dump off
layups and dunks because we weren't in the right spot.  
They can't hear you when you're 80 feet away. So maybe we should have stuck
with one defense longer, but that wasn't working earlier in the half. It was
just catch‑22\. We played a great team who played a great half.  
  
Q. You had Tuttle bottled up pretty well there in the first half. I think he
didn't score a field goal until two or three minutes into the second half.  
COACH FORD: We really focused on trying to take him away. He can beat you
multiple ways. He beat you with his scoring, with his rebounding, and with his
passing. Tonight you get to the end of the game, and you feel like you did a
decent job on him, and he had a double double with five assists, and we did do
a good job against them. That wasn't a very gaudy stat line for what he can
do.  
We just‑‑ when you have to give one guy that much attention, it opens up some
other guys. Certainly, Buss and some other guys were able to benefit from
that. I thought that we didn't‑‑ we triangled him the first four minutes of
the game. We played triangle and two on him and Mitchell, which the players
just accurately described as a diamond and two, which I'm pretty sure is
illegal. We could have used the sixth guy. Maybe that was our problem.  
Anyway, the triangle and two on him to not allow him to get going early.
Because they always come out and look for him, look for him, look for him,
which I would too. That's why Ben Jacobson is a great coach. They establish
him first. So he really wasn't getting touches the first five minutes of the
game. And that's why at halftime he only had one point because he just wasn't
in a rhythm of having it all the time like he usually does. But he's terrific.  
  
Q. Obviously, not the result you were hoping for tonight, Coach. Your team
made it out of the play ‑in game on Thursday. What can you take from this
experience in the tournament going forward and build on for next year?   
COACH FORD: I would say this. I think that four years ago we finished last,
and we were really, really bad. We were a bad basketball team. We came in and
inherited a team that had lost the leading scorer in the league and had
finished tenth, and we had two high major transfers gone too. The next year we
came in and finished fourth‑‑ I'm sorry. We finished tenth, but we won 18
games the next year.  
We're not that far away. We didn't get beat handy that often this season. The
majority of our losses were close games, and with two minutes to go, we
couldn't make winning plays. I feel like there was a couple things our team is
desperately missing, but it's not six things like it was.  
So I don't really feel like we're that far away from having a rebound season
like we did a few years ago, but I think that, when you look at our roster, a
few guys need to get better, and I think Josh has the capability of being an
All-Conference player. Northern Iowa's great because they have‑‑ Tuttle's
Player of the Year, and they have the great pieces around them. But they have
a Conference Player of the Year. Wichita is great because they have VanVleet
and Baker, First‑Team All‑League. Evansville finished up at the top of the
league because they have First‑Team guys. Illinois State has the Newcomer of
the Year who probably would have been All‑League but he was hurt and missed
most of the season.  
You have to have one of the top four or five players in this league to be any
good.  
You want to look way back, Creighton's here, McDermott, they win the league.
You've got to have somebody, and we feel like Josh is somebody that the
program can be built around, but he has to get to that level for us to get out
of the bottom half of the league. That's for sure.  
  
Q. Coach, coming into the second half being down by only two, did you feel
the team would contain them?  
COACH FORD: I thought, when we came out of halftime, we really went into the
locker room with a lot of momentum. We needed to get off to a good start in
the second half. And the first play of the second half, we got a great curl
jumper for Warren, who's our leading scorer, and he just didn't have his
jumper tonight, and it didn't go in. It's only one possession, but it's a big
possession.  
I think, had we been able to tie it a little there, maybe you hang in longer.
It was really the first media time‑out, and we were still down which two. It
wasn't the first media. I called time‑out at 16:20. I thought we looked really
tired. Our legs looked bad. Omari hit a jumper and brought it down to two, and
I called a time‑out. Then there would be a media in 30 second, so we could
kind of double rest them.  
I thought we looked flat. I don't know, last night's game‑‑ listen, we played
Northern Iowa 100 times. It's not going to be 50 for each team. That's not
what it's going to be. They're going to win a ton of them. For us to be
playing, we need to be operating on all sill cinders. I don't know if we could
have beat them tonight even when they were fresh and full go when we play like
that.

### [Ben Jacobson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19538)

_ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI_  
  

Northern Iowa  71  
Bradley  46

  
THE MODERATOR: Deon Mitchell and Nate Buss are the student‑athlete Panthers.
Head coach Ben Jacobson is in the middle. He'll start off with a statement on
the game, and we'll go to questions for the two student‑athletes.  
COACH JACOBSON: I thought we really defended them well. At the end of the
first half, they knocked in a couple jump shots, and we turned it over a
couple times and gave them some life. Give them credit for making those plays.
It's a ball game at halftime after I thought we had played really well for 18
minutes.  
Then we had some guys really step forward. Obviously, Deon and Nate were two
of them. These guys played great in the second half. We got into transition
and made some plays. Really proud of these guys.  
  
Q. For both of you guys, just talk about, as seniors, your first win in the
tournament, just any general thoughts on that.  
NATE BUSS: I just want to comment that's a great suit, by the way. That's
fantastic.  
It just feels good, feels like it takes a big load off our shoulders. Feels
like we got the monkey off our back, get the first win, get over the hump,
kind of like a mental roadblock almost. It took five years, but we got that
first win, and it feels really good.  
DEON MITCHELL: Like Buss said, it feels real good to come out and get our
first win. The past three years, we end up coming up short. Tonight we came
out, and it felt good.  
  
Q. For Deon, for you, do you feel like your offense fuels your defense? Or
is it is the other way around?  
DEON MITCHELL: I feel like they fuel each other equally. I feel like, if I'm
playing good on defense, my offense will get going. If I play good on offense,
my defense will get going. It works both ways. Each game I've got to make sure
I'm locked in on both ends to help my team and contribute as much as I can.  
  
Q. Nate, what do you guys feel you did different in the second half to put
this game out of reach?  
NATE BUSS: We just picked up our intensity overall. We picked up our
toughness. A lot of guys started making hustle plays we weren't making in the
first half. I think they were outworking us in the first half.  
We came out with a great mindset in the second half. We knew that, as a team,
we weren't going to get outworked, and we weren't going to get outplayed. I
think that was the difference coming out in the second half.  
  
Q. Kind of a similar question. What clicked for you guys? Because that game
just kind of took off from a back and forth one to all of a sudden you're up
20. What clicked to make that all happen?  
NATE BUSS: Our pace on offense really picked up, I think. We were running
things really well, whether it was zone or man. Another thing was our defense
was just outstanding. We were forcing a lot of turnovers, which led to a lot
of run‑outs. I'm not sure what points off turnovers was for us, but our
defense was fantastic in the second half.  
  
Q. Deon, Seth finished up with a double double, but he didn't get his first
basket until about 13:45 in the second half. Are you guys just kind of used to
the fact you may have to pick up the slack, they're going to double and give
Seth different looks. Did it panic you guys? Or how do you respond when people
bottle up Seth?  
DEON MITCHELL: That's what we expect every game. We keep trying to find
different ways to get the ball inside. If we can't get it to him, somebody's
going to have to step up. We just keep playing until we get it going.  
  
Q. Deon, were things opening up for you, or was it just you being a little
bit more aggressive today?  
DEON MITCHELL: I think once our defense picked up as a team, we started to get
more transition. It started opening up the floor more. They were trying to get
back into the zone, but once we started pushing in transition, it was tough
for them to get back in the zone.  
  
Q. Deon, were you reminded at all of the game at Drake when you were on the
court for 10, 12 minutes? I think it was even longer tonight. Just that
similar thing where you guys didn't make any shots?  
DEON MITCHELL: It felt similar. You never know when your name is going to be
called. You've just got to be patient and wait it out. It's not going to be
your night every time. We've got a deep bench. So you've got to be ready to
step up when your name is called.  
  
Q. 71 rebounds as a team for you guys, 23 for Nate. Talk about that. You
guys seemed like magnets, almost, getting all those boards.  
NATE BUSS: I'm sorry. What was that again?  
  
Q. 71 rebounds as a team, 23 ‑‑ points. My bad. I was reading the wrong stat
line. My apologies. But rebounds were 33 as a team, 11 for Seth. You guys
seemed to really dominate the boards.   
NATE BUSS: Yeah, rebounds has been a huge focus for this past week. When I
mean huge, I mean‑‑ I mean, we were doing a lot of drills where rebounding was
just the main focus for us. So we knew that was something we were going to
have to carry over big time into this game.  
Bradley has a lot of great rebounders, offensive rebounders, and they also
hustle hard off the board. We knew our technique had to be good, and we knew
we had to fight down low, and that's what we did.  
  
Q. Tonight had a chance to get a look at your team after a bit of a break.
What did you each learn from tonight to improve on going forward?  
NATE BUSS: I learned about our team. Something that I think we've known all
season is we're a mentally tough team. It doesn't matter how long we have
between games, whether it's a day, whether it's a week, we're going to come
out, we're going to be prepared, we're going to be ready for the game no
matter what.  
DEON MITCHELL: I just think we've got to make sure we come out prepared each
game and just focus each play and don't take any plays for granted. Just come
out and focus on every possession.  
  
Q. For Nate, regular season didn't end on the highest of notes for you guys.
How does it feel to kind of bounce back a little bit personally today and have
such a career day?  
NATE BUSS: Personally, it felt great. It felt great just to be able to step up
in a time when the team needed it to help get us that first win for all of our
guys. Just knowing that I was able to help out like that. It's great to be in
an offensive rhythm like I was today, like I haven't been all season.  
Like I said, just to know that I helped get our team that win is a great
feeling.  
THE MODERATOR: Gentlemen, thank you. We'll dismiss you and stay with the head
coach a little longer.  
  
Q. Jake, Bradley changed up defenses a lot there in the first half. Was
there a trigger point that kind of led to their late run? Did it have anything
to do with the defensive changes, or was there something else?  
COACH JACOBSON: You know, I don't‑‑ I'm not sure it was. We didn't have a lot
of offensive rhythm the entire first half, but at the same time, we were up‑‑
we had gotten up 13. I thought our defense was very good, and they missed some
jump shots.  
Seth had some opportunities in the first half, where they played him single
coverage, and he got pretty close to the rim. Those didn't go in for us. That
may have got us up maybe 16, maybe 18.  
Then we had a couple turnovers that allowed them to get it from 13 down to 2
right before the half. And give their guys credit. We were giving some jump
shots in the last few minutes, and within the last 2 1/2 minutes, they rose up
and made some jump shots.  
  
Q. Coach, what impressed you about your team tonight with this win?  
COACH JACOBSON: With everything going into this game, we don't talk about last
year or the year before, the number of years it's been since we've won a game
on Friday, but because we don't talk about it or I don't talk about it doesn't
mean the guys don't understand it and don't feel it. So there's certainly that
aspect of this game.  
I felt like, when we got deep in the first half, that we were fine. Once a
game like that gets close, some of that stuff can creep back in. To see Deon
and Nate as seniors step forward and put all that to rest and just drive us
home, I thought that was terrific.  
  
Q. Coach, even though Seth didn't have a basket ‑‑ I think he had eight or
nine rebounds before he scored a basket. Is that something you've seen Seth
mature in? Or was he like that when you got him? Is he a guy that would always
concentrate on other things besides the scoring?   
COACH JACOBSON: No, he's come a ways. There's been plenty of times this year
where Seth of freshman or sophomore year would have been frustrated with the
way he's being guarded, the number of ways he's being guarded. Tonight he
missed a couple of easy ones that he's been making all year.  
Yeah, when he was younger, that would have got to him, and tonight it probably
got to him a little bit, but he keeps it inside, and he continues now to
defend and rebound for us, and that's a real key.  
  
Q. Coach, what was the mood in the locker room like for you at halftime?  
COACH JACOBSON: The guys were fine. It's one of those deals. I felt like we
had outplayed them with our defense for 18 minutes. We turned it over a couple
of times, and like I said, they knocked in some jump shots. But for the
majority of the first half, I thought we'd done a good job. So just making a
couple of adjustments.  
The biggest key, I think, for our team, or one of them, is to be able to get
out in transition. I thought that really turned the tide, and that takes a
good effort defensively, and then you've got to go get the basketball. We
rebounded it well enough to get into transition.  
  
Q. Jake, when you go so long without subbing, is that something you
consciously think about? I'm not going to make a sub. Or are you more in the
moment and it never enters your mind?  
COACH JACOBSON: It's just during the game. It's not something I think about
prior to a game maybe is a better way of saying that. Just how the game's
going.  
That's where I give our guys a ton of credit because I don't tell them before
the game. If I feel like there's a better matchup here or there, who might
play more, who might play less. I don't ever talk about it with the players.  
Deon alluded to it. They're ready when they're on the floor. They know that
some nights it's going to be more minutes and some nights it's going to be
less minutes. Some nights it's going to be more shots. Some nights it's going
to be less shots.  
It's a unique team. I haven't coached a team like this before that has had
this kind of versatility and this kind of depth. Usually, the depth is a
little bit different, and minutes are more well established. These guys have
made it work.  
  
Q. Coach, I know it's always one game at a time, but there's this cloud
hanging over the idea of what could it be on Sunday? What's your message to
your team to get past and look ahead towards tomorrow and just your thoughts
on your opponents potentially for tomorrow.  
COACH JACOBSON: What would happen on Sunday? The teams for tomorrow‑‑ Lansing
is one of the best coaches certainly in our league, but I think in the
Midwest. He just does a terrific job. For whatever reason, our games with
Indiana State have always been very close and very competitive. So I would
anticipate, if it's Indiana State, that it's going to be the same thing.  
Porter‑‑ and I talked to him a little bit the other night‑‑ he's doing a
terrific job. I think that's the thing. I don't know how many of the coaches
have had a chance to talk about it, but this is a player's league, a coach's
league, a fan's league. Whichever of the two teams it is tomorrow, it will be
competitive as it always is.  
  
Q. Coach, you mentioned a little bit before that you don't really talk about
it, but obviously your guys were aware of the losing streak here. How much of
today is a relief that you don't have to answer questions from guys like us
about it anymore and you can move on from it?  
COACH JACOBSON: I'm happy for those guys and for our guys that are returning
next year, that they don't have to answer that question again. I'm happy about
that.  
THE MODERATOR: Ben, thank you very much. See you tomorrow.

_ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI_  
  

Wichita State  56  
Southern Illinois  45

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Barry Hinson of the Salukis is flanked by Jalen Pendleton
and Anthony Beane. We're going to ask Barry to open up with a statement, and
then we'll go to questions for the two student‑athletes of Southern Illinois.  
COACH HINSON: I'll make it real quick, and then you can ask these guys
questions. This is what we told our players going into this game. We did not
want VanVleet or Baker or the bigs to beat us because of what happened prior.
We said, we're going to make Cotton beat us today, and quite frankly, that's
what it came down to.  
That was the game plan, and then the second part, which is probably the most
important, is I asked my team to give me absolutely everything that they had
in order to win this ball game, and I got two kids up here right now that are
cramping up. I'll tell you, our guys, they gave us everything that we asked
them to do.  
And the best part of that is the glimpse because, when you start two freshmen
and two sophomores against the No.8 team in the country, you definitely want a
glimpse of your future and how it's going to be, and what I saw today was
encouraging.  
I'll let you ask these guys questions.  
  
Q. Jalen, we talked yesterday about our aggressiveness and how it helps your
team. How much of a better player do you think you are when you just put your
head down and just go to the rim as you did in the second half?  
JALEN PENDLETON: I mean, it works. It has its flaws. Sometimes I can't just
go, can't just put my head down and charging over, and that's how I turn the
ball over. Today they were real aggressive on defense, and they were trying to
deny us. So the lanes were open for me, and I just tried to take advantage of
it.  
  
Q. Anthony, what was their defense doing specifically in the first half to
force the turnovers?  
ANTHONY BEANE: I thought it was just‑‑ the only thing we really struggled was
just the press. I thought we got a little lackadaisical with the ball, and we
weren't running our patterns and press offense the right way. They did a good
job and just sped us up.  
  
Q. A lot of black and gold in the crowd as you guys, I'm sure, noticed. Can
you just talk about the impact they had on the game.  
JALEN PENDLETON: Yeah, every time they got a dunk or a stop, the crowd just
went crazy. You could see, once that happened, the players are bouncing
around. They had a lot of energy. You could just see that they turned their
energy up.  
It kind of affected us. Really when they started yelling, we kind of got
rattled a little bit, but after a little while, we just kind of played our
game.  
ANTHONY BEANE: Just really the same thing Jalen says. They've got a great
crowd. Whenever they do something good and get a turnover or just get a
bucket, the crowd goes crazy. It's hard. In my opinion, it's just a great
crowd because no matter what, you're going to hear them. It's even better at
their place because they're on top of you. They just have a great crowd.  
  
Q. Anthony, could you just talk about what you take away from getting within
seven or eight most of the second half and just weren't able to put two
baskets together to put some real pressure on them in the second half.  
ANTHONY BEANE: Say that again.  
  
Q. What can you say about keeping them close in the second half and just not
putting enough baskets together to put some pressure on Wichita State in the
second half?  
ANTHONY BEANE: I thought it really came down to our defense. They got a lot of
easy buckets. We got some good shots, we just weren't hitting them. We didn't
get the shots we needed to get in the game, and they got a lot of transition
buckets.  
  
Q. For both of you guys, like Barry was just saying, you've got a really
young team with most of your pieces coming back for next year. What's the
feeling like right now as you start to look forward to next season?  
ANTHONY BEANE: I think it's a good thing because all year, all the young boys,
they've been positive. A lot of them come from winning programs, so they know
what it take. It's just good to see them every day because, even though the
way our season went, they came in ready to work, hungry, ready to play every
day.  
Today them playing hard, it just showed a lot of them and their character and
what they can really bring to our program. As a team, I feel like we can build
on that because we know what it takes, and now they know what it takes to be
beat Wichita State.  
JALEN PENDLETON: I think our future is pretty bright. Guys like Jordan
Caroline and Deion Lavender, those guys can play basketball. Jordan, he's high
energy, and he just plays hard. You can always count on Jordan to play hard.
He's always going to play 100%. Deion, as you can see at the beginning of the
season, it was kind of low for him, but after a while, he picked it up. Deion
is a tremendous scorer for us.  
I just think, with all of us coming back next year, we can make a big run.  
  
Q. So you guys talk about the positives of your team. What do you think are
some of the things the team needs to address or improve on for next season.  
JALEN PENDLETON: Really, we just have to improve. I think more what we need to
do is improve on the defensive end, keeping guys in front of us, just helping
our teammates out. Being in help defense, really just more on the defensive
side of the ball.  
JALEN PENDLETON: Same thing he said. I think our problem is just focus. We
lost focus a couple of times, most of the times in the games. Now they know
what it takes. Like he said, on defensive end, we make a lot of defensive
mistakes. I just feel like, like I said earlier, now we know what it takes,
and now we know what we have to do in order to win in the Valley.  
  
Q. Anthony, when did you start cramping up? At what point in the second
half? Did it affect your play a little bit before you finally had to come out
for good?  
ANTHONY BEANE: I didn't catch a cramp. It was just my knee. I'm having a
couple knee problems, but I'm good. It was just‑‑ yeah, I'm good.  
THE MODERATOR: Gentlemen, we'll excuse you now. Thank you very much for your
time here.  
  
Q. Coach, will you just also talk about the fans and the impact you thought
they had on the game.  
COACH HINSON: Obviously, you're from Wichita. So let's see. I got to do it for
you too. If you've ever heard me interviewed when I talk about the Valley, one
of the things I talk about is Wichita State. And I don't know what their‑‑ I
don't know what they see, but I always see, every time you play there, it's
always 10,500, 7,500.  
It's been like that forever. It was like that when Scott Thompson was there,
back in the days when Coach Self and I were at Oral Roberts together. I have
nothing but admiration for the program and the community because they support
basketball. It's the sport. It's the sport in the state of Kansas, we know
that.  
They've gotten to the point, when I got early in the Valley, Mark got it jump
started, and the crowd started following them, but they were still a little
fickle at that time. What Gregg did when he took over was he created an
atmosphere that we're going to take fans wherever we go. I think that's been
very impressive.  
I think you credit two things‑‑ or three things. You credit‑‑ obviously,
winning is the most important. You credit a guy that drives it in Gregg
Marshall. And you credit an administration that really supports their athletic
program, and what Eric has done with their overall program is pretty
impressive.  
I take great pride in that because I'm a part of this conference. I take great
pride in it because they're a member of our conference. And I have no
problems‑‑ I check my ego in a long time ago. I have no problems bragging
about them or Gregg or his kids.  
And what they've done has been very, very representable for us and our
conference. Do you think that will make your boss happy? Okay. Other than
sending his wife flowers, I think that's about as good as it gets.  
Anybody else want to talk about Wichita State while we're here?  
  
Q. I got one for you, Coach. I'm just curious, it seemed like at times you
guys struggled, obvious, with their press a little bit. So I would say,
looking ahead to tomorrow, whether it's Evansville or whoever playing them
tomorrow, what would you say to that team to handle Wichita State's press
better?  
COACH HINSON: Really, you noticed that we struggled against their press? Huh,
I didn't notice that with the three time‑outs I called in the first half.  
The thing that you have to do‑‑ and it's really hard, especially with young
guys‑‑ you've got to get by the aura. It's just basketball. Go play, do what
we do, and do it well.  
We just‑‑ we were paralyzed because we got afraid, and we panic, and we were
just paralyzed. If I had to tell anybody that was going to play against them,
you just go play. You've got people out there that are dealing with a lot
bigger issues than a 1‑2‑2 press. Just do what you do and do it the best you
can.  
I was pretty good until we opened up duck hunting season and threw a couple of
ducks as passes. I didn't panic. I just lost my composure. I'm a Baptist. I'm
going to have to go to confessional tomorrow because of a couple of words that
I used during that span.  
  
Q. Barry, looking back now, the struggles you've had with turnovers in some
games, how much of it is nerves, do you think? How much is it you struggle to
establish a true point guard that can handle the ball 35 minutes a game?  
COACH HINSON: I don't think there's ever‑‑ there's never a replacement for
experience. We played‑‑ we were expecting point guard play to be better than
what we anticipated. It wasn't quite what we had hoped for.  
So I think it's twofold. I think you answered the question. It's we will go
recruit a point guard, or more than one point guard, and I think that will
help us a lot. And I think a lot of this will naturally happen just because
guys are going to be able to‑‑ we're actually going to have seniors next year,
and it will be my‑‑ this is my only team I've ever coached in the history of
my coaching, that we didn't have a senior on scholarship. We had no seniors.  
Naturally, I think part of this will take place and help us.  
  
Q. Barry, all season long, you've been talking about the maturation of this
group. I asked you in the conference call, you said a couple of players have
stepped up. How does this team ‑‑ you know, the team you saw today, how does
this compare to the beginning of the year?   
COACH HINSON: Oh, it's night and day. I think you would agree too. Anybody
that watched us today or the last two games would say‑‑ there's nobody that
watched that game today and just said, those guys aren't very good. I mean, we
gave everything today. We outrebounded them. We played incredible defense. We
hold them to 56 points, and they're the No.8 ranked team in the country. We
were the first on every loose ball. Every loose ball, we were the first team
to get on the floor. We outrebounded them. We had 11 offensive rebounds. All
of those are efforts.  
We stuck with our game plan, and I think that's‑‑ to me, that's a glimpse of
what can be. That's what I told them in the locker room. I liked what they
did. They answered the call. They answered the challenge, and they gave us
everything that we asked for them to do.  
I don't mind telling you, we're in a gun fight at O.K. Corral. We ran out of
bullets. I'm sorry. Our bullets and our guns weren't big enough.  
  
Q. With Wichita State being No. 1 in our conference and No.8 in the nation,
that's a little intimidating, intimidating enough that it can make some people
give up right from the beginning. We didn't do that. We came out strong, and
we took the lead for a good part of the beginning. What was ‑‑ what did you
guys talk about in the locker room before the game began that made that push
so strong?   
COACH HINSON: First of all, when we play at Wichita State next year, will you
go to that game and ask questions like that? Maybe this guy will listen too,
and maybe we can promote SIU when we go to Wichita. There we go.  
What I just said previously is what I ask them. That's all I ask them. I said,
have fun, and I said, when we face adversity‑‑ and I put who, question mark,
who's going to answer the bell? I said, well, let me answer the question for
you. It's us.  
At halftime, I went and put an X through us, and I said, it's not us. We're
complaining about the officiating. We're pointing fingers at each other. He's
not trying to get‑‑ all that stuff just kind of came back, and in the second
half, we took care of it, and consequently we played better.  
But thank you. I appreciate the question.  
  
Q. Barry, you've obviously been coaching for many years now, but you never
made it to the NCAA Tournament in your career as a head coach. Is that
something that bothers you at all?  
COACH HINSON: It used to. It used to a lot. I think that's a very good
question. When you've had teams that are 21, 32, 24 in the RPI and don't get
in, you're a little chapped about it. There will never be another 21, ever‑‑
quote me, ever‑‑ to get in the tournament.  
But going to Kansas helped a lot because we played in the NCAA Tournament
every year, and I got to put my hand over my heart in the National Anthem of a
National Championship Game. So I've let that go. I've let that go.  
And it's been‑‑ as my wife will tell you, it's been a challenge because I've
been really angry about it. But I let it go, and I really appreciate what I
get to do every day. I love my job. I get to be around kids every day, and I
love this conference, and just to be a part of it is a blessing.  
  
Q. Coach, what would you say were some highlights of this SIU basketball
season?  
COACH HINSON: We got off to a great start nonconference‑wise. I thought we did
a decent job and kind of faltered in the middle. I think the highlight for us
culminated here in the end. I think that's when you want to play your best
basketball. We played a team that swept us and beat them. We played another
team that swept us and really swept us bad, and we put ourselves in a position
to win a ball game.  
So I think, when I look at it, you always want to judge your teams on how they
play at the end of the year‑‑ how they play, how they compete, how they fight.
I'm proud of that. I really am. I know that was the last question.  
I'm going to tell you something. I had a friend sit right there for the
previous 11 years. I miss Bryan Burwell. I miss Bryan Burwell. Thank you for
honoring him for this media room. I miss you, Bryan.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Barry. Best of luck.

# [MISSOURI VALLEY CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=MISSOURI+VALLEY+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 6, 2015

  

### [D.J. Balentine](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26489)

### [Mislav Brzoja](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28364)

### [Marty Simmons](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20513)

  
_ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI_  
  

Illinois State  71  
Evansville  67

  
THE MODERATOR: Mislav Brzoja and D.J. Balentine represent the Evansville Aces.
Coach Marty Simmons is here as well.  
COACH SIMMONS: Just got to tip your cap to Illinois State. They made a lot of
big plays, really throughout the second half, but I like the way our guys
competed. They just made a couple more plays than we did, but I'm proud of our
guys.  
  
Q. Mislav, Coach talked this week about how aggressiveness is on the top of
your to ‑do list. Do you think you guys matched them in terms of the
aggressiveness tonight?   
MISLAV BRZOJA: I think we did. We definitely were much more aggressive on our
defensive rebounding. We rebounded the ball pretty well, and on the offensive
end, we executed, but we didn't finish very well on the free‑throw line.
That's something we have to work on.  
  
Q. D.J., second half, what changed offensively? Was it a matter of them
ramping up their defense or you guys finding a little bit less openings?  
D.J. BALENTINE: Just more aggressive, I'd say. I think we found opportunities
early to score the bucket with the easy plays. And then got out in transition
a lot.  
  
Q. D.J., how do you kind of process this ‑‑ I guess, this season and the
last month. There's been winning streaks and losing streaks the last month and
losing on back‑to‑back close games. How do you kind of wrap that up, where you
feel you guys are at now?   
D.J. BALENTINE: Just got to get better overall. It's very tough right now, but
obviously we've just got to get better and try to take this as a positive.  
  
Q. D.J., it looked like you maybe turned your ankle there in the first
quarter. How much did that affect you the rest of the game?  
D.J. BALENTINE: Really bad. The whole first half, I couldn't move on it, so I
had no rhythm. I went back at halftime, and they put three or four layers of
tape on there extra. It just hurt the whole game. It's just really
unfortunate.  
  
Q. Mislav, it seemed like their shooters got open a little bit. Was that
just a case of overhelping on some of their penetration?  
MISLAV BRZOJA: That was just part of the game plan.  
  
Q. For either of the players, Hawkins made 4 of 6 from three. Was that
something that kind of surprised you guys a little bit? He didn't obviously
shoot that well against you guys, I don't believe, in either game earlier this
season.  
MISLAV BRZOJA: That was a risk we were willing to take as a team, and I guess
he had his night today.  
THE MODERATOR: All right, gentlemen. We'll dismiss you. Thank you very much
for your time. We'll stay with Coach Simmons for a while longer.  
  
Q. What about the comeback in the second half? Seemed like they had all the
momentum on their side with their start to the second half. What did you guys
do to turn it around there?  
COACH SIMMONS: We just did a better job of keeping our composure. I really
thought the start of the second half we got some good looks. We just didn't
capitalize on them.  
Now, on the defensive end, we weren't executing. They came out a little more
aggressive. They're not an easy team to defend. They've got quick perimeter
players, athletic perimeter players, and then they're big inside. So got to
kind of pick your poison.  
And you show a lot of help off those high ball screens. There's got to be good
rotations. Then they skip it back. You've got to have really good close‑outs.  
First half, I thought we were really sharp, did an outstanding job. As the
game went on, we got just a little bit slower, little bit later. Hawkins, he
hurt us in the first half. We made an adjustment on the ball side, where we
weren't going to allow him to touch us on the ball side. But when they're
going away from the ball and they're rolling Lynch into the post, you've got
to help, not give up the layup. Now they did a good job of skipping it back,
and we were just a little bit late in our recoveries.  
I just thought our guys hung in there and battled throughout the entire‑‑ just
the start of that second half, we weren't getting any stops, and I thought we
missed some pretty good looks on the offensive end.  
  
Q. Do you feel like you guys have done enough earlier in the season to get
invited to some sort of postseason? What's kind of the process with that? Do
you keep practicing next week?  
COACH SIMMONS: I've probably got a biased opinion, but, yeah, I do. We play in
a great conference. We've lost four in a row here. Illinois State is a good
team. Northern Iowa is whatever they're ranked, and Wichita State. We played
the top three or four teams.  
But I thought we competed really hard today. I thought we were a lot better
today than we were Saturday. We'll go back and watch the tape, but I think,
when you look at the body of work of this team, that I'd like to think
somebody would like for us to participate.  
  
Q. How important was it to play well, to have Mislav making plays on the
offensive end tonight?  
COACH SIMMONS: It's important that we get them all doing that. I thought he
was outstanding. Made some great passes. He knocked in some shots. He
rebounded the ball. When he plays like that, it really helps us, not just
offensively, but the entire game. I mean, he has the ability to make an impact
on both ends of the floor.  
  
Q. Were you happy with where you were at the end of the first half
considering how much foul trouble you had to juggle with your big guys?  
COACH SIMMONS: I mean, we were happy we were able to stop them that last
possession. We really got off to a good start. We had pretty good rhythm. They
increased their pressure a little bit, and it kind of stymied us, and we kind
of just played through it a little bit. We never really got back to being and
having that sharpness that I thought we had maybe in the first ten minutes.  
That's a credit to them, and I think that's something we really got to
concentrate on. That's been an Achilles heel of this team all year is, when it
gets really hard, we tend to stop running offense and play one‑on‑one. We got
to learn from it.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much.

_ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI_  
  

Wichita State  56  
Southern Illinois  45

  
THE MODERATOR: Victorious Shockers are here. They are now 8‑3 as a No. 1 seed
in this tournament. They have a date tomorrow against the winner of Illinois
State and Evansville. Fred VanVleet, Ron Baker are here representing the
student‑athletes. Gregg Marshall is here as well. We're going to ask Gregg to
give us a statement on the game.  
COACH MARSHALL: We didn't play well. I thought Barry had a good game plan. We
defended very well. Just glad to move on.  
  
Q. Fred, a lot of the times, the team had Anthony Beane on you, and seems to
make it kind of tough on you to start the game. What were the some of the
things you did in the second half to really get going and keep your team in
the lead?  
FRED VANVLEET: He's a good player. We didn't do anything particularly special.
We didn't really play as well as we could have, but we got the win. Just make
adjustments throughout the game, however the game is flowing, and take what
the defense gives me.  
Thought Tekele was big and made a lot of big plays with the ball, off the
ball, and opened things up. We did enough to get it done.  
  
Q. Fred and Ron, how did you press change the momentum of the game there in
the first half when you were down?  
RON BAKER: I think it changed when we got the game. Any time we can press and
speed the other team up and get the steals and start our transition game, it
definitely gets us flowing and gets us energized and helps us out a lot.  
FRED VANVLEET: We just didn't come out aggressive enough early. Obviously,
they did, and they had the momentum. Like he said, the press changed the game
and got us on our toes and being aggressive, got a lot of deflections,
speeding the game up. So that helped a lot.  
  
Q. Ron, what did you feel you guys didn't do today?  
RON BAKER: Rebound.  
  
Q. For both players, how much of a factor did the fans play in today's game?
Obviously, a neutral site, but it seemed like a home game with the amount of
fans.  
FRED VANVLEET: Like I said yesterday, obviously, we've got a really big fan
base. Not sure how much of an impact it had on the game, but we really
appreciate everyone coming out. We just try to pay it back by playing as hard
as we can.  
  
Q. Ron, about the fans, what did you think?  
RON BAKER: Our fans travel well, like I said yesterday as well. Our fan
support is, I think, best in the Valley, and you saw that today with the
amount of black and gold in the stands.  
  
Q. Fred, you mentioned Tekele playing well with the ball. Is that something
he's gotten better at? What does that add to the offense when he can kind of
facilitate and help run things?  
FRED VANVLEET: It definitely adds another dynamic when he's aggressive and
driving downhill. He's definitely gotten better throughout the years, but
especially this season, he's taking what the defense gives him. A lot of teams
like to sag off of him, and when he gets it going downhill, it just makes it
harder, puts more pressure on the defense and kind of collapses everything.  
He had a few good drives in the first half, and then in the second half as
well, that just kind of opened up the game for us. So we need him in attack
mode at all times.  
  
Q. Fred, with about five minutes left, there was that nice alley ‑oop pass
to Zach Brown. What did you see there? Did you see that as kind of a dagger,
as something to really get your team going motivation‑wise?   
FRED VANVLEET: No. We were just trying to close the game. I think Ron and
Darius were fighting over a rebound, and they crashed the glass so hard, I
think they had all five down there. If we're able to get the outlet pass, it
was just me and Zach by ourselves basically.  
But I wasn't really focused on the dagger or anything. It was still five
minutes to play, and those guys aren't going to quit.  
We just did what we had to do to get the job done, and we did. So I think all
of us are looking forward to moving on.  
  
Q. Ron, when you guys were making your run there in the first half, it
looked like Shaq really ran the court well, and you hit him, I think, with a
bounce pass for a dunk. Is that the kind of play he maybe wouldn't have been
able to make two months ago and he's doing more of? That kind of running the
court well and getting more open.  
RON BAKER: He might have made the play two months ago, but he would have
started at the three‑point line where we're on the other end of the court. But
he's coming along, and those are the little things we've been asking Shaq to
do‑‑ run the court, screen, roll as hard as you can, and just do the little
things right.  
  
Q. You guys said you came out a little slow. Was there anything said on the
bench to wake you guys up, or did you guys just wake up yourself?  
FRED VANVLEET: I think we got a pretty damn good coach, but for the most part,
we just take the onus on ourselves. There wasn't just any conscious decision
to come out in the game and not be aggressive, but that's just what happened.
We were able to turn around and get the momentum back. We got guys that don't
like to lose, and I think that's all that is.  
RON BAKER: We just weren't‑‑ we weren't really efficient in the game on
offense. Obviously, Beane hit some really tough shots, and that's how they got
their lead. I just think we came out a little flat and on our heels in offense
and weren't very aggressive.  
  
Q. Either of you guys ever have players on the other team come up to you and
say something to the effect of we wish we had our fan base travel with us like
your guys' do?  
FRED VANVLEET: No, not throughout the course of the game. I'm sure they do. I
would if the shoes were on the other foot. But I've never had that happen in
the game, and if it did, I probably wasn't listening anyway.  
RON BAKER: No players usually talk about the other team's fans to me, but I
had a couple times when players come up to me and talk about Koch Arena and
stuff like that.  
THE MODERATOR: Gentlemen, thank you very much for your time. We'll see you
tomorrow. Going to stick with Coach Marshall a little longer.  
  
Q. Gregg, there was a time in the second half when you had Kelly, Brown, and
Morris all on the floor together. I know you've been working to develop those
three all season long. Was that by design, and how do you feel they've
progressed? Is that ‑‑ can you see that as a future front line for you guys?
  
COACH MARSHALL: No, it wasn't by design. I just‑‑ I obviously put those guys
in, and I looked up, and I saw the same thing. Probably too many freshmen, but
they played pretty well in that segment together. Didn't hurt us.  
I think they're all progressing at different rates.  
I thought Brown was pretty good tonight. Shaq was pretty good in the first
half. I didn't think he had a very good second half, played with a lot of
energy. And Rashard has had his moments.  
I like that group. I like those young players. They've just got to keep
getting better.  
  
Q. Coach, I want to say congratulations on the win, and also I want to ask,
what were your adjustments in the second half to contain Anthony Beane?  
COACH MARSHALL: I thought we did a pretty good job except for the first minute
or two. He had three of his field goals in probably the first four minutes.
They were contested jump shots. He's a talented player. He can score when
contested very well. We really didn't change anything at halftime. I think
we‑‑ the latter part of the first half, we were much better, and he stopped
making those shots he was making earlier. But Cotton just continued to guard
him.  
  
Q. In your opening statement, you said something about the game plan for
Barry Hinson. What were some of the things that the Salukis did early to take
that early four ‑point lead?   
COACH MARSHALL: I think they went to Beane and got their best player involved,
and he was making some incredible shots. Then they were trying to work some
clock and make sure they got the ball back to Beane at the end of the clock so
he could use the ball screen.  
They were changing defenses, just looking to make sure we didn't have the ball
for too long. They were shortening the game, if you will, I thought, early.  
I just think he does a great job.  
  
Q. Coach, what impressed you the most on this win?  
COACH MARSHALL: I would say what impressed me the most was our defense. We
allowed 16 field goals, 34 percent, 27 percent from three. We forced 18
turnovers to 5 assists. So you hold teams to 45, you have a pretty good chance
of winning.  
  
Q. Gregg, did you go to the press mostly just to get some energy, get
something going?  
COACH MARSHALL: Well, we normally press after made free throws, and we have a
variety of presses that we can go to. We were pressing early in the game, more
of just a man token press. But then I thought we needed some energy, and I
thought they had been suspect in terms of the way they handled the ball
against full court pressure. So that was the decision, and it worked well.  
We went from like down four, maybe even more than that, to up five or six
pretty quickly.  
  
Q. Fred mentioned Tekele's ball handling. How was it helpful?  
COACH MARSHALL: Fred sees it as well. Tekele, when he decides to go north and
south, he's very effective. He drove it in a couple of times tonight and
scored around the rim, and it just puts more pressure on the defense when you
have a third handler out there that can do that.  
  
Q. I'm just curious about tomorrow and kind of what your guys' routine will
be tonight and everything, preparing, obviously, for short rest. You guys
haven't played a tournament like this since December.  
COACH MARSHALL: We're going to watch the first half here. The assistant
coaches will stay. I've been assured that the Westin will have the game on
television, which they did not have last night. We had the Blues. I'm from
South Carolina. I'm not much of a hockey fan.  
We watched the first half at Mike Shannon's last night, and then the second
half, we thought we'd be able to watch in our hotel room, and we got hockey
instead. So we'll go back and watch the second half. Assistant coaches will
stay, and then we will eat.  
I'm sure they'll eat probably twice. It's still early. It's 2:30. I'm sure
they'll eat now when we get back, and they'll eat again tonight, and we'll
watch some video of whoever wins this game and tuck them into bed.  
  
Q. Gregg, what kind of unique challenges do each of these teams that are
getting ready to play present no matter who you play?  
COACH MARSHALL: I think Evansville is their motion offense, and D.J.
Balentine. Many times what a great job Marty does running that offense, and
you've got to defend screens for 40 minutes. You're going to get hit hundreds
of times. And they're very tough.  
Then the Illinois State team, just their size and athleticism. They're big and
athletic and pound the glass. We weren't great at that tonight.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much, Gregg. See you tomorrow.

_ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI_  
  

Illinois State  71  
Evansville  67

  
THE MODERATOR: We're going to questions for the student‑athletes.  
COACH MULLER: Very proud of the team. That's a really good team we beat in a
very close game. We fouled too much. Our defense in the first half was really
bad. But we had a lot of guys that put pressure on them.  
Like I said, that's a good team. It's a really good team.  
Excited to move on. Just looking to advance this time of year. That's all that
matters.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for DeVaughn and Deontae.  
  
Q. You hit your first couple threes in the game and got back into that
rhythm. Did you feel like in a rhythm from the start of the game?  
DEONTAE HAWKINS: I was feeling it in the layup line. I felt that my shot was
good, and I just kept shooting.  
  
Q. DeVaughn, you guys got up by eight points, and they had that run where
they kept going to the free ‑throw line, it seemed, on every possession. They
finally went ahead. Did it ever feel like it was getting away from you guys
there?   
DEVAUGHN AKOON‑PURCELL: Not necessarily. We just knew as a team we had to stop
falling, which we couldn't do. We felt like we did a good job towards the end,
and they executed.  
  
Q. Deontae, can you talk about ‑‑ the regular season is a long grind, but
can you talk about the drilling you had as a freshman coming into this
tournament with the intensity today?   
DEONTAE HAWKINS: I knew I had to make some big plays for my teammates. They're
counting on me, just like I'm counting on them. One goal is to take care of
business and get some wins so we can advance to the next round. That's what we
did tonight.  
  
Q. Deontae, two ‑part question. First of all, those last two three‑point
looks that you got, especially the last one, have you ever been so open on a
three‑pointer? And the second part of the question, when you have that much
time, what do you think about before you shoot? Because you took a long time
to get them off.   
DEONTAE HAWKINS: Get the ball right. Make sure the ball is perfect in my hands
and be confident in shooting it. Look at it going in. And I missed some that
open.  
  
Q. DeVaughn, to follow up, when you guys were committing all those fouls,
what was going on that made you say ‑‑ why were you committing all those
fouls?   
DEVAUGHN AKOON‑PURCELL: That's a good question. We just‑‑ we weren't playing
good defense, I guess. Everybody was fouling. I think me and MiKyle fouled
out.  
  
Q. DeVaughn, I think you just had 2 points in the first half. Were you
thinking at halftime you kind of needed to find your gear offensively? Is that
something you kind of ‑‑ Coached maybe talked to you about at halftime?   
DEVAUGHN AKOON‑PURCELL: Most definitely. I shot a couple shots in the first
half. I was just a step behind, I feel like, and I wasn't playing as hard as I
normally do, and I felt like I had no choice but to pick it up in the second
half if we wanted a chance to win.  
  
Q. Congratulations. You now play Wichita State. What do you have to do to
beat them?  
DEONTAE HAWKINS: Just got to execute. We got to come in the game with a great
mindset. Like I said, execute and just play hard. Just play our game and play
our role.  
  
Q. DeVaughn, you played them twice. Two pretty close games the first two
times. Does that give you guys a little bit of confidence going into tomorrow
with Wichita that you guys are just right there with them except for a couple
plays?  
DEVAUGHN AKOON‑PURCELL: It gives us confidence. Wichita State is a very good
team, and I feel like we match up with them pretty well talent‑wise, and
tomorrow should be a pretty good game.  
  
Q. Justin McCloud hit a couple big three ‑pointers in the first half. What
has he done to evolve as a role player throughout the season?   
DEVAUGHN AKOON‑PURCELL: One thing I like about Justin, no matter what's going
on, if he's playing or not playing, he's a great team player. Any time he
comes in, he makes shots, of course. That's what he is, a shooter. He just
knows his role on a team. He does a great job at it.  
  
Q. DeVaughn, this is the second game in a row, with them too, that you guys
were kind of able to make some plays down the stretch. How much more
confidence now do you have today than you did even on Saturday that you guys
can really kind of make the plays down the stretch when you need it?  
DEVAUGHN AKOON‑PURCELL: On Saturday we had to grind it out too. It was close
going down to the end, and we made a couple big plays towards the end. We did
the same thing pretty much tonight. Some guys made big plays.  
THE MODERATOR: Deontae, same thing.  
DEONTAE HAWKINS: I didn't hear you.  
  
Q. Some guys made some big plays at the end of the game. Does it give you
confidence?  
DEONTAE HAWKINS: Does it give us confidence? Yes, it does give us confidence.
Evansville is a pretty good team. They battle. We just execute it, play hard
until the horn blows.  
  
Q. What were you able to do on defense to kind of contain D.J. Balentine,
who finished 6 of 17 from the field?  
DEONTAE HAWKINS: I feel like we did a good job with our help defense. Whoever
was on him personally did a good job, I feel like the help defenders getting
in the gaps when he would drive. I think we did a good job helping. We did a
good job. We won.  
DEVAUGHN AKOON‑PURCELL: Making them feel uncomfortable. That's what we did.  
THE MODERATOR: Gentlemen, thank you very much. We'll see you tomorrow in the
semifinals. Congratulations on your victory.  
We will hold here with Coach Muller for a while longer.  
  
Q. Coach, congratulations. Seeing Deontae play for the first time in person,
it seems like you have a lot of confidence in him. I know one time he taps you
out, and you gave him a break. But then he came back and hit a long three from
the corner, then he had a three ‑point play for you. What type of player is
he? And are you really impressed with his play today in this situation?   
COACH MULLER: Yeah, he played extremely well. Not only his shooting ability,
he got some big rebounds down the stretch. Teddy is a talented player. He's
got a confidence about him. He may play good. He may play bad, but it's never
because of where you're playing, whether it's on the road. That stuff doesn't
bother him. For his first time around, that's unique.  
When we need his shooting ability, he can stretch the defense. He hasn't shot
it well recently. He missed shots the last three games, but he's been shooting
well in practice. So big shots. Those last two threes he hit were both huge,
and then the and-one. He's not scared. He's not scared at the moment.  
  
Q. And you talked about the defense in the first half, but did you think the
team was just kind of a step slow the whole time?  
COACH MULLER: Absolutely. First of all, Evansville was executing at a high
rate. I've said a lot of times their offense is so hard to guard because there
are a lot of long possessions, and you have to withstand their screening. One
breakdown leads to a basket. That's what motion screening does.  
We didn't execute. Our ball pressure wasn't very good. We were getting beat
baseline. I thought, honestly, two of our first year guys were really a step
slow. And it showed.  
Daishon Knight did an unbelievable job on D.J. Balentine the entire game, when
he was on him. But our first half defense was abysmal.  
  
Q. Coach, looking ahead to Wichita State here, 2012, do you remember that
semifinal, 65 ‑64? What do you remember about it if you do?   
COACH MULLER: I wasn't here yet. I remember watching it. So I can't speak to
the actual game. That was the year before I got here. I probably can't talk
about that too much.  
  
Q. Dan, a couple of turnovers there in the backcourt. Just the thing about
this team is that you guys had to make it exciting to the end.  
COACH MULLER: Want to keep you in your seat. That first one was completely
uncharacteristic to throw the ball on the end line, and we had the game in
hand at that time. The travel was‑‑ we had a great crew, great. I'm talking
about high level.  
This is not a‑‑ I don't know. If he didn't travel for sure, I don't have
anything to say about it. He got off balance and didn't handle the pressure.
We have to handle the situation better. We had the ball in the best free‑throw
shooter's hands, but clearly bad times for turnovers.  
  
Q. You had that run in the middle of the second half where they were going
to the free ‑throw line every time. What finally got them out of that? Or did
they get out of it?   
COACH MULLER: We went zone. We fouled 5 out of 6 possessions. We talked about
it a lot because Evansville goes to the foul line a lot. We talked about
playing with discipline, playing without fouling.  
Again, what they do is such long possessions, they get you, they drive you at
the last second, and you put your hands out or you get in the wrong position,
and you end up committing a foul.  
So it's disappointing, but honestly what we did at that point, which we
actually did last game also, which worked very well, is we went to our zone.
Once we went zone, we guarded without fouling.  
  
Q. Coach, congratulations on the win, first of all. Looking ahead to
tomorrow, this is your third shot at Wichita State now. How do you plan to
attack them maybe differently than you did the first two times?  
COACH MULLER: I got to break the film down again. Wichita State is great. We
all know that. They're one of the best teams in the country. Their personnel
is high level. But their toughness and experience is what makes them great.
Specifically with their guards.  
So I'm not sure what we'll do differently yet. We did have a couple of close
games, which we'll be able to look at. But we got out‑‑ if you're going beat
Wichita State, you've got to out‑tough them, and that's going to be hard to do
because they're going to show up to every game and play with incredible
toughness and incredible composure.  
So that's going to be a big challenge for us tomorrow.  
  
Q. Dan, for this specific team, what does this victory mean tonight?  
COACH MULLER: Well, I'm proud of them. We've had a couple of close games
recently. To get to 20 minutes and to beat some quality teams and to have an
opportunity to play in the semifinals against one of the best teams in the
country and to hopefully put us in good position for postseason play of some
sort, we're in a good place.  
We're not satisfied, obviously. No team is as they continue to win. But I'm
proud of what a lot of new guys and a lot of second‑year guys have done this
year.  
  
Q. Coach, you just kind of mentioned ‑‑ he stole my thunder, what I was
going to ask you. 20 wins, you think you deserve‑‑ I know you plan on playing
Sunday afternoon. If you're in a good spot, do you think you deserve to be in
postseason?   
COACH MULLER: Yeah, I do. I'll talk more about it when we officially know
where we're at, if we happen to lose a game. But I do think we're in good
position with our nonconference schedule, some quality wins, and what we've
done in a great league.  
So I hope so. Obviously, that's not on my mind right now, but if you look at
our resume, we've got a pretty good resume in a lot of ways.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much. We'll see you tomorrow.

# [MISSOURI VALLEY CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=MISSOURI+VALLEY+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

### [Porter Moser](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26501)

### [Earl Peterson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28320)

### [Christian Thomas](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26504)

  
_ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Up next, 2:45. 2 seeded Loyola Ramblers. They will play in the
3‑6 game against Indiana State. 8:30 game on Friday. We'll ask Porter to make
a statement first.  
COACH MOSER: I'm proud of our guys. They've withstood some adversity this year
with some injuries. They just‑‑ especially these two right here have played
really well, really hard. We got great chemistry. I think these guys have been
focused and just really proud of these guys they moved up our program a step.  
We have a lot of steps to go, we know that. In terms of where you want your
attitude, your character, your chemistry, we're pleased to be here.  
  
Q. Porter, could you reflect on the games against them in year. They've kind
of had your number the past couple of years. What is it they do so well?  
COACH MOSER: I think Indiana State has got a good balance of size‑‑ Gant and
Kitchell are very, very physical. And then their guards, Brown and Scott, have
been very, very athletic. We haven't been able to defend those two really
well. We've had great games in our arena.  
What they've done is they've shared the ball. They strike you off the dribble,
and they can shoot it. I was talking to Greg about it, and one of the big
differences for his team from nonconference to now is to make the shots. You
look at how much they're making threes, and they've got a number of guys who
can make threes.  
Then you've got to make a decision. Do you pack it in the paint to stop their
drive? Or do you extend and stop their three? I like their balance of their
size inside and their athletic guards.  
  
Q. Coach, the Sycamores have managed to win a game ‑‑ at least a game here
at this tournament for four years in a row. I know you talked about Greg's
consistency before the season. Could you just comment on the difficulty of
winning a game, even when you're not at your best, for four years in a row
here by the Sycamores?   
COACH MOSER: That's a great run by Greg because, to do the consistency, like
you said, but that is. You've got to have‑‑ when you get a taste of it,
they've had a lot of players‑‑ they've done it the right way. Gant's a senior.
Kitchell is a senior. Last year they had Odum, who played a lot of games for
them. That's one benefit for us. We have five guys in Christian, Jeff White,
Devon Turk, Joe Crisman, and Doyle, who won a game here last year. That's a
plus. You get the confidence. You know you can come in here and get a win and
hopefully advance. Your goal is not just to win one.  
You've got to give Greg and his staff and his players credit for coming in
here year offer year and at least getting one.  
  
Q. Porter, what are your expectations for Milton tomorrow? As a coach, are
you worried about maybe his return kind of throwing things out of whack a
little bit since he's not played for ten games or so?  
COACH MOSER: Our expectation, he's going to play. He played last game, got in
the middle of a close game and played well. Our chemistry's really good. I
think some teams, you might worry about that. I don't with these guys. These
two right here have been a key part of it. Everybody's welcomed him back.  
Milton was like a coach every day in practice. Sometimes, when guys get
injured, they migrate to the training room, and you don't see them for a
while. Milton was out there on the bench. There were some times in the 11
games he missed he'd be poking my sport coat during a media time‑out, hey,
look what's open out there.  
He's been staying involved. The guys on the team have great chemistry. There's
going to be no awkwardness. There wasn't last game against Missouri State. As
a matter of fact, I think it's the opposite.  
These guys are confident. I really think we can do something here, and they
want all hands on deck. I think that's the way our whole team's approached it
and the way these guys approached it.  
  
Q. Porter, in the previous two games, you got a good game in Terre Haute out
of Montel and a good game out of Earl in Chicago. How do you get a couple more
guys involved, and how does Milton's return kind of influence that?  
COACH MOSER: It's a great question. We've been consistent with our effort, but
we've had different guys step up at different times. That's what exciting to
me because I know we have great guys that are capable.  
No matter how you spin things certain years, do you really have the guns in
your holster, guys capable to help you do this? I feel like we do. Earl's had
some big games. Christian's had some big games. Devon Turk has. The key to
running three games in the tournament is to get everybody playing well.  
I think our effort, our attitude, our focus are there. Guys are going to play
well. I really do. Just getting‑‑ I think we haven't been at our best, but I
think we're playing well right now as the season ended. Like you said, Montel
played really well there. Earl played well here. I think the guys are‑‑ they
beat us twice. Hopefully, that's sticking in our guys' gut.  
  
Q. Christian, how special do you feel now in four years getting to come back
home and play St. Louis?  
CHRISTIAN THOMAS: It seems like almost a surreal feeling just because, when I
was growing up, my family would always come to Arch Madness. Now being on the
other side of it, it's just really special for me. Getting a chance for a lot
of my family members and maybe friends from high school, things like that,
just to come see me play and haven't gotten an opportunity to come to Chicago
is also great.  
  
Q. For you, Coach Moser, what sort of impact has Rick Majerus had on your
coaching career? Anything you take from the process in St. Louis as an
assistant that you've applied here with Loyola?  
COACH MOSER: Coach has meant the world to me. It was a blessing for me to land
here with him. I thought we did a lot of work here. I think about him a lot.
So much of what he was about and talking‑‑ so many late night meals talking
ball. He truly was a savant.  
I miss him as a friend. I miss him as a mentor. There's a lot of his footprint
on what we're trying to do here. Rick was big on‑‑ I remember my first year or
two at Loyola, him calling me, don't try to go too fast. Don't try to go too
fast. Don't skip steps. We felt like we didn't do that at St. Louis, and I
feel like we're doing that right now.  
For us, it's very hard to jump conferences, like we did, when you take over
something that was down in one conference. We feel like our arrow is going up.
These guys, I reference Coach Majerus all the time with these guys. They
didn't know him. Actually, Christian did know him. But there's a lot of
references we try to do with the culture that he impacted my life as a coach
and as a man.  
  
Q. Christian, could you just kind of reflect on last season's tournament
here and some of your memories of winning your first game over Bradley and
what that meant to you. Did that help you guys really get accustomed to what
this tournament was all about?  
CHRISTIAN THOMAS: I think so because, leading up to it, only Coach Moser had
any inside knowledge on it, having played here and coached here. Last year,
going up against a team that had beaten us twice before, coming down to a last
second shot, and then Milton, obviously, hitting the game winner, I think it
was really special for us.  
I think it showed that we can come into this environment and win, and that
kind of set up the expectation going forward.  
  
Q. Coach, just to follow up, you said that you tell your players some of the
things that Coach Majerus told you. What are some of those things?  
COACH MOSER: Rick has a lot of little sayings, that we actually have a wall of
culture in our locker room. There's probably a hundred little sayings on
there. There's a lot of them from Rick, Coach Majerus. Like threw you to the
rim. So many of them, so many little things, teaching points.  
That was one of the special things about Coach Majerus is his attention to
detail. It was off the chain. Rick has a lot of those‑‑ these guys know what
those little things are.  
  
Q. Christian, what did you know about Coach Majerus? What was your
relationship and interaction with him?  
CHRISTIAN THOMAS: I first met Coach Majerus as a junior in high school. He
came to an open gym at Clayton High School where I went. The first thing is I
remember him telling me just different pointers about how to play the game and
things like that. And also from going to different open gyms at St. Louis U,
talking to the players and getting their take on him.  
He seemed like an outstanding person, always willing to give a helping hand,
always giving the guys life advice and things like that. He seemed like a
great person.  
  
Q. Earl, how much did that ‑‑ was it a blessing, perhaps, in disguise that
players like yourself were called on to have a little bit different role when
Milton went down? Is a little bit more of a scoring role, a little bit‑‑ and
you can elaborate on what that would be. How much do you think that's helped
you at this point in the season to have taken on some different roles that
maybe you wouldn't have had otherwise?   
EARL PETERSON: I think it's helped me a lot, and it's given me a lot of
confidence because some of my teammates, they were looking to me to create
shots for myself and them as well, and I was able to do so and help the team
get a couple‑‑ get some wins. It boosted my confidence.  
THE MODERATOR: Best of luck. See you tomorrow.

### [Christian Kirk](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26558)

### [Paul Lusk](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23227)

### [Austin Ruder](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26522)

  
_ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI_  
  

Southern Illinois  55  
Missouri State - 48

  
MODERATOR: Austin Ruder and Christian Kirk represent the student‑athletes for
Missouri State. Paul Lusk in the middle as the head coach. We'll ask him to
make a statement on the game and then go to questions for just the two
student‑athletes, then back to Coach Lusk.  
COACH LUSK: Congrats to Southern for advancing. I thought it was really an
ugly game by both teams, but that's what generally happens. I thought both
teams played hard. Either team was probably very efficient.  
We got down. We got a chance to get back into it. We just had too many
turnovers. But proud of Christian Kirk, our only senior, and he's done
everything right. I thought Austin found some rhythm today.  
But congratulations to Southern. It's been a tough season for us. We have to
regroup. Guys have to make improvements. We have to move forward.  
  
Q. Austin, were the turnovers something SIU is doing defensively or a lot of
them just forced?  
COACH LUSK: A lot of them were on us. We were just kind of casual with the
basketball, kind of giving them baskets. A lot of them had the breakout layups
and jump shots like that, so I think it really hurt us.  
  
Q. You guys battled to get back into it, and then they went on a little bit
of a run. Tell me how devastating that was to your momentum and then be able
to fight the rest of the way.  
CHRISTIAN KIRK: It was tough the first half. We were struggling with turnover,
and we were down on the board. Second half, we made a great run. Me and Austin
were just talking, we thought we were definitely in it. And then O'Brien hit a
great three‑pointer, and that hurt us.  
We were down, but I thought we made a couple good runs. There was just some
bad mistakes for them to get up.  
  
Q. Christian, you had a great first half and led your team in points and
rebounds. In the second half, you didn't score quite as well. Do you think it
was more something SIU did to stop you, or were you just not getting the same
looks as before?  
CHRISTIAN KIRK: I think they probably, definitely keyed on me a little bit in
the second half. With me, I'm never looking‑‑ I try to be an all‑around
player. So I don't try to force many things, and I don't take many shots every
game.  
I didn't have a lot of openings. And I thought I made some good passes and hit
some open guys, but I just didn't have the openings in the second half that I
did in the first.  
  
Q. Austin, can you talk about how kind of frustrating it was in the
beginning of the game for you, but then you finally found your rhythm, just
how that kind of shifted.  
AUSTIN RUDER: Southern Illinois plays me pretty tough. They follow me around
pretty good. When they went zone there at the end of half and I got an open
look, that kind of got me going. After that, I found some rhythm. So I think I
was pretty lucky they went zone the last play.  
  
Q. Austin, you kind of struggled to find a shot the first half and started
getting it going, at one point hitting four threes. With the team down one,
you kind of hit a long three. Would you have taken that back and maybe set up
for a different shot on the shot clock.  
AUSTIN RUDER: I don't think so. I was kind of feeling at that point it was
open look, and I was make that shot. Probably 6 out of 10 times, 7 out of 10
times. So I thought it was a good look, and it would have been a momentum
changer if I would have made it. So I wouldn't change it.  
  
Q. Christian, only senior, looking back at this season, just tell me a
little bit about your thoughts on what transpired and everything.  
CHRISTIAN KIRK: We've definitely seen a little bit of everything. I think
that's what me and the guys have talked about. There's some things that have
happened. It's been a tough year, but we've stayed close in the locker room,
and we joke around still. It's been tough, but we went through some things,
and I think as a team we did really well, and it actually brought us closer.  
That will be great for them going into next year. They have a great group of
guys, and they'll have a really good locker room.  
  
Q. Do you feel you were maybe robbed of something with everything that
happened?  
CHRISTIAN KIRK: No, I don't feel like that at all. I always think that things
happen for a reason. This was a tough year, but I think it really showed what
guys can do. It gave them opportunities and what their career will be like.
Since they got that taste of playing time, they'll come back and work even
harder. It will be a good next two or three years at Missouri State.  
  
Q. Christian, as a senior, just the emotion that you feel when you walk off
the floor for the final time.  
CHRISTIAN KIRK: It was pretty crazy. I was talking coming off the floor, and
we were just talking that it hasn't really hit me yet. He was saying it hit
him when everyone else was going back to workouts and he was just going to
class. I think that's when it hit me.  
It was tough, but I had my family in the crowd and all my coaches showed me a
lot of love coming off the floor.  
It's been a great experience at Missouri State, and I won't forget about it,
and I won't regret anything.  
  
Q. Austin, just the drive that you need to do in the off ‑season toward next
year, what are your thoughts on that?   
AUSTIN RUDER: We just‑‑ everybody has certain things to work on. Me
personally, probably ball screens, coming off ball screens and stuff like
that. And keep improving on shooting. You can never stop working on your
craft. Everyone has their own things to work on, and everyone needs to find
something that drives them.  
  
Q. Austin, do you feel like ball handling is something you need to focus on
too? With the press tonight, it could have helped out?  
AUSTIN RUDER: I don't know if it's so much ball handling. I can handle the
ball right. It's more just being confident in those situations, I think, is
kind of what I need to work on, and kind of coming off ball screens and stuff
like that. Kind of ball handling in different situations, I'd say. I'm going
to get to work on that.  
THE MODERATOR: Gentlemen, thank you very much for your time. We'll dismiss you
and stay with Coach Lusk for a little while longer.  
  
Q. Paul, just the way they disrupted Dorrian tonight, maybe some of those
turnovers unforced. I don't know.  
COACH LUSK: There was a question about Christian getting shots. It's hard to
get shots for anyone. I think we talked at halftime that, if we could correct
our turnovers, we'll have a chance because we were actually guarding him okay.
I think the first time out of the second half, we had more turnovers than we
had shots. You just can't turn the basketball over.  
When it's hard to score and it's difficult to manufacture points, you cannot
turn the basketball over, and we don't have a lot of handlers. But the guys
that can handle it can't turn it over. We simply gave them the ball too many
times. The second half, we cut into it. We made a sub, and we just gave them
the ball two times. You can't do those kinds of things.  
  
Q. Paul, you mentioned on the conference call that Anthony Beane was going
to be tough to guard. Do you think that the team did a good enough job holding
him to 10 points?  
COACH LUSK: We did. It was an ugly game, as I said, both ways. We did a good
enough job on Anthony Beane. We just turned it over 16 times. And literally,
our turnovers were generally pick sixes. Just take the ball from me, take the
ball from us, and just go get a layup or get a transition basket, and you
can't do that. We really struggled on the perimeter tonight to find anyone
that could play positive minutes and help us.  
I thought Austin got some rhythm, and he did some good things, but we really
struggled on the perimeter tonight.  
And Dorrian has done everything he could possibly do for us. He clearly
struggled offensively, but he guarded Beane. He's had a very long year. He's
had to log a lot of minutes. For for us to have a chance, we can't turn the
basketball over like that. I thought we did a nice job on Beane.  
  
Q. Coach, it's not the ending you want to see for your team, of course. It's
been a tough season, as you said. What are the positives you think you can
take from this group who only has one senior graduating going forward?  
COACH LUSK: I think Christian Kirk has been a great kid, great
student‑athlete, just a model of what a student‑athlete is. When you don't
have a bunch‑‑ I thought Ron Mvouika would have been our emotional leader and
arguably our second best player, and I think we really missed him, just from
an emotional standpoint.  
Even him being on‑‑ he wasn't able to travel with us to Loyola or here just
because of the back. But pleased with the guys. There was a lot of different
adversity. I think guys were thrust into some positions that maybe they were
not quite ready for. Now it's what do you do with those experiences to get
better? Because we need to make drastic improvements across the board.  
But I was pleased with our guys. They tried to listen to what we were trying
to do. They didn't quit. We were down 11 tonight. We weren't very good. They
didn't quit. They kept battling.  
There were times when we had seven guys to practice. It has not been easy.
We've brought basically nine scholarship players over here. They stayed
positive. They let us coach them. They're good kids. We need to make
improvements in a lot of areas.  
I thought we had an opportunity to win some games after some of the things
that transpired. Some games were close that we just weren't able to finish.
Hopefully, with all the minutes that some of these guys have gotten, they can
get better in the off‑season because we need to get better. We need to add
some guys that can help us.  
  
Q. Chris Kendrix only took three shots tonight and didn't make any of them.
Near the end of the game, he looked like he had a pretty nice shot at the open
three. Going forward, are you looking for him to take more shots?  
COACH LUSK: Yes. We would like him to be more aggressive.  
  
Q. Coach, you played ‑‑ Coach, have you ever seen any kind of season like
this? How do you feel about it?   
COACH LUSK: You've been through tough seasons, but when you work really hard
to get the program in position that we thought we had it in, even with some
injuries last year. But we still had a good season. We thought we wouldn't be
in this position.  
To have some things happen‑‑ as I said, you can overcome some injuries. You
can overcome some guys. We could have overcome Ron Mvouika, but that was going
to affect us. Then the other situation, that really, really affected us. You
take two of your better guys off your team, it's going to affect you.  
And beyond that, we had some other things happen. But, no, it's been hard.
It's been tough. You try to practice. You try to get things done. You don't
have a lot of bodies, but you have to keep plugging away.  
It's unfortunate. It's disappointing.  
We need to make improvements, there's no doubt about that. As I told our guys,
they've had such great opportunities. Everyone wants to play, and if your
roster was intact, there probably would have been some grumblings because some
guys weren't playing.  
Well, that wasn't the case. Now be careful what you ask for. Be careful what
you ask for because guys got a whole lot of minutes, and I think there were
just too many times that you were rewarded minutes without earning minutes
because we didn't have a lot of places to go.  
But I like all those guys, and I like them. It's just we have to get better.
It was hopefully a learning process for them as to what they need to do in the
off‑season.  
  
Q. You talked about guys playing a lot of minutes. Obviously, your freshmen
had a lot of those minutes. Shawn played a lot against Wichita State. Chris
had a lot of minutes, 55 in the triple overtime. Talk about the development of
your freshman.  
COACH LUSK: Shawn plays 40 minutes against Wichita because we had seven guys,
and he was the only guy that could really handle the ball and do that. So he
did‑‑ he had a better game against Evansville, where we only had seven guys,
and he played 40 minutes.  
Chris Kendrick has played a lot of minutes. Obviously, it's a long season for
those young guys. We didn't think they would be in that row, but you can look
at it two ways. It could be a positive thing or a negative thing. Hopefully,
it's a positive thing for those guys moving forward.  
But they need to make improvements. The sophomores need to make improvements.
The juniors need to make improvements across the board.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Paul. Best of luck.

### [Jacob Enevold](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28368)

### [Ray Giacoletti](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13818)

  
_ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI_  
  

Bradley  52  
Drake  50

  
MODERATOR: Jacob Jensen and Gary Ritz Jr. Will represent the student body for
the Drake Bulldogs. Ray Giacoletti, the head coach, is in the middle.  
COACH GIACOLETTI: So many ebbs and flows in 45 minutes. Proud of our guys to
fight back from down at halftime to take the lead. Just so many different‑‑
you get down four or five points, fight your way back, get up three points.  
Barnes hits the three in transition out of our press, and actually that's what
normally you want, them to shoot the ball quick. That's what you're going to
give up. And he hit it. That's on me.  
The last play was designed to be thrown long, and our timing wasn't right.
We've got to do a better job of being able to execute those kinds of things
down the stretch. But I'm proud of this group, and they continue to fight.  
From where we were at Christmas to where we're at now is two different teams.
I just feel bad for the guys in that locker room not to be able to play
another game.  
  
Q. Jacob, I know it's a loss, but can you ‑‑ what can you take from this
game today? 24 points and 12 rebounds. Is this something you can take over the
summer?   
JACOB ENEVOLD: Yeah, definitely. For me, it was just kind of sealing the deal.
Just getting on it with being on the most improved teams, kind of like he said
in the statement.  
I can definitely use it over the summer going in with the international team.
So it's just a great confidence booster leading up to next season. So I'll
take that with me.  
  
Q. The second half wore down. You kept going to the line and shooting free
throws in a close game like that, how does it feel? How did you keep your
composure?  
JACOB ENEVOLD: I don't know. That's a good question. I just had it today. I
wasn't worried about anything. The audience wasn't getting to me, not that
they usually do. I was just‑‑ I don't know. I was just at ease, I guess, and
that's when I shoot the best.  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for Gary or Jacob? We'll dismiss you guys. Thank
you for coming up. We'll stay with Ray Giacoletti for a little bit longer.  
  
Q. Coach, just talk about ‑‑ you touched on from about December to now. What
are the things you're going to have to do now maybe in the next month to kind
of take what you have. It's about eight new faces you're going to have. So
what do you do? What's the next couple three months?   
COACH GIACOLETTI: Well, to take care of what we have right now. There's five
freshmen and Jacob that will be here and with Kale and Graham. So eight we'll
have throughout the school year, and each of the four freshmen will kind of be
at different times.  
So it's a little bit different and unique this summer because we're going to
go on a European trip in August. So we're going to get ten days of practice.
It's probably the ideal year to do that with trying to integrate. Even though
Kale and Graham didn't play, they were at practice every single day. I say it
every year. You walk out of practice feeling really good, and you don't have
those three guys in games, it's a little bit different.  
We'll get to all that. Just need to digest what took place. I said all along,
after two years, once this season was going to be over, the foundation's
pretty solid for moving along here now. It really is. My head's not into where
we're going. It's just still left from what just took place.  
I just feel bad for those guys. I've done this 30 years and been in a lot of
different situations and teams, especially at Christmas‑‑ good times, tough
times. Never been in one as tough as we were in‑‑ I mean, we've never been
that competitive. For those guys to be able to dig in. We all took three days
and then compete and then go win six conference games.  
Even there at the last, we're overtime with Loyola to get out of Thursday
games. Six‑point game on the road at southern, there's a big difference
between not being able to compete, competing, and then going and winning
games.  
I think those seniors can‑‑ they're going to have some pitfalls in life‑‑
family, marriage, job, whatever it is. That's what I told them, go back to
where we were at Christmas, and you can get through anything. Most students
never go through anything like that. Most adults don't go through anything
like that. They went through it and found a way to get to the other side.  
Now, were we perfect? Did we end perfect? No. But from where it was to where
we are now, light years. Light years. So it's a great credit to those special
five seniors.  
  
Q. With 2.7 seconds left, is that the point guys need to avoid anything that
would even resemble a foul at that point? How did you see that?  
COACH GIACOLETTI: No. It was on a pass. So the way I saw it, Gary was helping
and trying to jump in the passing lanes. I wasn't close enough. He somehow got
his hand on wrist or something. He was doing the correct thing.  
If you're on the ball, yeah, we don't want to try to slap down or make
something crazy, but his help came from off the ball. I thought it was‑‑ he
was able to get hand or arm somehow, but what he did was sound.  
Again, it happened so darn quick, I couldn't see it. That's why I was a little
confused. If he would have been on the ball, that was his man. I'm sure he
fouled. The official was standing right there. But he was off the ball and
trying to make a play on the ball, which is what we want. Don't want to foul,
but he was doing the correct technique anyway.  
THE MODERATOR: Ray, thank you very much. Best of luck.

_ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI_  
  
THE MODERATOR: 3:15 session and the final session today features the No.2
seeded Northern Iowa Panthers. They will play the winner of the Drake‑Bradley
game tonight at 8:30. The five seniors are up on the dais, Nate Buss, Max
Martino, Deon Mitchell, Marvin Singleton, and Seth Tuttle. Coach of the Year,
Ben Jacobson, is with us. We're going to ask him to make a statement about his
club, being back here in St. Louis, and we'll go to questions for anyone on
the dais, all six.  
COACH JACOBSON: Thanks. Congrats on your award today, very well deserved.  
We've had a terrific run. These guys have been great. I don't know that I
could ask for really anything more than what these guys have done for
themselves and their teammates and our program and our fans. They've just been
terrific. We're anxious to get going tomorrow. Highly motivated and anxious to
get going tomorrow.  
With that, I would leave it and open it up or send it back.  
  
Q. This is for all five players. If you guys could ‑‑ coach has said a lot
about you guys the last couple of days. Could you kind of maybe return the
favor, speak to what he's meant to you as players, as a team, and just comment
on him being named Coach of the Year.   
THE MODERATOR: Marvin, we're going to start with you and come this way.  
MARVIN SINGLETON: First and foremost, congratulations to Coach Jake on being
Coach of the Year. He's a well‑deserved coach. He pushes us each and every day
off and on the court to be the best we can be. He tells us every day to keep
building and continue to grow stronger together.  
Here UNI Panthers, we're all a big family. We're just a team that pushes each
other each day. Coach Jake pushes us, and we push him to be the best that we
can be. He means a lot to us as a program and as seniors.  
MAX MARTINO: The Coach of the Year is well deserved for Coach Jake. He's a
phenomenal coach. More than just that, he makes us better men. He wants us to
be all around great people. So not just on the floor, but off the floor, he
pushes us be to the best self we can be, academically, socially with our
family. Really he's not just pushing us, he wants us to be the best we can be.
I couldn't ask for anything else. Thank you.  
NATE BUSS: Yeah, congrats, Coach. You know I've said it to you. Very
well‑deserved for being Coach of the Year.  
When I first got here, I didn't realize how much growing up I had to do until
I met Coach Jake and went through our first practice, but he made me do it
quickly. I respect him for helping me make that transition from being a boy to
really becoming a man. He's helped me out in all aspects on the court and off
the court. I just really respect him for that, and I'll always be thankful for
that.  
SETH TUTTLE: Pretty much, these guys have mentioned everything. He's focused
on us in basketball and us as individuals. Obviously, as players, sometimes we
don't look at that too closely. When we look back on it, we're going to be
appreciative of that. On the floor, our success this year, directly,
obviously, goes right back to Coach Jake and his mindset and how he helped us
change our mindset towards the game.  
Obviously, we have a lot to be thankful for to have him as our head coach.  
DEON MITCHELL: Like most of these guys said, what Coach Jake has been doing
for this program, on and off the court, he pushes us each and every day. I
respect him at a high level, and I'm sure most of these guys do as well. We're
really thankful what he's been doing for us.  
  
Q. Coach, you have the award today. Such a great regular season. How along
the way have you been able to maybe enjoy the process, just enjoy the
season?  
COACH JACOBSON: This has been highly enjoyable for me. They've taken‑‑
starting with these five guys, they've taken so much ownership in our team and
in our program. Regardless of what we've done, who we've beat, or how many
games in a row we've won, they've wanted more.  
Every time they come back to practice, every time we line up to play another
game, it's just been a feeling of, all right, what can we do better? How can
we do it better? Let's go get somebody else. Just continued to want more.  
So from my standpoint, having been through this a couple times, I couldn't
have asked for anything more than guys that just want to keep going and keep
finding more things to get done. So it's been very enjoyable.  
Like I said, having gone through this a couple of times, I'm amazed that these
guys have been able to do it without having really any of the stress come into
it. They've handled it remarkably well.  
  
Q. Coach, I wanted to ask you, you touched on it in the speech this morning
a little about fishing with your boys and the best ‑‑ the most fun basketball
games and shootarounds. What makes Cedar Falls kind of that perfect place for
you? When did you realize it, or when did you kind of say this is pretty cool?
  
COACH JACOBSON: There's so many things. The one I'll start with is it's a
place that we can recruit these guys to. That is, from a basketball
standpoint, from a program standpoint, that's the biggest thing. We've got
enough on campus, we've got enough with our program, we've got enough with our
community, that we can recruit these kinds of guys so we can have a program
that's got a strong foundation. We can continue to come back year after year
after year.  
We're going to miss these guys, but there's going to be other guys. Next year
it will be different guys. And I think we're able to do that because we've got
so much going for us in town and on campus and able to get guys just like
these five. That's the biggest thing when it comes to the basketball part of
it.  
  
Q. Guys, Doug Elgin said that last Saturday's game is the loudest he's heard
at any time at any place. Is he correct in that? How much would it mean to get
Wichita State again for a rubber game?  
THE MODERATOR: Deon and Nate will answer that in that order.  
DEON MITCHELL: It's a pretty crazy game. It gets loud in there. Last time we
prepared for it and were ready to go. What was the other question you had?  
  
Q. [No microphone]?  
DEON MITCHELL: That's something that will be fun for us. We've got to take
each game one at a time. Going into tomorrow, if we don't win, we won't get
there. We've got to take it one game at a time. If we match up with them
again, then we'll be ready.  
NATE BUSS: It really was the loudest environment I've ever been a part of. My
ears were ringing going into halftime and after the game. But facing them
again, it would be great for us just because I know, as competitors, we all
like to face the best competition, and we know that Wichita State's the best
competition for us right now.  
But like Deon said, we're going to take it one game at a time. We're preparing
for tomorrow's game right now, and then we'll prepare for the next game. And
if it comes to it, we'll prepare for Wichita.  
  
Q. Seth, if you could just comment on your progress over the last four years
and winning Valley player of the year. Coach, just on how he's grown over the
years.  
SETH TUTTLE: I've matured in all aspects of my game. Over the first couple
years, the main thing was just the game slowed down, and my body, I was able
to put on weight and muscle and just be able to battle inside with those guys.
That was the main thing early on.  
And then, obviously, over the last two years, Coach Jake has talked to me‑‑
we've had meetings about not allowing myself to give in to being tired, not
allowing myself to skip a rep in the off‑season, all this stuff that he helped
me change my mindset towards some things. If you're going to play at a high
level, you have to have the right mindset at all time.  
It's a little bit of everything. Obviously, I had to get stronger and bigger.
And then Coach Jake, on the mental side of things, Xs and Os and all that
stuff, he's the one that really pushed me to the top.  
COACH JACOBSON: I would tell you that the things Seth just talked about with
himself, I think I could go down the line with all five of them. There's been
a real change in‑‑ Deon's made a tremendous and a terrific change in his
workouts and the kind of conditioning that he did this year to get ready, the
same for Marvin. Those two guys are in the very best shape they've ever been
in to start the season.  
And Max and Nate‑‑ Max, as everybody knows, he's not in our rotation, but he
comes in every day and shoots 300, 400 shots every single day with the guys
that are in the rotation, but he doesn't miss a day.  
Nate's growing into a guy‑‑ and I've said it this month. I don't know if these
guys have heard me say it, but there were days early on when Nate and I didn't
necessarily enjoy being in the same room with each other, and I really look
forward to being around Nate right now. It's kind of fun. So we've come a
ways.  
And back to Seth, he took on a lot of leadership last year at the end of the
season and carried that forward. The thing that I've appreciated most about it
and the thing I respect the most about it is that the guys will go back and
forth. Seth will give it, but he'll also take it. This is a group deal.  
Because he is the leader of our team and our best player, he doesn't sit off
to the side or on a different spot. They're all the same, and he understands
that as well as anybody in our program, and he knows he's going to touch the
ball a lot on offense, but he makes sure that the ball gets to all the other
guys. He doesn't touch the ball or want the ball so that he can shoot it every
time. He just wants us to play good offense. He knows he's got to get his
teammates involved because he has it a lot.  
So the respect that they have for each other and the way in which they go
about it and the leadership that Seth has shown has certainly increased
through his career. Then he talked about his work ethic and changing some of
those things this summer, and that's really important. I just like the
relationship these guys have with each other.  
  
Q. Coach, Wichita State players were in here a little earlier and expressed
significant frustration about the awards and how they came out, suggesting
that both went to the wrong people. How does that come across to you, and what
does that say about mindset going forward?  
COACH JACOBSON: I don't‑‑ I think everybody's pretty competitive. So I'll stay
away from that. I think we've got competitive guys sitting up here, and I
think they've got competitive guys in their locker room. I'll leave it at
that.  
  
Q. For Seth, have you ever been a bulletin board material type player? Or
has anybody on your team been that way? If not, where does your motivation
stem from?  
SETH TUTTLE: I don't think so. We just focus on‑‑ Coach mentioned a little
bit. We focus on the next game, and if it's a win or a lose, we'll learn from
it, and we focus on the next one. That's been our motto kind of going
throughout the year.  
Before every game, Coach always mentions keep building, and we really worked
on just continuing to build and build and build so that we can be playing our
best basketball now and throughout the end of the season. So I wouldn't say we
put too much focus on anything other than the next game and what's to come.  
  
Q. Could you assess each of your potential opponents tomorrow.  
COACH JACOBSON: We saw Drake two weeks or so ago at our place. They won three
in a row coming into our game. Ray has done a terrific job of bringing them
along. They do have five seniors, and those guys have really played well for
them. But they're young guys. Timmer and some of the other young players have
really come along.  
So to struggle for a long time and then win three in a row, and they've played
well since our game. So they're playing as good as they've played all year.
And extremely well‑coached. I think that's one of the things that people
around the league have realized about Ray and his staff, they're going to do
everything right at both ends of the floor, and they're going to play
extremely hard. So we know that that would be part of that game.  
Bradley played us, it was a one or two possession game into the second half at
our place, and, obviously, we've been playing very good basketball for a long
time. Geno's gone to some different zones and trying to find a way to get his
guys in the best position to have success. I give him‑‑ as I said after our
game, I give him a lot of credit for that, trying to find a way to get them
over the hump.  
So if it's Bradley, we'll take a hard look at that film and see if there's
some things that we can pick out of it, if we're going to see that same type
of defense in particular.  
  
Q. For the five seniors, this is your last go around here at the conference
tournament. Seth, on your teleconference call the other day with the league,
you reminded us that you guys haven't won a game yet here at St. Louis. I'm
just wondering, how different does it feel now, the fourth time here, to play
and it's your final time? Where's the confidence level, the mindset last go
around here in St. Louis for you guys?  
THE MODERATOR: We're going to start with Deon and go that way.  
DEON MITCHELL: Being it's the last year, we came in here every year with the
same expectations to come in and try to get a championship. We fell short the
past three years. I think our confidence is high as it has been since the
first time we came in here. So I don't think anything has changed. We just
have the same confidence.  
SETH TUTTLE: There's a special feeling that you get when you get on the bus to
head down to St. Louis every year. We've obviously not had the success that
we've wanted over the last three years, but there's no reason that our team
doesn't have full motivation, momentum, confidence going forward. Right now we
know we're a heck of a ball team, and we hope to come down here and show that
a little bit and obviously, make a run to Sunday.  
NATE BUSS: Yeah, it's been a long time. I've been coming down here for four
years, Max and I have been, just to keep it short. It's just been a great
season, and we're all extremely motivated, and we just want to end the season
the right way.  
MAX MARTINO: I know personally last year, when we lost the game, Chip Rank was
my roommate, one of my best friends, and he never won a game down here. For
me, that feeling of knowing that one of my best friends never won a game down
here, it just killed me.  
So we have a chance to change that this year, and we have all the confidence
in the world. This has been a special team from day one, but we never let
expectations or anything affect us. We've always been down to business. So
this is another business trip for us.  
MARVIN SINGLETON: Going off what Max said, confidence at a high level, and
this is a business trip. But one thing that Coach Jake talked about at the
beginning of the season was‑‑ that stand out to me is this team‑‑ he always
asks us what do‑‑ how do you want to be remembered? By what last year's team
did or the team before that or next year's team? How does next year's team
want to be remembered? This group of five seniors, we want to be remembered
differently. We want to go out there and play our hardest and come out
victorious.  
  
Q. This is for Coach. UNI is back on the stage now where they haven't been
since maybe 2010 to a lot of people. Was it ever difficult, or did you guys
ever, either you or Seth, find yourselves, not maybe haunted by that, but
trying to get back to that spot? Just people dealing with the expectations
created maybe four or five years ago?  
SETH TUTTLE: I wouldn't say we were haunted by it. We had‑‑ obviously, our
fans and supporters around Cedar Falls and obviously all over the place,
they've been waiting for another trip like they had in 2010 with that team.
Obviously, any fan base and supporters for your team would be wanting that
back.  
I haven't felt haunted or anything like that. Obviously, I've wanted to
experience it, and you'll see pictures on our walls or in our team lounge that
those teams got to experience it. For myself, it wasn't a haunting, it was
more a motivation to be able to run over to the middle of a court and hug Deon
or jump up and chest bump with Nate, just to experience it with these guys and
rest of our team and have a memory that those guys got to share.  
COACH JACOBSON: I would say that that's the thing that I'm most excited about
us or most happy about. These five guys are on quite a run in this‑‑ sometimes
I think it's‑‑ I don't know if easy is the right word, but I think that
sometimes people feel like, because it's been done, it should just happen
every year. You go out and do it, and everyone gets to go to the Sweet 16.  
I'm going to tell you something, it's hard. It's a hard thing to do, to get to
the NCAA Tournament, to win a championship in our league, those are difficult
things to do. Saying that, that doesn't mean we shy away from that as our
expectations. When we start every year, as I talked about a little bit, I'm
really proud of the program that we have and the foundation that we have, and
we should be in the hunt every single year, and the reason is because of these
five guys that are sitting here and their teammates.  
So we don't shy away from those expectations, but at no time does it‑‑ I guess
the word that you use‑‑ haunt us in any way. That's what this is about. You're
going to get up in the morning and be a part of this program. You're going to
be striving for a championship. That's the way it is, and that's what these
guys have done so well.  
And they've driven each other and driven our program to another big time
season, and I'm awfully proud of that. Like I said, we've got guys that are
cranked up to get going tomorrow night.  
THE MODERATOR: Gentlemen, thank you very much. Best of luck.

# [MISSOURI VALLEY CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=MISSOURI+VALLEY+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 5, 2015

  

### [Devonte Brown](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24849)

### [Greg Lansing](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21764)

### [Khristian Smith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26471)

  
_ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI_  
  
MODERATOR: 3:00 session features the Sycamores from Indiana State. They're the
3 seed. Will play Loyola, the 6 seed, in the 8:30 game Friday night. Khristian
Smith, Devonte Brown represent the student‑athletes. Coach Greg Lansing will
start off with a statement about his team.  
COACH LANSING: Just excited to get going. Got a really good group of guys that
were limping out of the gates a little bit to start the year. Coming back
after Christmas, starting with these two guys right here, we just started
being a little bit better in practice every day. Made it more of a focus to
compete harder, got off to a good start in the league.  
Didn't get to contend for a championship, but when you have two nationally
ranked teams fighting each other out, we figured hang in there and compete as
long and hard as we could and get better on a daily basis so coming in here
we'd have a chance.  
We're very excited about the opportunity. We know we're facing a very good
team and well coached team in Loyola, but we're anxious to get going.  
  
Q. Greg, the nature of this game is a bit different than your other two with
Milton, Doyle playing. What does that affect in terms of your preparation, and
what influence does it have on the game?  
COACH LANSING: A lot. It does, there's no question. These two will probably be
guarding him a majority of the time. A premier player in the league, a very
talented player, and it's a whole different deal guarding him. He'll get a lot
of our attention.  
As well, Turk and Earl, who have hurt us in the past in the games we played
them. We know they've got‑‑ they like to get the ball inside, good around the
basket. But putting one of the better players in the league back on that team,
we'll be ready for it.  
  
Q. There was an element during the season of will he or won't he, when it
came to Milton. How much scouting have you already done on him? Going back to
what he did last year. Did you kind of have to prepare for him anyway in the
couple games you played him this season?  
COACH LANSING: I think the first one we did a little bit. We weren't quite
sure until we saw him in warmup sitting out there. We knew pretty well he
wasn't going to play in the second one.  
I had talked to Porter off and on throughout the year, and I knew he had
something, even coming into the year, with his shoulder. We prepped for him
once. These guys know him very well. We watched‑‑ I know I did and the staff
did‑‑ Terry went to scout last year's game with them and in the tournament. So
even though he's been out all year, we're very familiar with him.  
  
Q. For both Devonte and Khristian, you guys have experienced winning here.
How much do you think that helps you here?  
DEVONTE BROWN: It helps a lot. But none of us have won it. So we're kind of
following Kitchell's lead this year.  
KHRISTIAN SMITH: I think last year was huge for us, just knowing how tough it
is to get to Sunday and hopefully win it. No matter what team it is. We know
we had a team in southern that really pushed us to the last minute of the
game. It doesn't matter what seed you come in with. Everybody is 0‑0\.
Everybody wants that trophy on Sunday to play on CBS. That experience we had
was unbelievable.  
So we try to convey that to the younger guys that we have that haven't been
here yet. It doesn't matter. Everything is a clean slate now. We just try to
take it a game at a time.  
  
Q. Greg, what special challenges does Loyola present? They're kind of
different from the teams in the league with their size and quickness and
things? What do you see in them. A team that makes them difficult.  
COACH LANSING: Even though they're undersized, we do like to throw it in
there. Thomas on the basket, we like to give him a lot of attention. He's
playing well. I think it was the player of the week last week. Comprised
together, all of them, they're a challenge. There's no question. We think
Turk's one of the better shooters in the league. Thomas‑‑ Earl had 19 or
something on us in the second game, just got to the basket on their ball
screen continuity offense. He's changing things up with his defenses a little
bit.  
Porter's done a great job. We have to be ready for everything, there's no
question.  
This is a team that they got their best player back. They're excited about
being here and being a 6 seed. They think they can contend with anybody, and
they can, when they're playing well.  
  
Q. This is for the players. Third time you've seen Loyola or going to play
Loyola. Talk about, if you will, your mental preparation, not only for Loyola
the third time, but how different it is just because it's Arch Madness.  
KHRISTIAN SMITH: I would say it's hard to beat a team three times in a year,
but I mean, the preparation is going to be the same. I think the excitement
level will be a little bit different just because it's tournament time. You
walk in this building, and there's a certain feeling you get that you don't
get anywhere else. You know you win or you go home. That's the message we're
still conveying to people.  
You know what I mean, we're going to prepare like we prepare for every other
game. It doesn't make a difference. We want to win this one like we want to
win last Saturday's game too. So it's just tomorrow or nothing.  
DEVONTE BROWN: I think we're both familiar with each other, so it's going to
be more of a defensive type of game. It's going to make it a lot better, but
we're going to be ready after the scout meets with us tonight and get ready
for them.  
It's no different‑‑ it's conference, but it's no different than any other
game.  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for the Sycamores? Thank you. See you tomorrow.

### [Anthony Beane](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26463)

_ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI_  
  

Southern Illinois  55  
Missouri State  48

  
THE MODERATOR: Victorious coach of Game 1 is here, Barry Hinson. We're going
to start with him with a statement on the game.  
COACH HINSON: We haven't said "victorious coach" takes the podium in quite a
while. So I kind of like that.  
I thought this was a simple game. I said this Monday in the conference call, I
said it on my radio show, and I said it on the pregame show. I felt like the
team that really wanted to be here today, that really had the most enthusiasm
and would have an opportunity to win this game.  
Now, with that being said, I thought you just saw two teams that really played
with a lot of enthusiasm and effort. We went up 11, and I tell you what, such
a characteristic of Paul's teams, but they just came roaring back and did a
great job.  
This game was unusual for a play‑in game because, in most circumstances, one
team doesn't play very hard, and that certainly wasn't the case today. This
was two teams that just acted like they wanted to be here today, and I think
that's a testament to the Valley.  
I'll let you guys ask questions.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're going to go to questions for the student‑athletes. Jalen
Pendleton and Anthony Beane are here. We've had opening statements, so we'll
have questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Jalen, this one's for you. In the second half, like Coach said, the Bears
started making their comeback, you had five straight points and a couple
steals. Just talk about what you think your intensity did for the rest of your
teammates.  
JALEN PENDLETON: Coach has told me all along that my energy is what gets our
guys going. So I just try to make sure that I bring energy to the team and do
whatever I can do to spark the team.  
I think that it helped a lot. We kind of got a little slump for a minute, and
when I came in, I got those couple steals, and we picked it back up. I see my
guys' face, and they looked real hungry. So it helped us a lot.  
  
Q. Jalen, can you just talk about the overall defensive efforts, forcing
them into 16 turnovers.  
JALEN PENDLETON: We just really wanted to play defense tonight. You could tell
everybody on the floor, all five guys on the floor, you just look at our
faces, we were hogging for stops. We wanted to get stops today. That's what we
came out and said we wanted to do is try to shut them down, and I think we did
a great job of that.  
  
Q. Anthony, you guys don't get very long to enjoy this. Do you go back
tonight and start studying your games against Wichita State? How does that
work?  
ANTHONY BEANE: Yeah, that's the main thing. We're celebrating in the locker
room, but as soon as we get back to the hotel, it's all business. Coach is
going to go over our game plan for tomorrow and get ready for Wichita State.  
THE MODERATOR: Jalen, same question. Are you going to study?  
JALEN PENDLETON: Yeah, for sure. I mean, we're happy we got this win, but we
can't be satisfied. We know that we have a great team that we have to play
tomorrow. So we just have to make sure that we enjoy this win, but we have to
be focused for tomorrow.  
  
Q. Anthony, could you just talk about Ruder hit a couple of threes there to
get him close again and you came in and hit a couple more. Is it like a duel
at the end there and you stepping in to get them on top?  
ANTHONY BEANE: That was just J.P. When he came in, like you said, he gave us
energy, and Jalen is the one who kicked it to me. When he created it for me, I
was able to knock it down.  
  
Q. Guys, I'm just curious about tomorrow's game with the shockers, kind of
your thoughts on them, and what you guys think you need to do during this go
around to beat them.  
JALEN PENDLETON: This go round, we have to play a great game. They're a great
team. You can't make a lot of mistakes. It's a very, very small margin for
error. So we have to make sure that we don't turn the ball over and we just
play as a team like we did tonight, and I think we'll be fine.  
ANTHONY BEANE: Just the exact same thing Jalen said, just come in focused and
bring energy. No matter what, keep your head up and stay positive and just
keep doing what we're doing, having fun.  
  
Q. Anthony, 10 points. How hard were those 10 points? They had two guys
watching you for most of the last six minutes, didn't want to give you a
shot.  
ANTHONY BEANE: They were okay. Like I said, it was just‑‑ it was a credit to
Shawn and Jalen because that's who got it to me. So I give credit to them.  
  
Q. Guys, Lavender hitting big free throws in the last minute. How happy were
you to see those? Is someone else you wanted to see take those in the last
minute?  
JALEN PENDLETON: Deion went to the free‑throw line, and I was confident he
could make them. Deion is a great player, and he can score the ball better
than a lot of players in this league. Even though he's a freshman, Deion is
very confident in his game. As soon as he got fouled, I felt good about him
going to the free‑throw line because I knew he was going to make him.  
If anybody else could have the ball in their hands, I expect for them to make
them too. I have confidence in my teammates. Whether it was Shawn or Anthony
had the ball, whoever had it, I knew they were going to step up and make the
shots.  
THE MODERATOR: Gentlemen, we will dismiss you two and stay with Coach Hinson.  
  
Q. Barry, how much of a key was it to disrupt Dorrian Williams tonight?  
COACH HINSON: We changed the way we played them. It's amazing, when you get
your butt beat twice, you try to figure out what you did wrong the first two
times. We guarded Dorrian different than we did in the past. We guarded ball
screens differently. We never pressed. We pressed. We haven't played that much
zone. We played sporadically, off and on zone. We played different, how we
played out of bounds underneath the basket because they destroyed us at their
place.  
So I think, quite frankly, I'm an old stubborn mule, sometimes it takes me a
little while. We knew we'd have to play a little different against these guys
in order to beat them.  
  
Q. Coach, you had great fan support out there today. Walking down here, one
of those fans kind of shouted out, tomorrow Wichita State is going to run into
a buzz saw. Do you guys feel you picked up enough momentum, maybe have enough
electricity, good showing tonight where that statement might be true?  
COACH HINSON: I'm going to answer this question for you. I'd lay 25 to 1 odds
that fan was inebriated.  
  
Q. Last time we talked to you, one of your biggest concerns was having such
a young roster. You were worried they were going to come into this game and
the excitement of March Madness was going to get to them, and they weren't
going to play as well. Obviously, that wasn't the case tonight. Anything you
talked to them before the game started? Anything specifically you worked on
with them before the game?  
COACH HINSON: First of all, I think that's a great question. I think the thing
that we try to do, as soon as we beat Drake on Saturday, we met with our guys
after the game. We beat Drake, and we went in the locker room, and our guys
all had their heads down. We lost five games in a row and just busted a
streak, and we didn't have any fun at all.  
We won Senior Night, and our guys were in the locker room like it just didn't
mean a lot. So I got with my staff, and I said, we're doing something wrong
here. We've got to start having fun. We've got to get back to being kids,
including me.  
We did that every day in practice in everything that we did. Yesterday while
our guys were waiting for the bus to come in the parking lot‑‑ because we were
getting a lot of snow. I was doing doughnuts in my car and got pulled over by
the police. And our players really enjoyed that‑‑ not the doughnut part,
someone else being in control‑‑ but they were laughing. And I knew at that
time, okay, we're starting to relax a little bit.  
I relaxed a little bit, and I think that's the whole key. I thought we had fun
today. We'll see if we have fun tomorrow. I'm going to tell you, you guys want
to ask me about tomorrow, here are my thoughts. You've got two different
choices when you play today's game. You can get on a bus and go home right now
and get your good chicken fried steak on the way home, or you get an
opportunity to play on national television against the eighth ranked team in
the country. I love chicken fried steak, but I'd rather play the eighth ranked
team in the country.  
It's a privilege and an honor to do that. We have to play virtually a perfect
game. We know that. We get it. But I'd rather do that than the option. We're
going to come here tomorrow. I just told our players in the locker room, the
only thing I'm going to ask them is they play so hard they feel like or they
throw up on the floor. That's all I'm going to ask them to do, seriously. And
that's the same thing that I'm going to ask of our fans. You're right, we did
have great crowd support, and that's one thing I love about Southern Illinois.  
  
Q. We talked about Deion the other day, and you put him in the starting
lineup, and he had a great start early. And then the great finish late. Talk
about him.  
COACH HINSON: I've got a lot of confidence in Deion shooting the basketball.
We're calling plays for him when it's a three‑point game. I was very confident
that he had the ball in his hands for free throws.  
We had him shoot the technicals. He just goes brain dead. He's like every
other freshman. There comes a point in time when the aliens come and get him
and take him away for a little bit and bring him back. He's a typical
freshman.  
We started two freshmen and two sophomores today, guys. There's only 26 teams
younger than us in NCAA. I was pretty impressed with our guys today. You've
heard me all year long, I like our guys. I like them. They drive me nuts.  
They're a bunch of goobers and knuckleheads, but they're my guys. We're
getting better.  
  
Q. Coach, tonight is obviously about your team and your win, but you're
obviously familiar with the Bears as well. From what you saw tonight, the
attention you paid from afar to take on where they're at right now after going
through one of the most difficult years they've had in quite a few years.  
COACH HINSON: I'd be a liar if I told you I didn't follow Missouri State
basketball because, even though they fired my ass, it's still very dear to me
in that community, and my mom and dad still live there, and my mom and dad
report to me on every move that Paul makes. If Paul goes to Hy‑Vee, I know it.  
I think what they've just gone through this year is absolutely incredible. If
we'd have gone through the same thing with injuries and defections, we
wouldn't have had as good a record as what they've done. I thought that guy
did a hell of a job this year. You look at today, and they came out and played
their butts off. They gave us everything we could handle, and quite frankly, I
was proud of them.  
I really wanted to win the game, though. I thought what Paul and his staff
have done, the adversity they've gone through this year was really impressive
with what they did.  
  
Q. Coach, how important was it this evening to get contributions from a
variety of players as you did? And how important might that be leading into
the matchup with Wichita State tomorrow?  
COACH HINSON: First of all, if we ever do interpretation, you and my voice,
we're going to be right there next together. You're my man. You've already got
the favorite voice here. If you learn how to say y'all, you're going to be
okay.  
When you get to this tournament, the teams that have been successful are the
teams that do exactly as you said. Sean O'Brien, 10 and 6. Deion Lavender, 12
and 5. Jalen Pendleton, the steals that he had today. You go down the line.
Bola had a big basket, big rebound. Everybody made a big play today. We didn't
shoot the ball very well at all, but like you said, we kind of spaced out the
contributions, and that's what you have to do to be successful in this
tournament.  
  
Q. Coach, it seems like you kept it pretty close with Wichita State back in
January at Koch Arena. I guess, what do you take from that game going into
tomorrow? What do you guys need to do to emulate that and possibly pull off
the victory like you mentioned earlier?  
COACH HINSON: We always find it a privilege to play at Wichita State because
it's going to be 10‑5, 7‑5, no matter when you play them, doesn't matter who
they play. But quite frankly, it was close because Gregg allowed it to be
close. Just point blank, that's the way it was.  
Quite frankly, I think we played better at our place and got beat by 25.
That's how well they're playing right now. They're playing as good, if not
better, than anyone in the country right now. We're playing, in my opinion,
the hottest team in the country right now.  
We know what our chore is. We know what our task is. But doggone it, at least
we get an opportunity to be part of it.  
Thanks, guys, for coming.

# [MISSOURI VALLEY CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=MISSOURI+VALLEY+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 5, 2015

  

### [Auston Barnes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26505)

### [Geno Ford](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23244)

### [Nate Wells](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28369)

  
_ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI_  
  

Bradley  52  
Drake  50

  
THE MODERATOR: The victorious Bradley Braves are here. No.10 seed will move on
and play Northern Iowa tomorrow night at 6:00. Auston Barnes and Nate Wells
are here as the student‑athletes. Head coach Geno Ford is in the middle, and
he'll start off with a statement, and then we'll go to questions for just the
two student‑athletes and come back to Geno.  
COACH FORD: I thought two teams that played well and played really hard
defensively. It's kind of interesting. They had us scouted out unbelievably
well, and we had them scouted out pretty well. I thought the two teams
offensively struggled to get things going because of the high level of defense
played both ways.  
Give Drake a lot of credit. They've got a young team that's going to be good
next year. We were fortunate at the end we finally made a couple of free
throws with the game on the line, and I was proud of our guys for finding a
way to win.  
  
Q. Auston, can you kind of take us through the big three ‑pointer you hit
there at the end. You shot it pretty quick, but you were open, and just take
us through your mindset there.   
AUSTON BARNES: My coaches, Coach Ford has been preaching to me about being
more aggressive and just playing with some confidence. I toed the line, and I
was open. So I put it in.  
  
Q. Jacob Enevold got involved early in the second half. As the second half
went on, it seemed like he was going to the line more but wasn't scoring much.
How did you guys adjust to not letting him get as many touches?  
NATE WELLS: He's a great guy, ducking in the post players, and we're just
trying to work our way to get around. Seemed like it was going that way. He
was, what, 12 for 12 at the line or something?  
But, yeah, trying to do our work early and keep him to limited touches. But
every time he got the ball with the whistle calls, he got to the line.  
AUSTON BARNES: He did a great job of getting to the line today. The man can
shoot free throws. He proved that today. He's so big, and he's so good at
using his body and getting angles. It's really hard to guard him in the post,
and Nate did a great job in the first half. He's 7 foot, and he gets angles on
people, and it's hard to stop him.  
  
Q. Auston, when you got the ball there, when that play began there, were you
thinking three right away? Or when did it occur to you that you could take
that shot?  
AUSTON BARNES: I'm a three‑point shooter. My percentages might not say that,
but I don't know, I thought the lane was open, but I toed the line, and I
thought just shoot it, I don't know. Just playing with confidence. That's what
we've got to do in the next game.  
  
Q. Both guys, can you kind of describe your defense. You played a lot of man
tonight. Did you think Drake was not expecting that? Just describe not only
how you played but just the aspect of your defense.  
THE MODERATOR: Nate, lead us off.  
NATE WELLS: We try to do a good job of mixing it up and keep our opponents on
their toes, but the main thing that comes out is communication. When we do a
good job on the back line between Auston and Josh and I and talk to Warren and
Tramique on the wings. That allows them to not only get through screens and
stuff, but on the help side defense.  
AUSTON BARNES: That team's so good at shooting threes that it's almost scary
to play them. We've been playing a lot of zone the last four weeks of the
conference, and they shoot the ball so well that I think it was better to just
get up and pressure the ball a little bit more and maybe disrupt them.  
I know they've been scouting us and they probably thought we were going to
play a diamond and one. But we did a good job switching it up and
communicating, like Nate says.  
  
Q. Those free throws at the end of regulation, what was your ‑‑ after the
second one didn't go down, what was‑‑ how happy were you to see your teammate
hit the three and then the other free throws?   
NATE WELLS: I was ecstatic that he hit those. I feel like I rushed those. If I
was in my normal routine, but I put them up in the heat of the moment. I'm
excited for Josh and Tramique hitting them at the end. So great, big time.  
  
Q. It's been four years since Bradley's won a game in this tournament. Could
you guys both speak to kind of breaking that skid. I know you weren't here
that long ago, but just what does it mean to finally break through?  
AUSTON BARNES: It means a lot. We want to give ourselves another opportunity
to play. I just think, why not us? We're not done. That's what we were saying
in the locker room today. I'm just grateful we have another opportunity to
play tomorrow.  
NATE WELLS: Exactly. Why not us? We just leave it all on the floor and don't
regret anything.  
  
Q. You got a big challenge tomorrow. Can you kind of speak to playing
against the Panthers.  
AUSTON BARNES: Well, he makes all the game plans, and we try to go out there
and execute. We've got one day to do it, and they're a great team. They've got
Conference Player of the Year and a whole bunch of guys that can shoot.  
We're just going to come out here and then play our hearts out.  
NATE WELLS: We've just got to go out there and leave it on the floor and do
our best and play for each other.  
THE MODERATOR: Gentlemen, thank you very much. Congratulations on your win.
We'll stay here with Coach Ford for a little longer.  
  
Q. The decision to go to man, was that because you knew they had you scouted
so well with the zone stuff?  
COACH FORD: Well, we‑‑ to be honest, when we went up there, we showed some
diamond and some triangle and some zone. We mixed a little triangle in. We
played five possessions. We were 4 for 5 at getting stops. We threw the
diamond on them only one possession. So we were just trying to keep them out
of rhythm.  
And I thought that in man we had them scouted well enough that the players‑‑
it isn't about the coaches scouting. It's about the players on the floor
communicating and recognizing actions, and I think it made it a little easier
that it was the third time seeing them and the third time seeing us.  
When we were‑‑ when we called a play call, our guys were talking on the floor
about who was going where, and they were doing the same thing when we had the
ball. It's really kind of funny. You've had all those articles about college
basketball scoring being down, and my point has been all along, with the
access that we have to scouting, it's just really increased your ability to
defend. I mean, they defended great too.  
If they make a three at the buzzer, we're in here talking about how we barely
lost and talking about their great defense. Both teams were terrific. I
thought the kids really absorbed the game plan both ways, and we're really
fortunate we came out on top. That could have gone either way.  
We led almost the whole day. Felt like we were going to win, then it got late
and felt like it could go either way. I thought our flow to the game was
better, and we kind of led a little bit more often than they did on the day.  
  
Q. Can you speak to breaking your losing streak down here?  
COACH FORD: We've really ruined your writing because you can't talk about the
west of the Mississippi anymore. We‑‑ I don't know. It's funny because,
honestly, it was something you and I talked about because we needed to talk
about, and I think you excitedly wrote it. I'm just kidding. It was something
that had to be written about.  
To be honest, we've never had the discussion with the team. Today's different
because of the tournament. So if you don't win today, it's over.  
Interesting thing about our team, for all the loss that's we've had, the close
losses and the disappointments over the year‑‑ and there have been countless‑‑
I gave the guys off on Sunday and Monday. Monday night at 10:00, they came in
and played pickup, and every guy on the team was in there playing. They
organized it. I wanted them off their legs, and they wanted to play.  
They want‑‑ they're not ready for it to be over now. You spin that into
tomorrow, you cannot want it to be over, and that's all fine and dandy, but
we'd better play our butts off and play really, really well. We're playing a
team that's a top ten team in the country.  
They're a great offensive team. For us, we're probably not going to score 75
points tomorrow. So for us to win, we've got to guard unbelievably well, and
we're going to need them to miss some shots.  
But I think that it's something that our kids are excited about an opportunity
to do. I was just proud of them. I thought we were relentless in the game
today. It's one of the rare moments‑‑ and you've seen us all year. When we
gave up the lead, as we held the lead the whole day, and mid second half, they
got a quick lead. We came right back and got it, and about 4:30 to go, we were
down by three, I believe.  
That's when we've struggled in the past to get a basket. I think it was Warren
that hit one, and it just kind of got us back on track. But we haven't gotten
over that hump quite enough.  
And give the kids a ton of credit because they just kept playing and grinding.
It was a hard‑fought game, but excited we won. Enevold was terrific. He was
terrific. We had no answer for him, but the rest of them, I thought we did a
pretty good job on.  
Is that going to be your title tomorrow, Dave? Win west of the Mississippi? Is
that what you're going with? Maybe? So I'll just keep talking. So if I keep
filibustering you, you're done. Okay.  
THE MODERATOR: Geno, congratulations. We'll see you tomorrow.

# [MISSOURI VALLEY CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=MISSOURI+VALLEY+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 5, 2015

  

### [D.J. Balentine](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26489)

### [Egidijus Mockevicius](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26491)

### [Marty Simmons](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20513)

  
_ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI_  
  
COACH SIMMONS: I'm sure like every other team, we're excited to be here. It's
a great opportunity for us. St. Louis has always been a great host city to the
tournament. They've treated all the student‑athletes, coaches, fans in a
first‑class manner.  
A great opponent in Illinois State, a team that's beat us twice already. Had a
great game Saturday at Evansville. Very talented team, very well‑coached team,
big, strong, physical team. We're looking forward to the opportunity.  
  
Q. Marty, can you talk a little bit about where you see this league right
now. Give me a little bit of a pulse check. Is the arrow in this league
pointed up? Flat line? Give me a sense for the big picture, as it were, of the
Valley.  
COACH SIMMONS: Well, I'm probably biased, but I said it before the season
started. I thought, top to bottom, it was going to be as good as it's ever
been. That's pretty good when you just lost Creighton a couple of years ago.  
Some programs had some injuries along the way that I think might have affected
it being even better, but I think it speaks for itself. When you have Wichita
and Northern Iowa, being in the top 25 pretty much the entire year, both right
in the range of the top 10, and I'd like to think those two were ahead of
everybody else. But I'd like to think that everybody else had a pretty
competitive year as well.  
We've got a lot of players coming back next year. So I guess I spent a lot of
time saying that I think it's headed up. I think it's been a great year, and
it's only going to get better.  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by D.J. Balentine and Egidijus Mockevicius.  
  
Q. For Egidijus, what makes it so tough ‑‑ Coach just referred to their
front line being very physical and all that, but what's it so tough for you to
play against them?  
EGIDIJUS MOCKEVICIUS: What's tough to play against them, as you mentioned
before, they're just physical. I don't know. All we're going to do is match
their physicality, and hopefully we're going to get in the zone.  
  
Q. D.J., obviously, you played them six days ago. You've lost to them twice.
Does that give you guys any kind of psychological edge? Everybody has always
heard this hard to beat a team three times and all that. Do you think,
especially the way Saturday's game went down to the wire, that that gives you
a little bit of an edge?  
D.J. BALENTINE: I wouldn't say an edge, but just more excitement that we got
beat by them twice. Obviously, we really don't want it to be a third time. I
really think that motivates us a lot just to come out and compete really hard.  
  
Q. D.J., when you've got two monsters in this league at the top, like you do
right now, does that put more pressure on them, less on everyone else, to get
onto a three ‑game roll? Is that psychology overworked? Can you just give me a
sense of, psychologically, what it does for a team like you guys?   
D.J. BALENTINE: It makes us more hungry, I'd say, just to be where they're at.
Just to see the success they have, and they deserve all of it. I think it
makes us want it more. But I think, like you said, the two power‑heads at the
conference, I don't think it's much pressure on them. I think it's a lot of
pressure on us.  
  
Q. Two either one of you guys, when you hear Arch Madness, what do you guys
think?  
D.J. BALENTINE: Arch Madness is incredible. It gets me excited every year, and
I think I'm more excited this year than ever before just because of what's at
stake. All the teams are great this year. So just really gets me excited, the
atmosphere and it all.  
COACH SIMMONS: I'd say the same thing, excitement. I think fans, coaches,
players, everybody involved, parents, they just get excited about coming to
St. Louis. Again, like D.J. said, the atmosphere, and obviously what it means,
the opportunity. You're playing for a championship. The slate's clean.
Everybody's got an opportunity now for a second time to play for a
championship.  
EGIDIJUS MOCKEVICIUS: And that's what we play for. Just that's why we
practice, just to come here and show ourselves. We just want to play here
honestly. So that's an incredible, incredible opportunity.  
  
Q. Marty, as a coach preparing to play a team that you just played six days
ago, what ‑‑ is there anything different about that that is a special
challenge.   
COACH SIMMONS: Not really. Everything's pretty fresh in your mind. I think
both teams can evaluate what they had set up in both games, what worked, what
didn't work, things that maybe we want to try differently. I think maybe both
teams will adjust. We've done it quite often here in the last four or five
years. Not really.  
I think really any of the two teams that play, they're going to be familiar
with each one. I think it's just going to be really competitive.  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for the Aces? Okay, gentlemen. Thank you very
much. Best of luck this weekend.

## March 5, 2015

  

### [Ron Baker](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24906)

### [Gregg Marshall](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17087)

### [Fred VanVleet](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26458)

  
_ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Regular season champion Wichita State Shockers should be with
us. Ron Baker and Fred VanVleet represent the student body. Coach Gregg
Marshall is with us as well.  
COACH MARSHALL: We're just excited to be here, postseason play and looking
forward to the challenge this weekend.  
  
Q. Fred, when I was speaking with Zach Brown a couple days ago, he told me,
after that win with UNI, he feels like you could go up against anyone in the
country because you guys were able to execute offensively against a good
defensive team. Do you agree with that?  
FRED VANVLEET: Yeah, I think that's a good statement, coming from him. But for
a guy that's been around, we already feel that way. Speaking to some of the
media after the game, I just think we've got a good feel for the new guys to
be in a game like that and to play well and to get those experiences.  
For them, to know that they can do it is a confidence booster, but you talk
about guys like me and Ron and Shaquille that's been around, we've kind of
walked that street already, and we're just trying to pull those guys around.  
Zach Brown made a lot of big‑time plays in that game. Hopefully, we can keep
building on that.  
  
Q. Coach Marshall, really quickly, I don't want to make this about a rematch
with UNI, but have you watched film from that game at all since then, since
Saturday?  
COACH MARSHALL: Have I watched film from UNI?  
  
Q. Of that game against them. Have you watched film from that game at all
since then?  
COACH MARSHALL: Yeah, that's what we do.  
  
Q. I know, but how much. How much are you looking into it in case you do
have that rematch?  
COACH MARSHALL: I'm not worried about that rematch right now, but I probably
watched that game three times.  
  
Q. Fred, Ron, what do you guys use this tournament for? What do you want to
have working, functioning? What do you want to be able to say about your club
on Sunday when you walk out of this building?  
FRED VANVLEET: Well, hopefully, we're champions. That's what you come here
for. That's what you play for. Obviously, you want to be playing good
basketball, but I mean, we're not in the business of looking ahead of
anything, to be honest with you. We've got to figure out who we play tomorrow.
We'll watch the game tonight and just take it one day at a time.  
You come in and get three, and you can't get three without getting the first
one.  
RON BAKER: I think Coach put it into perspective best yesterday. He asked us
how to eat an elephant? Eat an elephant one bite at a time. Tomorrow's Friday.
That's when we play. Focusing on that day. If we get to Saturday, we get
there. If we get to Sunday, we get there. Just take it a day at a time.  
That's important for us because we've got a lot of young guys. Like Fred said,
last Saturday was important for us, and we executed on both ends of the court,
and that's what we're looking to do here this weekend.  
  
Q. Coach, just picking up on your voice a little bit. Are you feeling all
right? A little bug going around. I was just wondering how you're feeling.  
COACH MARSHALL: I'm a little under the weather.  
  
Q. Just in general, though, are you guys feeling ‑‑ is it just a matter of
excitement right now? A matter of confidence? How would you describe it, for
Fred and Ron?   
FRED VANVLEET: We're excited to be here. It's championship time, tournament
time. I think all of us are focused on the task at hand, and we're ready to
get to business. I would just say we're determined and ready to get out there
and play.  
RON BAKER: To me, it's just excitement. It's crazy to think it's this time of
year again, a championship march. So try and play our best at this time and go
from there.  
  
Q. To each one of you guys, what do you most look forward to when you come
here for Arch Madness? When you come and play here in Scottrade?  
RON BAKER: For me, it's just the excitement and the atmosphere. It's always
fun walking out to the court and you've got four different team colors in each
corner of the arena, everyone supporting their team. And then, obviously, the
competition in the Valley. Everyone plays their best ball this time of year,
and each game is very important.  
FRED VANVLEET: I would just say, piggy‑back off Ron. The atmosphere is a
tournament atmosphere. It's not like playing at home or on the road. It's
supposed to be a neutral site, but just the atmosphere of the game, when you
win an event, keep advancing. Obviously, the stakes rise. Fan bases get more
into it.  
It's one and done. So I always like having a little pressure there and just
looking forward to the opportunity.  
  
Q. Fred and Ron, you guys both had a really good ‑‑ the fans had a really
good turnout last year for the tournament here, and also last Saturday. What
do you want and what do you expect from the fans here this week?   
FRED VANVLEET: What do I want from the fans? I think we've got one of the best
fan bases in the country. We don't really ask them for much. They do a
tremendous job, and we just try to pay them back by playing as hard as we
possibly can. They showed again on Saturday, last Saturday, what Shocker
Nation is all about. We're just going to go out there and play as hard as we
can for them and for each other. I'm expecting a good turnout as usual.  
RON BAKER: I think Wichita is the farthest team from the site, if I'm not
mistaken, and we bring probably one of the larger fan bases here in St. Louis.
It goes to show for us players that our fan base is very supportive and active
throughout our community with supporting us.  
  
Q. Coach, how much do you let these guys have fun or treat this as strictly
a business trip?  
COACH MARSHALL: Probably more business. I'm not sure. I mean, they probably
have fun in their dorm rooms or in their hotel rooms, but I don't bother them
too much in there. We're not going to do much sightseeing.  
The fun is winning.  
  
Q. I know this is the Valley tournament, Fred, but just walking in here, the
aura of the building, have you thought about the NCAA Tournament last time you
were here, maybe the shot when you go out on the court? Just being here, the
aura of this building, a little bit of history for you guys. How do you plan
to attack it or even give it any consideration?  
FRED VANVLEET: To answer your first question, no, I tend to think of the
championship we did win here, cutting down the nets and being up on that
podium. So I'd rather think of that memory than the other one.  
It's just down to focus, man. We've had a long year, a great successful year.
Believe it or not, it feels like we've almost proven ourselves all over again,
which is always fun for me. I'm really looking forward to tomorrow.  
  
Q. Gregg, do you see the league as being on an upward arc? It's always been
your concern that this is consistently a multiple bid league. It's certainly
going to be that this year. From a broader sense, do you see this league
continuing to advance towards that sort of goal? Can you give me a little
pulse check as to where you see it right now?  
COACH MARSHALL: I think it's the best it's been in a couple of years. I think
UNI had a tremendous year. If they don't win the tournament, UNI, they will be
the first non‑Wichita State team to get an at‑large in the past eight years
since I've been in the league.  
From that perspective, I hope they don't win the tournament. That way, either
we win it or someone else wins it, and we get three teams in. So that's good,
that's positive.  
I came in this league in '07, and I was a year removed from having four bids,
and it's never been more than two. It's been a couple of years, like I said,
when we got the at large. It would be nice to be a two‑, three‑bid league
every year minimum, and I see some good players and some teams on the horizon.
So I guess it's getting better.  
  
Q. For Fred, you mentioned having something to prove. Where does that stem
from, do you think, this year?  
FRED VANVLEET: I mean, we just had a league banquet that we just attended, and
that's all I'll say.  
  
Q. Ron, can you follow up on that? Is there a chip on the shoulder that has
come in the aftermath of All ‑Conference voting, things of that nature? Can
you give us a sense?   
RON BAKER: To be honest, we think some votes got slipped up and put in the
wrong hat. It's just something we're going to look past.  
  
Q. Coach, I'm just curious, I guess, going into this as the 1 seed, you
don't know who you're going to play, obviously, yet. Just, I guess, talk about
the challenges of that as a team, how that affects you guys or if it really
doesn't affect you guys at all for game planning and whatnot.  
COACH MARSHALL: No, I don't think it affects us. We'll watch the game tonight,
and we're prepared to play either of those teams. That's one of the benefits
from being the Number 1 seed, you get to play the winner of the 8‑9 game, and
they're playing tonight and will have to go back again tomorrow at noon, which
is a quick turnaround. Certainly wouldn't want to trade places with them. So
we're okay with that.  
FRED VANVLEET: I think Coach said it perfectly. People with the hardest jobs
are the assistant coaches that have to scout the game on a short turnaround.
Other than that, they'll have us ready to play tomorrow, whoever that may be.
We'll be ready.  
RON BAKER: Like Fred said, our coaches are going to have to do a lot of work
for each game we play here. For us, the players, it's just our job to listen
to them and get on the court and play hard and just have fun out there.  
  
Q. Gregg, how do you ‑‑ it's a March rite of passage. You guys are here.
You're a 1 seed. Media in other towns‑‑ Dallas, Kansas City‑‑ are talking
about you and your job prospects and your future. How do you block that out
with these guys and yourself and people floating you as a magic candidate for
other jobs when you guys have team goals you want to get to and get table?  
COACH MARSHALL: I appreciate you speaking into the mike so I can here. I'm 52
now. It's hard to hear when you don't speak in the mike.  
Had you not told me that, I wouldn't have known. I don't have to block it out.
It's irrelevant. We're coaching and playing as hard as we can.  
If these guys in any way think that I'm slacking off and not doing my job,
they'll let me know. No, we're locked in.  
  
Q. Don't you guys allow yourselves to daydream just a little bit? I know
you've got to prepare for the next game, but wouldn't it be nice to maybe get
Kentucky down the road? Do to them what they do to you?  
COACH MARSHALL: Daydream?  
  
Q. Yes.  
COACH MARSHALL: I thought you said day drink.  
  
Q. No, we don't want you day drinking.  
COACH MARSHALL: We're a pretty honest team about ourselves. We know we're
pretty good, but we know there's times when we might slip up here and there.
So for us, we try to focus on what we've got in hand as far as our next game.  
I don't look at Joey brackets here and there. I don't do any of that. I just
focus on what's now and in the present.  
FRED VANVLEET: I don't like to daydream. You end up missing a lot of your day.
I'll just say that.  
  
Q. Just real quickly, are you guys going to be watching the game tonight?
Will you be in the crowd or just so we can let people know where to look for
you?  
RON BAKER: Yeah, we usually try to catch at least a half of the playing game.
At least in the past we have.  
COACH MARSHALL: I'm thinking about going up in the Arch and taking the team
out for a little sightseeing tonight.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much.

# [MISSOURI VALLEY CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=MISSOURI+VALLEY+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 5, 2015

  

### [Devaughn Akoon-
Purcell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28314)

### [Daishon Knight](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28313)

### [Dan Muller](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24792)

  
_ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI_  
  
THE MODERATOR: 2:30 session features the Illinois State Redbirds, No. 4 seed.
They will play Evansville, the No.5 seed. We have Coach Dan Muller with us.
Daishon Knight and DeVaughn Akoon‑Purcell will represent the student body.  
COACH MULLER: It's great to be here. Fond memories from many years ago.
Excited about the group we have. I think we learned some things last year, and
we played pretty good basketball lately. Excited to be with these guys.  
  
Q. Daishon, what have you told DeVaughn and a couple of these guys now that
they've been in the arena and seen it? What do you tell the guys about the
atmosphere, what they can expect?  
DAISHON KNIGHT: I tell them it's a cold atmosphere. We're going to get out
there, get a great warmup in, get warm real fast. Most important, I tell all
of them, just stay relaxed.  
  
Q. Dan, how much confidence has your team built up over these last four
games? Heading into this tournament, it seems like it would be a real boost.  
COACH MULLER: I hope a lot. I think we've played pretty good basketball at
different times throughout the year. We've had some losses, even good
basketball. To win our last game the way we did, to win four in a row, and
then we've had very good practices.  
I think we're coming into this weekend with confidence, but also understanding
you've got to compete at a high level to win games in this thing.  
Evansville was a close game, anybody we face after that, if we're lucky enough
to win, it will be a tough game.  
  
Q. Obviously, you were part of two team on back to back titles here. Is one
of those years more of a memory for you than the other one?  
DEVAUGHN AKOON‑PURCELL: Yeah, but for me, my senior year is easily my greatest
basketball memory in general, our weekend my senior year.  
The way that we played, the way that we basically dominated the tournament
with a group of guys that have been through a lot. So I'll never forget that
weekend.  
  
Q. If you guys could just reflect on playing Evansville so quickly after
having just played them, does that mean anything? Does it change how you
prepare at all?  
DEVAUGHN AKOON‑PURCELL: I would just say we prepare the same. We've just got
to expect they're going to come out even harder and more motivated because we
beat them twice in the regular season. We've just got to prepare how we
prepared in the past, and I think we should be fine.  
DAISHON KNIGHT: I think we look at it as a whole new slate. It's a new game.
We put the games and beat them past us. We prepare and get ready to go out
there and play another game.  
  
Q. Three of the last four games, Wichita State and Northern Iowa, were
closer than you've played them all year. Does that give you some confidence? I
know they talk about you as the dark horse to win this tournament? Do you
think about that at all? Does it help with your confidence?  
DAISHON KNIGHT: Those were good games, good teams we played. We would like to
win those games. We lost. We watched film about it, and we just put those
games past us. We move on to the next game and try to come up with the win.  
  
Q. Dan, on that subject of playing a team just six days later, back ‑to‑back
games, does that present any special challenges in terms of preparation?
Especially when you've won the game, to get your guys refocused on that.   
COACH MULLER: I don't think it's challenging in preparation. It made the
preparation easier, but it's an even playing field for both obviously. We're
so familiar with each other. You play every team twice. So you're going to be
familiar with whoever you play. Because it's so soon, covering the same
things, but really learning from what hurt us six days ago is probably the
biggest thing.  
I forget the second part of your question. Oh, I'm sorry. Because we won both.
That's what you said.  
I don't think our team is foolish enough to think that the two wins we had
during the regular season mean anything tomorrow. We've talked about it. It's
behind us. Not only that, but we had to make a shot at the buzzer to extend
into overtime. It's not like we blew them out twice.

_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

Wyoming  45  
San Diego State - 43

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by San Diego State.  
Coach, just some thoughts on today's game.  
COACH FISHER: I won't tell you everything I told our team afterwards, but one
thing I said is disappointment has no boundaries in our world, in what we do.
Nor does the sheer joy and exuberance and excitement that we felt yesterday,
that Wyoming is feeling right now.  
I will congratulate Larry Shyatt. He's a good friend, been a long‑time friend,
for what he's done, and for his team, with their grit and toughness.  
But we have a team that has proven that we have that same mettle, and I'm
disappointed we're not the ones out chopping the nets down. But we're not.
That's the reality of it.  
That disappointment and feeling truly has no boundaries. We had opportunities.
We didn't take advantage of enough of them. Some of it was us, some of it was
Wyoming.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll now take questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. AQ, just talk about the game. Coach said you had opportunities that you
didn't take advantage of. What opportunities do you think you had? Where
didn't you take advantage the most?  
AQEEL QUINN: I mean, went up by five points, they came down, hit the jumper.
We came down, didn't score. They came down again, scored again. Momentum gone
for us. Momentum for Wyoming.  
We had multiple times a lot of stops and we didn't convert. Just didn't
convert on a lot of stops.  
  
Q. JJ, how were they playing you tonight and was it different than what you
had seen? How did you adjust to that?  
JJ O'BRIEN: They were doubling me. If I caught it on the wing and I started
dribbling in, they came late. If I caught it on a block, they came over early.  
They were just doubling me, how everybody does. They came over, they got a lot
of length with Nance and Cooke under there.  
I felt like we converted on a lot of the times that we had doubles. I think
Malik hit a three in the first half. They were doubling me.  
  
Q. AQ, can you talk about the last sequence.  
AQEEL QUINN: Well, JJ had got the rebound first. He threw it to Matt. I was
wide open in the middle of the court. Winston was on my left. I forgot who was
on the right. But Grabau was backing up. I saw an open three. I mean, I had
confidence to shoot it, so I shot it. Didn't go in. Felt good.  
  
Q. Malik, I think you were the leading scorer tonight with 13. Your first
conference tournament. Talk about the experience and growing each game.  
MALIK POPE: It was quite an experience, ultimately, this whole thing. A lot of
mistakes. You know, some things we didn't do, it's just a disappointment
ultimately, that's all.  
  
Q. JJ, during the regular season you beat them twice by eight and then
sizable, by 26, later in the year. Why was tonight such a reverse?  
JJ O'BRIEN: Well, there was a lot more on the line tonight. They did a good
job just getting hot early. Both teams played hard. It was a good game
overall. They made their shots I think a lot better this game than they did
the previous two games.  
Obviously having Nance back was huge for them. But, you know, there was a lot
on the line, and they needed that to get to the tournament. They handled their
business today.  
Just got to give credit to them.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll dismiss the student‑athletes at this time. Thank you.  
We'll continue with questions for Coach Fisher.  
  
Q. Talk about the conference as a whole after this tournament, what you've
seen from it, the outlook for March Madness and the NCAA tournament.  
COACH FISHER: Well, we know Wyoming's going, and we think we're going. So
we'll see who else goes.  
You know who else we think's deserving. We'll see what happens tomorrow. This
is very, very competitive league, and it was shown in the conference
tournament.  
Any number of teams could have been cutting nets down. Wyoming found ways to
go backtoback to back, and they are. So they're to be congratulated.  
  
Q. Could you talk about the process of the NCAA tournament. It's real quick.
You don't know who you're going to play. You don't have time to scout.
Everything is compressed. Walk us through how the process goes and the
timeframe.  
COACH FISHER: No disrespect, I'd just as soon talk to you after on that. I'm
more concerned on questions on the game we had today. I'd be happy to talk to
you later about that. I'd rather talk about Wyoming and San Diego State right
now.  
  
Q. You came out in the second half playing very well. I think you held them
scoreless in eight minutes. In that stretch, you were only able to get 10
points, then things switched back. Most of the season you were able to keep
that momentum. What changed in this game?  
COACH FISHER: We haven't done it most of the season. We've done it at times
during the season. When we have, we've been successful. We've won.  
We started the game not guarding the way you have to guard. To Wyoming's
credit, they made shots. But they were open shots. They were too good of looks
that we allowed to happen. They made all of them early.  
The last nine possessions of the half, they scored one basket, a three by
Grabau on an inline out of bounds. We scored four times. So we cut into the
lead. Cut a 10‑, 11‑, 12‑point lead to three, or whatever it was, at halftime.  
You're not going to win many games when you score 45 points, but they did
today. You're sure not going to win many when you score 43. Six for 24 at the
second half, that doesn't get you victories.  
Our moxy guy, our guy that brings energy, that I love to death, AQ, was
0‑for‑5, 0‑for‑4\. We're not going to win many games when that happens.  
He had a great look at the end, nine, 10 seconds to go down two. But we had
other opportunities. With a minute to go, 50‑some‑odd seconds, we said we
wanted two for one. JJ is going to take the ball, we're going to screen him,
try to get a shot. Looked like he had a layup that didn't go in. You have to
make some plays.  
And Wyoming, they showed a lot of moxy and muster. They were tough‑minded.
Those seniors wanted to say, We want to go to the NCAA tournament, and they
did.  
Our five fifth‑year seniors wanted to win a Mountain West Conference
tournament championship, and we didn't get it done.  
  
Q. With the last shot you took, you had multiple timeouts, think about
setting something up?  
COACH FISHER: I'm sorry?  
  
Q. Multiple timeouts with the last shot, any chance to set something up?  
COACH FISHER: The last shot?  
  
Q. The three ‑point shot at the end.   
COACH FISHER: He had a terrific shot. You know, you sometimes say take a
timeout. We felt we had the flow, something good would happen. Something good
did happen, but it didn't bring closure with happiness. It was a miss.  
  
Q. You played a lot of tough defensive teams in the conference this year,
plus Utah, Arizona, Cincinnati. How does Wyoming's defense compare with the
best teams you faced this year?  
COACH FISHER: Wyoming says, Who do we want to shoot jump shots? They go under
any screens that are set, they back off, they dare you to shoot it. We didn't
make enough.  
At the other end, the shot clock got in the red a whole lot of times. Several
times they shoot it with under five and got the rebound and had another 35.
That slows your possessions down. That lends itself to the kind of 45 to 43
game that we had here.  
  
Q. The last couple weeks you started to build up some momentum, played some
pretty good games, some good halves here. How does this change things for the
psyche of the team? What do you have to do to get them ready to play again in
the NCAA tournament?  
COACH FISHER: I don't think I know the resiliency of youth. We will tomorrow
be euphoric when we see our name called. Doesn't matter what number's behind
it or where we go or who we play.  
So we'll be excited and ready to play. We wanted to win today and have another
one, have four in a row, five in a row, whatever it might have been. But I
don't think that will have any impact on our preparation and how we come out
ready to compete.  
We will be as energized as any team in the field of 68.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much, coach.  
COACH FISHER: Thank you.

_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

Wyoming  45  
San Diego State - 43

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Wyoming.  
Coach, your thoughts on today's game.  
COACH SHYATT: Well, these guys know I like the 43 part, although I guess some
of the pundits nationally feel like the game's got to change.  
I love the way these guys play. I have always trusted them. I'm so happy for
our ball club, for our university, and most of all for these five seniors who
came and took a chance on our staff, they took a chance on the University of
Wyoming at a time that was not easy. They really came through, so I'm happy
for them and equally proud of all of them and all of the team.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll now take questions for our student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Josh, it's crunch time. Offense was a struggle. You made that three about
a minute to play. Was that set? Was it open for you?  
JOSH ADAMS: Clock was winding down, as it was the entire game. San Diego State
is an insanely good defensive team. We struggled getting looks, myself
especially. They were front guarding me. I spaced to the corner. Hankerson
made a great pass and it went in. I'm blessed the ball just went in.  
  
Q. Larry, you got off to a pretty good offensive start, then struggled. San
Diego State, looked like they were doubling down on you. What was the biggest
difference from the fast start to the rest of the game?  
LARRY NANCE, JR.: I mean, anytime you have a hot start shooting from the
perimeter you got to be ready for that to fade a little bit. San Diego State
did a great job of pressuring all of us in the second half, kind of making it
a little bit difficult to get those open looks.  
The resiliency of this team to stick to our game plan is really what pulled
this one out.  
  
Q. Derek, you've struggled over the course of your career from the free
‑throw line. A little bit of an understatement. How have you gotten better at
the line over the years and how special was it to clinch this with that?  
DEREK COOKE, JR.: I think I just stopped thinking about it. I got guys on my
team, my coaches, everybody who has faith in me. My best friend Junior is
always just like, Don't think about it, just shoot it. I know before every
free throw, Riley Grabau comes up to me, he's like, You do this every day in
practice. Why not make this one now? Sometimes he talks trash to me. But today
he was more positive and I just made all of them.  
It started with the first one. He was like, Why not go one for one? Why not go
two for two? He kept going. I didn't think too far ahead and just thought
about that shot.  
  
Q. You've been thinking about what this would feel about forever. Does it
feel like what you thought it would feel like?  
LARRY NANCE, JR.: And more.  
JOSH ADAMS: And more. That's the best way to put it.  
  
Q. Josh, how would you assess your team's play over the tournament?  
JOSH ADAMS: Relentless. Been relentless all year. We've been in dogfights all
year. This is the style we play. I know a lot of the critiques about us, we're
grinding it out, we're going to lose energy. We had bounce in our step and
were able to grind it out all the way to the end of the game, and now we're
going dancing.  
  
Q. Larry, you guys have had points in each of the last few seasons where
it's looked like you've had a chance to make the NCAA tournament, and always
something has happened. Does it make it more special having been through that
adversity?  
LARRY NANCE, JR.: Absolutely. We've been so close before. Just seeing it slip
right from our fingertips.  
To know that this is ours, and there's nothing anybody can do to take that
away from us, like I said, it's everything we imagined and more (referring to
the trophy).  
  
Q. What does it feel to bring the trophy back to Wyoming, a place that
hasn't experienced having that trophy?  
LARRY NANCE, JR.: We came here, and I say it all the time, coach promised to
be a piece of something bigger. If I remember right, that court just about 20
minutes ago was something bigger. That's what we're taking back to Wyoming.
All those fans, this trophy, the tournament MVP, and an NCAA tournament berth.  
  
Q. Larry, you mentioned the fans. This was pretty much a home game for
Wyoming. Talk about the representation from Laramie.  
LARRY NANCE, JR.: It was crazy. You said it, it was a home game. Every time we
scored, you could see three‑fourths of the gym stand up and clap. Every time
they started chanting the W‑Y‑O or our band started playing "Cowboy Joe." Man,
no other way to put it, but it was a home game.  
And thank you to everybody who came out.  
DEREK COOKE, JR.: Thank you. Oh, my God.  
JOSH ADAMS: Thank you.  
  
Q. What is it like to get this for Coach Shyatt?  
DEREK COOKE, JR.: One of the greatest coaches I ever played for in my life,
I'm going to say that.  
JOSH ADAMS: This man, a good way to put it, has brought this program from rags
to riches. Like you could tell, it was a home game today. The fans recognize
this. Not only the players and coaching staff, but the fans recognize this.
The world has no choice but to recognize this as we get a tournament berth.  
This man has done more for me personally and each guy on this team, this team
and program, than anybody I've ever met. Your hat is off to him. We love him
as a coach. We wouldn't have it any other way.  
LARRY NANCE, JR.: Couldn't say it any better myself.  
  
Q. You embrace, a big hug. What was that moment like after all you've been
through to be able to have that relief?  
LARRY NANCE, JR.: Like a previous question stated, it's been so many extreme
highs and so many extreme lows. We beat San Diego State, fifth ranked, on our
home court. I went down with an injury. It was just up and down. And to
finally reach the peak, what we had set out to do, to share that moment with
him, my best friend on the team, I can't even put it into words.  
It was a very real moment.  
JOSH ADAMS: Couldn't have said it better myself. You know, countless hours on
and off the court just talking about this day for the last three years, four
years of my life, since I was a senior in high school, just talking about this
day.  
Everyone said we couldn't do it. Nance goes down, we can't do it. Nance plays
great, we can't do it. And we're here, so... I think that says it itself.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll dismiss the student‑athletes at this time. Thank you,
gentlemen.  
We'll continue with questions for Coach Shyatt.  
  
Q. I asked Coach Fisher this same question. Second half, they came out and
held you scoreless for about eight minutes. They scored 10. You were able to
reverse it. How did your team not get frustrated?  
COACH SHYATT: You just heard them. They speak very well for themselves. I
think sometimes through adversity you do become stronger and you're hardened.
This team is hardened. They have a good combination of five seniors, five
freshmen. These guys have been through a lot.  
Like many teams in this country, they had high hopes and dreams. They fell a
little short each year because of nothing they did wrong, but circumstances.  
In each game, the focal point has been put pressure on our defense, they're
not on a run. The first five minutes it was 2‑0\. They made 2, we made
nothing. I think they understand who they are.  
Sometimes it's even more important. And I really trust them. They understand
who they're not, and they don't try to pretend they're somebody else.  
  
Q. In looking back, that period when Larry was sick, you had a game up in
Reno where the first half was 14 points and the second half you really got it
in gear. Did you start to feel something then at that point?  
COACH SHYATT: Well, I'm hoping that was the beginning. I can't lie to you. I
can't tell you I felt it at that point.  
What happened was that Josh and Riley and Junior, I think they understood,
Look, these guys aren't going to be healthy for a while. Fortunately, like
some other players around the country, they didn't want to wait until they
were 100%. For that I love them. They said, Coach, whatever we got, as soon as
the doctors let us play, we'll give it our best. They weren't even a shadow,
perhaps still, not quite what they were before the mono.  
That's who they are. That's why I've fallen in love with them for four years.  
  
Q. The way Josh played these last three games, especially the late shot,
talk about his performance over the three days.  
COACH SHYATT: Yeah, you know, Josh has abilities that not a lot of people have
at 6'1". Because of that, you have to allow him a little bit longer leash than
some others.  
But I got to tell you, he's got oodles of energy. I tried to describe it the
other day, this team, Josh, as much as anybody, it's never shot on try. Try is
important. Doing your best. You can't always control doing your best. There's
another team and a little hoop.  
But to try to do your best, I don't know if you can say anything's more
important. Josh really, I think, epitomizes that.  
  
Q. You've spoken a lot about doing things the right way, winning isn't
everything, but building a program. What does it feel like to do things the
right way and get this win as a reward?  
COACH SHYATT: The win is a great reward for our student body and these kids. I
can tell you that I was crushed and really hurt when people would mention to
me when people said what was being said about this team. It really bothers me
because I love these guys.  
But like you said, I'm old school. I like people who do what they're supposed
to do most of the time. And that's what we do. All five seniors will graduate
this May. Not a lot of programs that will say that.  
They love being with each other and with our student body for four or five
years. That's the way college ball was supposed to be. You almost feel bad as
a coach. You're almost ashamed that the NCAA has allowed 650 transfers to
scatter around the country each year.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much, coach.  
COACH SHYATT: Thank you.

_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

San Diego State  56  
Colorado State - 43

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by San Diego State.  
Coach, some thoughts on tonight's game.  
COACH FISHER: It will be good to be playing in the championship tomorrow. We
have beaten two good teams. It's key by how we guard and our depth.  
We had another game where we made it hard for our opponents to score and got
ourselves a good team victory tonight.  
So we're happy that we're still playing.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Winston, pretty good game for you. Kind of an understatement. Talk about
your game, how much fun it was to get into the game like that.  
WINSTON SHEPARD: I just wanted to bounce back from last night. I thought I
left a lot of points right at the rim. I shot two for nine. My teammates
showed a lot of confidence in me, gave me the ball in an excellent position,
so all I had to do was finish.  
That's all it really was.  
  
Q. Winston, talk about that first dunk from the side. Describe what you
saw.  
WINSTON SHEPARD: You can ask my teammates, I'm pretty athletic, too. I don't
really know what I would have to say about it.  
I saw the play and I just wanted to make sure that I got the two and there
wouldn't be any mishaps on it.  
  
Q. Winston, it seemed like you made a real effort to start attacking the rim
in the start of the second half. What was the reason for that? Finally
figuring out what you needed to do to score and win this game?  
WINSTON SHEPARD: That's what we always want to do. It helped tonight playing
against Colorado State without their best player. There was a couple times
that a couple of us just got in the lane and the seas parted. No J.J. Avila in
there. He has quick hands, gets a lot of steals. It helped us a lot that he
wasn't in there.  
  
Q. How much different were they without him?  
WINSTON SHEPARD: A whole different team. They're not even the same team
without him. That's no disrespect to anybody on the team. That guy's all
conference, so it makes a big difference.  
  
Q. Winston, talk about Larry Nance. You'll face him tomorrow.  
WINSTON SHEPARD: Can some of my teammates answer questions?  
  
Q. Sure.  
DWAYNE POLEE II: Larry Nance, he's a great player, one of the best in
conference. He has a great team behind him. It's just going to be another
tough game. Really looking forward to playing him.  
  
Q. Dwayne, how are you feeling right now? 19 minutes tonight, excellent
game. Seems like you're getting back to full speed.  
DWAYNE POLEE II: I'm feeling great actually. My coaches and my teammates been
giving me great confidence to just go out there and play my game and bring a
lot of energy, so that's what I'm doing.  
  
Q. AQ, talk about your night.  
AQEEL QUINN: I thought I was going to slide out of here with no questions,
y'all. C'mon, man (smiling).  
I would say it was a rough night. A couple air balls. I don't know. I thought
I just played solid and I played through like our system, our team's system.
Guys gave me the ball where I normally get the ball, behind the arc in
transition. I just tried to come through for the team.  
And Winston does have bounce. Finally he's showing it.  
  
Q. AQ, they obviously didn't have Avila. Instead of going deeper in their
bench, they replaced him with a guard. What kind of adjustments did that force
you to make?  
AQEEL QUINN: Well, you got to sit down on defense, first off, when they got
guards in like that. Especially pretty much everybody on their team likes to
attack, attack, attack. You have to have a hover hand up and move your feet.
If your feet stuck in the mud, you're not going to be able to slide them and
stay in front of them.  
As far as the guards, it's a lot of switching action. We played a lot of
guards, too, except for Skylar and Angelo. A lot of our guys have to be in the
stance and be ready to play D.  
  
Q. Dwayne, is this the kind of game you pictured when you were out to come
back and be a part of?  
DWAYNE POLEE II: Yeah, me being a competitor, I want to go out there and have
the best game of my life.  
I was just playing through the flow. I found myself open a lot. My teammates
did a great job of finding me.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll dismiss the student‑athletes at this time. Thank you.  
We'll continue with questions for Coach Fisher.  
  
Q. When the game ended, your players walked off the floor, shook hands, went
to the locker room. There wasn't a ton of celebration. Is this expected of
this program to get to this championship game?  
COACH FISHER: We were excited. We were excited that we had an opportunity to
get to that championship game.  
I think when there are expectations, sometimes you flat line it a little bit.
But if you came in our locker room and saw the energy of our kids in the
locker room when they came in, they were hugging and high‑fiving one another.  
They are appreciative of what they've done, respectful of our opponent, and
determined that we're going to come back tomorrow and hopefully find another
way to get a victory.  
  
Q. We didn't see a lot of Chol or Malik Pope tonight. Do you expect to see
them more against Wyoming tomorrow?  
COACH FISHER: We got a lot of players. We tell all of them opportunity that's
productive will get you more opportunity.  
They'll all get an opportunity to play. Hopefully they'll play well. We would
much prefer to level out some of the minutes for some of our guys. But
tonight, for whatever reason, Skylar, we kept him in longer when normally
Angelo plays. Malik twisted his ankle in the first half. I was a little bit
reluctant. I want to make sure he's okay and able to go tomorrow.  
Hopefully they will play and play well.  
  
Q. Colorado State and Boise State have been considered on the bubble for the
tournament. Do you feel those are two tournament teams?  
COACH FISHER: I would hope so. I'm more worried about San Diego State. But
I've got great respect and appreciation for both coaches. They do a great job.
And I would hope that their body of work and how they played... Boise State
has been the best team in our league since they started that big, long winning
streak. And Colorado State's got more victories than anybody in our league.  
If you watch them play, you say, That's a tournament team. So I'm hopeful. I
would hope that they would get in. That would be my hope. I said that to Larry
tonight after the game. I said, Good luck in the tournament. We'll be watching
to see where you go on Sunday.  
  
Q. How different was Colorado State without Avila in there?  
COACH FISHER: If you take J.J. O'Brien off our team, how would we be? We'd be
different, a lot different. The ball goes through J.J. a lot. The ball goes
through their J.J. a lot.  
He creates so many problems for you at both ends of the floor. So there's no
question that it was a huge difference in the game.  
And I feel badly. We wanted to win. I told Larry that before the game. I said,
This is not me talking. I feel badly that J.J. is not able to play for you
tonight. I hope he's ready to play for you in the tournament.  
We want to win, but we want to win going against their full complement.  
  
Q. Speaking of J.J. O'Brien, he had another great night, contributions all
across the board. You've never been shy about talking about how much he means
to the team during the year. Talk about what he means at this time, post
‑season moments?  
COACH FISHER: J.J. doesn't care that he doesn't score. He's 0‑5 in the first
half. It doesn't bother him at all. It bothers most other players on our team
and other teams if they have a doughnut when they come in at halftime.  
We came out with intent. I said, We're going to run a play for J.J. the first
play of the second half. He wound up worming his way in and scored a layup.  
He knows how to play. He's extremely intelligent. He usually makes the right
play. A delight to coach. I think San Diego State University is fortunate to
have him as a graduate. He's in grad school now. He's a terrific young man.  
  
Q. Looking ahead to Wyoming, what is the biggest challenge with the
Cowboys?  
COACH FISHER: Well, we've had two tough, hard‑fought games with them. Larry
Shyatt had a team that at the midpoint in the season, they were leading the
league. Nance goes down and it affects them immensely. He's back. I don't know
if he's back 100%, but he's back.  
And they're good. They're senior‑laden. Larry Shyatt knows what he's doing,
and he controls pace and tempo of the game. They're a hard team to speed up.
So we're going to have to guard them.  
This should be a great game tomorrow.  
  
Q. We know about Nance. But the guards sometimes for Wyoming step up big.
What are going to be the keys to keeping them in check tomorrow?  
COACH FISHER: We're going to have to guard 'em like we did tonight. We're
going to have to make it hard for them to get easy baskets.  
Our theme, like a lot of coaches, tough twos. Make players make tough twos on
us. That's what we need to do.  
When we make shots we're a good team. We couldn't make shots in the first
half. We had nine field goals. Polee had four of them. It was good for us to
have our guy back, Polee, to play.  
In the second half, like yesterday's second half against Vegas, we made shots.
We look good when we make shots. If we could combine both of those for 40
minutes, we would be real good.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you for your time, coach.  
COACH FISHER: Thank you.

_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

Wyoming  71  
Boise State - 66

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Boise State.  
Coach, some of your thoughts on tonight's game.  
COACH RICE: It was a great ballgame. I mean, playing really good. Our guys
battled. Got it back, got it in overtime. They did some great things.  
I was really proud of the way we battled and competed.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Rob, seems like all season you guys made the right plays at the right
time. In overtime, it wasn't there. Maybe one play short.  
ROB HEYER: Yeah, it was disappointing, to say the least. I felt like we were
playing a really good defensive possession at that point. To see that ball
bank in was pretty tough because I believe that we would have gotten that stop
had anything else happened.  
But it didn't, so props to him.  
  
Q. Nick, a guy like Derrick who was so good all season, but off tonight.
What are your thoughts about being able to pick up the slack when he's
struggling?  
NICK DUNCAN: Yeah, we had a good game plan coming in. I mean, yeah, Derrick
just had one of those nights where he wasn't hitting shots.  
I felt our defense was there for a little bit, but we lacked a little bit the
first half there, at the end of the half.  
I mean, there's not much to say. We came together as a team at the end. But
just a few unlucky things, a few missed shots by us, that was the game.  
  
Q. You were up 12 with three minutes left in the first half. They extended
the run to 22 ‑5\. What changed there and how big was that stretch?  
NICK DUNCAN: Yeah, I mean, they went on a big run there at the end of the
half. I think our team stuck together and we were still confident no matter
what.  
If anything, there wasn't a minute in the game we didn't think we were going
to win the game. But credit to Wyoming for playing a great game. But, yeah,
we're just disappointed, that's all.  
  
Q. How big was that stretch there to finish the half?  
ROB HEYER: I think that was the momentum for the entire game. No matter if we
had a run late, I think that sparked their confidence for the rest of the
game. Those are just runs we have to, you know, struggle through. We have to
try to make plays at those times.  
We didn't make enough of them today.  
  
Q. Was Josh just hitting some tough shots? How frustrating was it with
him?  
ROB HEYER: He was hitting a lot of shots, yeah. We were always turning the
ball over. He's a great transition player. He scores a lot in transition.  
We knew we had to limit our turnovers if we wanted to stop him in transition.
We did a better job of that in the second half. But, yeah, he had a great
ballgame.  
  
Q. Nick, what are the next 36 hours going to be for you now?  
NICK DUNCAN: Haven't really thought about that yet. I think we get back
tomorrow, I think we'll watch the show tomorrow. We'll just see what happens.
Hopefully we'll be all right.  
But, you know, I think we'll think about the game for the next 24 hours, get
our heads around it, focus on what we got next.  
  
Q. Rob, do you feel you've done enough for the season?  
ROB HEYER: Yeah, I believe so. It's kind of a strange feeling not to have the
fate in your hands anymore. We built a résumé this season. We're turning that
in right now. Unfortunately we would have liked to have gotten an automatic
bid.  
I think we're a dangerous team on any night with our shooting capabilities. If
we continue to put together defensive stops, I think we're a problem for a lot
of teams.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll dismiss the student‑athletes at this time.  
We'll continue with questions for Coach Rice.  
  
Q. With Derrick who has meant so much to the team, picked a bad time not to
have his best game. Late in the game, you still had the ball in his hands. One
of those nights where shots weren't falling for him?  
COACH RICE: He's Mountain West Player of the Year. Anybody that would question
him having the ball and taking those shots, they haven't paid attention to
what we've done. Going into this game we won 15 out of the last 16, and
Mountain West Player of the Year certainly had a hand in those, a big, big
hand.  
We dance with the one who brought us. We played great team ball. We've done
such a good job together. But, you know, you got to credit Wyoming. They got
some of those block charge calls go their way. Probably frustrated Derrick a
little bit, I'd have to say. He just had a few balls that rattled in and out,
too. He was still right there.  
But proud of our guys. They competed. They stuck together. They understand
that, that that can happen. It can happen to great players.  
There's no question that you'd still want Derrick shooting those shots. Our
problem probably was the uncharacteristic turnovers. We had 16 turnovers
tonight. We're one of the best teams in the country at not turning it over.  
Adams had six or eight straight points off our turnovers in the first half.
That was probably more a key to the game than anything else.  
  
Q. What did you see on that 10 ‑0 run at the end of the half? Momentum
switched there.   
COACH RICE: We had a couple guys in foul trouble we were trying to protect.
They got a slip dunk to the basket because Nick was out. They got a turnover
for an and‑one too. That game wasn't going to be won or lost in the first
half. If we had a 10‑point lead going into first half, it wasn't going to be
over because Wyoming was battling. They know what's at stake. They got to win
this tournament.  
So they played like it. They got a bunch of seniors that want to keep playing.
They were battling.  
Our guys, I'm not taking anything away from our guys. They battled back, got
it into overtime. Then had one of the best defensive possessions in the game.
Had a stop it looked like. The ball just happened to bank in. When you play in
that many close games, sometimes that happens.  
  
Q. You have to wait until Sunday to know what happens. Do you feel like your
team is pretty settled?  
COACH RICE: You look at what we've done recently, 15 of the last 17. We lost a
game around Christmas to Loyola‑ Chicago without Derrick Marks. We lost on a
buzzer beater to Utah State. Tonight we went down to the wire with these guys.
They banked one in with a minute to go that kind of ended the game.  
You tell me we're not a tournament team because of those three situations, I
don't buy it. We're the Mountain West champions. We're number one seed in the
tournament. I think we got a great résumé.  
We went out on the road and played a lot of games, too. I think we need to be
rewarded for that.  
  
Q. The way that Rob and people like that have come up with such timely plays
to get you into overtime, your thoughts about what they were able to do?  
COACH RICE: These guys got heart. They just keep battling. Our shots weren't
dropping tonight like they have been. We shot 38%.  
You got to credit Wyoming's defense also. They did a great job. They were
battling. But, you know, a few of them, we had a couple good looks that
rattled in and out. On some nights we're making those. Most of the nights in
these last 17 games we have been making those.  
But they just kept fighting, fought us into overtime. They were right there
with a minute to go and, like I said, had a great defensive possession. We
know what happened next.  
  
Q. Obviously listing the reasons why you should be in, you appear pretty
confident you will be in. Is it nerve ‑wracking these next 36 hours?  
COACH RICE: It's not ideal. You'd liked to have secured it with this win. Our
guys played like that. They came down here, wanted to win this tournament,
gave everything they had. I don't think there's anything more I could have
asked of them.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much, coach.  
COACH RICE: Thank you.

_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

San Diego State  56  
Colorado State - 43

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Colorado State.  
Coach, just some thoughts on tonight's game.  
COACH EUSTACHY: Well, I was proud of our guys. I heard Coach Fisher talking.
J.J. Avila could have played for us tonight. I mean, he was healthy enough to
go, but we didn't want to ‑‑ we're in the tournament. We just didn't want to
risk anything. It just wasn't the right thing to do.  
You know, but San Diego State fought the same thing with Dwayne Polee. I heard
Coach Fisher said he wished our J.J. played against them. I believe him. He's
a gentleman of the game.  
Dwayne and I go back eight years. I've known him since he was, you know, a
sixth grader in camp. I was happy for him that he's back. They're going to be
a tough team to reckon with.  
With that said, I was really very proud of our guys. You know, we slugged it
out till the end. That's a really good team that we just played.  
I thought we went toe‑to‑toe with them. We had it to seven. Think the biggest
play of the game was that shot, I don't know, I think Quinn hit it or somebody
hit it, from the three with two seconds to go that got it to 10.  
Proud of our guys. We'll start a new season pretty soon.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Stanton, what makes a team like San Diego State so tough to score or get
good looks against?  
STANTON KIDD: They're pretty long, athletic. They do a real good job of
containing penetration and packing the paint when you drive the basketball.
Also they took away our bread and butter, which is screening and rolling.  
It gives you a hard time, guys like me and DB, if he sets a screen, to pick
and pop, get a good look. They played a really good defense tonight.  
  
Q. Daniel, how much of your guys' offensive struggle was you and how much
was not having J.J. to feed the ball through and not work things around a bit
more?  
DANIEL BEJARANO: J.J. in or not, obviously a good defensive team. Like Coach
Fisher said, when his team is hitting shots, they look good. Like when we hit
shots, we look good just as well.  
We weren't hitting very many shots. Every shot we took was probably tough. We
just got to give them credit. But we still went down low with Tiel in the
first half. You can't forget about that. He did do work.  
  
Q. Obviously you wanted to win this one. Did you feel like you were playing
with nothing to lose, going up against San Diego State?  
DANIEL BEJARANO: We don't really try to think about that. We were just trying
to play against San Diego State, just trying to have fun.  
We weren't glad that we just beat Fresno, we were trying to win the whole
thing. Obviously we didn't, so...  
  
Q. Stanton, without J.J. that left you guys one short off the bench. Played
seven guys tonight. Do you think you ran out of gas playing the second game in
two nights?  
STANTON KIDD: Coach always preaches about how much the body can take. We was
pretty tired but we kept fighting. That's the thing that coach liked about the
game tonight. The first thing he said after the game was over was that we kept
fighting and we didn't give up. I think that's going to do us a big favor when
we get to the NCAA tournament and we got J.J. back with us. When we feel
fatigued, we're going to keep fighting through.  
  
Q. Stanton, how different were they in the second half? They started
attacking the rim, going inside for their buckets, had a lot of success. Were
they doing things differently or was there some reason they were that much
more successful at it?  
STANTON KIDD: There were a couple blown assignments, giving guys angles we
shouldn't give. I fell like we played pretty good defense, making them score
over us. They got a lot of second‑shot chances and a lot of put‑ backs. When
we get back to practice, we're going to definitely work on rebounding and
getting ready for the tournament.  
  
Q. Have you thought at all about what you deserve? Have you given that any
consideration at all?  
DANIEL BEJARANO: At this moment, I really don't care, just as long as we get
in. It's all about beating the team in front of us and moving on, so...  
  
Q. You played twice without J.J., that's against Nevada and San Jose State
at home. How different were those games from tonight?  
DANIEL BEJARANO: It's just like all year, like I've been telling our coaches
and players. When someone goes down, more people have to step up. I believe in
our coaching staff as well as our teammates.  
It is different when someone goes out that is a big part of our team.
Obviously it was J. You can see the difference. We need everyone. But we still
fought.  
  
Q. Stanton, you said you'll have J.J. back when you're in the NCAA
tournament next week. You sound confident. I want to hear you state your case
for making the field of 68.  
STANTON KIDD: That guy is a big part of what we do, just like all three of us.
I always tell J.J. and Daniel, I say, If we don't have good nights on both
ends of the floor, we won't win.  
We're the leaders of the team and we have to lead by example. Tonight we
didn't do that on certain ends and certain points.  
When J.J. come back, he's going to be healthy and be fine and I think he'll
hit the ground running.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll dismiss the student‑athletes at this time. Thank you.  
We'll continue with questions for Coach Eustachy.  
  
Q. You said, We're in the NCAA tournament. Life on the bubble can be tough.
Why the confidence?  
COACH EUSTACHY: We're not on the bubble. We're 28 RPI. I've been through this
a lot, and we're squarely in the NCAA tournament. You know, if you read the
criteria, the body of work, I think we've had about as good a body of work as
most. You know, we won our first 14 games. It's supposed to mean as much as
winning your last 14.  
I have no doubt that we're in the NCAA tournament based off what the criteria
is, so... It gave us the luxury to sit J.J. and it's nice knowing that you
didn't have to win that game to go, in my opinion. I've been wrong once in my
life, but that's only once, so... It's a joke (laughter).  
No, I just think it's kind of a moot deal. We're too far deep into it. You
know, there's too many teams that are questionable ahead of us. The people
that know, the experts that do it for a living, you know, we're in great
shape.  
  
Q. Without J.J. how do you think that affected your depth?  
COACH EUSTACHY: You know, I think the real story in this game was that San
Diego State made a great adjustment and they decided not to press us. And if
you know, I think when we beat them at our place, we got some easy baskets off
our press offense. So they backed up and just packed it in.  
So I thought that was as big as anything. And, of course, you know, you just
adjust. I mean, again, I'm so happy for Polee. They adjusted and learned a way
to win. I was confident going into this game that we could win this game
without J.J. along with not having to win it to get into the NCAA tournament.  
Obviously there's an adjustment period. We played through it. I thought the
game was a little closer than 13 points. A few layups here, a few shots there.
But, I mean, that's a team that goes Sweet 16 that just beat us.  
  
Q. You've done the NCAA drill before. The preparation is a little bit
different because you don't know who you're going to play, the travel comes
up. Having done that before, how much of an advantage do you think it's going
to be having been to the Big Dance before?  
COACH EUSTACHY: I mean, obviously it helps. It's a great question. It helps. I
can give the players a heads up as to, you know, when they say this time, it's
this time, and wear this, you wear this. It's an advantage.  
But really the biggest advantage is we are who we are. We could play whoever
we draw tonight again. You know, time doesn't really help us. We play a
certain way. I think we play the right way.  
But obviously, you're saying I'm old is what you're saying. I'm an old guy,
right (smiling)?  
You look at these coaches, I mean, these guys that are up there, I think
they're the better guys in the country. The guy that just left, is there a
finer coach? That's why I like being around him so much, he makes me look
young, I hope. That's not a knock on him.  
But you look at Bo Ryan. When he hit 60, it was over. Now it's just starting
for a lot of coaches. But it helps. Experience always helps.  
  
Q. If circumstances had been different and you had to have played J.J., how
effective do you think he could have been?  
COACH EUSTACHY: I think he could have been really effective, you know. But
when you get that soft tissue and you just happen to hit it the wrong way...
He's been invited to Portsmouth. There's other things you have to think about.
The number one thing is the best interest of the student‑athlete. I mean, I
had to talk him down, talk him out of it. I had to tell him that this is not
good for long‑term.  
So I think he would have been fine. We caught them on a real good night.  
  
Q. If Wyoming wins tomorrow and gets the automatic bid, do you think the
NCAA Selection Committee will take four teams from what is the 12th ‑rated
conference in the country, or do you think somebody might get left out?  
COACH EUSTACHY: I don't know. What do you think? You guys are the experts that
write about it.  
You know, that's where I think the human element comes in. But if you go by
what you're supposed to go by, Boise State certainly deserves to be in. We
certainly deserve to be in. San Diego State.  
Just because we have this unusual situation, these guys have worked for 22
weeks now. They shouldn't be penalized because all of a sudden, We don't want
three from‑‑ I thought we were 11th, 12th. Whatever it is.  
You have to remember, our league is not the Missouri Valley. Our seventh‑place
team was UNLV. Our eighth‑place team was a school called New Mexico. So, you
know, San Jose State has struggled. He's doing a great job, but there's a
couple schools. Reno, Nevada was tough this year.  
You make it an eight‑team league, it's a hell of a league. I mean, ask Arizona
how UNLV is. Then they finish seventh in our league, didn't they?  
Yeah, it's a strong league. I think it's a little misleading because there's a
couple bottom schools that are rebuilding.  
  
Q. Do you think JJ's injury will have any impact on your seed?  
COACH EUSTACHY: I would hope not because he's healthy enough to have played
tonight, and he'll be fine, you know. It is a factor. I had to talk him out of
not playing tonight. You know, we're going to get the proper paperwork and say
that he could have played.  
So I would say no, because we have a healthy J.J. He's going to be healthy for
sure by that time.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much.  
COACH EUSTACHY: Thank you.

_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

Wyoming  71  
Boise State - 66

  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Wyoming.  
Coach, your thoughts on tonight's game.  
COACH SHYATT: Well, the first thing that comes to mind was it sounded,
audio‑wise, like a game in Laramie. Really pleased our fans came out. I'm
really happy for these guys.  
There's never been a game this year I've ever questioned their try. They have
great try. When they're up, when they're down. So I'm happy for them. I think
they're happy to be in the championship, but I don't think they're ready to
settle for anything less than a championship victory.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll now take questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Jason, did you call bank?  
JASON McMANAMEN: I did not call bank, but I heard a couple guys on the bench
call bank after I shot it.  
  
Q. That counts?  
JASON McMANAMEN: That counts.  
  
Q. Josh, that first half, going on to score 27, how satisfying was this for
you?  
JOSH ADAMS: Well, I said this a couple times in some postgame interviews. I'm
just happy for these five guys that are a year ahead of me that I've had a
chance and privilege to spend three years with. I know they've wanted this for
a long time, worked their tails off for it. I'm glad to be a part of it and
I'm glad I could do something to propel them to that spot and help out a
little bit.  
  
Q. How good are you feeling right now?  
JOSH ADAMS: I'm feeling pretty good. But the best stat is 2‑0 in the Mountain
West tournament. Not many people had faith we could do anything here. Now
we're winding up in the championship game. It's just a credit to this team and
how hard we've worked, how we stuck to our principles, stuck together as a
team.  
It's just a really gratifying feeling.  
  
Q. It's obvious what's on the line tomorrow. What would that mean to get the
tournament title and the berth to the NCAA tournament?  
JOSH ADAMS: Everything. Just like I said, we've taken this program, especially
these five guys ahead of me and Jason, from a 10‑21 season to three plus 21
season. It's a credit to this guy on my right, Coach Shy, everybody that wears
the brown and gold. It's a tight‑knit family. We've worked hard to get here
and we've built this program up. That would be the cherry on top if we could
make this dream come true.  
  
Q. Jason, take me through the shot. Did you just try to put it up? What was
your reaction when you saw it go in?  
JASON McMANAMEN: I just saw the shot clock winding down. I had a little space,
so I shot it. I mean, a little too hard I guess. I guess I got a little lucky
with the bank. I was pretty surprised, as everybody else was.  
  
Q. Larry, Josh, when you saw that go in, what went through your minds?  
LARRY NANCE, JR.: CSU.  
JOSH ADAMS: Exactly. He's done it two times before, CSU and Nevada. When he
has the ball, the clock is winding down, I figured it would go in somehow.  
  
Q. When you're in a game like this that's so back and forth, what did it
feel like in the middle of this game? How fun was it to be a part of something
like this?  
LARRY NANCE, JR.: These conference games are always a blast. But in terms of
the close game nature, back and forth, I mean, we have five seniors, including
Josh, experience‑wise he's a senior, too.  
Just the resiliency, stick‑to‑itiveness. We executed what we wanted to do on
defense and the rest took care of itself.  
  
Q. Josh, you have gone to overtime a bunch of times this season. When you go
to overtime, how much confidence was there still that you could get that back
and finish the right way?  
JOSH ADAMS: A lot of confidence. Just like Larry said, that's a credit to the
upperclassmen and the experience we have. We have been in overtime quite a
bit, against New Mexico, one game at Fresno probably sums up half of our
overtimes with three.  
We have that experience. It's really just another five minutes. It really
comes down to who wanted it more.  
  
Q. You took on a big challenge with the scoring, but defended Marks a lot in
this game. Talk about that challenge.  
JOSH ADAMS: First of all, Marks is a heck of a player, a heck of a program. It
takes its toll when you try to stop him. You look at his numbers, 17, a pretty
decent game. It was definitely a challenge for me and this team. It's very
difficult to guard Marks one‑on‑one. So it's a credit to the help side.  
Got beat a couple times. My teammates had my back, so...  
  
Q. Larry, they scored 38 in the first half. After that, pretty stellar
defensively. What changed there?  
LARRY NANCE, JR.: I mean, we went into halftime, after Josh made one of his
many outstanding runs in the game, down two. The momentum was swinging. We
could feel it swinging. I think they were, what, seven for 13 from three in
the first half. That's what needed to change and it did. That was the major
change in the game.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll dismiss the student‑athletes at this time. Thank you.  
We'll continue with questions for coach.  
  
Q. The focus is always defensive with this team. What had to change
defensively in the second half?  
COACH SHYATT: Too many threes. Too many open threes the first half. The game
was probably being played too fast. We get a little greedy. We want to run the
ball when we can get it in Josh's hand and get it down the floor. We don't
want the other team to.  
Unfortunately it was going back and forth probably quicker than we really
want. The tempo slowed down a little bit the second half. It may have been
getting a little boring for some, but that's more to our liking against a team
like Boise. They're just too poised on offense.  
  
Q. How good was Josh tonight?  
COACH SHYATT: I've said this before, and the only guy that ever comes to mind
is Joakim Noah. He's the one guy we had to rein in, like, Slow down.  
I think it was his leadership today as much as anything else listening to him
in the huddle, on the floor and at halftime. That's where he has had a great
growth. He really knows how to inspire the players in a positive way.  
  
Q. You had a good first half, but it seems like there was some frustration
there. Did anything change for him in the second half that you noticed?  
COACH SHYATT: No. Larry and Al have battled, as you well know, mono. It's a
pretty tough virus. I'm so proud that they didn't do what a lot of big‑time
athletes do do and say, I don't want to play until I'm 100%.  
Those guys came out two weeks ago, three weeks ago. They weren't a shadow of
what they once were. You know what, they're both coming back now, but I don't
think they're 100%.  
  
Q. Two really emotional games. Now you're going into one more. How do you
feel the guys are going to be physically going into tomorrow?  
COACH SHYATT: I think they're going to have a little bounce in their step.
This is an opportunity that they want to seize. Neither came easy. They
trailed. They had to come back. Their connectiveness is something that still
excites me.  
We'll give it our best shot. I have no question that at 3:00 tomorrow they'll
have pretty good try and they'll have pretty good focus.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.  
COACH SHYATT: Thank you.

_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

Boise State  80  
Air Force - 68

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Air Force.  
Coach, some thoughts on today's game.  
COACH PILIPOVICH: What a really good Boise State team. We knew coming in how
talented they are and how well they shoot the basketball. They didn't
disappoint. They shot the ball really well.  
So proud of our guys. Our effort. We struggled at times early, but fought
through, finished the half down four. Identical score we had yesterday. Talked
about coming out the second half, limiting our turnovers because that bothered
us early in the game.  
Then they got a great start to the beginning of the half. That kind of
separated us and kept their distance. We were able to manufacture some
momentum, some runs. We cut it to I believe six, 62‑68 if I'm correct, then
couldn't get any deeper than that.  
So proud of our guys. Our seniors have been along my whole time here as the
head coach. They've meant so much to me and this program. They've taken us to
another level. Now it's these guys that carry the torch on from that.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Nine of the ten teams here are going to leave with a loss. To leave with
a loss like this, does that at least lessen that blow for a competitor?  
ZACH KOCUR: We came into the game thinking we were going to win. We fought. I
think just the fact that we fought till the end, I don't think it matters what
team we were playing, we were just going to fight till the end.  
They had a great game. So give credit to them. We just came up a little short.
I'm proud we fought till the end.  
HAYDEN GRAHAM: I feel the same way as Zach. I wouldn't want to choose a loss.
But, I mean, Boise State's a really good team. They got high‑quality players.
They execute really well.  
I mean, I just hope they go all the way. If they're going to knock us out, I
hope they finish the thing right.  
  
Q. Is it frustrating with Nick Duncan where he keeps getting open?  
ZACH KOCUR: We knew coming in that he was a good shooter. He did the same
thing to us at home in the game. I mean, we knew we had to get out and contest
him. I mean, give credit to him. He made difficult shots.  
I think maybe we just thought we were up on him, and he was still knocking
them down. We needed to get up on him a little bit more. But give credit to
him.  
HAYDEN GRAHAM: Boise State's a really complete team. We had to focus on
everybody. Most teams you don't have to really do that. You can kind of
isolate your defense and figure out the two people you really want to stop,
let the other people on the team beat you.  
Boise State you can't focus on one person because somebody else will kill you.
You can't focus on Marks because Duncan is going to get open, or Webb. It's
hard to balance it, honestly. He found his looks and he took 'em.  
  
Q. Is it possible for young guys like yourselves to realize what you have
leading now into next year, there's so many young pieces coming back, or is
that something you don't think about?  
HAYDEN GRAHAM: Absolutely. We realize how much potential we have as a team
'cause we're young. This year wasn't supposed to really happen like this. We
had a senior‑oriented team coming into the year. Due to injuries, whatever
else, we've had guys step up, step into roles, new roles that they didn't
think they were going to experience this year.  
It just set us up, it allowed everybody to become more mature. There's not
going to be a shock next year when we go into SanDiego State or whatever else,
a hostile environment. There's no excuses.  
  
Q. Hayden, how much was this tournament important to establish new things in
your game?  
HAYDEN GRAHAM: I mean, this year was kind of frustrating for me because
usually I rely on my three‑point shot, and it was not here this year, for
whatever reason it was. I had to find other ways to help this team out, just
become more aggressive, attack the basket, get more rebounds. I mean, it just
helped me grow as a player.  
Maybe it was meant to be. Maybe next year when my three ball comes back, I'll
be a more dimensional player.  
  
Q. What was said in the locker room afterwards?  
ZACH KOCUR: I mean, we wouldn't have wanted to play with any other group of
seniors. They definitely laid the foundation for us, really led us throughout
the year, which is going to help us in the next couple years.  
It really was really sad. A couple of them were dealing with injuries
throughout the year. Obviously Kam and Ethan, they couldn't play the rest of
the season. They had season‑ending injuries, sad, unfortunate for our team.  
Yeah, Hayden definitely stepped up, picking up the rebounds for Kam. I think
it was great that we could get some experience with the younger guys. But they
really led us.  
  
Q. Did you realize coming in the way Boise defends the three that your
points were going to have to come at the hoop or different places?  
ZACH KOCUR: I'm going to shoot it if I'm open. I think I got 1‑3 today. I
definitely was thinking about driving a little bit more, getting them with the
shot fake.  
But, yeah, I don't really plan on it. However they play me, that's how I'll
react.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, men.  
We'll continue with questions for Coach Pilipovich.  
  
Q. Did you feel like this game epitomized the whole season for you guys?  
COACH PILIPOVICH: I think it shows the fight in our team. Really proud of
them, how they kept coming back, coming back, coming back. Again, Boise State
is a very talented team. We knew we'd be challenged by them. Nick Duncan has
done that to many people in the league. He can really shoot the basketball.  
Derrick Marks, he's a second‑half guy. We talked about that. Isolated him
early in the second half, but he was able to get us down low, take advantage
of his size or strength.  
But our guys kept fighting, fighting. When we cut the lead back late in the
game, you know, we had nothing to lose. Just keep play, keep play, keep play.
As we kept saying to keep push play, we'll get after them.  
So proud of them. As you mentioned, our younger guys, the second half of the
season, they've been our focal point and been our leading scorers, our leaders
of this team. As Hayden said, we came in with a senior group, expecting these
guys to play some support roles off the bench. Come January, they were our
major players. They grew so much. Trevor Lyons, Zach Kocur, Matt Mooney, just
to name a few. So excited about what we got.  
Really, it's going to be hard not to go to practice and not have those guys.
Those six have been so much, a good group.  
  
Q. That spurt at the start of the second half, do you wish you called
timeout sooner?  
COACH PILIPOVICH: Weather the storm, call a timeout, get a stop... You can
look at it different ways.  
We knew they would attack. We made some adjustments. We just didn't execute
the way we talked about doing it. That was in large part to them. They're a
veteran team and very good. They took advantage of that.  
We got through it. We got through it. With us being down six, I think we hit a
layup at the rim and missed. Another possession we missed a layup.  
What if we make that layup and cut it to four? Things start to tighten up
maybe a little bit differently. But we battled. Really, our guys grew so much.
That game yesterday winning was so important for this program, for us to move
forward, get to this point now. Now we got to take another step.  
This senior group has been around us that we've beaten three top‑25 teams, got
to post‑season play, won a game here in Vegas. So we're growing. We like where
we're trending right now.  
  
Q. Did you sense with Marks out for so long in that first half that was your
chance?  
COACH PILIPOVICH: Yeah, because you knew he was lurking around the fence. He's
that dog that's barking, he's going to come out there. I have so much respect
for him. He's talented. I said before the game, they were warming up down at
our end, I said, I was hoping I wouldn't see you again. But here we go.  
He's a really good player. He's going to play somewhere. He's going to
continue to play. Then you throw in a Webb and a Duncan and Igor runs the
team. They're really good.  
I was wondering, when they were 0‑3, they lose Drmic, I think Coach Rice has
done an unbelievable job of regrouping that team, putting them at the
forefront of the Mountain West. I wouldn't want to play them in the NCAA
tournament, I'll tell you that.  
  
Q. It's a balancing act as a coach. You come in with Marks, one of the best
scorers in the country, you're doing a great job on him. There's another guy
draining threes from everywhere. When do you shift your defensive focus?  
COACH PILIPOVICH: We talked about that. We talked about our preparation, as
Hayden mentioned, we said Derrick can score in different ways. He can drive
it, shoot it, get to the free‑throw line. Duncan, you can't help off anybody,
because they kick it in, he can shoot it. James Webb can stretch and make
threes, but then he can offensive rebound. Rob Heyer plays so hard and strong
when he comes in. Then Igor is a left‑handed driver and can get to the rim.
Where do you pick your poison?  
Yesterday and maybe some other games we were able to maybe isolate some
things. That's why Boise is so good, because you can't make mistakes. You
can't because they can score in a variety of ways and they're really good at
what they do.  
  
Q. Is there almost a sigh of relief now?  
COACH PILIPOVICH: You know, it will take a while. You're sad it's over. I'm
not sad it's over. I'm happy it happened because I had a chance to be with
this group.  
At the end of the year when you have some teams that go through adversity,
they either pack it in, count the days, cross the calendar off. Our guys
worked every day. Even 8:15 this morning in the banquet room of the hotel.
They brought it. They love being with each other. I'm going to miss this
group. But excited about the ones coming back.  
  
Q. Curious to the mindset at halftime. Were you encouraged by the score or
were you thinking Marks is going to get going here?  
COACH PILIPOVICH: Both. First of all, encouraged by the score because the
numbers were a bit in our favor, because it was 32‑28, a low‑scoring game.
That was good for us.  
Also we talked first and foremost, Derrick, we've seen it so many times where
he's gotten 18, 20 points in the second half. He can score in a hurry.  
So excited about where we were at. We didn't play extremely well, but we were
able to manage the game.  
It was important our first four or five minutes would dictate probably the
outcome of the game. It did, in their favor.  
We had it. We knew what to do. They were just a little bit better in doing it
than we did.  
  
Q. Coach Rice said Marks' performance was that of a conference Player of the
Year.  
COACH PILIPOVICH: Guys do that. He's the Player of the Year. He took the team
on his shoulders to start the second half, gave them the opportunity to have
that cushion to finish the game.  
He's so, so good. He's going to have two more good games out here, I guarantee
you that.

_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

San Diego State  67  
UNLV - 64

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by San Diego State.  
Coach, some thoughts on today's game.  
COACH FISHER: It was somewhat reminiscent of our game here eight days ago, our
game in SanDiego. Two teams that desperately wanted to win, that played as
hard as they could, and we found a way to win.  
I think that's a tribute to not only the three here, but the 10 others in the
locker room. You have to believe that you're going to find a way, and then you
have to produce.  
So we were able to do that. We're proud that we're going to be staying an
extra night and playing a game against a really good team tomorrow.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Winston, in the second half you missed those two free throws, then went
to the bench. Not a great moment. At the end of the game you came up with huge
offensive glass, the icing on the cake shot. Talk about the flow of emotions
through your game today.  
WINSTON SHEPARD: First and foremost I have to thank Coach Fish for putting me
back in. Shot two for nine, seven for 12 from the free throws. It wasn't my
best night.  
I pride myself coming through in the clutch. That's all that matters. I made
some plays, as JJ and AQ did. We live to fight another day, so I'll be okay.  
  
Q. What do you think it is about this team that just is able to grind out
games at the end?  
JJ O'BRIEN: It definitely starts with the coaching staff, the toughness that
they bring to us. You know, they're guys that don't shake under pressure, as
well. So that trickles down to us.  
We're able to keep our cool under pressure, we're able to keep our cool in
tight games.  
It's just about making winning plays. It starts in practice, putting us in
situations where we got to make those plays. It translates to the games.  
It's a lot about toughness, starts with the coaches and trickles down to us
guys.  
  
Q. At halftime what was the feeling like? What do you credit your early run
in the second half to?  
AQEEL QUINN: Halftime it was, like, we came into the locker room a little
down. Coach Fish came in and he said, We need to pick it up second half.  
When we came out, we huddled up together as a unit, all 12, and we just said,
We got to pick it up. This is not Aztec basketball.  
So we wanted to lock up on defense, be more aggressive on our shadow, our
pressure. We were able to knock down shots, which helped a lot.  
I mean, when you knock down shots, your confidence goes up, everybody's fired
up on the bench and everybody out there on the floor. Everybody came together.
It was a whole team effort. It was fun to see tonight.  
  
Q. You mentioned the defense. How effective would you say the full court
pressure was on UNLV? How satisfying was that and how effective would you say
it was overall tonight?  
JJ O'BRIEN: The press was very effective. If it doesn't get a steal, it takes
time off the clock. It makes them work to bring the ball up the floor, which
changes their energy. So even the times we didn't get steals, it does
something for us.  
We did give up a couple layups in the first half, I think one in the second
half. As you could see, we got turnovers, we got the 10‑second call. We get a
lot of energy from our press when we can turn people, we can get steals and
turnovers. It was huge for us tonight.  
  
Q. There were a few stretches where it was you guys and UNLV trading baskets
back and forth. For the most part it was a run here and there. What is it like
to be playing in a game like that?  
AQEEL QUINN: It's a wave of emotions. At one moment you're up, and the next
you're kind of biting your fingernails.  
It's very fun. It's competitive. I know every guy in that locker room loves
those type of games. I know I do personally.  
It just shows the character of all the guys in the locker room, our coaching
staff who puts that mindset on us. So I just love when it's a game like that.  
When we prevail, it's even better.  
  
Q. Winston, could you take us through a little more detail on the tip.  
WINSTON SHEPARD: We pride ourself on X'ing. I shouldn't say it, everybody will
start game planning for it. If I'm not mistaken, I think JJ got across the
lane and got a hand on it. I was able to get one. I got it back up. I missed
it. I think somebody else got a hand on it again and I was fortunate I was
just in the right spot at the right time. I was able to make a play.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll dismiss the student‑athletes at this time. Thank you.  
We'll continue with questions for Coach Fisher.  
  
Q. Chris Woodruff had a solid game, but only three shots taken from beyond
the arc. Was that the game plan to force him on the inside or was it him not
taking as many shots inside?  
COACH FISHER: That was their game plan. That was their game plan.  
He's good. We've done a pretty good job the first two games of limiting his
shot attempts, somewhat limiting touches. But they moved him into different
spots tonight to make him harder to guard, and he proved to be hard to guard.  
We had our hands full with him, keeping him from getting to the rim, following
his own missed shot to tip it in. He was a load for them today.  
  
Q. Talk about the value of your depth. How much does that mean to San Diego
State?  
COACH FISHER: It's a huge positive for us and unfortunately for UNLV they
don't have the numbers, so we knew that. So our thought process, we're not a
team that likes to run, run, run, run, but we wanted to turn it into more than
just a halfcourt game. It was pretty much a halfcourt game.  
We wanted to put heat on them full court whenever we scored, run whenever we
created a miss to try to wear them down because we said we're going to play
all our guys. We have had this number who played consistently, and not just
play but perform, produce, be productive for us. We got that again today.  
So you utilize the weapons, the positive things you have. One of those for us
is a lot of guys, nine, ten guys that all believe they're going to play, and
when they get in, believe they're going to play well.  
  
Q. About the toughness of the team, how much emphasis do you place on
recruitment a player's personality? Do you place more importance on that than
other schools? How important is a kid's makeup when you go to recruit him?  
COACH FISHER: Well, I don't think we prioritize that more than any other good
program. You recruit talented athletes who are quality people, and you do that
by getting to know them and evaluating.  
When new kids come in, we have four freshman in the program this year, they
wait and see and look what is it truly going to be like. They watch the lead
of our fifth‑year seniors on how they prepare for practice, how they treat
people on road trips, how they get in that weight room and lift.  
So I think we're fortunate that we've had it a number of years now where the
old guys kind of make sure the young guys do it our way.  
But we're not the Lone Ranger on that. There are many, many, many programs
that do what we do. We like our kids. We're proud of the program that we've
all been a part of. We want to continue to grow it.  
  
Q. If it wasn't 50/50 with the Aztec fans out there, it sounded like it.
What do you have to say to the fans?  
COACH FISHER: We have the greatest fans imaginable. Anybody that has been in
Viejas, to see that home crowd, it's electric. We had a 29‑home win streak
that was recently snapped. The fans contribute to that a great deal. And they
travel.  
Everybody likes to come to Vegas. But our fans are here, and they're not going
to miss a game. We are growing that number also. So they bring a lot to the
table. We appreciate it. They know that. We need them.  
  
Q. It's not my intent to get you in trouble with this question, but
something I view as a fan when I watched this game, I wonder if UNLV, the
players, maybe don't believe they can beat you guys with six straight wins for
you guys, and three times this season they were leading at halftime but you
came back to beat them. Has the winning at San Diego State gotten to a point
where the opponents have a tough time and wonder if they can get a win?  
COACH FISHER: No, I don't think so. They got a whole new cast of players.
They've got as talented a group of young players, and I'll underline 'young',
that there is in the country.  
I told Dave, I said, I'm glad that I'm not going to be around too much longer
to have to go against these kids because they've become men. They're good.
They're much better now than when we played them the first time in our
building, minus arguably their best player in Vaughn.  
Sometimes it happens. It goes in spurts and cycles. Sometimes that cycle seems
like it's never going to end. I hope it doesn't for us for a while. But they
have a group that they know they're going to win. We felt that the whole game.  
That's why we've had the kinds of games we've had with them. If they didn't
believe they could win, when we get that 12‑0 run, we would have run away with
it. They bowed their back and came right back at us.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much, coach.  
COACH FISHER: Thank you.

_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

Boise State  80  
Air Force - 68

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Boise State.  
Coach, just some thoughts on today's game.  
COACH RICE: Well, we knew this was going to be a tough contest. I thought Air
Force played great yesterday. They shot the ball so well. Their offense is so
hard to guard. They present so many different problems. Dave does such a good
job with them.  
We knew it was going to be a tough go of it. We knew also they played good
yesterday, they were clicking. They came out that way in the first half
against us. We got in a little foul trouble, weathered the storm. I thought we
had a great second half, though.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Nick, what is it about Air Force that kind of brings out the best in
you?  
NICK DUNCAN: I think it's more about me on the day. Definitely against Air
Force, I like to shoot against them, our offense suits playing against Air
Force as well. I think it's good. It's my teammates, as well, finding me when
I'm open. So credit to my teammates for finding me.  
  
Q. Defensively you came out and forced seven turnovers in the first six or
seven minutes. How important was that to set that tone?  
NICK DUNCAN: You know, it's always good. The offense is really, really hard to
guard. With all the slip action on their screens, it's hard. It's always good
to come out strong.  
I think we need to improve on our defense there for the next game. We lacked
off there in the first half and the second half. We need to tighten up our
defense for the next game.  
  
Q. Air Force kept creeping in. Was there a point where you wondered what you
had to do to shake them loose?  
NICK DUNCAN: A little bit. I'm pretty confident on my teammates on the
defensive and offensive end. We always have confidence. We just have to play
40 minutes of basketball, and that's it.  
  
Q. Nick, we've seen this from you before, where you hit one or two, get
rolling in the second half. What is it about your confidence when you start to
make a couple?  
NICK DUNCAN: Yeah, I think the first one or two shots, if they go in,
especially the second half, I go on a roll. It's a good feeling, they're going
through the hoop. Hopefully get another shot and do the same thing.  
  
Q. Derrick, how frustrating was it with the fouls, then to be able to score
13 big ones in the second half?  
DERRICK MARKS: I mean, it happens. I wasn't frustrated. That's why it's two
halves of basketball. I can't worry about the first half no more. The second
half I just came ready to play and we got the win.  
  
Q. Nick, what is this experience like for you compared to last year?  
NICK DUNCAN: It's different. Last year got a few minutes here and there. It's
more pressure on me, but I love that pressure. I love the teammates giving me
confidence going out there this year. It's great to get a win.  
  
Q. Derrick, you've been known to have big second halves. After you have a
first half like that, in the back of your mind do you know that a good second
half is coming?  
DERRICK MARKS: I mean, I don't come into the half saying I'm going to have a
big‑scoring second half; I'm going to do what I got to do, even if I don't
score again. It doesn't matter to me. I want to win.  
  
Q. Nick, you didn't have Derrick in there, but you were able to get the lead
and keep it in the first half. What is it about this team?  
NICK DUNCAN: I think since we started winning games, we've proven we can play
with anyone on the court at any given time.  
Also with Derrick, how he's been playing this year, even if he's in foul
trouble we can continue on and play the game. Obviously, when he comes back in
and scores 13 points at the end of the game that we need, that's great as
well.  
Great to have a player like Derrick and a team that we can play without
Derrick at the same time.  
  
Q. What is it like when Nick starts hitting the threes and gets into a
rhythm like that?  
DERRICK MARKS: I mean, when he makes, you know, like four in the first half,
it's like we all looking for him because we know the next one going up. Even
if he miss it, we still going to look for it. We all understand that he's hot
right now.  
We just keep looking for him without forcing it.  
  
Q. Derrick, how much have you seen Nick grow in the last year in the role
he's now playing on this offense?  
DERRICK MARKS: I mean, he was the same smart player last year. He just, you
know, is making more shots this year (smiling).  
  
Q. Derrick, what is the feeling like when he hits those three ‑pointers and
gets about as excited as anybody? What does that do for you guys?  
DERRICK MARKS: I mean, it makes all of us excited, too. That's the one thing
about this team, no matter who's doing the scoring, whether it's from the best
player to, you know, the player that doesn't get all the media attention, like
we're all happy for each other no matter what.  
We'll dismiss the student‑athletes at this time. Thank you, men.  
We'll continue with questions for Coach Rice.  
  
Q. Was there a number, if the deficit had shrunk to a certain you would have
brought Derrick back in in the first half?  
COACH RICE: As long as we had the lead I was going to stay with him off. Dave
Southern was so kind to point out, he's a second‑half guy. He's being humble.
I know he plays a lot better in the second, so I want to make sure I didn't
lose the game in the first half by letting him pick up his third foul. Could
have changed the game.  
Our guys were playing pretty good. So, you know, I just kind of went with it.  
  
Q. Air Force's resiliency, you've seen them a lot.  
COACH RICE: You get to the conference tournament, everybody's playing good,
especially the teams that win, they played great yesterday. I was like, Oh
boy, here we go. Their kids play so hard. They run one of the hardest systems
to guard in the country. That's a tough task.  
I thought our guys did a great job with it.  
  
Q. How big was Nick in the second half with those threes? What is it like
for you when he gets on a roll like that and makes three or four in a row?  
COACH RICE: Well, yeah, you expect those to go in the way Nick can shoot the
ball, what I've seen from him, the consistency to shoot the ball.  
But a couple of them were so deep, I turned to my assistants, Does he have to
shoot that?  
He's made like six in a row, it's probably a heat check.  
Our guys do a great job. I thought Chandler made an awesome play when he drove
baseline, looked like he was going to kick it out to the top, no‑looked to
Nick and got him another one.  
Our guys teed it up for him pretty good today. When they do that, Nick is a
good enough shooter, he makes them.  
  
Q. Derrick said he wasn't frustrated. Coming back in the second half with
13. What do you see in his mindset when he is forced to sit on the bench? Did
you see him get frustrated at all?  
COACH RICE: No, no, no. Maybe the younger Derrick would have. This one, the
Mountain West Player of the Year, he gets it. He knows what's going on.  
The silver lining of our foul trouble was I was able to play him 25 minutes,
now we move on. You know and I know I don't take him out very often in these
close games. That's what's ahead of us. Maybe there's a benefit to him not
playing heavy minutes tonight.  
  
Q. Can you tell us how you found Nick in Australia?  
COACH RICE: Well, I've got a great staff that does an unbelievable job
recruiting. We've got two other Aussies on our team. Aussies attract Aussies.
I have one on my coaching staff, too. Nick isn't even the best shooting Aussie
we have. The one on my coaching staff is the best shooter, without question
(smiling).  
So, yeah, like I said, my staff does an unbelievable job.  
  
Q. When Derrick was out, the rest of the team was able to carry it, keep the
lead. What are your thoughts on them being able to do it?  
COACH RICE: Yeah, we looked good, too. A lot of it's the feel. If things
wouldn't have felt good and right, I probably would have went back with
Derrick.  
Again, Air Force can isolate you. They can put foul pressure on you in weird
ways that are unique. So I just felt like he was better off sitting next to me
for a while. If we kept it close and had him a little bit at arm's length, get
to the second half.  
When you got Derrick out there with not having to tiptoe around with foul
trouble, he's a lot more effective.  
  
Q. If I told you Derrick wouldn't have taken a shot in the first half, what
would you have thought?  
COACH RICE: That would have been a little concerning, no question. That's
Derrick, though. That second half was terrific. I mean, 13 points. All of his
assists came in the second half. Five assists, one turnover. That was a
Mountain West Player of the Year second half.  
That's what we said to him at halftime, too, You get to go show them now.  
  
Q. When you look at the two teams, say something about each of them that
would concern you?  
COACH RICE: We played Wyoming so long ago, that's an interesting matchup. That
was two and a half months ago. It seems longer than that.  
Both these teams are hard, hard matchups because of unique styles. With
Wyoming, you know, their style, then Utah State, Stew's system. Neither one of
them are easy to prepare for. Like I said, they got unique systems that are
difficult to prepare for in such a short turnaround.  
  
Q. The runs you had to start the second half, then close it out when they
got within five, how big were those?  
COACH RICE: That was huge. I think they cut it to six or something, or eight.
We kind of had them where they were creeping back in. I thought Iggy's shot in
the middle of the key, that was a big one. It wasn't the nail in the coffin,
but it gave us enough breathing room that we're going to be okay.  
  
Q. Looking back quickly at the regular season, you had so many close calls
against SanDiego State, what has it meant to you that you broke through this
year against them? What were some of the keys to finally getting those wins?  
COACH RICE: Well, Coach Fisher and I talk about it all the time. When those
two teams get together, it's epic. I mean, it's been amazing games. I think we
only won one going into this year.  
Just every single one of them was not down to the last minute but almost down
to the last possession on every one by one maybe, maybe two.  
They're such a great program. They have one of the best home courts in the
country, not just in the league, in the country. If you haven't experienced
that or seen it, it's an amazing thing.  
For us to go in there this year, be trailing at halftime where they'd won
4,700,000 games in a row, you know, the stats are astounding when you look at
all those stats that you always hear, their winning streaks. For our guys to
go in there and have enough moxy to come out with the win, it was an
impressive one.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much, coach.  
COACH RICE: Thank you.

_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

San Diego State  67  
UNLV - 64

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by UNLV.  
Coach, some thoughts on tonight's game.  
COACH RICE: First of all, tremendous respect for Coach Fisher and his program.
Congratulations to them. They play extremely hard. We wish them the best
moving forward.  
I'm extremely proud of our two seniors, the rest of our team. I thought we
battled from the start of the game to the end of the game. One thing about our
group, had a lot of close games this year, we never quit. That was one of our
main goals coming into this season.  
Got a locker room full of guys that are disappointed, that can't wait to get
back to practice and compete. They love to play. They're growing. They're
getting better. We've made tremendous progress. We're very disappointed with
the outcome. We came into this with a lot of confidence. We just came up a
little bit short.  
Again, all the best to San Diego State. Couldn't be prouder of our group for
how hard we played and how we stayed together through a season that we grew up
and continue to get better.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Talk about the full court pressure you had to face throughout the entire
game. Did you feel like you were a little bit fatigued late in the second
half?  
CODY DOOLIN: Well, you know, I think they do a really good job in their full
court pressure, obviously. It's really tough to break. I think we did a really
good job for the most part taking care of the ball.  
Where I think it's a little underrated in its effectiveness is how much time
it takes off the shot clock. By the time you set up into your set, there's 20
seconds to go on the shot clock, feels like you're always playing against the
shot clock as opposed to other teams. They've done that in all three games.
They're really good at it.  
  
Q. When you sit here and reflect on the season, all the close losses you've
had, is there a sense of frustration that you should have had a much better
season than what you had?  
CODY DOOLIN: I think whenever you lose, there's a sense of frustration. I was
really happy for us. We had plenty of chances this season to just fold up and
go home, and we didn't. We battled till the end.  
Obviously the season didn't, you know, quite go as we may have wanted. I was
really proud of us for how hard we played. Obviously they're a good team. Give
a lot of credit to them. They've won a lot of conference championships for a
reason.  
  
Q. After they had that big run to start the second half, you had the and
‑one play that got you going, a couple drives towards the end. Once they came
out and took the lead again, what was the mentality of the team?  
CODY DOOLIN: Well, I thought we did a good job. We had a chance there. They go
on a whatever and 0 run they had. We battled back add tied up the game. Just a
few plays got us. A little bit of their experience along with their depth may
have hurt us.  
They shot the ball well tonight. When they shoot the ball they're going to be
tough to beat for anybody on any night. A lot of credit to them. They played
well offensively.  
  
Q. Jelan, you have improved over the course of the season. Last month you
seem to have found yourself on this team. Talk about the disappointment for
you coming here and finishing up this way.  
JELAN KENDRICK: No one likes to lose. It's very disappointing. But we're going
to keep our heads high and continue to prepare for whatever comes next.  
I'm excited to see where this young team will continue to go. Glad I can be
part of their lives, inspire them, set a way of how to do things, with Cody.
We're going to continue to try to finish out this year strong.  
  
Q. The second half, that's been a bugaboo the whole season long. Talk about
that.  
CODY DOOLIN: Yeah, you know, I thought lately maybe we've been doing a better
job of it. But they're a good team. They're going to make runs on you.  
Yeah, they came out, we missed some free throws, I air balled a three‑pointer.
They took advantage of that and ran off some points, I think two threes in a
row, a couple offensive rebounds and a put‑back.  
Like I said, you got to give credit to them. They're well‑disciplined on the
defensive end. They shot the ball really well tonight. They played well enough
to win and we didn't. All the credit to them, like I said.  
JELAN KENDRICK: No comment.  
  
Q. JK, do you want to play in some type of post ‑season tournament?  
JELAN KENDRICK: I definitely want to. It's my last year. I think we got a
group of guys who love to play the game. Even if we weren't playing in the
post‑season, I feel like we'll be playing pickup come Sunday. That's the type
of guys we have. They love the game, love to be around the game, love to play
the game. When you're around a group of guys like that who always want to
play, you never want to stop playing with them.  
All props to the coaches who kind of embraced us, especially over time, took
this young group and groomed us and helped us mature over the games and stuff.  
So I'm excited whatever comes next.  
  
Q. Coming out of the second half you went 0 ‑5 shooting. The four missed
free throws hurt you. Talk about the uphill battle when it seemed like you
couldn't make a shot.   
CODY DOOLIN: Yeah, I think you said it. It did hurt a little bit. They can
really squeeze you defensively sometimes. You can go four, five, six
possessions sometimes without scoring on them. They just do a really good job
in ball screen defense and guarding the ball and post defense and we call it
monster, but doubling the post.  
They did a great job. That's their bread and butter on the defensive end. They
hit some shots in that stretch, but what they really did is squeezed us
defensively. It took us five or seven minutes to really get in a rhythm
offensively that we had in the first half.  
  
Q. For you to be around with all these young guys, how important have you
been to them to help them for the future?  
CODY DOOLIN: I think, you know, me and Jelan both have tried to instill a
culture of sharing the basketball and playing on the defensive end and playing
tough. Our young players are fantastic. Obviously everyone watched tonight.
They can block shots and shoot and run the court. Like Jelan said, I think we
are excited to be a part of something that we think's going to be a big deal,
a big‑time program down the road.  
I'm just glad I was able to come here and play with Jelan and have a chance to
be a part of something special in the future. We had a lot of close games this
year. A lot of freshmen were thrown in the fire. They gained a lot of
experience, invaluable experience, that a lot of players won't necessarily get
for two or three years down the road.  
I think next year, it's really going to show. I think guys like Pat and Jordan
and Chris and Goodluck and Dwayne, they're really going to play well next
year. They don't play like young players now and they certainly won't next
year, I think.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll dismiss the student‑athletes at this time. Thank you.  
We'll continue with questions for Coach Rice.  
  
Q. Every game is different, but it's now in your Mountain West games, first
five minutes of second half a minus 50. Have you seen any kind of trend where
teams do something different? At one point you were 18 ‑2 in the lane paint.
Did they go away from something? What happens after halftime?  
COACH RICE: Those are probably two questions.  
It's certainly something that we have struggled with, starting second halves.
That's why yesterday afternoon we started pressing. I didn't think pressing
San Diego State was the answer to start the second half.  
It's a situation where to start the second half we were able to pound it
inside, got the free throw a couple times and were not fortunate enough to
make those free throws, and San Diego State was able to get out and make some
easy baskets. Something that's frustrating for our guys because we have led at
the half a number of times.  
We just didn't come out and get a shot to go in. I thought they got some
baskets because of our inability to make a shot or a free throw to start the
second half.  
  
Q. You led at halftime the last 16 games of the year, led at Kansas, Arizona
State. Does this feel like a season that got away?  
COACH RICE: I don't look at it that way. I look at it as a group that made
tremendous progress as the season went on, as a group that grew into something
that was much better at the end of the season than it was at the start of the
season.  
At the same time, sure, we're disappointed with a lot of those outcomes, no
doubt about it. It will be something we'll continue to look at, evaluate and
try to figure out.  
  
Q. What are your thoughts on playing some type of post ‑season tournament?  
COACH RICE: I told the guys afterwards it's a group that we want to keep
coaching. We got guys in our program that love to play. I think every year is
unique. I think when you have a number of new players to the program, there's
a value in getting them post‑season experience.  
We're going to actually meet tomorrow at noon as a group and all of our guys
as of now are committed to wanting to continue to play. You heard what JK
said. Some years when you have all seniors, it might be a situation where
maybe it's not the best thing.  
When you have as many young guys as we have, it's not an excuse for losing
games, when you have guys that have an opportunity to get post‑season
experience, I think there's value in more practices and more games. We'll
figure that out.  
Our guys love to play and they all seem very excited to continue to play. I
think they like each other. This is a group that has great team chemistry.
They want to keep practicing and playing.  
  
Q. When you look at how many close games you lost this year, where you are
right now, how would you sum up the season in a paragraph if you had to?  
COACH RICE: It's really soon to try to make that kind of a judgment. I feel
really good about the progress our guys made. Obviously we're disappointed we
didn't get it done tonight. I think as we look back, we'll see individually
guys made great strides. As a team we got better. I think it's something we
can absolutely build on moving forward and going into the off‑season.  
I think every single guy in our program that comes back next year will be able
to use the experiences this year as motivation in the summer, in the weight
room, the track, the gym, to help us be much better next year.  
I'm appreciative of Cody and JK for what they provided to our young guys. I've
said many times they helped lay a solid foundation for our group.  
  
Q. Did you have any concern tonight these three games dating to last year?
Talent ‑wise you're ahead of them, that it was above the shoulders playing
these guys? Were you concerned it came down to confidence and when it got
tight late?   
COACH RICE: I think the bottom line is we're disappointed that we came up on
the short end in the three games against San Diego State because we were in
all those games and they made a few more plays, to their credit.  
Again, it's frustrating because we wanted to win this one very badly and we
came up a play short. We've got to evaluate that and certainly figure that
out.  
  
Q. Three second halves this year against San Diego State, minus 27 against
them. Was that more so San Diego State adjusting or is it just missed shots?  
COACH RICE: I think going back, thinking about your question, I don't want to
minimize San Diego State's talent level either. Certainly they're tough and
talented, so I want to give them credit for that, as well.  
Obviously we didn't play as well in the second halves against San Diego State
as we would have liked to. We didn't execute as well as we would have liked
to. I think we made tremendous progress as the season went on and we have
something to absolutely build on.  
  
Q. At the end of the year last year in the off ‑season you had some
discussions with Khem Birch and Roscoe Smith. Do you expect that this year
with a couple players? What do you expect in that process?  
COACH RICE: We'll have conversations with all of our guys and get all the
information that we can get from the NBA, help those guys make the best
decision for them.  
We'll be doing that over the course of the next several weeks. I think the
deadline is April the 26th, if I'm not incorrect. It's not something we've
spent of time talking about right now.  
Obviously every program has opportunities for guys to make decisions, and
we're excited about the guys that will be coming back. Right now it's too
early to say who those guys will be.  
I just think we have a great foundation for the future. I made the decision
last spring to put this group together. We had a lot of guys who were able to
play significant minutes during the course of the season. I'm proud of the
progress they made. I think the future's extremely bright. I think everyone
that is objective about that sees that.  
But it's too early. They've still got quite a bit of time before they have to
make that decision.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much, coach.

_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

Colorado State  71  
Fresno State - 59

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Fresno State.  
Coach, some thoughts on tonight's game.  
COACH TERRY: I'd like to give Colorado State a lot of credit tonight. His team
played the way they played all year long. They played as a team. They really
competed at a whole 'nother level. I like to think of those guys are one of
the better effort teams in the country. They competed on both ends of the
floor. They have a physical mindset in terms of rebounding the basketball.
They made shots tonight. They made plays. We give them a lot of credit.
They've had a great year.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. You were down 18 at halftime but cut it to six points at one point in the
second half. What do you think that says about the team? What was your mindset
coming out of halftime?  
ALEX DAVIS: Coming out of halftime, our mantra was just to go out and play
hard. We had to come out, we had to come out fighting. We got ourselves down
in a hole early. We had some pretty good shots that we missed.  
We missed some pretty good shots that we normally make, got down in the hole.
Come out in the second half, play hard. There's no need to hold back now. I
think we did a pretty good job coming out in the second half, making our run,
showing Fresno State we a great team. We still got fight in us. I think we
just couldn't finish the plays we needed to finish in order to win this game.  
  
Q. Talking to you yesterday, I think you mentioned yesterday about making a
run to the championship game. Do you think you guys as a team believe that?  
ALEX DAVIS: Of course. We worked all season, all spring, last year. This is a
pretty good team. It's just the fact that I don't think we had the games where
we played great together. It's a really good team, a really athletic team.  
I really feel like we could make a run. I'm pretty sure Paul would agree with
me, we feel like we could win a championship, because we have that caliber of
team.  
We have a lot of guys coming back next year. I think they going to be a
really, really good team next year. They going to be a force to reckon with
next year.  
  
Q. When Avila went down, how did that change things? Did you think you had a
better shot?  
PAUL WATSON: You know, seeing Avila go down, you never want to see a good
player go down. It's always nice to play against a team when they're at their
best. You don't want to win a game when one of the key players on the other
team is down.  
At that point I feel Colorado State, they picked up the intensity down the
line. I mean, the bench, they came off, picked up for Avila. They played
harder. They played more intense.  
  
Q. Paul, what, if anything, do you think was missing from you guys
tonight?  
PAUL WATSON: Probably coming out from the jump. We didn't really come out with
the intensity we needed like we did in the second half on the defensive end.  
We missed, like Alex said, some key shots that we usually make. That hurt us
in the beginning.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll dismiss the student‑athletes at this time. Thank you.  
We'll continue with questions for Coach Terry.  
  
Q. What is Marvelle Harris' condition?  
COACH TERRY: I don't have a prognosis for him right now right off the bat.
There's going to be some further evaluation into the night where he is right
now.  
We've got him with really good people that will do a great job with him. But I
don't have an answer right now.  
  
Q. He did hit his head?  
COACH TERRY: He did.  
  
Q. Too soon to say if he had a concussion?  
COACH TERRY: I think, with the climate, you're going to take the precautionary
measures to have his best interests in mind in terms of what happened, the
consequences, the situation that arose there.  
It's hard to say what it is right now. We'll deal with it.  
  
Q. Looking at the final stats, pretty big discrepancy in fouls and free
throws. How, at all, do you think that affected the outcome of the game?  
COACH TERRY: Well, I think it's two teams that played with great effort. Those
guys played with really, really good effort. I think our team is a good effort
team. Any time you have teams that play with that kind of mindset, as much as
we pride ourselves with hard‑nosed defense, they pride themselves with how
they play. You're going to have a large number of fouls throughout the course
of the game. It's going to be a physical game.  
Playing a team like Colorado State, you have to exceed their effort. The games
we lost to them, they won the effort battles. They did again tonight.  
  
Q. When they're sitting here talking about not coming out from the jump,
that being pretty much the same thing that haunted you against them back in
Fresno a month ago, how frustrating is that?  
COACH TERRY: Well, I think the frustrating thing would be, you know, we missed
some shots that we, I mean, point‑blank, we work on really finishing. We
finish those, it's a whole different game.  
You know, when you miss shots like that, point‑blank, it kind of deflates you
a little bit defensively, now you're back on your heels a little bit.  
But we regrouped, had the game still right where we wanted it. We had a
six‑minute stretch in the half where things got away. Give them credit, they
made some shots. I give my guys a lot of credit.  
We came out after halftime and said, Hey, we're going to have to put it on our
defense, we're not worried about our offense right now. We're going to guard
as hard as we can guard on every single possession, we'll be right where we
need to be in this ballgame. We cut it to a two‑possession game.  
Give them credit again, they made another big play.  
  
Q. After Avila went out, they were hitting all those threes, you were in
zone. Was that something you changed when he went out?  
COACH TERRY: They're a really good offensive team, a difficult team to guard
with their motion offense. We played 80 minutes prior to tonight of man‑to‑man
defense against them. They're extremely hard to guard. I don't think we played
one possession of zone against them.  
Any time you play a team twice, you have to find a competitive edge, how can
we disrupt what they were able to do the two previous games.  
I thought the game plan that the coaches and our staff had defensively to
start the game was a good game plan for us. We were in a good position.  
On makes we were back in zone, on misses we were man‑to‑man, just to throw
them out of their rhythm a little bit. We probably won five or six possessions
straight in zone before they started making shots. Anytime a team gets
comfortable in zone, we have to go back to man. We went back and played our
traditional man‑to‑man defense.  
  
Q. How would you rate your team's play in transition, especially the second
half?  
COACH TERRY: Much better than the first half. We actually got some really good
stops and then we turned the ball over. We didn't play advantage basketball
early in the ballgame and in the first half particularly well.  
Second half we were much better. We had better spacing. Guys were in attack
mode, looking to finish. We were more efficient in the second half than the
first half.  
  
Q. Guys missed a lot of shots in the end of the game. What was the reason
for that?  
COACH TERRY: I think this group did learn to work the game for 40 minutes,
working it, working it, working it, keep playing till the horn goes off.  
We did, we missed some shots obviously that didn't go down for us, and they
made some. You have to tip your hat to them in that regard.  
Marvelle Harris, a guy we've leaned on all year long, didn't have the kind of
night we needed him to have. When that happens, other guys have to step up. We
didn't get that contribution all the way around.  
  
Q. Marvelle Harris, to me after he missed a couple early, he was a little
hesitant to take some shots after that. Was that one of the biggest
differences in the game?  
COACH TERRY: He played probably the most minutes in this league of any player.
He's done so many positive things for us over the course of this season. Even
tonight when he didn't have his A game going in terms of making shots, he was
still a positive leader with our guys. Somebody else has to step up and do
this. We're still doing this defensively.  
He did let him take himself completely out of the game. I always say to guys,
How else are you going to affect the game? I thought he stayed into the game,
in tune to what was going on even though he didn't have his best defensive
game.  
  
Q. From your perspective, facing a team for the third time where the other
two outcomes both went the same way, how difficult is it for another team to
beat a team three times in one season?  
COACH TERRY: That's arguably the toughest matchup you could have in this
tournament, to be honest with you. I'm not taking anything away from any other
team that's still playing right now. That's a physical mindset team, an older
team there that can really score the basketball and rebound the basketball and
they can guard.  
You have any of those combinations, that's an NCAA tournament team. They have
been all year long. It's a hard matchup for us all year. For us to take the
next step in our program to compete with those guys, we're going to have more
of a physical mindset likewise. We have some talent on our team, but the next
step for us is to take the next step, and that's what they've been able to do.  
  
Q. You've had ups and downs this season, what is your perspective on the
season as a whole?  
COACH TERRY: I was proud of the way our guys came out and kept competing. We
didn't get off particularly well the start of the season with the way we
wanted to for a number of different reasons. I said to our guys in the locker
room a second ago I was proud of the way they carried themselves. It was easy
for a team going through what we went through early in the year to completely
go the other way. End up with seven, six wins on the year. We took that and
built on that, got better. We really became a team over the last three weeks.  
To win 10 games in this league, this is a really good league top to bottom,
and it will be from here on out. Mountain West Conference is one of the best
leagues in the country. For us to come back and have the perseverance to get
ten wins in this league and compete at the level we compete in, with the start
we got off to, I can't fault our effort. I thought our guys really hung
together.  
Can we be better as a team next year as a team? Absolutely. If we buy into
that and do that over the off‑season, we'll be as good as anybody in our
league next year.  
That's the continued growth curve with our program and what we are.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much, coach.

_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

Wyoming  67  
Utah State - 65

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Utah State.  
Coach, some thoughts on today's game.  
COACH MORRILL: It was a good college basketball game. I think the difference
was about a stretch in the second half of about four or five possessions where
they got just too good of shots. They got layup opportunities driving the
basketball. We couldn't get them stopped during that stretch.  
We also were struggling a little bit scoring at the other end. But our defense
tightened up. We got back in the ballgame. All the credit in the world to
Wyoming. They've got an experienced, veteran team. I think they're playing
real well right now.  
Tough loss for us. Tough way to end the season.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Jalen, talk about fighting back. You clawed back in a lot of games.
Almost did it today.  
JALEN MOORE: Yeah, for a little bit, like coach said, we were down by seven
points or so. We had to try to come back. We kind of almost dug ourselves out
of that hole but we couldn't quite get there.  
We were just giving them layups and on the other end they were stopping us. I
think that was the biggest turning point of the game.  
We just dug ourselves in too big of a hole to overcome this time and we
couldn't get out of it.  
  
Q. When they missed the last two free throws, a couple seconds left, you've
hit some game ‑winners in high school.   
JALEN MOORE: I just got the rebound, tried to take a couple dribbles to get a
better look. I let go. It was on target. Just too far. That's a low‑percentage
shot kind of thing. Once‑in‑a‑lifetime kind of thing. It just didn't fall this
time.  
  
Q. David, stayed out of foul trouble for a large portion of tonight.  
DAVID COLLETTE: Obviously that's been a big thing, trying to keep me on the
court. I did my best to play as smart as I could this game. Did pretty good in
the second half, only got one foul, so...  
  
Q. Can both of you address playing for Coach Morrill. I know a lot of you
want to send him out the right way. I'm sure that's been emotional for you
guys.  
JALEN MOORE: Yeah, it's been great playing for one of the best coaches in
college basketball, kind of a legend kind of things. I learned a lot about
basketball, playing hard, defense, offense. He's always coaching for
perfection, have energy, that kind of thing. I like that in a coach.  
He pushes you, makes you get better every game kind of thing. I like that.  
We tried to send him out how we did. We came out, played as hard as we could.
Tried to get a win for him, that kind of thing. Just have to keep moving
forward from here on. A lot of guys got to play for a once‑in‑a‑lifetime
coach. I think they all liked doing that.  
DAVID COLLETTE: I would agree with everything Jalen said. It's an opportunity
that not many get to play for such a great coach. I think we've tried to lobby
to get him back another year, but it's not going to happen.  
He's led us in the right direction. He's given us all the tools we need to
move forward and become better.  
We're going to miss him. But we're going to take what he's taught us and move
forward and become better.  
  
Q. You did a great job shutting down Josh Adams. What was it about him the
last two games that allowed him to get going?  
DAVID COLLETTE: I think the first time he didn't look to push as hard as he
did the last couple games. He was super aggressive these last couple games.
Last time we played him at their place, we didn't have much help on him
driving in. That's what we tried to do this time. We certainly stopped him
more than last time, but not enough as we would have liked to.  
JALEN MOORE: At our place, he wasn't as aggressive. He didn't look for his
shot as much. Then we play him here and at Wyoming, he's way aggressive. They
ran a lot of plays for him. He made some tough shots, that kind of thing. Make
some tough shots, gets you going.  
That's what I would say, was more aggressive, looked for his shot a little bit
more.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, men.  
We'll continue with questions for Coach Morrill.  
  
Q. What kind of is going through your mind as you sit here right now? Are
you hopeful for some post ‑season opportunity?  
COACH MORRILL: Well, what's going through your mind is that it's kind of weird
to be done. I'm really proud of this team. This team was picked 10th. This
team, if some of you had seen us during our exhibition games, it was all we
could do to manage a win over D‑II teams.  
This group of kids got better. They're young. They got a really bright future.
I really believe that. We're starting a couple freshmen and a sophomore,
brand‑new players. All five starters are back.  
I think the new coach will inherit a good group that will just keep getting
better. That's what we emphasize from day one, keep getting better. That's
what I told them in the locker room: Be proud of what you accomplished, don't
hang your head, you did more than most thought you could do. Keep trying to
get better.  
Our season is over at this point. We had hoped to come in here and get to the
championship game obviously, try to win the tournament like every team comes
in here. We felt like if we got to the finals we might be a candidate in the
NIT. The NCAA and the NIT are basically out.  
At this point we just feel like it's best for these kids to concentrate on
their academics. We've missed a ton of school. And get ready for a new coach,
rather than play in any other events, like the CIT and the CBI. We will not be
pursuing those. So our season is over.  
I do think it's in their best interest to get back on track academically. It's
in the best interest of the university to hire a coach. We won't look at those
events.  
  
Q. You have coached your last game?  
COACH MORRILL: I have, yeah.  
My son asked me if I would help coach his eight‑year‑old daughter. I said I'd
go to the game and cheer for her like hell, but I am not calling a timeout,
not even an eight‑year‑old game.  
  
Q. Not everyone goes to a small college town like Logan and find something
there that keeps them so long.  
COACH MORRILL: I grew up in Utah. I love Utah. My mom was there when I came
back 17 years ago and needed us to be around. That was a big part of it.  
It's a great place. Coaching, too many people are looking for the next job. I
always thought you ought to keep the one you have if you can, because they're
hard to keep. As you guys know, they're hard to keep.  
I just liked it there. There were opportunities, but nothing that made me feel
like I wanted to leave.  
It's been a great run. People have treated me so well. I've joked that if I
would have known people were going to be this nice to me, I would have retired
three or four years ago. How about the coaches sending me on a cruise?  
I must have been pretty easy to beat. That's pretty awesome for the other
coaches to send me on a cruise. First class, no less. They must know how much
I hate to sit like this with this big body. That will be fun. Looking forward
to new things and new challenges, mostly relaxing for a little while.

_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

Colorado State  71  
Fresno State - 59

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Colorado State.  
Coach, just some thoughts on tonight's game.  
COACH EUSTACHY: Well, it was record‑breaking. Our 27th win. No team at
Colorado State has ever done that. And how we did it I think was most
impressive.  
We have as much respect for Fresno State as any team in the league. They play
hard. They compete. They're really well‑coached.  
They beat Boise State and they beat San Diego State, and that says enough.
It's a blow when you don't expect somebody like one of these three, happened
to be J.J. this time, go down. The character, it has been these two and J.J.
all year long. I've just been along for the ride. They've shown great
character and unbelievable coachability.  
It's one of my top experiences as a coach, tonight was, in a long career. I'm
very proud of these guys.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. What was going through your head when you saw J.J. go down at that
point?  
DANIEL BEJARANO: We were all down, of course. I was concerned. I got up off
the bench, just tried to see what was wrong, see if I could do anything to
help.  
But it's just like all year, J.J. was suspended for a game. Gian was out, Tiel
was out. We recognize when someone goes down, especially our main player,
other guys have to step up. That's exactly what we did.  
We didn't want to let him down, as well as our other teammates, so...  
STANTON KIDD: It was shocking basically to see it happen. I had an ankle
sprain before. I know how painful it is. He wanted to play so bad. Coach told
him, We can win this game, we just need you to chill out on the bench, get
healthy for the next game. We took care of business. We did that for him and
ourselves.  
  
Q. After J.J. went down, you went on a tear. Was that something they did
different defensively or...  
DANIEL BEJARANO: I think every time we play them, I think we have done that,
to be honest. Like coach said, we really respect them.  
It's hard to beat a team twice, alone three times. They beat every team in our
league but us. They're just falling in, thank God. We got too trigger happy in
the second half. But we just found a way to win.  
  
Q. You shot eight of 13 from three ‑point range in the first half. What was
it like to get the lead in the first half coming into the second?  
DANIEL BEJARANO: It was good. We were just trying to focus on our defense. We
were up big. Obviously a key to that game was getting that stop, Gian Clavell
got that stop at the end, which was terrific. It was good.  
Going into the second half, we were down by that much, so we took care of
business second half.  
  
Q. Stanton, what can you say about the job you did defensively against
Marvelle Harris?  
STANTON KIDD: We had to go out there, play it the right way, like how we know.
Because we played him twice already. We know he's a right‑handed guard. You
want to get to his right hand, get to step back jump shot and get to the
basket. So we forced him a little left, put him out of his comfort zone. You
could slow him down a little bit.  
He's a great player. First team all‑league guy. We did a great job on him
tonight from myself to Gian to Daniel and other guys that guarded him.  
  
Q. Do you think this kind of erases any doubt at all about the NCAA
tournament?  
STANTON KIDD: We ain't looking towards that. If it's out there, if it happens,
it's out there, we know. We were on the bubble. We had to win this game to get
in. We have a big game tomorrow against San Diego State. We're just going to
go out there and play basketball and beat those guys.  
  
Q. Daniel, do you just have to prepare now like J.J. is not going to play
tomorrow?  
DANIEL BEJARANO: We're going to prepare both ways. That's just the biggest
thing. Obviously we have the best coaching staff in the country, so we're
going to prepare and come up with a plan.  
We split with San Diego State, now we're on a neutral court. They took care of
business on their court, we took care of business on our court, so now we're
on a neutral court.  
We're going to prepare for J.J. playing and not playing. Right now we feel he
is going to play.  
  
Q. Stanton, as the competition gets tougher in these tournaments, is it a
blow mentally to think you might not have J.J. in a game like you're playing
tomorrow?  
STANTON KIDD: Yeah, not thinking about it like that. Tough guy in the locker
room. Done a lot for us this year. Work just as hard as anybody I have known,
Daniel, other guys on the team, myself.  
He's going to do everything in his power to play tomorrow. If he don't, it's a
blow, but we adjust. We go to the lineup that coach have for us and I think we
be perfectly fine.  
  
Q. Daniel, can you win this tournament if J.J. doesn't play again?  
DANIEL BEJARANO: If we believe. Obviously he's our guy. We got the win at Utah
State. That's past. Going into the tournament, we think we should have won the
Mountain West. Obviously we didn't. We just take that to heart. We just want
to win the whole thing. Obviously we do.  
If we believe and have heart, we will.  
  
Q. Daniel, coach mentioned the program record, 27 wins. What does that mean
to you?  
DANIEL BEJARANO: I think it's terrific. Like I said all year long, all the
wars and milestones, that's all good. All I care about is wins and my
teammates.  
I'm just trying to lead this team the best way I can. I've been put in
different situations all year, all my career. So I'm just trying to lead.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll dismiss the student‑athletes at this time. Thank you.  
We'll continue with questions for coach.  
  
Q. Sounds like on the postgame radio show you said J.J. is not going to play
tomorrow. That is the case?  
COACH EUSTACHY: I just listened to these guys and they make all the decisions,
so whatever they want to do I'll go along with (smiling).  
No, I'm really in the dark with what it is. I just knew that he wanted to try
it in the second half, and I didn't want him to because I didn't want to risk
any permanent injury.  
We'll get an update afterwards. If it's just a matter of tolerating pain, then
he'll play. If it's a matter of it could get worse, he won't play. It's pretty
simple.  
  
Q. Does two years ago with Dorian's ankle in this tournament and how he came
back give you peace of mind moving forward?  
COACH EUSTACHY: I never thought of that. You never know how a team's going to
react until it happens. It was a blow to me when he went down. It's your worst
nightmare.  
Supposedly you're on the bubble. You need to win this game to go to the
tournament. Your leading scorer, et cetera, et cetera, first team all‑league
guy goes down.  
I'm just totally, not shocked, not amazed, but this team just continues to
prove that they have another level and they're able to win the game.  
I don't know if I'm answering your question or not. But he's every bit if not
more valuable than Dorian was to this team. But we'll figure out a way.  
  
Q. They started the second half and cut it down to six. Immediately after
that I think you scored eight in a row to pull back away. How important was it
to respond as quickly as you did?  
COACH EUSTACHY: Fresno State's a good team. They're really a good team. I've
always praised coach. I thought he's one of the bright young coaches in the
country. They play hard. They play physical. They don't play dirty. They just
play hard and physical within the rules.  
So, I mean, for us to withstand them coming to us within six and finding ways
to extend it where they had to make four threes at the end to tie it even was
amazing.  
Obviously when we're doing what we do, coach, pick out things we're doing
wrong, run certain things, but I was just kind of taking it in, watching some
of the greater plays. I mean, blocked shots. Looking at what Stanton really
figured out what he does have in the tank. We saw how high he jumped late.  
They took it to another level. I've always told them the body can take a lot,
it's just how far you want to push it. They went to a level that I've never
seen before because that is not a stiff team that we just beat. They start
over again, they'd be a post‑season tournament team. They were just a victim
of their schedule early.  
  
Q. How difficult is it to beat a team three times in one season?  
COACH EUSTACHY: I've been asked that a lot. Bob Huggins said a long time ago,
I've always kind of clung to, beat them twice, it's hard to beat somebody
three times. He said, If you lose to them twice, does that make it easier? He
goes, I think if you can beat them twice, something like that, then you got a
great chance to beat them three times, which makes sense to me. Pretty
logical.  
Our guys always show up. I've never had a team like this, including the
third‑ranked team in the country at the end, when it was all said and done, be
ready to play every game that this team has done. They amaze me. They're
always ready to go.  
So you think the question is, we beat them twice, we got this made. They're
not built that way. They're not built that way. They really get themselves
ready to play mentally better than any group I've ever had.  
  
Q. When J.J. went down, you went small ball. What was the strategy on
that?  
COACH EUSTACHY: We didn't have any tall guys (smiling).  
When you look at it, we matched up well to them because they're not exactly
big. They're not like playing San Diego State where we'll have to depend on
J.J. Marcus was a thought.  
You know, I really thought that we were going to struggle to defend them, we
were going to have to out‑score them. So I put the scorers in there. The
logical thing would have been to put Marcus, the length, in there and match
up. They have to go to the other end and guard us. That's what happened, we
out‑scored them.  
  
Q. What does it mean when you see a guy like J.J. go down, but he's right
there on the sideline cheering them on, coaching them alongside you?  
COACH EUSTACHY: Well, it really depicts, says it all. He was bawling talking
to the team. I didn't say a word at halftime. A couple words. But I had him
talk to the team and coach them. I said, Then I want you on the bench. You can
sit next to me or where you feel comfortable, but I want you coaching this
game.  
So he's put a lot of time and effort into getting to this moment, and to have
it taken away, you know, he struggled at first, then he really took control of
himself and told the team exactly what they needed to do.  
Like I say, it's one of those priceless moments. Yet you never know till
you're put in it. Unfortunately, it was an adverse situation, but that's when
you find out most about guys and his teammates.  
I guess in a long answer, it was pretty cool. It was one of the better moments
that I've seen as a coach.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much, coach.  
COACH EUSTACHY: Thanks.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

### [Josh Adams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24971)

### [Charles Hankerson,
Jr.](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28549)

### [Larry Nance, Jr.](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24938)

### [Larry Shyatt](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23390)

  
_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

Wyoming  67  
Utah State - 65

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Wyoming.  
Coach, just some thoughts on today's game.  
COACH SHYATT: I thought we had it in the bag the whole game. Just kidding
(smiling).  
I love these guys. At times I didn't think we played particularly well
tonight, at times all season. But I have never been around a team I've enjoyed
being around more on and off the court. Resilience comes to mind, down seven
or eight. They just keep playing.  
I thought our defense towards the tail end of the game, maybe holding them to
four baskets in the last eight or nine minutes, was probably the difference.  
I wish Stew the best. Utah State, you don't know what you have till you don't
have it any more. We're losing a great one, a great coach and a great man.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll now take questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Back and forth game with all the lead changes. What was the difference?  
LARRY NANCE, JR.: I believe it was our defense. I mean, obviously you're going
to hear that over and over again, but that's our principle. Defense, defense,
defense.  
It doesn't help to have Josh and Junior slashing the way they were tonight. It
does help, sorry.  
  
Q. Junior, offensively it's been up and down. What was working tonight?  
CHARLES HANKERSON, JR.: To be honest, it was just my teammates continuing to
believe in me, putting me in great positions. This is definitely the best that
my back has felt in a couple weeks. That definitely helps.  
But mainly my teammates just putting me in the right positions for me to be
successful.  
  
Q. Junior, having some up ‑and‑down moments, what did it feel like to be
able to contribute today?  
CHARLES HANKERSON, JR.: Man, well, this is my first Mountain West tournament.
It's an incredible atmosphere. The Wyoming fans really came out in full force
tonight. We just wanted to make them proud. We're fighting for our careers
now. Every game is crucial. That's our mindset.  
  
Q. Josh, you've had success against Utah State the last couple games, being
that aggressive player you've been. What was working well?  
JOSH ADAMS: Just the same thing that Chuck just said. My teammates finding me
in the right positions, you know, having Larry down there drawing attention,
having Jun. slashing, too. Having to respect a lot of players on the court.
That opens up a lot of court space for me. Once I drive they have to focus on
that.  
It's just a team camaraderie thing. Everybody's playing well, so things open
up. You just exploit it.  
  
Q. Larry, essentially two wins away from the NCAA tournament. How do you
stay focused? Would you consider anything short of reaching that tournament a
success?  
LARRY NANCE, JR.: I just think you said it, we're two games away from reaching
the NCAA tournament. If that's not enough to keep these guys focused, I don't
know what is.  
For five guys on this team, this is our last go‑around.  
To answer that last question, I would hate to put a cap on it right now. But I
do believe this team can do it.  
  
Q. Josh, this game seemed to be so intense. What did it feel like to be in a
game like that, that much intensity on the floor?  
JOSH ADAMS: It's a great feeling, you know, to be competing against the best
guys out there. This conference is stacked. Every team is solid. As Coach
Shyatt said before, Coach Morrill is an outstanding coach. It's an honor to
play against him. He knows how to coach his team. He knows how to counter
plays. So does Coach Shy.  
It's an honor just to be out there in the fight with your teammates against
another team where they're all in it as well. That competitive edge is what
the sport is all about. It's just an honor to be out there.  
  
Q. Josh, what do you think of the nickname Dunk Town, how much you enjoy
adding to that reputation wherever you go?  
JOSH ADAMS: We love it. We love it out there. We do have a lot of athletic
guys. That's a direct correlation to the coaching staff, how they've
recruited. They've not only recruited great athletes, players, but great
people. We fully embrace that nickname and our fans have. You can see our fan
support out there tonight was outstanding.  
Again, it's just an honor to be a part of this program, a part of this league,
the Mountain West.  
  
Q. Which of the three of you, who on the team likes dunking the most?  
LARRY NANCE, JR.: I say D.C. It's like the rim did something to him. He's
angry every single time he dunks.  
  
Q. You agree, Josh?  
JOSH ADAMS: I'm going to have to agree with that (smiling).  
  
Q. Junior, coming through it on the other side. When you were in the middle
of struggles this season, were there times when you lost faith? If so, what
did you do to get out of that?  
CHARLES HANKERSON, JR.: Coach Shy is always saying get out of yourself, get
into the team. That was my whole focus. My personal stats and stuff, I mean,
it's kind of irrelevant to me.  
My stats are 23 wins. You know what I mean? That's the only thing that matters
to me, surviving and advancing. I just try to stay in the moment and continue
to do my best.  
  
Q. Larry, you're a powerful guy. How are you able to counteract when they're
trying to draw offensive fouls on you?  
LARRY NANCE, JR.: That's credit to, like they said before, Coach Morrill is a
terrific coach. If he could coach them to do that, they obviously knew our
game plan. That was my go‑to.  
Those plays were just kind of bonehead plays that I've got to remove to win
these next two games.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll dismiss the student‑athletes at this time. Thank you,
men.  
We'll continue with questions for Coach Shyatt.  
  
Q. What do you think Junior added to you guys in this game, not just with
the scoring but his energy and his performance?  
COACH SHYATT: Against the better teams on our schedule, we need five or six
guys. We need Derek Cooke to get 10 rebounds, we need Junior to score some
points. We've been pretty steady on defense, doggone near every game. It's
been the times when we didn't have everybody contributing in different ways on
offense.  
  
Q. You think the experience of this group that's been through so much, that
played a factor, especially down the stretch?  
COACH SHYATT: I don't think there's any question. This team has been through
adversity like never before in my 40 years. When I say 'this team,' these
guys. Three years ago we had a great season going. We lost two players in
February. Two years ago, we had an even better season going, we lost Larry to
an ACL in February.  
This year we had even a better season going after we swept CSU at 19 and 4. We
got hit on the tail end with not one by two viruses, mono. They kept going.
They never made excuses. They just kept playing as hard as they could, not
pretty, but as hard as they could.  
I think there's a reservoir there that some teams have been around they just
don't have.  
  
Q. You talk about keeping going. With Junior, obviously he was struggling at
points. What is his character and attitude been like to be able to keep
pushing?  
COACH SHYATT: Junior's paying his own way this year. That says a lot in
itself. He has a level of appreciation a lot of athletes will never have.  
But I think it's his teammates that supported him more during this year and
just made sure that they knew, Look, it's coming, we need you, just put the
pressure on your defense and forget about your O right now. I think tonight it
came to play and thank goodness it did. We needed him and D.C.  
  
Q. Utah State did a great job of shutting down Josh. What have you seen from
him in the last two games against the Aggies, especially today?  
COACH SHYATT: When the virus hit us, we lost our only two 4 men, Herndon and
Nance, we were a physical team from a physical and numbers standpoint. I think
at that point we talked about racing it up the floor a little more often,
shooting it quicker. That's more to Josh's liking anyways ‑ not that he's
going to listen to me.  
I think it carried over when these guys came back, got a little healthier.
They're probably not 100%, but they're looking a lot better now than they did
two weeks ago.  
Those four or five games when we weren't healthy helped Josh immensely.  
  
Q. I know it's a quick turnaround. You have the top seed tomorrow. What are
your thoughts on Boise? Are they a different team from the one you beat
earlier in conference play?  
COACH SHYATT: They most certainly have a different mindset. They're the
champions. They've had a great season. I would say more than anything that's
impressed me when I've had a chance to watch them on tape is they have really
collected themselves defensively. I think they're the best defensive team in
this league. If they're not the best, they're one of the best for certain.  
  
Q. Your thoughts on the nickname Dunk Town?  
COACH SHYATT: I've enjoyed being aside from that, just enjoyed watching our
guys play. It's a pretty good percentage shot. I sort of like to see D.C.'s
elbows above the rim when they can drop it off to him. There's something to be
said for our unselfishness. A lot of our dunks this year have come on
extremely unselfish plays.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much.  
COACH SHYATT: Thank you.

_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

Air Force  68  
New Mexico - 61

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by New Mexico.  
Coach, some thoughts on today's game.  
COACH NEAL: I thought Air Force did a good job in the second half. I thought
they made crucial shots when they needed to make them. Anytime you play a team
like they are, you have 18 turnovers against a zone the whole game, you're not
going to win, and you're not going to be able to win if you shoot 59% from the
foul line.  
All in all I thought our guys gave great effort. I thought we had chances to
win. I think there were six possessions in the second half when we let them
score with under six in the shot clock. If you do that, you're not going to
finish the game.  
I thought our kids gave great effort. Just sad that Hugh doesn't get to
continue on, being the only player in the Mountain West history to have 9‑0 as
a player. Now he's 9‑1\.  
This tournament and our season won't define his legacy in our program. I
appreciate everything he's done for us. Same with Deshawn. It's sad Deshawn
didn't get to play. He missed Senior Night, then misses his senior Mountain
West tournament.  
Other than that you've got to give Air Force credit. They made plays when they
needed to make them, and we didn't. My hats off to them.  
I think this is the third, fourth time we lost in the first round. Not a lot
of fun. We'll just try to keep improving. Now we got to start getting ready
for next year.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll now take questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Hugh, walked off the court for the first time in this tournament without
a win. I'm curious your thoughts as you were walking off.  
HUGH GREENWOOD: Just walking off, I wasn't really thinking about the loss. I
was more thinking about thanking the fans for an incredible four years.
Unfortunately this season didn't go the way we wanted it to.  
But at the end of the day our fans have always been supportive, they've been
supportive of me and my family. I wanted to thank them. That was my moment to
thank them one last time. Last time with a Lobo jersey on. It's been an honor
and a privilege. What makes it is the fans, they're supporters through thick
and thin. I know they'll be back next year.  
  
Q. Specific to this game, they obviously had a game plan where they wanted
you to attempt a lot of three ‑pointers. You did 25 of them. Sam, were they
taking away your drive? Hugh, did you feel they were forcing your game to be
played on the outside?   
SAM LOGWOOD: Well, personally I felt like they gave us open shots, so coach
told us to shoot open shots. We shot open shots. That's what they gave us. We
just didn't make 'em. That's unfortunate.  
HUGH GREENWOOD: Yeah, I thought we went inside early. But probably not as much
as we should have. We missed some layups inside. Then started collapsing a
little bit more.  
Like Sam said, we had open shots. We had an open shot, wide open shot in the
corner to put us down one. That's the difference in the game, is making shots.
The foul line was the biggest thing. If you shoot less than 60% from the foul
line in a 7‑point game it makes a difference. That's something guys have got
to acknowledge moving on to next year, they've got to be able to make shots.  
  
Q. Sam, it's been one season for you, you came late in the summer. What is
the future for you in this program? What can you take away from Deshawn and
Hugh?  
SAM LOGWOOD: I've learned a lot this year from both of the seniors on and off
the court. They're both great players and great people. Just moving on, we
just got to continue to work hard, you know, and learn from our mistakes we
made this year.  
I believe the next couple years, we're going to have pretty good seasons.  
  
Q. Injuries piled up, especially with DD towards the end, losing him for the
last few games. How much did that affect your game plan, not having Deshawn?  
HUGH GREENWOOD: I don't necessarily think it was this game, it was the whole
season. When you lose Cullen, who's all‑conference the beginning of the year,
Jordan is coming in expecting to be newcomer of the year and he's battled
injuries all year, and then you lose DD, who was all‑conference as well.
Hasn't been just the last two games, it's been a progression over the season.
We last Sammy for three or four games.  
It is difficult. It is sports. Fortunately we were able to make that
adjustment against Wyoming and get a win. Tonight we just couldn't get it
done. Like I said, injuries happen in sports. Other guys have to step up.  
I thought Sammy stepped up and did some things well tonight. He's going to
have an incredible career moving forward.  
It's about who can stay healthy. We've been healthy the last three years.
We've had an incredible run with health. We have great trainers. Bob has been
great, Nate has been great over the years. When it gets to this point in the
year, you have to be fresh, have healthy bodies, and unfortunately we didn't
have that.  
SAM LOGWOOD: I feel the same way as Hugh does. We lost a lot of players, but
we can't really put it on that. Just something we got to look for to just keep
moving forward and getting better.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, men.  
We'll continue with questions for Coach Neal.  
  
Q. At the academy February 4th, it was a game that I know afterwards you
were a little frustrated that the team seemed to settle for the outside shot.
It seemed to be the exact same kind of scenario in the second half tonight.
Did you feel anything changed from what happened a month ago to what happened
tonight in terms of how you performed?  
COACH NEAL: I think we made more shots today. I think some guys made some
shots. But we've said all along that we were going to try to get guys open
shots, and I think we had open shots. I just didn't think we were able to
convert like they did. They made crucial shots when they needed to, and we
didn't.  
I think what happens also, when you throw the ball inside or you miss layups
or easy shots or turn the ball over, your guards tend to not want to throw it
in there as much. That has nothing to do with anybody on our team. That's
basketball. I've played it for a long time, been around it for a long time.  
We went inside early, weren't able to convert on some things we were going to
try to convert on. Anytime you turn the ball over 18 times, like I said,
against the zone, it's going to be a long, long night.  
  
Q. How big were those turnovers?  
COACH NEAL: Yeah, I just told them that our goal is to be under 12. I think if
we would have been under 12 tonight or somewhere close to it, 13, 14, we would
have had a chance to win. But those were crucial because they got easy shots.  
Their offense is hard to guard, that's why we played a lot of zone. It's not
fun to guard. When you zone them, besides the shots they make, they've never
been a really good transition team. When you turn the ball over, it gives them
chances to get easy points. I think that affected us.  
They're very capable when you turn the ball over or you try to go for
offensive rebounds, they're capable of getting out on you if you don't get
guys back.  
  
Q. The easy answer is to stay healthy. Looking back at this season, what
might you change from a coaching standpoint, what might you learn from this
season and change going forward?  
COACH NEAL: Well, I'll learn not to have nine new guys to start the season.  
I learned a lot. I learned a lot about myself. I learned a lot about my
program. Know where we have to go. At the end of the day I feel pretty good
about what our staff did, how hard we worked.  
I just think the ball didn't bounce our way. This isn't trying to be cocky or
arrogant, but there's not too many people in this tournament that have won
this tournament, and I have. You can go down the coaches in our league, see
who has won it, who wasn't. I'm one of those ones that has. My goal is to try
to come back and win it again.  
I'm not satisfied where we finished. But my kids gave great effort and I'm
really proud of them. We've established a winning culture there and hopefully
we'll get it back to that next year.  
  
Q. You said this season won't define Hugh's legacy. His record does speak
for itself. How do you as his coach define his legacy?  
COACH NEAL: That's hard. We've had a lot of great players, a lot of great
student‑athletes in eight years. But I don't think we've had anybody that has
touched our community and touched our campus or our program like him.  
Not just that he wasn't a guy that was the leading scorer, he wasn't the guy
that always wanted the ball, taking all the shots. He just was a guy. He was
all about team. It was never about me. That's what I hope our younger guys
learn: It's not about me, it's about team.  
What he did in our community, what he did for our university, I think it's
second to none. I have the utmost respect for him. We got a great
relationship. He's really helped Cullen because he was Cullen's roommate the
last two years.  
He did so many things in our community and our university that he'll be hard
to replace. I don't think there will be anybody like him.  
I think he's got a huge heart and he loves everything about Albuquerque, he
loves everything about the university, he loves everything about wearing that
Lobo jersey. That's going to be hard to replace, and I don't think you'll ever
do that.  
I think he's going to be one of those guys that will stand time because of
all‑around package, not the playing package, not the academic piece, not the
community relations piece. I just think all of it makes him unique. He's a
unique kid. He loves life. He wants to be around people. That's going to be
his legacy.  
  
Q. I thought pace was a big piece of the latter part of the second half.
There were eight possessions in a row where there were whistles that led to
turnovers. Did you sense frustration from your guys whistle after whistle
after whistle second half?  
COACH NEAL: I don't know about that. It was a weird whistle in the second
half. That's all I'll say about it. I thought it was a weird whistle.  
We're in a bonus 11 minutes, it was caught up in the next 45 seconds. It was
just a weird whistle. There wasn't a continuity to the game. There wasn't a
flow to the game. I think that took us a little bit out of things. But you
have to give them credit. They made shots and we weren't able to get over the
hump.  
When we were up five, I thought we'd have a really good shot. Then we came
down and gave them free throw, free throw on dead clocks. You can't do that.
You can't have six possessions when you're under 10 seconds and you let them
score.  
I told our guys, One thing we have to work on, one thing our teams have had in
the past, is mental discipline. Nine new guys, five new guys that played, I
don't think our mental discipline was as strong as it's been in years past.  
  
Q. Obviously when you have a season like this, there's a lot of criticism, a
lot of heat. Knowing what you have coming back next year, how much better will
this team be next year?  
COACH NEAL: Well, I don't know. I hope they'll be better. I think we got three
good freshmen coming in. I think I've got a couple guys that will learn. I
think they'll get into a roll.  
I thought Obij really improved. I thought late in the year he really improved.  
I know we're going to work to be good. We're going to do everything we can to
be good. That's what our program's about.  
I know as soon as we get back and we start spring workouts, it will get back
to where our program has been and we won't accept losing. We'll try to get
back to where we've been the last, you know, four or five years.  
I don't know what's going to happen because we have a couple guys that never
played in this league and I think this league is a lot better than everybody
thinks it is. Just because you've had success somewhere else doesn't mean it
carries over to what happens in this league.  
It's a great league. Great venues. Hard to win on the road. Great coaches,
great players. Our guys are going to have to really buckle down to get better.
But I'm looking forward to it. I'm disappointed in what happened today. Not
real happy about it. But I'm looking forward to the future.  
  
Q. Does a season like this give you more motivation to improve for next
season?  
COACH NEAL: Well, I think anytime as a coach you want to improve. I can't sit
up here and say that I saw this coming. I mean, if you would have told me
before the season that we'd have the injuries we'd have, the things that's
went on with our guys, then maybe, maybe.  
But you can't predict that. I think you don't know what would have happened if
we had everybody healthy. But I'm excited to get some guys healthy and excited
to get new guys in and try to help our other guys improve.  
One thing our program has done, a lot of you have watched us over the years,
we've really developed players. This year was a little bit harder because we
didn't have time to develop nine new guys or five new guys. There's no excuses
for our season, but we've done a good job developing, and we'll continue to
see if we can do that. I'm excited about that.  
  
Q. Hugh talked about putting the jersey on for the last time. If invited, is
this the end of the season or...  
COACH NEAL: I think we're just going to push the reset button (laughter).  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much, coach.

_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

Air Force  68  
New Mexico - 61

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Air Force.  
Coach, just some thoughts on today's game.  
COACH PILIPOVICH: Okay, wow. Well, first thing I'm going to start this with is
we may be in a little bit of trouble. When I woke up this morning, I had the
hotel bill underneath my door, so we may not have rooms tonight (laughter).
That was not a good sign when I saw that.  
But unbelievably proud of our cadet athletes. We haven't won here much in the
Mountain West Conference tournament. I think this is our third time ever.  
We talked about that. We talked about it from last year when we were here. We
beat a very good New Mexico team who has some players out, obviously. But
that's a team that's never lost here. Our hats go off to them.  
The first thing I'd like to say, too, is we're at the same hotel with their
fans. We came in yesterday and their band and cheerleaders and fans were
waiting for their team and we walked through it. Today when we walked through
to our bus, they were having a pep rally outside. Classiest, best fans around.
They treated our guys with respect, they applauded us as we walked through. So
thank you, Lobo fans, you guys are awesome.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. You started shooting two for 15 from the field. From there on out you
shot well over 60%. What changed?  
HAYDEN GRAHAM: I think it was a little bit of nerves at the beginning, just
coming out. It's a big scene. It's a conference tournament. We had to get
settled in. Coach kept emphasizing in timeouts and when we huddled up, just
settle down, breathe, get in the flow of the game, then shots are going to
come.  
ZACH KOCUR: We've had this experience before in the season, we haven't shot
well in some games. Each game coaches and all the players tell everybody to
keep shooting.  
We have confidence. I think that's the biggest thing, keep shooting.  
  
Q. Zach, you were 0 ‑4 in the first half. Could you sense the importance of
the first shot in the second half of what that means to the team?  
ZACH KOCUR: Yeah, I realized one of the reasons I'm out there is to shoot
threes (smiling).  
I think, yeah, we knew we didn't make any shots in the first half, barely any,
and we stuck around. We knew if we came out and started shooting decently
well, we would be there. They made some runs. We made some runs.  
  
Q. Hayden, one of the big keys was how you were able to defend inside with
the 7 ‑footer.   
HAYDEN GRAHAM: We had to keep a body on him. It was kind of tough because of
the game plan, the shooters go to the corner for New Mexico. We kept a body on
the big guys, get the inside positioning for rebounding, just make sure they
don't abuse us inside.  
  
Q. I've seen you here a number of times. It's been the same story. The other
team makes the run late. Today you guys had the late run.  
HAYDEN GRAHAM: It feels great. We've been saying all year, this is a different
team than last year. We're more mature, we're more confident. We believe in
ourselves.  
We didn't do too well on the road this year, but in neutral sites we were
1‑0\. We came in, Let's keep that going a little bit. We felt good about it.  
ZACH KOCUR: Yeah, we started that little stretch second half of the year where
we started winning down the stretch. We had a long stretch where we couldn't.
We hadn't won after we trailed at halftime.  
That carried over to today, us being able to believe, just make plays down the
stretch, not fold over.  
  
Q. I think you missed nine in a row after the three to open the game. Was
there a time where you felt, Here we go again in Vegas?  
HAYDEN GRAHAM: No, no. I don't think anybody on this team will forget the
feeling we had against Fresno State last year. We didn't want to go back to
that. We had to stay positive, stay confident. Every coach, every player was
emphasizing at timeouts, We're fine, this has happened before, believe, move
on, make the next play.  
ZACH KOCUR: To go off that, last year against Fresno we didn't hit free throws
down the stretch. That was a big part of the win. We were able to hit a lot of
free throws, the front end of one and ones. Even though we were 12 for 16, we
made big free throws that kept us ahead.  
  
Q. This is the second game where Trevor Lyons asserted himself offensively
for a stretch. How important is he to this team?  
HAYDEN GRAHAM: Trevor is huge for us. He's a young player. He brings so much
to the table. I'm glad we have him for the next two years after this. He's
just going to grow, only get better. He brings a lot of confidence and swagger
to his game.  
ZACH KOCUR: Not only offensively, but he's tremendous on defense, getting
steals and deflections. That helps us a lot when his shooting is not there
that game.  
  
Q. Specific to New Mexico, their offense has struggled this year. They lost
some guys that would have helped them offensively. Is the game plan against
New Mexico to make them shoot three ‑pointers? Is it true that Greenwood is
the three‑point shooter?   
HAYDEN GRAHAM: In a sense, I believe so. We wanted to make sure we closed out
on Greenwood because he's a great shooter. There were a couple others we had
to make sure we closed out on. But we didn't want them to just fly by. We
didn't want to get out of the defense and let them attack the basket. We were
trying to stay tight and locate the shooters we were talking about in our
scout.  
ZACH KOCUR: Greenwood is obviously a great shooter and great player. But our
main focus for the other guys was containing them 'cause when they got in the
lane and dished it out, that's when they got their open threes. If we could
contain them, that was our primary focus.  
  
Q. Thoughts on tomorrow's game against Boise State?  
HAYDEN GRAHAM: I'm excited. I'm very excited. We felt like the game at home,
we were right there. It was a great game, I think. When we went out to Boise,
I don't think we brought the same energy and effort as we should have or we
were capable of.  
This is just another opportunity to show people out here and everywhere what
kind of team we are.  
ZACH KOCUR: We know we can compete with them. We competed for the majority of
the game at home. We made some runs. I think if we just carry that over to the
game tomorrow, we all believe that we can do it. We just got to come out with
the same energy.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll dismiss the student‑athletes at this time. Thank you,
men.  
We'll continue with questions for coach.  
  
Q. In Albuquerque we stood outside the locker room, two weeks after you lost
Kam, the day after you lost Max for the start of that. You said you wanted to
improve in January and February and get to this point where you could peak in
March. Did you believe that at the time and do you feel that's the case?  
COACH PILIPOVICH: Yeah, I did. If you're around these guys every day, they
just bring it. I mean, they're awesome.  
We went through a stretch, as I told you, that SanDiego State game, we were on
the top. Kam Williams goes in for a dunk, makes it. A minute later he tears
his Achilles and is out. Then Max was out. They wouldn't allow us not to work,
not to come together.  
In 28 years of coaching, I've never been around a group closer than them.  
When checking the scoreboard, we were getting each day in practice, in games.
If we did those things, the scoreboard would take care of itself.  
We've grown here in February and early March. So proud of them.  
  
Q. What do you think was the key today?  
COACH PILIPOVICH: At halftime I think those guys said it right, I think we
were pressing a little bit early. Still, you're talking about a team that's
never lost here. Cut the nets down three times. We've been going home now for
three straight years. So there's a difference.  
Once we got to halftime and managed a four‑point deficit, it was manageable.
We talked about, Let's relax, be us. We don't need to be Superman. Shots are
going to fall because we're good shooters. We relaxed and settled in.  
  
Q. Second ‑chance points...   
COACH PILIPOVICH: That's always going to be a problem. Do you see any 6'11"
guys on our team (laughter)?  
  
Q. That didn't seem to impact the game all that much.  
COACH PILIPOVICH: You know, you can measure here, but you can't measure here.
We play with a lot of heart. We were aggressive. I think we got on the floor,
challenged things. We didn't want to go home. We wanted to survive, advance,
play another game.  
The seniors talked about that this morning at breakfast, Why can't we win a
game, a couple games, let's go. Their effort, attitude and leadership was
unbelievable.  
  
Q. At halftime you had five points from Mooney, Zach Moer and DeLovell. Do
you feel like they kept you around?  
COACH PILIPOVICH: They did. Zach Moer was really big on the glass. Matt Mooney
was aggressive, one turnover late in the game. He knows what to do the next
time. DeLovell is a leader, a senior. He does so many things for us. He and
Justin Hammonds, Max, Olesinski, those four, so happy for them, so happy for
them. They kept talking about, We're not losing every timeout as we went out.
We didn't. We didn't.  
  
Q. We heard the players talk about Boise State. What are your thoughts going
into tomorrow?  
COACH PILIPOVICH: Boise is so talented. They're well‑coached. Extremely good
perimeter players. Player of the Year, newcomer of the year, Coach of the
Year, bus driver of the year (smiling). They're really good. We're going to
look at our film, see about some things we did well against them. As Hayden
mentioned, we were pretty good against them with 3:20 left in the game, it was
a tie game. Did pretty good at the Taco Bell Arena. If we can get out to some
shooter and put some pressure on them, not give them open looks, I think we
can be in it to win it.  
  
Q. Do you feel the tenseness you felt early, is that gone now?  
COACH PILIPOVICH: Yeah. If you were in our locker room about 10 minutes ago, I
think it's gone now. I think we're okay now. I think we're okay.  
  
Q. Wherever you stay tonight, do you think you'll make sure the bill is slid
under your door?  
COACH PILIPOVICH: I said to my wife, Did you put that underneath there?  
We're going to be okay (laughter).  
  
Q. From an opposing coach standpoint, Hugh Greenwood started his career here
0 ‑9 here. What are your thoughts about him?  
COACH PILIPOVICH: I told him as we left the floor, I have so much respect for
him as a player, probably more as a person at what he's done. He's what you
talk about as a student‑athlete. He's unbelievable. I'm going to miss him. I'm
not just going to miss him when we play him.  
But he is awesome. Hugh Greenwood is awesome. We have so much respect for
their program. They've been at the top of the league. They've done it the
right way. Outstanding coaches, players. That's where we need to get to.  
I have a lot of respect for him. He's been great for this conference.  
  
Q. Specific to this game and the season for them, they were out a couple
players this year. Their offense was more limited this year than recent years.
From a game plan standpoint, are you hoping they make a living on the three
‑point line?  
COACH PILIPOVICH: Today, this game, that's what we wanted to do. We wanted to
keep everything in front of us. We wanted to make sure we knew where a three
was at. We felt if we're going to get beat, they have to beat us over the top
rather than inside. They're really good drivers. If the ball comes off the
rim, they usually get it. We don't get it much. That was our game plan.  
They went through a lot. Losing Delaney last week, it's a shame for him he
didn't get a chance to perform here because he's been a part of that
championship tradition for so many years. You feel bad for that. I hate to see
any players in our league get hurt and not be able to perform.  
  
Q. Boise State, defensively, what have you seen from them in that aspect?  
COACH PILIPOVICH: Personnel is a little bit different. James Webb is an
outstanding player. He's 6'9", but he can shoot threes, long, guard one
through five. Derrick Marks, player of the year. They just gritty. They take
on Coach Rice's attitude. They're tough‑minded, go after loose balls. They'll
knock you down, push you a little bit. They're a gritty team.  
Not only that, but they're talented. When they can stretch you and make shots
like that, they're hard to beat.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much, coach.  
COACH PILIPOVICH: Thank you.

_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

UNLV  67  
Nevada - 46

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by UNLV.  
Coach, some comments on today's game.  
COACH RICE: First thing I want to say is how much respect that I have, that
our team has, for the Wolf Pack and in particular for David Carter. David
Carter is a fantastic coach. He's a better person. He's one of the best guys
in our business.  
I wanted to start with that because he's such a good guy. His teams are always
prepared. He's a fantastic guy.  
I don't think the final score was indicative of how competitive that game was
today. We had certainly a lot of concern going into the game. I guess
well‑founded with the way they offensive rebounded the ball. But was our
biggest concern was their ability to offensive rebound the ball.  
A.J. West got 20 offensive rebounds against us in the first two games, and he
had 12 more tonight. He's a very hard matchup for us.  
I thought our defense kept us in the game in the first half. I thought our
energy level was fantastic. We shared the ball. We were together. There was no
doubt the last two days of practice we were focused. I had no doubt in my mind
at shoot‑around this morning that we were ready to play.  
I just knew we had a lot of guys on our roster this was their first Mountain
West Conference experience. I knew it was going to be a little bit of a slow
start for us, but our veteran leadership came through for us. Certainly Cody
and JK were fantastic. And Chris, his sophomore leadership, was good as well.  
I thought the second half was a key. As you know, we've led halftime a lot of
games. We came out pressing the second half, wanted to do some things to get
us going.  
Proud of our effort, proud of our togetherness. That stretch in the second
half when we got a couple defensive stops, got an open three for Jelan
Kendrick, got an open three for Jordan Cornish, a couple baskets for Chris
Wood, I think all those things showed how together we are, how hard we can
play.  
Like I said, I don't think the final score was indicative of how competitive a
game it was. I was very proud of our guys. We're excited to still be playing.
We understand the challenge of playing against the Aztecs, we just played them
last week, came up a play short. We have a lot of respect for them as well. A
quick turnaround. We'll get some rest, get a shoot‑around tomorrow.  
I'm proud of these two guys. Chris keeps getting better. His low post play in
the second half key. Jordan kept us in the first half with his three‑point
shooting.  
It's always tough to play a first‑round tournament game, especially tough when
you play against an in‑state school. When you look at that it makes it doubly
tough because of all the things involved with that.  
But again, great respect for David Carter and job he does at Reno.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Chris, did you feel like you had to bring it today, stand up to the A.J.
West challenge?  
CHRISTIAN WOOD: Most definitely. Going up against A.J. West, he's a big guy.
I'm going to have to show up every game. Every game matters, every game
counts. I'm going to have to come out and bring 100%.  
  
Q. Your thoughts about the Aztecs and how tough an assignment that will
be?  
CHRISTIAN WOOD: It's going to be a dogfight, just like every game is, just
like today was.  
I think we're going to be ready. We'll watch film, be prepared. We're going to
play a good game.  
JORDAN CORNISH: I mean, like he said, a tough team. We just got to come in and
execute our plays and just do what we have to do to get the W.  
  
Q. Jordan, they cut the double ‑digit lead to one or two possessions. Before
you go on the stretch, what was the mentality of the team? Did you feel like
you had been doing the things you needed to win and just had to keep pushing
or was there a change there before you went on a run?  
JORDAN CORNISH: I felt like we were doing the little things the whole game. We
kind of got flat in the middle of the game. Chris came back in, hit a couple
shots. We just went on a roll.  
  
Q. Jordan, talk about the confidence you have in your shot.  
JORDAN CORNISH: I mean, I just go out there. Whenever I have an open shot,
have a good look, coach always tell me shoot the ball. I just let it go. No
conscience, just let it go.  
  
Q. The last two times you played SanDiego State, they played 10 guys, they
press, try to take the legs out of you. You just played tonight. How are your
legs? Are you tired or should SanDiego State be worried?  
CHRISTIAN WOOD: SanDiego State should be very worried. We're going to be
ready. Our legs are going to be fine. We'll be well‑rested and we're just
going to play.  
JORDAN CORNISH: Like he said, they should be worried. In a tournament time you
can't be tired.  
COACH RICE: Obviously we're equally worried because they're a fantastic team.
You know the deal. SanDiego State is fantastic, we know that, they've beaten
us twice this year. Obviously Coach Fisher is worried. I'm worried. We're all
worried because it's the time of year if you get beaten you go home in terms
of the conference tournament.  
We have great respect for SanDiego State and what they do. I speak for our
guys when I say that.  
  
Q. It's a quick turnaround preparation ‑wise. How much do you think it helps
having played them a week ago in the same building as far as scouting report?
Is that still fresh in your mind?   
JORDAN CORNISH: I think it helps a lot. Like you say, we just played them last
week. Just come in, same scouting report. We've seen them twice this year,
just execute.  
CHRISTIAN WOOD: SanDiego State is a really good team. We're going to watch
film. Film is still fresh. Like you said, we played them last week. We're
going to be known to the offense. We're going to know what they're running.
They're going to know what we're running. It's going to be a dogfight, just
like every game is.  
  
Q. Chris, scored 21 of your 28 in the second half. Free ‑throw line a lot.
Talk about your play in the second half.   
CHRISTIAN WOOD: Thing was, we have unselfish guys on the team. Coach kept
calling the play for me. I just kept executing it. We just got things going.
Guys got open looks.  
Jordan knocked down a few threes. J.K. had a huge three that got us a good
lead. When we play together, it's hard to beat us.  
  
Q. Chris, you got revenge up in Reno. How much sweeter is it to advance
against your rival?  
CHRISTIAN WOOD: Reno is a good team. It's always good. They're an in‑state
team with us. It's always good, you know, to beat them. It was a good game. It
was a dogfight. They played good. I'm just glad we got the win as a team.  
  
Q. What are the things you didn't do in the first two games that you'd like
to correct?  
JORDAN CORNISH: Less turnovers. We got to out‑rebound them, just take care of
the ball.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll dismiss our student‑athletes at this time.  
We'll continue with questions for coach.  
  
Q. Did you see something in the first few games, your guards dug well,
creating turnovers? Did you make a concerted effort to tell them that maybe
you saw something they could get these turnovers?  
COACH RICE: We thought the biggest key to the game was trying to pressure them
and force turnovers. As much as we emphasized defensive rebounding all week
long, we aren't a great defensive rebounding team, haven't been all season
long. The way for us to try to somehow neutralize that was to try to force
some turnovers and get some points off turnovers.  
I thought Cody did a good job of it. We picked up. The pressure we started in
the second half got us going as well.  
  
Q. When they got to four, you took two or three quick threes, three straight
possessions to Wood. It was obviously a mismatch at some point in there.  
COACH RICE: Yeah, that's always a key for us. That's been one of the things
all season long is trying to go to Chris, trying to get the ball inside when
we have a couple flat possessions. We want to give our guys freedom, as you
know, to shoot the ball.  
Jordan shot the ball extremely well. And Pat hadn't shot the ball well all
season long.  
But again, it's all about defensive stops for us, trying to get some easy
baskets. It will be the same tomorrow night. It will be very difficult because
of how good SanDiego State is in defensive transition. They're a great
defensive transition team. Trying to get a few easy baskets will be key
tomorrow night just like it was today.  
  
Q. Game plan was obviously to pound the ball into Chris. We saw how he
responded on the floor. How did he respond when you laid out the game plan for
him?  
COACH RICE: I think anyone would like to see they're going to get the ball a
lot.  
I just think Chris continues to make progress. When he's engaged like he was
today, we're a good basketball team. I think that the ability of our guys to
get him the ball. We're screening much better. Getting Pat back was huge
because it gives us another scorer out on the floor. It's difficult when Pat
is not on the floor, because teams can really sag on Chris.  
That lineup we had out there with multiple scorers on the floor was a big deal
for us, giving Chris some space inside. Goodluck has become better offensive
rebounding the ball, and Morgan's energy has been good, as well.  
  
Q. You talked about having a lot of guys who haven't played in a Mountain
West Conference tournament game. Does that balance out with the fatigue factor
of having to play a game and San Diego State coming in fresh?  
COACH RICE: I think there's no doubt they're deeper than we are. You know the
respect that I have for Coach Fisher and their staff and the job they do. I
think they're one of the best defensive teams in the country. They're tough.  
J.J. O'Brien is probably my favorite player that's not on my team. Obviously
one of my big disappointments when we tried to recruit J.J. and we didn't get
him because I think the world of him as a player and a person. Does a
fantastic job. They're so well‑rounded. Three all‑conference players,
co‑defensive Player of the Year. They do so many things.  
To answer your question, it's tournament time. Leave it all out there.
Certainly there's always an advantage to getting a bye, but there's also an
advantage to having just played a game. So probably those two things
neutralize each other.  
What it's really going to come down to is the fact that SanDiego State is very
good. We've been very competitive with them. We'll be ready. It should be a
heck of a game, like all these games have been for 16 years.  
  
Q. Your thoughts on how tough an assignment SanDiego State is and how big of
an advantage is it to be playing on the home floor?  
COACH RICE: Well, obviously it's a huge advantage for SanDiego State to not
have played today. Having said that, it was the first time this year we've
played on this court and these baskets. Like I've said many times, I said it
when I was at UNLV as an assistant coach, I said it at BYU as the associate
head coach, and I say it at UNLV now, is that the tournament needs to be in
Las Vegas. I think it's been proven.  
Now, where exactly it is, what venue it's in, that's the presidents and ADs
that decide that. It needs to be in Las Vegas. I think the excitement of fans
proves that's the case.  
So we're excited to be playing here. We'd be excited to continue to play if it
was in SanDiego, Albuquerque or wherever. We're excited with our group to
continue to play and we know the challenge of playing SanDiego State tomorrow
night.  
  
Q. Seemed like every time Reno cut the lead to a couple points, Cornish made
a couple big threes. How important was it for him to get his shot going?  
COACH RICE: I thought other than the one stretch in the second half where we
took a couple quick shots, I thought one of the keys to the game was our
offensive patience. We scored a number of times in the basketball game late in
the shot clock.  
Again, we're not trying to hold it till the end. I just thought it was about
patience and making sure we take good shots.  
If we can get something in transition, that will be really hard tomorrow
night, we want to take it. If not, we want to move the ball and make them
play.  
When you play SanDiego State, they're disciplined at the low‑position game.
Probably going to be a low scoring game. We'd like it not to be. You have to
be patient because the bottom line is they get run‑outs and easy baskets
because they're a good defensive rebounding team. We have to make sure we're
patient.  
  
Q. Having come from a really high tempo offense, can you tell which you'd
rather have, the slow grind it out or if you want to get it up and down? Is
this a better matchup that you know it's not going to be 89 ‑80, or is this
hard because of your legs?  
COACH RICE: I think it's a hard matchup just because SanDiego State is so
good, because they're so physical, they have so many different weapons. You
watched the game last Wednesday night. In the first half J.J. O'Brien got 16
points because we guarded him one‑on‑one because we were concerned Shrigley,
concerned about Quinn.  
In the second half we doubled down on J.J. because I didn't want to come in
afterwards to the group and say we let J.J. get 30 points. Polee made a huge
three, Winston made a pull‑up jump shot, Quinn made an open three.  
They're an experienced team. There's a reason why they've been in the NCAA
tournament five straight years, six this year. They're well‑coached and
balanced.  
No one you play in this tournament's an easy matchup. Everyone came here with
the hopes of winning the tournament. It will be a tough matchup for us. Having
said that, we'll be ready to play tomorrow night.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much, coach.

_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

UNLV  67  
Nevada - 46

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Nevada.  
Coach, some comments on today's game.  
COACH CARTER: I thought the Rebels played very well for 40 minutes. We turned
the ball over 14 times in the second half. They scored 14 points. Got down,
dug ourselves a hole. The second half I thought we crawled back in it. They
made some big threes to extend it to 13, 16. We never could get it back.  
But I thought our guys competed and fought very hard.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Seemed like turnovers killed you guys tonight. Talk about why the
turnovers popped up in this game specifically.  
A.J. WEST: Just they got in a good position. We weren't careful with the ball.
Just turning the ball over at a higher rate.  
D.J. FENNER: I think we just rushed it. We weren't strong with the ball at all
and it showed, turnovers. They took advantage of our turnovers. That was the
biggest key for them. They scored off our turnovers. We just weren't strong
with the ball.  
  
Q. Seems like you've been emotional, red in the eyes. Talk about the
emotions as the season ends.  
D.J. FENNER: I'm an emotional guy. I use that to motivate me actually.  
But right now it's tough. It's one of the toughest days this year, especially
as tough as our season was, I feel like we were going to end it the right way.
I really don't feel like we gave it our all today.  
  
Q. You had some opportunities around the basket. Was it a microcosm of the
season, you couldn't get those opportunities to fall?  
A.J. WEST: Definitely. Personally I didn't do the best job at finishing. It
rubbed off onto my teammates. We just couldn't get it done today.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll dismiss the student‑athletes at this time. Thank you.  
We'll continue with questions for Coach Carter.  
  
Q. Talk about the turnovers. That was obviously the key to the game. Did you
not give yourself a chance in this game?  
COACH CARTER: Yeah, I thought we were careless with the ball, trying too hard
to get to the basket. We were driving one against two. We were kind of out of
character a little bit. I thought the guys were trying to win the game instead
of letting the game come to them.  
  
Q. It seemed like they were passing up some midrange jumpers to drive into
traffic.  
COACH CARTER: Again, I think trying to take over a game instead of taking what
they give you. We had a lot of open midrange shots. We drove in there against
two trees and two good shot‑blockers. Those guys are very long. They changed a
lot of shots. We didn't finish inside as well.  
You take the turnovers, not finishing inside, that combination you can't
really win.  
  
Q. You got within three points. Did you just run out of energy there?  
COACH CARTER: I think that was the turnovers. I thought we were right there at
three or four or five, two possessions. Was hoping to stay there. I think we
came down, turned the ball over three or four straight times. They hit two
threes. They were up by seven, hit two threes to go to 13. I thought that was
probably the breaker right there.  
  
Q. Did you feel this was a microcosm of the season?  
COACH CARTER: You know, it's been since November. We had a lot of shots inside
the paint, guys are anxious to get the shot off. You got to complete plays.
That's been one of our Achilles heels this year, not finishing inside.  
  
Q. Your general thoughts on the season. Not the year you wanted.  
COACH CARTER: Like I told the guys after the game, it's about growing up. It's
about what you do in the off‑season to prepare, to get better. I've had a team
like this before in 2010/11. You're very young, you're not as experienced. The
following year, those guys are going to get better.  
Sometimes you learn from losing. It's not always you have to win to know how
to win. But sometimes when you lose, the way you lost close games, missed free
throws, turnovers, those kids will grow up and you won't make those same
mistakes next year because you've already been through it.  
  
Q. You played tonight with zero seniors dressed. What is the lesson you hope
everybody takes back as they return next year, basically your entire team?  
COACH CARTER: Individually they have to get better. Everyone is different. You
got to work on your deficiencies. That's how the team gets better. Everyone
has to be on the same page. We talked about that. The season wasn't what
anyone really expected. You got to stay together, come back strong.  
  
Q. Chris Wood took over in the second half. Seemed like that power forward
slot was pretty lopsided. Talk about the way he took over the game in the
second half.  
COACH CARTER: He's so long. I thought he did a great job in the high post
against our zone.  
The first game and second game I thought he was more on the perimeter. This
game he stepped up and went inside, made some tough plays. I think he was the
difference, especially when we went to our zone, making big plays against us.  
  
Q. At times this year we saw Coleman and Criswell and Cooper get hot and
start hitting threes. It wasn't consistent throughout the year. How important
is it for you to get a catch ‑and‑shoot guy?  
COACH CARTER: It's very important. The key word is 'consistency'. I think
those guys were a little more consistent last year. You talk about Tyron
Criswell who is a newcomer. Eric is a freshman. Sometimes the speed of the
game, physicality. Marqueze last year was more of a role player. I think that
will come with experience.  
As far as bringing someone in, obviously we can add some pieces to help us
next year.  
  
Q. When did you find out that Perez wouldn't be able to play today? How did
that affect the game plan?  
COACH CARTER: He was sick on Tuesday. It was pretty serious. He didn't get to
practice yesterday. I knew Tuesday that he was not going to play.  
How did it affect us? More depth with the guards. Had to play those guys a lot
of minutes. Perez does a lot of things, not necessarily scoring, but
defensively he takes care of the ball. We did miss him in that regard.  
  
Q. Talking about next year, Perez and Stivrins, the only two not back.
You'll have Cooper, Criswell. How do you expect this team to make a jump?  
COACH CARTER: The jump is going to come in the springtime. The kids have to
get in the weight room, they have to work on their game. Like I say, everyone
is different. When you add newcomers like Tyron and Eric, the physicality, I
think the game is going to slow down for them.  
History has it, if you return your four or five guys, they will be better next
year, and I think they will be better.  
  
Q. Did it surprise you the disparity in the turnovers? They scored 21 points
off of turnovers. You didn't have any off of their turnovers. Did that
surprise you?  
COACH CARTER: Yeah, I thought we had a couple layups, fast breaks in the first
half, we didn't complete. If you don't get any easy ones... I thought their
defense was pretty good in the halfcourt, especially when they had the two big
guys in. It did surprise me.  
  
Q. Does it surprise you also the inability to finish down low? How do you
improve to be able to get some of those shots to go in?  
COACH CARTER: It's been going all year really. I think, again, it's about the
individual working hard. When it comes to offense, I've said this all year,
sometimes as the head coach you really feel helpless because when you're
inside, you miss the layup, you're at the free‑throw line, you miss the free
throw. It's not like you can do it. It's not like defense where you can rotate
a guy to take a charge. You can teach defense, sometimes you can't teach
offense. Unfortunately for us we missed a lot of easy baskets.  
How you correct it is more about the individual getting better and learning
how to finish around the rim.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much, coach.  
COACH CARTER: Thank you.

### [Mike Krzyzewski](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13672)

### [Jahlil Okafor](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28618)

### [Justise Winslow](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28810)

  
_CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

DUKE - 68  
SAN DIEGO STATE - 49

COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Well, very first thing, just congratulations to San Diego
State, Steve and his kids for a great season, 27 wins and a great program,
great people. And they were a very worthy opponent today, a team that was
really tough for us to score against and so we beat a really good team. Our
guys played outstanding defense. Justise, his defensive rebounding especially
in the first half was huge, and his play throughout was huge. And then Jah
was, you know, his scoring inside to get that percentage of shots and makes
against the San Diego State defense that is one of the best in the country was
terrific. My guards handled the ball well and we're going to Houston. So
that's a heck of a thing. I'm proud of my team.  
  
MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
 Q. Jahlil, you don't see a lot of guys as big and dominant physically
as you that apparently spent so much time working on your moves and your
fakes. Where did that come from? Did somebody influence you at a young age?  
JAHLIL OKAFOR: I've been playing basketball my entire life so a lot of the
things come natural, I'm just really comfortable playing in the post and I've
always been bigger than everybody else my size, so at an earlier age I was
always forced to be in the paint because I was taller than everybody else.
That's just somewhere I'm very comfortable.  
  
MODERATOR: Question is about the moves, his individual moves.  
  
JAHLIL OKAFOR: Well, I have a trainer that I've been working with since 8th
grade and he's been great for me, even when I stepped on the Duke campus, I
worked on a lot of moves with Coach Capel and watching the film with coaches,
they pointed out things that they'll think will work and it's been effective
for me.  
  
 Q. For Jahlil, how much did the aggressiveness and the quickness of
your guards have to do with putting their defense on their heels and creating
openings for you?  
JAHLIL OKAFOR: Say that again? I'm sorry.  
  
 Q. How much did the quickness of your guards have to do with putting
their defense on their heels and kind of creating some openings for you?  
JAHLIL OKAFOR: Our guards, they were phenomenal tonight on both ends of the
floor. They found me multiple times to give me easy opportunities to score and
they were giving me all the confidence in the world, but I think their
quickness did give San Diego State a problem.  
  
 Q. Jahlil, what did you learn from Friday night and how did that
experience help you tonight?  
JAHLIL OKAFOR: Just the game's never over. We had a huge lead with Robert
Morris and they cut it down to 10 and we kind of felt the pressure of that
game and we learnt that from this game and we never let up, the entire game we
stayed together, we kept competing.  
  
 Q. Usually winning an ACC tournament leads to NCAA success. What did
you guys do to recharge your batteries in the last week to come in here and
play the two games like you played and moving forward?  
JUSTISE WINSLOW: Really we just took some time off, let our bodies recovery
physically. Just the whole week Coach did a great job of getting us mentally
prepared. We didn't find out our opponent until Wednesday so throughout that
week, there was a lot of focus on us and how we can get better as a team, and
once we found our opponent, the coaches did a great job of letting us know the
scouting and the game plan. We were just very prepared for both these games so
that we could practice really helped us get better.  
  
 Q. Jahlil, at one point early in the first half or midway through the
first half, you finished off a fast break with a dunk and you turned around
and you punched your fists and you were clapping. Kind of emotional. What was
going through your head then because you were maybe a little more emotional
than I'm used to seeing?  
JAHLIL OKAFOR: I had a lot of emotion going through me before the game. Me and
my brothers, we really just wanted this game. There was no reason for it, I
don't know why I did it, it was just all emotion and I was passionate about
the game.  
  
 Q. Jahlil, what would it mean to you, you know, to get to the top of
the mountain here. Obviously you have a ways to go, but what would that mean
to you to win a national title?  
JAHLIL OKAFOR: It would mean the world to me. I've always wanted to win a
national title. Me, Justise, Tyus, Grayson, the freshman who are coming in
here, we had one big dream of winning the national title. That's what led me
to come to Duke was the opportunity to win a national title. That's where all
my focus has been the entire season and that's where it still is. We're
putting everything on the line and that's our No. 1 goal.  
  
JUSTISE WINSLOW: Like Jah said just as a kid, you grow up wanting to be in
that moment and play on that big stage. It's been a long season, we had our
ups and downs. For us to finish off in that fashion would be great but we've
got a lot of work to be done.  
  
MODERATOR: Thanks, guys. Good job. Questions for Coach?  
  
 Q. Mike, you reduced your rotation tonight, dramatically it seems, and
at some point in the game you stopped calling set plays and went straight
motion offense; is that right, did I see that correctly and why did you do
that?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: That's pretty good. Keep going, I'll grade you. What was the
first point you made?  
  
 Q. The rotation.  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Rotation. It was so good that I'm really pretty good. I
don't go into the game thinking about a rotation. Part of it has to do with
foul trouble, who they have, and our match-ups, and then conditioning. Jah,
especially with these long timeouts, Jah this week is in much better shape
than he was the last three and a half weeks of the season. I think he's pretty
much over his injury, so he can play longer. If you hit on a group, I would
have had Grayson in there a little bit longer but he got in foul trouble, it
just kind of hit. In the second half, they're a very good defensive team and
they're very tall, they have great length. They're tough to score against.
They were prepared to stop some of our sets really well. And so we just said
at a timeout, look, let's run motion, you guys attack, follow your instincts.
If you can get it to Jah while you're running motion, get it to Jah but be
players. And we do that at different times during the season but today it
really worked out. It was almost like a good push for them because it
translated on defense also. It just kind of worked out. But they're the ones
who made -- they were making the plays and they made it happen.  
  
 Q. I was asking the players about usually the ACC tournament winners
spring boards and certainly Notre Dame has, but how do you deal with not
winning it and still keeping the goals that you obviously have in mind?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: I don't necessarily agree with that. I think we've won a
national championship and we've won a tournament. I remember losing by 20
points in the championship game and winning. I think the main thing is for any
team to put what they've just done behind them and try to get fresh. That's
what we've tried to do. When we lost to Notre Dame, it's not like you go back
and punish them. They've been too good. But learn from it, get fresh and then
you're 0-0 again, that's what we tried to do.  
  
 Q. Mike, when Justise has the kind of all-around game that he had
today, what does that do for the team especially on the defensive end?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: It just takes us to a whole other level. Those two kids
played at a really high level this afternoon. And Justise, a lot, was on their
best player, O'Brien, who I think a lot of people feel is the best player in
that conference, in the Mountain West. And certainly that point forward, that
guy, he's a really good player. Justise won that individual battle, not that
he was bad but Justise was so good, and it gave our guys more confidence.
Those two kids really played great games this afternoon, big-time games.  
  
 Q. Coach, you know what it takes to win a national championship. As you
look at this team, do you see all the pieces coming together right now that
tell you, you have a shot?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Yeah, you know, we have a shot because we can still play.
You know, there will be 16 teams that will have a shot. A couple things, one,
we're healthy, hopefully we stay healthy. We weren't healthy the last couple
weeks of the regular season, completely. We have great attitudes. The guys
aren't ready for this to be -- in other words, they're not mentally tired,
they're not physically tired. They're together. We have talent, we're getting
older by experience, and so we just -- like we got better here, these two
games. Our defense was really good here. We shared the ball well again
tonight, 16 and 9, really good. So we got better. If we can -- we've got to
play Friday night. Hopefully we get better then and get a chance to play
Sunday. It's a young group of kids that have really had a great season and
they still want to get better. So you've got a chance, we've got a chance.  
  
 Q. When they cut it to 7, they came down and Tyus fed Quinn in the
corner for 3, and you called an immediate timeout even though there was a TV
timeout coming up the next dead ball. What did you tell them because y'all
went on a 13 run after that?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: I thought like we had lost control of the game, they were in
more control, the momentum of the game was theirs, and we had just seized it
with that 3. And I wanted to make sure, I just wanted to be the point guard
for the timeout and say, look, we need stops, we're going to go motion, let's
change this right now. I've done that more this year with this group at
different times, to call some timeouts when it's not in the book to call them
or whatever, but just more by feel. I think they needed a blow, they needed a
blow so they would be fresh defensively.  
  
 Q. Coach, you obviously have learned a lot about your freshmen
throughout this season but did you learn something else about them this
weekend in their first tournament action? And talk about that growth of them
from beginning to now.  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Well, sure, thank you. This is their first time. And even
for the upperclassmen, most of the questions for the upperclassmen was what
you did last year. So there wasn't a lot of positive vibe about us being in
the tournament, it was like can you get over this and then it's a new thing
for you. That's just the way it is. I thought our guys had fun this week. We
didn't pay attention to anything like that, we just played. And they're such a
good, close group. They're really a close group. And they responded in both
games when it got down to 10 against Robert Morris and it got down to 7 this
afternoon, they responded to like their best play, which that's the thing you
can't teach, you don't know if they're going to do it and they did, and so I'm
proud of them for doing that. This tournament, I call it tournament pressure,
and they handled it really well twice.  
  
 Q. Steve Fisher was talking about how you guys offensively were able to
do things that teams haven't been able to do against them all year, like
getting to the rim, finding an open 3, then pounding it down low to Okafor. Is
this maybe the most versatile offense you've had in quite a while? Because it
seems like you have got four guys, whether it's the wing players, the guards
or down low that you're able to score almost at will against anybody at any
time?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Well, it's a very complimentary group of guys because you
have, I think, the best low post scorer in the country in Jah, we have good
shooters and we have guys who can drive. And so that's why we've been one of
the best offensive teams in the country because we have those components. But
it starts with Jah because you get -- you don't just get penetration with a
dribble, you get penetration with a pass and then you get results. And so you
move the defense in and out, and Jah overall has done a really good job with
the double team. So it's been a really good off -- I mean, one of the very
good offensive teams I've had. We've been a good defensive team most of the
year and we just had a couple games where we weren't good, but overall we've
been a very good defensive team and we were really good here for these two
games.  
  
 Q. Coach, the other night with Jah with the dunk, do you think that was
a learning lesson for him and how do you think that impacted how well he
played today?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: I think all of them are learning lessons. He shouldn't have
done that, and he knows it, he takes responsibility for it, and just like you
should take responsibility for playing great tonight and why did that happen,
why did that happen? Were you a little bit more mentally prepared tonight, did
you show emotion, did you put more into it, and did you play through tired? I
didn't think, like in that situation it was the end of a four-minute period, I
thought he was tired and he did -- he made a mistake. Tonight, this afternoon,
when he got tired, he played through it and made really good plays. And that's
part of becoming a really good player is to be tired. A team needs to beat it
and a player needs to beat it because all these kids get tired.  
  
 Q. What adjustments do you have to make heading into Houston against
Utah and their 3-point shooting team?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: You know, I haven't watched anybody. I wish -- I'll handle
Utah questions -- nothing against them, I just haven't watched them. I didn't
know we would be going to Houston until about an hour ago and in between I
haven't watched any of their tape or whatever. I'll be happy on our press
conferences before the game to talk in detail about Utah, but I just know
they're coached by a guy with an amazing background, I think in the history of
the game, I don't know how many times two Polish coaches will go against one
another, where both of us are called Coach K, but he's a good friend. I had
him on my Sirius XM show about a month ago and, boy, was he -- he was really
good, really good. And his background is amazing. I know they play with great
character and they come from a great conference but I'll study them more and
I'll be more apt to give a good answer as to how we'll defend them and attack
them.  
  
 Q. Mike, have you been able to -- were you aware of how well the
conference has played?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Yeah, yeah. Unbelievable. How about the triangle region,
it's not bad. But the whole tournament has had incredible games, just
incredible games. Our hearts and our thoughts and prayers go out to Mike and
his family. For him to coach that game without anyone knowing that his mom had
passed away. She was an Olympic -- she was, like Mike said, she was way ahead
of her time. She just was like a great, great lady. For his team and for the
basketball gods to make that happen was so good. I'm so happy and I hope
they're doing all right.  
  
MODERATOR: Thank you.

_CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

DUKE - 68  
SAN DIEGO STATE - 49

MODERATOR: We'll be starting with San Diego State.  
  
COACH FISHER: I told our team that I'm disappointed that we couldn't have
played better, that we didn't play better, but I'm immensely proud of what the
program has become, single out our three fifth-year seniors. We got beat up
tonight by a really good team. I thought when we fought back in the second
half and cut it to 7, I think we had the ball twice with a chance, maybe, but
they didn't let that happen. They're very good and they deserve a No. 1 seed
and they played like one. We're better than we played tonight, they had a lot
to do with it, but we've got a group of guys that compete, believe in one
another. And when it ends, it ends so fast because you don't think it's going
to end. But the end is here for us. But we represented San Diego State and
ourselves in a fashion that a mom and a dad and the university president and
the coach could be proud.  
  
MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. Skylar, can you just give us your impressions of Okafor, particularly
in the first half when they were able to get the ball inside to him pretty
effectively, sometimes on the break?  
SKYLAR SPENCER: He's a good player. You know, he's real big and he gets into
position. I tried to guard him without fouling him, but I'll take the blame on
that one. I allowed a lot of points from him so I feel like I let my team down
in that area.  
  
Q. JJ, uncharacteristically we're not used to seeing you guys kind of
not look comfortable, they were doing some things to you that most teams
don't. What happened early in the game from your perspective?  
J.J. O'BRIEN: I think they bothered us with their pressure. They did a good
job denying our wings, getting us out of our sets a little bit. So their
pressure bothered us early and I think we had some turnovers, some missed
shots and they had some runouts and they got some easy buckets. Their pressure
bothered us.  
  
Q. Is that just a matter of them being extremely talented, that that
happened, because again that doesn't usually happen with you guys?  
J.J. O'BRIEN: Well, not a lot of teams pressure like them, so it's a lot to do
with their coaching, a lot to do with their players, but that's just their
style. We haven't faced a style like that.  
  
Q. Skylar, this question is for you: You're the only guy sitting up
there that's coming back next year. I know it's pretty early to think about
things like this, but how much does a game like this make you want to get
going right away?  
SKYLAR SPENCER: Yeah, it leaves a bad taste in your mouth. I want to get back,
I wish the season started tomorrow. I'll think about this L, go back in the
gym, work hard in the off season and hopefully we meet them again next year.  
  
Q. AQ, you guys seemed real tentative early, very uncharacteristic of
you guys, and then once you guys were behind, you seemed to relax a little
bit. Just talk about that a little bit and how were you guys able to get back
into it?  
AQEEL QUINN: Their pressure bothered us a lot. That's all I can say, their
pressure bothered us.  
  
Q. For Skylar, you said Okafor was big and he got positioning, but can
you describe what it's like to go up against him?  
SKYLAR SPENCER: I played against big players before but I haven't played
against anybody that big, with that skill set. It was kind of hard to fight
with him and not get called for a foul, so I don't know, I guess I'll come
back stronger next year or whatever, but I just tried to bang with him without
getting called for a foul.  
  
Q. For Dwayne, you guys obviously hit a bunch of 3s on Friday. What were
they doing differently to take those away from you today?  
DWAYNE POLEE II: They did a great job denying and pressuring the guards so
that it was hard to make certain reads. That's a credit to their defense. And
open ones we did get, we weren't able to knock down. All credit to their
defense.  
  
MODERATOR: Guys, thank you. Congratulations on a great year. Questions for
Coach Fisher?  
  
Q. Steve, I know about the pressure. That's just an extremely talented
team and I wonder if that is basically the difference tonight, the depth of
their talent, that they can play defense like that and make shots, and you
guys are, it's really 50/50 whether you're going to come out shooting or
not?  
COACH FISHER: What happened to us was created a lot by Duke, but it could not
have been a worst scenario for us to get behind so big, so fast early. And we
got rocked back on our heels and I think we became tentative a little bit when
that happened rather than being smart-aggressive. But we had some pretty good
looks that we didn't get to go down, but a lot of it's a credit to how they
guard. They do a nice job of guarding, they don't let you get easy looks. But
we got off to a rough start. And all that being said, at halftime I said we
can win the game, let's get the first basket, let's win the first TV timeout
segment. I think we cut two or three points off of it, 13-10, and all of a
sudden Malik hit a couple baskets and we cut it to 7. I think we believed then
that we had a chance, but to their credit, I think they went back-to-back-to-
back on us and 7 became 13 or 14 again and they expanded on it. We're better
than we played. Duke made us play that way to some degree, to a great degree,
and when we had our open shots, the ones that went in yesterday didn't go in
today for us. And we had some open shots, not as many but we had some open
looks that we couldn't get to go in.  
  
Q. Steve, I know it's not the easiest time to do this, but I just
wondered if you could reflect back on what your guys accomplished this year
and maybe what you see for this program going ahead from here.  
COACH FISHER: I told them, you must be disappointed. Disappointment is there
when you lose, especially when you lose your last game. But to your point, I
said the same thing, reflect back with pride on what you've done to continue
to elevate San Diego State basketball. And I singled out the three fifth-year
seniors, and where we were when they came and how much improvement we've made.
And then I said be determined, be determined the rest of you, that you're
going to come back and do a little extra to get a little bit better, and knock
on the door again. We will find a way to work our way into Sweet 16, through a
Sweet 16 and you can be the group that does it. But they've done a wonderful
job all year in representing San Diego State in terms of how they treat and
deal with people, to how they go to class, to how they compete as a basketball
player. So they've done a wonderful job representing themselves and our
university and I'm proud of that. Disappointed that we're losing today, it's
there for all of us.  
  
Q. What were your impression of Winslow and Okafor, were they better
than you even could tell on film?  
COACH FISHER: They've been pretty good on the film that I've watched. I knew
they were good. They've he got a team full of very good players. Okafor is a
load, he's hard to guard. I think we gave him two, three, four that were too
easy, but he's good. He's very, very talented. And again, he's not the Lone
Ranger. Winslow can play. They've got a terrific team and they played like a
No. 1 seed today.  
  
Q. Can you talk about how you guys have relied on your defense all year,
one of the best in the country but they still were able to come out and shoot
in the mid 50s from field goal percentage, and even high from a 3-point range.
What were they were able to do that they were able to score almost at will all
night?  
COACH FISHER: They got it to the rim a little too easy on us with their
guards, with their quickness to get by us and get to the rim. That hasn't
happened the way it did tonight. We say guard your man, keep him in front of
you, be responsible. And when they would get in the gaps, somebody would step
over to help a little bit and then they did a great job of finding the 3-point
shooters and all the while they're throwing in an Okafor every other time down
the floor and he went to work on us. He went to work.  
  
Q. Steve, I just wondered if you could address real quick the news of
the illness kind of sweeping through your bunch?  
COACH FISHER: Everybody knew that AQ got sick at shootaround on Thursday
before we played on Friday. I don't know if it was a bug, they initially
thought it might have been food poisoning, but it hit a lot of people from
coaches to players to coaches' wives and that's not fun to deal with that, but
that had no impact on how we competed, what we did, how we played. That had no
bearing on it.  
  
Q. You had a pretty great freshman class at Michigan, and this Duke
freshman class is pretty good as well. Can you compare the two a little bit? I
know it's a ways back, but can you talk of this Duke freshman class and how
good they actually are?  
COACH FISHER: They're very, very good. I don't like to compare anything, but
they are a talented, well-coached group that compete hard and that's what you
have to do, no matter whether you're a freshman or a senior, but they're very,
very good.  
  
MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.  
  
COACH FISHER: Thank you.

MICHIGAN STATE - 60  
VIRGINIA - 54

COACH IZZO: I can't tell you how proud and excited I am for these guys.
Especially the seniors, juniors, the guys that have been through a lot. I'm
not sure of all the great teams we've had, I've ever had one in a day that
change what we do on a game plan and execute it as well as they did. I'm just
proud of them, excited for them and looking forward to moving on.  
  
MODERATOR: Raise your hand, please.  
  
 Q. This is for Trav and Branden. Early on you scored 13 quick and,
Branden, you were big at the start of the second half. As two seniors, was
part of that, did you guys talk about not wanting this to be your last game
and, I don't know, I guess coming out big and carrying the game early?  
TRAVIS TRICE: It's funny that you say that. Draymond Green actually this
morning said don't let this be your last game and I texted him back and said,
I won't. But that was our mindset coming in. We knew they were a great team,
we had to jump out on them early.  
  
BRANDEN DAWSON: Coming to the locker room after the first half, we just kept
telling each other that we definitely want to practice tomorrow and coming to
this game, myself and Travis and Denzel, but being that Travis and I are
seniors, we just kept telling each other hey, we definitely don't want this to
be our last game, so we kept playing hard and we just kept playing with
passion.  
  
 Q. For either Branden or Denzel, when you look at what Travis has done
from where he was last year to this year scoring 23 points in a game like
this, is it hard to believe how far he's come?  
DENZEL VALENTINE: No, not really, he's always had that capability. We just had
basically a three year starter in Keith Appling playing in front of him, so
Travis was always ready but it's his senior year and this is his time to
shine. He always just stayed humble his three years and always calm and he
just kept working and now he's shown what he can do.  
  
BRANDEN DAWSON: Just playing with Travis since AAU basketball, those shots
that Travis made throughout the Big Ten tournament and shots he made in the
regular season, a few of the shots he made in today's game just shows Travis
is a bigtime player. He's been in moments like this plenty of times and the
shot he made, I think, late, I knew it was going in for a fact. That's just
what type of player he is. Big-time players make big-time plays, that's what
Travis did.  
  
 Q. Follow-up with Travis. Denzel said it, you waited your turn. How
hard was that to wait until your senior year and did you ever have doubts?  
TRAVIS TRICE: To be honest with you, there were a lot of things that played
into it. If you look early on I had a lot of injuries. I mean, I lost out on
two summers and that's really when you improve so I think that played a major
key into it. At the same time I've always had great players around me and all
I care about is winning, whether that's playing a lot, scoring a lot, not even
playing at all, that's all I care about.  
  
 Q. Question about Branden for you. Matt Costello said right before the
game, usually through the huddle when you guys are jumping around, and he
jumped in and kind of took over and Tony Bennett said they just couldn't match
his energy. Can you talk a little bit about Branden gave you today and how he
changed the game defensively early on there?  
DENZEL VALENTINE: Yeah, funny you said that, because we're usually jumping
around in our huddle or whatever, I'm usually the one that takes it over and
is encouraging guys. B.J. just took it over for some reason so I was like oh,
he ready to play. So when he did that, I knew he was ready to play. B.J., he
just came out like a monster and he did what he's supposed to do. At half-
time, I stayed in his ear. I knew if I couldn't be in the game, I had to stay
in his ear. I just kept encouraging B.J. and he pulled through.  
  
 Q. Travis, what was going through your mind the first five minutes when
you went on your hot streak? And then later, there was a transition
opportunity when Branden ran the floor. Costello went first, and Branden came
fast. What did you see in Branden on that one? How key was that play and what
did you see from Branden as that was developing?  
TRAVIS TRICE: It's funny, I actually caught the ball around half court and
once I got it, all I hear it B.J. yelling my name Trav, Trav. And he just
separates and goes down and finishes, gets the and-one, and I think that was
one of the major plays of the game because that changed the momentum,
honestly. It really got him going, too. So after that we were just rolling
with him.  
  
 Q. Travis, did you ever kind of just feel snakebit considering the
injuries you went through, at one point even your blisters had a blister in
it?  
TRAVIS TRICE: I haven't had any surgeries but I've probably had every injury
in the book that would make you shake your head. I just think everything
happens for a reason. I just thank God for literally just bringing me through
it. It's made me a better person, honestly, just all the things I've been
through.  
  
 Q. Travis, you just talked about your start, the first five and a half
minutes scoring 13 out of your team's 15 points to give you an 11 point lead,
how that felt and what you were thinking, starting the game?  
TRAVIS TRICE: To be honest with you, it started off, my teammates did a great
job of getting me open looks. I think B.J. or Zel threw me a breakout. I got a
dunk and then I got a layup from one of the two, and then Denzel hit me with a
great pass on the 3. I have to give my teammates credit for that because they
did a great job of finding me early on.  
  
 Q. It's really a question for all three of you guys. Coach Izzo said
that he asked you in a day to change something significant about the team's
personality, and I'm sure he'll eventually tell us what that is. But when he
comes to you and says to you we're going to do this thing that's totally
different, give us a little bit of insight into how you digest the fact that
the coach is asking you to be totally different.  
DENZEL VALENTINE: Well, at this point in the season we're playing teams that
we're not familiar with. So if we got to do something that's uncharacteristic
of us, then we just have to do it and we've got to trust in the coaches that
they're being right. Obviously they were right because our defensive concepts,
it worked today. Our coaches do a great job of preparing us for this.  
  
BRANDEN DAWSON: Yeah, just what Denzel said, we've been playing in this
tournament we've been playing teams that we're not familiar with, so you have
to follow the Coach's game plan and that's what we've been doing. Our coaching
staff, our managers, they do a great job of getting us prepared, but when you
have trust in Coach and the things that he tell us to do, then that's when
things fall into place. Like for instance, Coach told me during this game that
I can't go for any steals, I can't gamble, and I didn't go for any steals. So,
Coach, I listened to you.  
  
COACH IZZO: (Claps hands.)  
  
TRAVIS TRICE: I think you've just got to give our coaching staff a great hand.
Not only coaches, but our assistant coaches. They're staying up until late
hours of the night preparing us for our game. I think it just speaks to how
great that really are. They literally told us a totally different game plan
from some of the things we've been taught for four years honestly and for them
to be able to display that to us and for us to pick it up, I just think it
shows how great of coaches they are.  
  
 Q. Travis, you mentioned your teammates getting you those open looks
earlier, but it seemed like you had a very aggressive mindset. Did you see
that as a chance to seize control of the game and once you had that lead, does
that change the complexion from there on out just because of the type of game
that it was?  
TRAVIS TRICE: Yeah, I think of the way Virginia plays, they're a team where if
it's a slowdown game, the momentum's in their hands just because of the way
they play. Early on our thing was attack from the getgo, not just myself;
everybody. We need to try and attack, get a lead and it gives us kind of a
cushion. At the same time, you have to give Virginia a lot of credit, and most
of that was because of the way they play.  
  
 Q. You guys are probably one of the most dangerous teams within this
bracket and you're a 7 seed. Do you feel that there's less pressure as a 7
seed? Is there an us against the world type of mentality that you enter this
tournament with?  
BRANDEN DAWSON: Well, just throughout the season, we definitely had an up and
down season. We had some losses that in my mind we shouldn't have. Coming to
this tournament we just told each other, hey, we see the Coach's game plan, we
all play together, we bring in passion. We trust one other then that the sky's
the limit for us, I think coming to this tournament being a 7 seed it's
definitely us against the world type of mentality for all of us. We keep
playing the way we're playing, we'll definitely make a good run.  
  
 Q. Travis, defense obviously is something people were talking about all
week, a lot of it was with Virginia. Can you talk about, I guess, what the
challenge is when your program is built on that and hearing people talking
about other programs' defense and does that raise your game to become a better
stopping team on defense?  
TRAVIS TRICE: To be honest with you, all, we've tried to improve defensively
and honestly we're going up against one of the better teams statistically in
the country against Virginia. But we don't try and get caught up in that. If
you think about that, there's a hundred other mind games you could be playing
with. Our thing is just concentrating on winning the game, listening to our
coaches and doing what we need to do to win.  
  
MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Izzo?  
  
 Q. So, Tom, fill us in. What was the major personality change?  
COACH IZZO: Well, it really wasn't a personality, it was just the concepts.
Usually we're a team that our guards, we call it jump to the ball, we're
always giving help, we play kind of like they do, a little pack man defense.
But because they run these flare screens and they're so good at it. This is a
hard team to prepare for and a very well-coached team. A couple guys didn't
have as good of games but because they flare those guards, we couldn't get
caught up in that. So we used our bigs in the middle and we just kind of
changed what we do and we did it in a day and a half. We did some things
against Wisconsin where we changed how we played. Some guys are just concept
guys that do the same thing and I respect that because we're just not quite as
talented as we've normally been, so we're always cheating and trying to find a
way to get an edge. Give my staff a lot of credit, they sat down and did it.
But to have a team do that in one night change or two nights, kind of the
things, like Branden and Trav have done the same thing for four years. It was
interesting because we put Branden on the perimeter at the 3 because we were
running out of bodies there in the first half. He jumped to the ball and he
held like we normally do and they flared him and got a bucket and he kind of
said, oh, it's different when I'm playing the three than the four. It was just
something we did tactically and my assistants talked about it, we went with
it, we implemented it, and boy, the credit goes to coaches can tell you what
to do, but to do it when muscle memory tells you to do it a different way,
that's where I think we all talked about, in factor, Earvin talked about it
when he talked to them. At this time of year your focus has to be incredible
and that was incredible focus if you ask me.  
  
 Q. You said yesterday that you've learned over the years you've got to
look at the whole weekend, you can't just look at the first game. When did you
see this in Virginia, when did you guys come up with this, was this earlier in
the week, was this after watching them play Friday, how did it work?  
COACH IZZO: I didn't go that far, we're not that good a team. We couldn't go
in thinking -- I watched some film on Virginia early, but I also know what we
did last year and that probably helped us a little bit, too, I did forget to
say that. We did similar things last year, but last year we didn't have to
cheat as much because Harris and Appling were two of the best guards
defensively in the country. We kind of talked about it on Tuesday, if we play
them, here are some things we can look at, put it down, had our video guys
pull some clips of when we played them, pull some clips of what we were trying
to get across. And the minute we got back from the game, we gave them a half
hour, we talked about it and we went with it.  
  
 Q. Tom, a couple of the guys said that you brought up the Wisconsin
game down the stretch to them. What did you tell them and what did you see
differently in this game from those guys versus last week?  
COACH IZZO: Well, like I said, I've always been a guy that if there's an
elephant in the room, I'm going to address it. You know, I made no bones about
it. We didn't finish the job against Wisconsin, and so all I want them to do
is learn from it, you know, because it wasn't a couple of plays; it was a
couple of defensive lapses, it was not cutting out. So those are the things we
emphasize, and that's the advantage of playing in championship-level games,
because they hurt a little more, you remember them a little bit more and I
think our guys, I might have said it once or twice, but they said it more. And
don't forget, we didn't do this, we didn't do that. That's pretty cool when
that happens.  
  
 Q. Coach, you talked a little about your team not being quite as
talented this season. Do you consider them now overachieving or do you feel
that they're sort of maximizing the potential that they've -- that you've seen
in them all season?  
COACH IZZO: Well, that's not a cut to us. It is just that we're missing a few
players that we started the year with. In all honesty, we're not as talented,
but that happens to a lot of teams. I did say this is one of the more together
teams we've had ever, ever. I mean, something funny happened the other night
after the game. We watched a little film like we do and we give them a meal
and we send them up and we do some stuff and we bring them back down. After
the meal they just sat there and laughed and talked. Usually we had guys that
would run up and grab their phones and text their girlfriends and call it a
week. These guys just enjoy being around each other. I think that's the makeup
of a team. And I give credit to our seniors and our junior. These three guys
did that. Branden's an unbelievable teammate, sometimes too good of a
teammate, got to get a little more selfish. And Trav and Zel are just special.
I get a lot of credit from our football coach when he says you know, I look
across, you've taught us how to win championships. The last couple years he's
taught me that our seniors have to be good down the stretch and that's what he
preaches to his team and it's been good for me and my team.  
  
 Q. Along those lines, when Branden had a marvelous game against
Virginia last year, but he had Adreian Payne in the game, and there were other
things. Can you talk about his performance in this setting today about with
your roster as is it?  
COACH IZZO: You know, that breakaway, I told him after in front of everybody
that I'm really mad at him because that's what I think he has to give. To me,
that was an unbelievable play, I would like to know what that 40 speed was. He
looked like Secretariat, he just put in another gear. When he called Trav, he
was 10 feet behind I was right in line, and when Trav threw it, I said what
was he doing, and it was one step. Branden has got some special skills that he
doesn't even know he has sometimes. But he is getting better and we shouldn't
punish him because it's taken a little longer. Like Trav, I think he would
have been a different player if he didn't miss two summers. And we had Branden
miss two summers, and that's more difficult than people think. Just like
Anderson, he's not the same player he was. That kid in the middle of January,
I think, was one of the best players I saw play. Injuries are more difficult
than people think to get over.  
  
 Q. Forgive me if you've answered this already, 5 point game with just
under three minutes left, they've been fouling you, you hadn't taken many
field goal attempts. Trice waves off the screener and hits a 3. Talk about
that play.  
COACH IZZO: Good coaching. I told him to do it. No, I didn't. You know, that's
what you say, you rely on your seniors. They're a hard team to get around
because we're trying to ball screen it, they trap that, jump it, so we started
telling Trav just take them one-on-one and I wasn't expecting them to pull up
from that distance. It's one of those oh, no, nice shot type things. But he's
made a lot of those through his whole career, he's made a lot of those through
high school. I've just got to run with him because the kid's an incredible kid
and I'm just happy that he made it.  
  
 Q. I think that's 13 Sweet 16s for you now. You just beat a team that
was 30-3 and it's Round of 32. Did that seem almost more like a regional final
and what does that do for your team just getting started in a tournament to
come through a war like that, if you had that type of experience in a third-
round game?  
COACH IZZO: I think people asked me yesterday about the chip on your shoulder
because we beat them last year but these guys lost about as much as you could
lose last year if you have 16 years or 18 years straight of a senior class
going to a Final Four. And I know that record was meant to be broken, nobody's
done that throughout their career, so it wasn't -- I mean, it wasn't the
record that was earth shattering to me but it was to them that they were part
of the group that didn't so I think these guys had a lot more to play for than
people give them credit. And to watch them and listen to our former guys, like
they said today, I think that's a driving force you should have. I can't tell
you how good I think Virginia is. I do not think they played well today for
Virginia. I guess we get a little credit for that, but it's just one of those
days some guys miss some shots, it happens. It's happened to us. But we've
been a team all year that has banged around, probably lost more games than we
should have just because of the free throw situation or dumb coaching with
two, three seconds left to go in the game and people hitting 3s and tying it.
But I think we've had to earn every single thing we've gotten because every
game's been like that. So I think they felt comfortable in a game because
that's the way not their whole tournament has gone or the Big Ten tournament,
their whole season has gone that way. I'm just, I'm really proud of this team.
I don't use that word lightly when I speak and I am.  
  
 Q. You look at Travis' development from last year to this year, you
said he missed a few summers. Was there anything else that's led to what he's
been able to do as a senior?  
COACH IZZO: You know, I honestly believe the summer he's talking about, I
mean, I think it was his first -- you've got to realize he's 6-1 and a buck 50
when he started. He got up to about 172 or 3 and then that summer he got
really sick. It was a virus of some kind, they didn't know. I was worried
about his life for a while and it totaled him for the whole summer and he went
down I think to 148 pounds. Then the next summer he had a couple injuries,
too. He had a concussion. When you miss that much time, you can't get
stronger, either. So this summer, if you looked at the spring, summer and
fall, he had the best summer ever and I think I wore him down a little bit by
the middle of December because we just played him to death at the point and
guarding the best player, and we had some injuries then when we didn't have
any subs in the perimeter and he went through a little bit of a tough time
when I made the lineup change. I think it helped him because Tum took some of
that pressure off of him and it let him be a scorer and now he can do both. I
can't say enough about the job he's done but he has done it the old fashioned
way, he's earned it. He's a gym rat, his dad's a coach, his mother was an
athlete. Great family. When I didn't start him, I called his dad and he said
yeah, I didn't start some guys on my team, either. Everybody gets it. When he
says winning is the most important, winning is the most important.

_CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

MICHIGAN STATE - 60  
VIRGINIA - 54

MODERATOR: We're ready to begin with the University of Virginia.  
  
COACH BENNETT: A very physical game the way we started. There's a little bit
of a pattern or a trend for us, later in the year our starts hurt us, and when
the Trice young man had 13 I think of their first 15, we dug ourselves a hole.
After that first five minutes, it wasn't a matter of heart or effort. I
thought our guys laid it on the line, but when we needed a key stop or a
bucket to be made, it wasn't there. If you look at it, we took 17 more shots
than they did. We had trouble finishing and trouble making shots and then
there's a key breakdown. And again Michigan State, they're playing good ball
right now, they're very tough and they've got some guys who made some big
plays in that setting. Stings right now, of course, the finality of the season
after we've had a heck of a year with these guys, what they've done, but it
just leaves that feeling that you wish you could have taken it further. But it
doesn't take away when all the dust settles what was accomplished, and we give
thanks for that but certainly learn from what took place.  
  
MODERATOR: Questions for Justin, Malcolm.  
  
Q. Justin, can you talk about Branden Dawson's impact on this game
inside, in the paint, and what he was able to do and how difficult he was for
you?  
JUSTIN ANDERSON: We knew the challenge that he presented to any basketball
team, his ability to rebound, his ability to pound on the inside and tough
fade away jumpers. He's a very complete player down there. I think early we
didn't match his energy but we did a great job getting back to who we were and
I think we did a solid job on him. I'm not sure about the numbers, but he's a
tough player.  
  
Q. You guys, Coach mentioned that trend of slow starts but your defense
keeps you in those games. How do you balance even with your defensive playing
well all year, when you don't have that offensive consistency? How do you get
that back and the defense sparks the offense, especially the last two losses
that wasn't there consistently enough on offense?  
MALCOLM BROGDON: I think it's about what Coach Bennett said earlier, getting
off to a good start, whether it's being sure-handed with the ball or not
having defensive breakdowns. Our defense does lead to our offense but when
you're having defensive breakdowns and you can't get stops and you're having
trouble seeing the ball through the net, then you're going to struggle, so
offensively I think that's why we struggled a little bit.  
  
Q. For Malcolm, why was Trice able to have that hot start?  
MALCOLM BROGDON: I don't think we made him uncomfortable. I thought he was too
comfortable at the very beginning. Losing him in transition and just not
pushing him out of his comfort zone. When players that can score at that level
get comfortable, then they're going to knock down a lot of shots.  
  
Q. What did Michigan State do defensively to you guys that contributed
to your 29 percent shooting tonight?  
MALCOLM BROGDON: You know, I think they play a similar pack defense. I think
they jam the lane and then they -- when we come up our down screens, which is
a staple in our offense, they swipe the gap really hard, which I thought led
us, disrupted us a little bit more than we should have let it. We just got a
little bit out of chemistry.  
  
Q. Justin, there were a couple sequences in the second half where I
think you were down 2 and maybe 3 and had an opportunity to get back there.
Did you feel like the breakthrough was coming, at some point you were going to
catch up and take the lead?  
JUSTIN ANDERSON: Yeah, I didn't have a doubt in my mind throughout the course
of that game that we weren't going to win that game. This team's resiliency
and ability to fighting no matter what the circumstance may be, I just knew
that collectively we had our heads in and we knew what we had to do to try to
fight back. It hurts, when you pull that close in the second half and maybe
they get a big shot, a big bucket, or whatever the case may be, it really
hurts because we know how hard we have to fight to get back when we dig
ourself in a hole like that.  
  
Q. Malcolm, could you talk about that as a team 2 for 17 3-point
shooting and some of your 3-point difficulties here?  
MALCOLM BROGDON: I thought offensively we were just a little out of rhythm and
it's hard to not gun 3s when you don't see one go through the net. We just
struggled in that way. Michigan State played good defense.  
  
MODERATOR: Any other questions for Justin or Malcolm? Okay, thanks guys.
Congratulations, great year. Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. Tony, did you feel the defense and rebounding were good enough had it
been a decent offensive day to win this game?  
COACH BENNETT: I think so. Michigan State, I thought early we were bailing
them out with our offense. You have to shift them. I mean, they're like us,
they're standing in the elbows and they're really jammed in there, and the
ball has to shift, you can't just stand one pass and either throw it inside
and the defense hasn't moved. And the ability to move the defense and be
physical and finish and we had a lot of opportunities. You look at our
offensive rebounds, 18 of them, we got some in there. We just had trouble
finishing. It's not like they're huge. I thought when we settled in, we moved
them better and got some looks, but the percentages, whether the key free
throw here or there, the 3-pointer shots, and then finishing, your defense can
only hang in there so long. It was enough, but not the start. To mention, you
asked a question about Trice, he hit some tough ones early, too, a couple real
tough ones that got him going and a couple times, we didn't have that many
turnovers but the three of them were crucial because we call them live ball
turnovers, they're the ones that, boom, got them going, they run out and got
points off of them. That hurt because we didn't shift the defense right away
and attack.  
  
Q. Same question about Branden Dawson. Early on he seemed to really
impact the paint defensively especially and that altered things a little
bit?  
COACH BENNETT: Yeah. I think his eyes light up when he sees Virginia because
he was terrific last year and he's was good again. He is so athletic and so
strong and our guys had trouble finishing. That's where you have to be able to
use fakes, draw fouls and do things. He was a man, he made some tough shots,
blocked shots, got on the glass. And you can see why he's at good as he is,
and he plays well in big games. He's done that twice on a big stage.  
  
Q. Can you talk about that fourth foul on Atkins with eight minutes to
go and maybe how that changed the momentum?  
COACH BENNETT: What was the score at that time? Six point game? It looked like
a clean block. When you're clawing and trying, scrapping, trying to get back
in it, you need everything to go well for you and go right. That hurt. Then
there was -- that was at the end of the shot clock right there. Seemed like
there was a little bit of a momentum shift there but that certainly hurt us.
Maybe when I watch the tape, I'll realize that I overreacted to it but I
thought it was a good block and again, we needed everything at that time.  
  
Q. You mentioned Branden Dawson from last season. In this game did you
see anything, the difficulties you had were similar or reminiscent to the
problems you had facing them last season? I know it's a different season,
different players.  
COACH BENNETT: Honestly, I'm not sure. I think he made some tough shots
against us last year. We tried to match-up Darion Atkins on him, our most
athletic, lively defender. Last year I think he had 24-10. He was timely,
that's the thing. He was timely. He probably impacted the game more
defensively this year than he did last year. Everything he did was timely at
the right times.  
  
Q. Tony, obviously you referred to being a little bit out of sorts
early?  
COACH BENNETT: Yeah.  
  
Q. What was the deal on that timeout where they were going to review it?
I thought you guys were thinking they would take a point off the board and
they added putting one on it. What happened there?  
COACH BENNETT: Nice call, right? He said both of them were 3s. They had those
in, they were checking them. We didn't call the timeout for them to check it,
we called the timeout to try to get ourselves going. But they reviewed both of
their 3-pointers. My staff said his foot was on the line on the second one at
the top of the key. Then they went back and saw it. They put the review in
before and both were 3s, so that was what it was.  
  
Q. Just when I asked the players, when you're getting the stops, it
seemed the first half you guys were playing good defense, you just couldn't
finish, after the initial run. How do you get them, if the defense isn't spark
being the offense, what next?  
COACH BENNETT: It's a challenge, we got some shots, we got some offensive
rebounds. We're not the greatest offensive team, we don't have tremendous
shooting, so that's why I said let's shift the ball. We decided to make a
concerted effort to pound it inside, we got a few things there. We got some
good looks, but when you're that cold, hard to beat a team like Michigan
State. You have to be able to, and again I think after the start our defense
rallied enough, except for a couple key possessions, but you have to be able
to make some plays. Trice made them for them, Dawson made them. We couldn't
get those. Again, there was a better effort in the second half to get it
moving and get it closer but that puts a lot of pressure on you.  
  
Q. You talked about Dawson, how he played great this year and last year.
How about Trice though, his development from last year to this year?  
COACH BENNETT: Good player. He has the ability to create shots, make shots.
When you can stretch the defense like that. He's complete, he can score at all
three levels. Off the drive, off the pull-up or deep 3s. It was a dagger 3,
the one he hit at the end of the shot clock. It looked like it was an NBA 3.
We should have known that, we saw it against Belmont most of the game but he
drilled one. And again, like Dawson, those two, they were the deal. Valentine,
I think their big three, we did a good job on Valentine, but didn't really do
the job we needed to do to be successful against Trice. And as poor as we shot
and all those things, we still had a chance, and we tried to hang in there
with it, but when you got a guy like Trice, making those plays down the
stretch, that's what makes you advance in this tournament.  
  
MODERATOR: Any other questions for Coach?  
  
Q. What was your main focus at halftime? Did you feel pretty good
considering you hadn't played that well?  
COACH BENNETT: Offensively we said let's shift them, let's get the ball moving
and really attack. We got a couple good looks and we said defensively let's
try to keep them off the glass, avoid the runouts. Do what we do. There's no
magic formula at that time, a couple a little adjustments here and there. We
went with Evan again at the four, try to move them that way so at least there
would be some spacing. I was hoping we could either knock done a shot or open
up the lane a little more for some drives, which we got. But it was stay in
there, stay in there. We have been in this spot. Ironically, I think about 17
of our 34 games we've been down at halftime. So as much as we struggled, it
was still a two possession game. But they had a quick burst and we fought
back. It was typical of a lot of our games but just not enough. Because
they're so tough-minded, they're so good defensively, every start like that
was costly, especially in this game.  
  
Q. What was it defensively that Michigan State did that really didn't
allow Brogdon and Anderson really to get going?  
COACH BENNETT: Again, they jammed the lane, they played a similar defense kind
of that we did. Some of it we just missed some shots but they were in position
and they made you earn. When we did get the open looks we didn't capitalize. A
couple times we probably forced and didn't screen it well enough or move it
well enough. But you are going to have to outlast them. That's how our game
was against them last year. We probably didn't have as quite the outside
attack as last year without Joe, but it's just a physical, hard game and
there's not a lot of easy stuff there and that was the case again, we knew
that.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the decision to start Justin Anderson today after
having him come off the bench in previous games?  
COACH BENNETT: I thought he showed. He did a good job. I was really worried
about the match-ups. Evan would have had to guard Valentine, and I thought --
and when we played NC State we put Justin on Anthony Barber, Cat Barber, and
he did a really good job spreading out. And I thought okay, London can really
move and try to bother Trice, which Trice just got off to that start and we
liked Malcolm on Valentine. So we thought the match-ups were good. How Justin
played, and that probably, I don't know if it would have made a difference if
Evan was out there or not but I thought it was time.  
  
Q. You played Michigan State two years in a row now, how would you
compare this team to last year's team looking forward?  
COACH BENNETT: Yeah, they're playing good ball. Last year with Harris and
Payne they had probably a couple more big playability guys that could just go
get stuff. I'm missing someone, who's the senior? Yeah, Harris and Payne,
Appling, yeah. They had guys with that experience but they understand who they
are, they're very clear. They go through, it's Dawson's team, it's Trice's
team, you can see that, and Valentine. Those guys have a ton of experience.
They're not quite as explosive offensively but very sound, very tough, know
where they've got to go to get stuff. I think that's a fair assessment. And
defensively, very good.

_CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  
MODERATOR: We're about to start with the San Diego State student-athletes.  
  
 Q. This is for Dwayne and J.J. Coach Fisher's had a lot of success
building the program with transfers and we know what you guys have meant to
the program. What has it meant to you guys to come play at San Diego State and
for Coach Fisher?  
J.J. O'BRIEN: It's meant a lot. He recruited me out of high school and I chose
to go to Utah and just to have the opportunity when I transferred to come back
here. It was a blessing so I'm very fortunate to him. Especially to be a part
of something that's growing and to be here during those first years of
success, starting with Kawhi and started before that, too. To be a part of
three consecutive tournament appearances for me has been amazing. So I'm
blessed to be a part of it.  
  
DWAYNE POLEE II: I just want to say you can't forget AQ because he's also a
fifth year as well. Just to see what Steve Fisher built from the ground up is
something special and just to be a part of it, six straight tournament
appearances doesn't come around very often so just to be a part of something
special is a great feeling.  
  
AQEEL QUINN: Let them know, DP. It's been a fun experience just to know that
we left a legacy once our time here is done. That's something that will last
for ever. I mean, when we come back and we look up in the rafters and we see
banners and we know we're a part of that. It's just been a blessing, man, to
be a part of this and what a special group of guys and us three seniors, it
just means a lot.  
  
 Q. Can you take us through the last 48 hours and maybe tell us where
you ate so we won't go there?  
AQEEL QUINN: For lunch the day before yesterday, I had a turkey sandwich.
Right after that my stomach just, it was not feeling well. We came to the
shoot-around, I didn't feel good in shoot-around at all. I told Tom, I'm like,
I can't -- this is not right. So when I got back, started vomiting, got IVs
that whole night until like 3:00, 4:00 in the morning. Woke up, got another
IV. Didn't eat all day. Then came to the game. Tried to give it everything I
had, but then that second half it just wasn't right, so I told them I can't go
no more. And then last night I had another IV and we here now.  
  
 Q. Are you okay now?  
AQEEL QUINN: Pretty solid now.  
  
 Q. This is for all you guys. Coach Fisher turns 70 on Tuesday, don't
tell him I told you that, but he's very animated on the sidelines to this day,
always has been. Does he bring that energy all the time, is he always like
that in practice and everything?  
DWAYNE POLEE II: Yeah, he brings that energy every day in practice. Defensive
sliding, he'll be doing stretches with us, he's just really uplifting, he
brings a lot of energy to practice every day.  
  
J.J. O'BRIEN: Yeah, it's funny because when he wants you to do something, he's
going to act it out for you, so before he tells you what to do, he's acting
out himself, he's moving his feet real quick and everything. He moves pretty
well for a 70 year old man, I must say.  
  
 Q. On defense or offense?  
J.J. O'BRIEN: On defense, he does that a lot on defense.  
  
SKYLAR SPENCER: He's got a good stance on defense.  
  
J.J. O'BRIEN: How to get the hands up and cover the drive, so he's pretty
active.  
  
SKYLAR SPENCER: He's always animated and involved in our practices. He let's
the assistant coaches do their thing but he make sure he always puts his
input, he is never just going by quietly. You always hear him doing something.  
  
 Q. AQ -- he gave me permission to call him AQ.  
AQEEL QUINN: DP said the stretching part is the funniest to me. When we're
doing our stretching, when he's like just mimicking what we do, that's the
best part of practice to me the whole time. It's a good sight to see. It's
pretty funny to watch him. If you guys come out to practice right now, you'll
probably catch him doing a couple stretches.  
  
 Q. You for some of the bigs here, I guess Skylar especially and Dwayne,
you guys have great length, height and all that, but Okafor obviously is a
presence, a monster inside. How have you guys defended this season someone
who's got that kind of physical size?  
SKYLAR SPENCER: You have to control the paint. You can't let them overbear
you, take control of them. You have to always be aware, stay connected because
when you playing against a good big man, you rest for one second they can
catch you slipping, and that's an automatic 2 points, so I just have to be on
my toes and stay aware the whole time.  
  
 Q. J.J., I'll start with you, you talk about being special, about being
a part of this growing. A victory over Duke, what would that do for the legacy
that you're building?  
J.J. O'BRIEN: It would do a lot. Probably the most behind or close to the win
at Kansas, just program building wins that tell a lot about what kind of teams
we have, especially in the tournament to make it to the Sweet 16, that would
be huge. Coach Fisher had battles with Duke back in his Michigan days and
we're fortunate enough now to be a part of that year at San Diego State. It's
a big opportunity, man. They've got a great history, and to get a win would
mean a lot to our program.  
  
 Q. J.J., a question, you guys talked about hanging banners a little
earlier and obviously Sky's the only guy that's coming back next year but
earlier Coach Krzyzewski was talking about Marshall Plumlee and how big guys
maybe develop a little bit later than perimeter guys. I'm just wondering if
you three seniors could talk about Sky's development and him being one of the
guys to kind of carry that banner again next year?  
J.J. O'BRIEN: Sky came in with a natural ability to block shots, but he's
grown so much in that area just with his timing, his ability to block shots
without fouling, and also with his ability to alter shots. With his defensive
positioning, sometimes he doesn't even have to block a shot, helping outside
the lane, helping on pick and rolls, not letting the guard get by him so
defensively he's going in that area a lot. And offensively, I think a lot of
people have seen this year, he's had great post moves this year, he does a
good job catching and finishing, so overall I think he has grown a lot, and
just his maturity overall. He does everything right on the floor. There's few
times you're going to catch him not doing the right thing. He's very mature
about how he goes about playing defense, offense and just being a leader.  
  
AQEEL QUINN: I think Skylar, from the first year it was just blocking and then
he was like carrying minutes with DeShawn Stephens, and then last year he
played a lot, started. He was vocal on defense but he was there with shot
blocking. But now this year, what I've loved like more than anything is his
communication on the defensive end. We can actually hear him now, like years
previously we were like can you talk louder please so we can hear you. Now
he's like the main one screaming and yelling back there and it's so much
easier when you know he's back there and which way to jump on ball screens and
stuff like that. I just think the communication barrier is at an all-time high
right now, and I love it.  
  
DWAYNE POLEE II: Aside from the defense, I think Sky's grown a lot
offensively. I think that just gives us one more weapon, having Sky down low
to finish around the basket and grab offensive rebounds and just give us an
added weapon.  
  
 Q. This is for J.J. Since you brought up the Michigan days, what do
guys now, it's been a long time since the days of the Fab Five and Coach
Fisher playing Coach K's team in the championship game, what do guys know
about it, and do you guys ask questions about those days?  
J.J. O'BRIEN: We don't ask too many questions about it, but I think we all
know a lot about it. I mean, they had the whole documentary on it. They just
had the documentary on Christian Laettner the other day. It's in history and
if you're a basketball guy you know about it, just their battles, them
starting five freshmen and playing against them in the National Championship
game, so many opportunities that they played against them. We know a lot about
it but we don't speak too much about it.  
  
 Q. Maybe for AQ and J.J., is this a little bit similar to a couple
years ago when you guys played against McDonald's All-American five-star guys
and you guys really, I don't want to say, chip on your shoulder but you went
in there being not highly rated guys and kind of wanted to show the world
something is this a similar situation, I mean they have nine McDonald's All-
Americans and both of you guys weren't really highly recruited out of high
school and now you have a chance to play on the same floor with them?  
AQEEL QUINN: Are you talking about Jamal Jeter at the Hunter Center when we
played UCLA? That year it was pretty much the same. Like you said, Jamal Jeter
was the anchor of that team. You know Jamal Jeter's fiery and he plays with a
lot of passion. I think this year they do have a lot of McDonald All-Americans
and I think a lot of people in our locker room had developed as far as the
older guys and we have a couple young highly rated recruits that came in as
well. But we do have a lot of passion and heart. The experience will help us,
and we definitely are looking forward to this opportunity. As you said, we do
have a chip on our shoulder being San Diego State and we had to hold up that
mantra.  
  
J.J. O'BRIEN: Yeah, like he said, I think we're more now on the upswing of
getting more highly touted recruits with the freshman class that we had but we
don't compare with five as far as like they do right now. I mean, when we
tossed the basketball up, your starts don't really matter. I mean they're
proven great players, they're No. 1 seed but in the game we've just got to
worry about playing basketball. So it is a similar situation, but we just want
to win and move onto the next round. Five stars and McDonald's All-Americans
aren't really something we need to worry about. We just need to worry about
them as great players and do what we do as great players.  
  
MODERATOR: Any other questions? Thanks, guys. We're ready to begin with Coach
Fisher. Questions.  
  
 Q. Can we go back to December 2001 when you took the team back to
Cameron Indoor Stadium and how much when you're building that program, how
much that exposure meant to building the program, where it is now?  
COACH FISHER: We don't take bye games and that was a situation where the
longer I held out, the more money they offered us to go. I tried like the
Dickens to get Mike to give me a home and home and couldn't get that done, but
we robbed a bank to go there and we played well. We played well. We had Randy
Holcomb on that club and wound up going to the NCAA Tournament ourselves that
year and it was a great experience for us, for our kids, for the program, a
nationally televised game that was helpful in starting the growth of the
program.  
  
 Q. You're coming up on your 70th birthday. How have you been able to
maintain the fire that it takes to be able to maintain the kind of success you
have been able to build in college basketball?  
COACH FISHER: I don't feel 70, and I look in the mirror and I know I'm
approaching 70. If you do something you love to do, and I've said this before,
my dad was my first coach. That's all he wanted to do. A wife, four kids,
World War II, he did everything but student teach. I saw his passion for
coaching our little league team, and he told me, do something that you love to
do. Don't do something for money, do something you have a passion for and
opportunities and good things will happen.  
  
 Q. You talked about that being a great experience against Duke in 2001.
Can you talk about how far you've come? Now here you are, six straight
tournaments, you're playing them in the Round of 32, measuring up against one
of the blue bloods, one of the greats.  
COACH FISHER: Well, there's no question that Duke is one of the elite, and
that's where most of it, and I'm not demeaning us, aspire to get. They're less
than a handful that you could say that are at that level. We have a great
opportunity. We're here, we think we can win, and probably most people in the
country will not think that could happen but we're coming in to play and play
as hard as we can if we make shots. You know, you've followed us, underline
if. We're as good as most people in the country. We guard efficiently, we
guard collectively, and last night when we had open shots, we made them. We
need to do the same when we play Duke on Sunday.  
  
 Q. What would it do for the program as you talk about, you've built a
program; not a good team. You've built a program. What would it do in terms of
the next step beating Duke in the Round of 32, and also just to even be here
and no one thought you were going to go to Duke and win. There will be some
people that think you can beat this team tomorrow, that's where you guys have
come to.  
COACH FISHER: We've never been beyond the Sweet 16. I said that last year when
we lost to Arizona. San Diego State will eventually sometime, maybe not in my
lifetime, but we will have a team that will get to the Final Four, have a
chance to win a National Championship. To say that, now people don't laugh
when you say that so that's a neat feeling. A year ago when we went in to
Kansas and Allen Fieldhouse and won there, I know a lot of people said they
didn't win at Kansas, they couldn't do that. But we did. So we want to
continue to grow who we are, and this would be a huge opportunity to do that
in front of the whole world. I think we're the only game that's going to be on
when we play on Sunday and we'll have a lot of eyeballs on it and our goal and
hope is to play well and win.  
  
 Q. Steve, Coach Krzyzewski earlier was talking about Marshall Plumlee
and the development of big guys that usually comes later than perimeter guys.
I just wondered if you might speak to the development of Skylar Spencer and if
it's been easy for him to be overlooked in the mix of everything that's
happened.  
COACH FISHER: Skylar Spencer knows who he is. His signature is he's defender,
shot blocker, protects the rim. He has worked tremendously hard to grow an
offensive game. Last night he had some really, really good baskets for us
versus St. John's. We need for him to have confidence in his offense, but we
need to be -- need to have him as our Rock of Gibraltar defensively. He's a
terrific young guy that doesn't care if he doesn't get a lot of touches. But
he has to have the ability to draw a defender on him. They can't just walk
away from him, say he can't or won't score.  
  
 Q. Steve, how would you compare what you've done at San Diego State to
what you did at Michigan, and how have you built this program basically out of
nothing to what it is today?  
COACH FISHER: What happened in my first stop doesn't happen, and it happened
to me. It happened at a blue blood program, one that sometimes people say you
win because you're there and sometimes people are saying that about Duke now.
It's Duke, they're supposed to win. At San Diego State, we reenergized a
dormant program and took a program that had not had recent success and one
step, one block, one coffee shop to the 300 at the National Kiwanis meeting,
we drew an audience and we grew it because we got some players who helped us
win. And now we have one of the better programs not only on the west coast but
in the country and we're very proud of that. Four straight years, we've sold
the building out before the season began, we had won 29 straight at home
before we dropped one to Boise State. So we've worked hard at it. Been a lot
of people that have worked hard at it. It's been a community affair that has
allowed it to happen. The nice thing is, we still see an upward tic in trend
and I like that, too.  
  
 Q. Do you feel like you're not known for being this architect at San
Diego State or do you think people still know you as the coach of the Fab
Five?  
COACH FISHER: I would say probably that depends on your audience, on who
you're talking to. I walked into the hotel here where we're staying and people
looked at me and looked at me and, do I know you? Oh, yeah, I know you. Those
are the guys that remember me from yesterday. I went to the Final Four the
last two years, and they all know me as San Diego State coach now. I like the
fact that now when I go to the current people that are involved and they say
San Diego State when they point at me.  
  
 Q. Coach Krzyzewski described you as a friend. I'm curious how much
interaction you've had with him in the coaching circles over the years, away
from the court obviously?  
COACH FISHER: You know, it's a small fraternity relatively speaking and there
are no secrets. We all go to the same places to watch the same groups of kids,
these AAU programs. Mike has always been a guy, and I have great respect for
him as a basketball coach obviously, but the way he interacts with people is
something that everyone should take a look at and say that's how it's supposed
to be. So often you get a head coach that walks right by the assistants and up
to sit either by himself or with other head coaches. Mike has always gone out
of his way to shake hands, to sit and talk long before I became a head coach.
Got great respect for him. So I've known him for a long time. Our wives have
known one another through various functions and I call him a friend. I think I
said this outside, when I got the job at San Diego State, and I got a telegram
from Mike Krzyzewski, welcome back. People don't do that. He does it.  
  
 Q. It's been 23 years, I guess, since the national title game, the one
time you guys were in an NCAA Tournament game against each other. It's not
very often that coaches go 20 years, have the longevity to be around two of
them and have that happen. Is there going to be any special feeling going
against him all these years later after doing it once before?  
COACH FISHER: The excitement for me is we're playing, we're playing in the
NCAA Tournament, we won a game, we're in the Round of 32, we're playing a
great, great program but we'll be worrying about the players on the floor.
Mike is the architect and I think I would probably lose 10-9 in a game against
him, but he's not going to be playing, nor will I. But he's got a terrific
team and we're just happy that we're still playing and our happiness wants to
be still playing after the game.  
  
 Q. Rick Pitino was on the radio a few days ago, didn't like the one-
and-done, wants to see that eliminated. You've done it all different ways. Do
you like the one-and-done, do you think it should change and do you think it
will change at some point?  
COACH FISHER: I like the way it was before the one-and-done. I think if you're
talented enough and somebody's coming and saying we want you and we will pay
you millions to have you, they should be allowed to do it. I think -- I've
coached kids, we had a young player named Jerod Ward. If you're a junkie, you
know that name. Clinton, Mississippi. Came to us, who's better, Jerod Ward or
Felipe Lopez. Tore his ACL twice. Had he had the opportunity, he would have
gone to the NBA out of high school. I don't know how long he would have
played, but he would have had quite a bit of money. And I've said this before.
Nobody bats an eyeball when a 16 year old turns pro in tennis or other sports.
So there's value to be gotten obviously from going to college, but I don't
think you should say you have to stay X number of years if you're talented
enough.  
  
 Q. You talked about you guys need to make shots to win, I guess that's
pretty standard. But one guy didn't make shots last night, Win Shepard, he
contributes in other ways obviously. What has his growth been as a player
during his time there, where his emotions are a little different now as a
freshman when he's not having a great shooting night?  
COACH FISHER: When Winston Shepard signed with San Diego State, he was the
highest ranked player we had. With that came the pressure of expectations. He
played terrific as a freshman but people expected more. Started every game as
a sophomore, people expected more. He is our leading rebounder, he's our best
passer, he's one of our smartest players, he knows what to do and he's to the
point now where he's not worried about what others are thinking, and he's
playing to win, made great progress, and he is a huge piece to what we've done
over his three years to have the success that we've had. Winston's done a
great job for San Diego State.  
  
 Q. Steve, your first handful of years, how hard was it to attract top
players?  
COACH FISHER: Early on? When I took the job I heard from a lot of high school
coaches, and one, I tell this story. He said, I've got a player you need to
look at. He's not good enough to play for Rick Majerus, but I know he can play
for you. I said the last time I looked I'm in the league with Rick Majerus,
and I need guys that can play for Rick as well as me. I made a home visit with
Tyson Chandler my first year. Went pro right out of high school. We were
unafraid to go talk to people. The audience I got early on, they wanted me to
sign the Fab Five book. So we got audiences with people, some just wanted to
see who we were. Some of those guys went someplace else and we got some
bounce-backs early on. So we were unafraid to knock on doors but we said we
have to grow our program a certain way. Junior college transfers, four-year
college transfers and good high school players. This past year we signed four
high school players and it was the highest rated class we've had. We will
still take, like everybody does, like Duke, like Carolina, like Michigan
State, a transfer who can fit a niche and help you. So we now attract, we get
in the doors easier now. We've been smart to go into doors we thought we could
have an opportunity on, but I use the phrase, we don't have to get on kneepads
to get into your home to recruit your son and I like that.  
  
MODERATOR: Okay, thank you, Coach.

_CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  
MODERATOR: We are set to begin with the student-athletes from Michigan State.  
  
 Q. Branden, tell me what you remember from last year's Sweet 16 match-
up with Virginia when you had 24 and 10?  
BRANDEN DAWSON: Virginia's a great team. Last year was definitely a well-
fought game by both teams, but you know, they play hard, that's the main thing
they're going to do. They're great defensively, they're a disciplined team.
They don't make many mistakes and last year it was just a great game from both
teams.  
  
 Q. For Travis and/or Branden, could you talk about when Colby just
showed up way back when you guys were freshmen and how far he's come as part
of the program?  
TRAVIS TRICE: Colby since day one has fit in with our group. He is a great
asset to our team, you've seen lately he's been playing a lot and even
throughout this year he has really stepped up and played in some big games,
but he's just a great guy. He adds a different dynamic to our locker room and
he's always cracking jokes at everybody. Half the time we don't understand
what he's saying.  
  
BRANDEN DAWSON: Just like Travis stated before, Colby's been a huge impact
from our team since the first day he arrived. On the scout team we have a kid
named Eron Harris and those guys, they do a great job on the scout team. It's
funny because Colby and I, we're always getting into it in practice, we're
always just going at each other because he's always trying to score me, I'm
always trying to score him. He's been great since the first time he came.  
  
 Q. Question for both Travis and Branden. When you guys came here you
knew the situation with everybody who had played for Tom Izzo had been to one
Final Four. Obviously last year's class didn't. Can you talk a little bit
about the sense of urgency for you guys right now and how you want to keep
your season alive and what things do you have to do to keep your season
alive?  
TRAVIS TRICE: Definitely last year hurt, especially being so close, being in
the Elite Eight game, we felt like we were four minutes of making it to the
Final Four and keeping the streak alive. We feel like that is just added to
this year, we want to start that streak back up again and start our own. Both
of us, that was the reason why we came here to go to Final Fours and play in
championship games.  
  
BRANDEN DAWSON: Yes, I would definitely agree with Travis. Just for the senior
group not being able to make it to the Final Four last year, that's just for
motivation for us, for us to get back to another one as far as myself and
Travis, so I think from watching last year and learning what we did, what we
did wrong in the Elite Eight game, it just carries over to tomorrow's game and
the rest of the tournament.  
  
 Q. For all the players, what are some of the keys to attacking the pack
line defense and what has been kind of the focus point of your preparation
here the last 12 hours, I guess?  
DENZEL VALENTINE: Yeah, we just got to be solid on everything and be sharp
with all our cuts and everything. I think if we do what we do on offense and
we're sharp, we'll be fine.  
  
BRANDEN DAWSON: Yes, I think we just have to make just the simple play. We
just have to stay dialed in on our offense. We can't have too many mistakes
against a well defensive team like Virginia, so I think if we play solid, we
listen to coach game plan, I think we be okay.  
  
TRAVIS TRICE: I think we're going to shoot well. Virginia does a really good
job of really packing it in, like you said, and also their length helps them.
They start off 6'1, and after that they're 6'5 and up so I think the driving
kicks are going to be there, we're just going to play smart and not turn the
ball over.  
  
 Q. Travis and Denzel, this is likely to be a road environment in some
ways, it's close to Virginia. You guys dealt with that against Wisconsin, and
you guys played really well on the road this year dating back to Iowa, what
creates that dynamic? Why does that work so well for you guys this year, even
sometimes better than at home?  
DENZEL VALENTINE: Just because we just have the us against the world type of
mentality. We have to pull together and it's going to be tough, but at the end
of the day we're good enough players and we're close enough that when it gets
tough and when there's adversity we just band together. We can do this, we've
been play -- we played all the top teams in the country either at home or on
the road or at a neutral spot, so it's new because it's the NCAA Tournament,
but we've been here before.  
  
TRAVIS TRICE: What was the question again? Oh, road games. Yeah, I feel like
we play a lot better on the road, kind of like what Denzel said, we feel like
it's us against the world. You kind of take out all the distractions of family
tickets, friends trying to come to the game and all that. You just really bear
down and focus in, and that's when you really rely on your teammates.  
  
 Q. For Travis and Branden, could you just talk about your decision to
come here together and the roads you traveled after playing AAU ball and
everything and how it's gone for you so far?  
BRANDEN DAWSON: Well, it's ironic because when I made my decision and a couple
days after I made my decision I found out that Travis had committed, too. So
from playing AAU together since the 7th grade, it was great. He's like my
brother. We've been roommates since my freshman year, so it's been great. So
just playing along with Travis has been quite a long journey, it's been fun.  
  
TRAVIS TRICE: Definitely like BJ said, we're like brothers. It was a great day
when I found out he had committed here, too, that way I knew I would have
somebody I would be going through this with. And to be honest with you, it
wouldn't be the same if I hadn't been here without BJ, dude's like my brother
so I'm grateful we both got to come here.  
  
 Q. This is for all the guys, how much do you figure the games you guys
had against Wisconsin kind of prepares you for facing Virginia, seeing as how
they have similar styles?  
DENZEL VALENTINE: Yeah, they're a similar pace team and they've got kind of
the similar players but Virginia's a little bit more athletic and a little bit
more physical. We're just going to have to just go out there and just play our
game and be simple, make simple passes and not turn the ball over and I think
we'll be fine.  
  
BRANDEN DAWSON: Yeah, as I stated before, Virginia's a well-disciplined team
and just to compare them to Wisconsin, both teams are disciplined teams.
They're going -- the key fact that Coach pointed out to us, he said Virginia's
going to make you play defense for 35 seconds and that's what we're going to
have to stay dialed in because the minute you relax and the minute you turn
your head or something or you going to get beat by anything, a shot or back
door, so we have to stay dialed in and I think just stay poised.  
  
TRAVIS TRICE: I think both teams are very similar. I feel like Wisconsin kind
of spread you out more with the more shooters and kind of stretches it out
where Virginia is more of an inside team, but they run their stuff really
well, which causes problems where they might run their offense for 30 seconds
and then you fall asleep at the last second and they get a layup. So our thing
is we've just got to stay disciplined and stay locked in.  
  
 Q. Branden, last year you talk about defense but you guys held
Virginia, I think, 35 percent shooting last year to win. What did you do
defensively? And also do you feel like this Virginia team's going to come in
with a chip on their shoulder having lost to you guys and kind of increased
importance to be ready for this one?  
BRANDEN DAWSON: Yeah, I think they're definitely going to come in with a chip
on their shoulder. I know for a fact that they didn't forget about the game
last year. Last year, we had a good defensive team last year, we had Adreian
Payne, we had Gary, had Keith and as far as this team we have younger players.
So this year they're definitely going to come in ready to play, they're going
to come ready to play and they're going to definitely have a chip on their
shoulder so we're going to have to come ready to play and just be dialed in.  
  
 Q. Travis, the Virginia players said this week, they're pretty honest,
they said they noticed right away that there was a potential second round
match-up with Michigan State. They haven't really emphasized the revenge part
of it, but was that something you guys picked up on right away, that there's a
potential second round match-up with UVA or didn't look past the first one?  
TRAVIS TRICE: To be honest with you, at Michigan State we try to take it just
one game at a time. You can see throughout this tournament, if you start over
looking games you can get upset and we don't want to be one of those teams so
we just take it one game at a time but we know, it's definitely got to be a
revenge factor for them. It would be the same thing for us if a team put us
out last year.  
  
 Q. Did you notice it right away in the brackets?  
TRAVIS TRICE: Oh, yeah, you're obviously going to look in your section and
your part of the bracket, but our first concern was Georgia.  
  
 Q. This is for Denzel and if you guys want to answer and chime in, too.
Given Tom Izzo's history in this tournament, how well his teams have done,
does that give you guys any kind of -- is there kind of a mental bounce that
comes with it when March comes around that's maybe just really just a
psychological effect but it's not really anything that has changed, just kind
of knowing that his game plays good in March?  
DENZEL VALENTINE: Yeah, whenever you see Michigan State or whenever you think
about Michigan State history, you think about what have they done in March.
You go in the gym and there's all these banners, Final Four banners, Big Ten
championship banners. At Michigan State, we kind of expect to play good and
expect to win here. That being said, with Virginia coming in, we put them out
last year so they're going to have a championship on their shoulder and
they're going to be ready to play so we've just got to particular to our
principles and just know that we're Michigan State but also we've got to play
how we play and I think we'll be fine.  
  
 Q. What is it about Coach Izzo that makes him effective in tournament
settings, and quick turnarounds? Do you guys pick up on something about him
that makes him so kind uniquely successful?  
TRAVIS TRICE: I think our entire coaching staff deserves a lot of credit, and
our managers because they do such a good job of breaking down other teams and
film work. As far as preparing us for March and the tournament, I believe it's
a whole year thing. It's not like March comes around and we flip on a switch,
it starts with our first practices and our first games. We're not afraid to
play anybody anywhere and I think that shows. A couple times early on in the
season we might take a loss somewhere, and people will look down on us, but we
know it's only preparing us for this.  
  
BRANDEN DAWSON: Yes, I would definitely agree with Travis. Coach, he's been
through this plenty of times, so he know what to expect and he told us playing
Georgia yesterday, he said the first game is always going to be the toughest
game, we have to just get prepared. But around this time our coaches, our
managers, they do a great job of just getting us prepared, watching film,
waking up, early walk-thru's and everything. So Coach, he just wants to win,
that's main focus or us and for the program.  
  
 Q. What are your three thoughts about facing a No. 2 seed at this stage
of the tournament as opposed to maybe later, a bigger obstacle to advance, so
to speak?  
DENZEL VALENTINE: Yeah, you know, it's tough, we're in the third round and
we're already playing a 2 seed, a great team like Virginia, but it is what it
is. The tournament was set up like this for a reason and we're not, like
Travis said, we're not scared to play anybody at any time, to we're just
coming in with the mindset that we can win this game if we do what we do and
we're solid, so I think we'll be fine.  
  
BRANDEN DAWSON: Yeah, from the question earlier, from looking at our bracket,
we kind of had in our mind we were going to play Virginia, but like Travis
said, we just had to focus on Georgia. But this is what this tournament's
about, this is March and you're going to go up against any good team at this
point. So like these guys said before, we're ready to play anyone at this
point, this is what this tournament's about.  
  
TRAVIS TRICE: Like they said, it is what it is. If we didn't play them now we
would probably have to play them later on. Like we said, we're not scared to
play anybody. We're ready to play, Virginia's a great team, we're just
prepared to play.  
  
MODERATOR: Any other questions? Questions for Coach Izzo?  
  
 Q. Tom, could you talk a little bit about what you saw yesterday?
Especially talk about the second half with B.J. but throughout the game with
B.J. and Travis and where their sense of urgency is right now with the end of
their careers in sight?  
COACH IZZO: Well, I know Travis is off the charts. Every minute is important
to him. B.J. doesn't always show that as much, but I thought he was very
focused, when the game started, everybody handles that kind of excitement
differently. B.J., we talked to him about the pump fake, he went for the first
one and gets his second foul. So he had, what, 14 or 16 and 6 day but it was
all in the second half. He didn't score at all in the first and didn't play
many minutes. I think that's one of the big keys, we've got to keep B.J. in
the game and there's no question in B.J. and Trav, those guys have played on
an aircraft carrier, played in Germany, played in Sweet 16, Elite Eight games,
they've played in championship games and Big Ten tournament and Big Ten
conference. They're pretty well-schooled and those are the guys you rely on at
this time of year.  
  
 Q. So much is made this time of year of your success in tournaments and
in March and I'm curious as you go back to maybe earlier in your career, are
there things you have learned, sort of key lessons of how you get a team
ready, especially a second game in a setting like this?  
COACH IZZO: You know, I think in the second game turnarounds, I've got to give
credit to my best friend in the world, Steve Mariucci. Football looks at
things in video and film in a kind of a different way, especially 18 years
ago, I think they were far ahead of where basketball was at that time. I used
to go to as many camps and when he was at San Francisco, I would learn some
things there about different ways I wanted to prepare and kind of put my own
thing together there. We do things in 15 and 20 minute intervals, after a game
before breakfast, after breakfast, before lunch, after lunch. Trying to keep
the focus, which is very hard to do at this time of year, there's parents and
families on the hotel, there's games on TV, there's upsets happening, and I
know the attention span isn't as good when you're fatigued and tired. So we've
gone with this model. And then I stole from a lot of good coaches, Mike
Krzyzewski, stole some things from him on learning how to win the weekend,
that you do have to prepare once your program gets to a certain level. As I
told our media, the first year I just, I was so happy to win a game I didn't
care about the rest of the tournament. I thought I won the National
Championship and someone reminded me we won one game, but that's how it was
early. Once we got to a Final Four, you realize you go to win the weekend. You
have to prepare that way, you have to make sure your players understand that
it's one game at a time, but you're in a place where if we don't win two games
and come back successful, it's not as good. I've stolen from a lot of
different people. I haven't come up with some diabolical plan, most of my
plans have been stolen from other people.  
  
 Q. Talk about playing Virginia so soon after meeting them last year and
that jump out at you as soon as you saw the bracket?  
COACH IZZO: Well, so soon; it's a year. That seems like a long time to me.
I've known Tony since he was a player, I've known his dad, I knew his uncle.
When I was a Division II guy. I just have always had the utmost respect. I've
been a fan of his and what he's accomplished and then watching what he's done
at Virginia, we played against them when I was an assistant when he was at
Green Bay, I watched what he did at Washington State and played against his
dad four times the year we won the National Championship. I mean, that should
be illegal to play against Dick that many times in a year because they're so
difficult to play against. What Tony has done is he stole some things, too,
I'm sure from his dad, from other people, but he's added his only little part.
I think offensively they're different, they run some great stuff. They're
disciplined but yet they can get out and go a little bit. I still think, first
thing I thought about when we got him again is why, you know, and then I
realized my AD is on the selection committee, so I was mad at him. But the
second thing was where is Anderson at because I don't think there's any
question this is a very good team, but they lost two very good players last
year, very good players, and we lost some good players, too. But Anderson, if
you watch him before he got hurt, I think was playing at a whole other level.
The other night I'm sure was reassuring to Tony that at least he's coming
back. The tournament, he didn't look as good but he looked a lot better the
other night and I know what that's like because we had Payne and Dawson last
year missed eight and nine games at the end of the year and then getting them
back is a whole another story. But great respect, I guess, would be the first
thing; appreciation for how hard his teams play and how solid they are.
They're about as mistake-free as a team on both ends of the court offensively
and defensively, you're going to earn your keep when you play them. He said
something to me last year, it was a war last year and I remember him walking
by and saying that's the way the game should be played, and you know what, I
felt the same way. It was a dogfight right to the end and I think both teams
played hard as well and hopefully it will be the same tomorrow.  
  
 Q. Kind of along those same lines, what do you remember from that back-
and-forth contest in last years Sweet 16 between Michigan State and
Virginia?  
COACH IZZO: One thing that makes me sad, Adreian Payne was pretty good and
he's gone. One thing makes me happy, Branden Dawson might have had the best
game of his career. He was very good. He made a lot of shots and he did a lot
of things but a couple of my best players struggled in that game. Keith
Appling, who had been hurt, struggled, but Gary Harris had a pretty good game
defensively but it was a little harder offensively. So I don't know, every
game's a new game, everybody reacts differently. It all comes down to the
match-ups and how you match up. My biggest concern is how we match up with the
size of their perimeter people more than their inside people. Their inside
people are strong and athletic and good, but their perimeter people, not only
in height but in girth, they're big, they're big. We're not as big there, so
I've got to figure out a way to, I don't know, work around that.  
  
 Q. Tom, this is likely to be a road atmosphere, you faced that against
Wisconsin in the Big Ten tournament. All year the personality of this team has
done well in that setting. Travis Trice's shooting numbers are significantly
better away. What is the personality of this team that's allowed that to
transpire?  
COACH IZZO: I don't know, we played Virginia and New York last year, which
wasn't a home game for us. Then we played UConn there. We have had good
practice in the NCAA tournament last few years. I do think when you're a
close-knit team and everybody gets along so well. We as a coaching staff, in
our video room here at the hotel and usually a lot of teams they eat and if
there's nothing there they're back off to their rooms. It will be a half hour
later and those guys are sitting there talking and doing things. It's an
unusually close group, 1 to 13. They all sit there and talk and laugh. I think
that's very positive and I think that's what being on the road does, it gives
you a sense of camaraderie and you kind of have an appreciation for a guy more
than just as a basketball player.  
  
 Q. Coach, I think a lot of people would say that you and Tony both
built the programs that you've built the right way. What does the right way
mean to you and what are some of the similarities between your program and the
one that Tony's trying to build?  
COACH IZZO: Well, I think No. 1, we both have incredible universities. I mean,
Judd Heathcote was very, very important to me and we had done a lot there. It
was a different era. When Magic came into our film room today and talked to
our team, there were some things that happened in the past, so when I say we
built it up recently, there was some things there, and this other guy from
Virginia named Sampson or something like that that was pretty good at
Virginia. So there were good perhaps there and solid and I think good
institutions, but I think part of our success has been president, AD, right on
down the list. We've really been solid there, especially in the last 10 years.
I think that's helped. But doing it the right way means we're just blue collar
guys. I know where Tony's from, he knows where I'm from. We're not far apart.
We're from places, I was a Division II guy, he was a Division I guy that was a
Division II school not many years before that. We kind of both came up as
being mentored by people that were very disciplined. Dick Bennett, Judd
Heathcote, we couldn't ask for better mentors. So I think that all helps.
We're not loaded with McDonald's All-Americans and things like some places but
we get good people who buy into what we want to do and I just marvel at the
job he's done in getting it back as quick as he's gotten it back. I have a lot
of respect for it and Tony's one of the guys in the profession that I would go
against recruiting every day because I know it would be up and up and he would
do a good job and there wouldn't be anybody ripping anybody, it would be fair
and that's the way I look at Tony Bennett. Great family, but a great guy
himself.  
  
 Q. Coach, I'm sure you've been in this situation before where you've
beaten a team in a tournament and you're going to play them again and there's
that chip on the shoulder that they're going to have coming in. What do you
say to your players in terms of mentally preparing for a team that's going to
come out with a little chip on their shoulder?  
COACH IZZO: Well, I don't know, I've got a chip on my shoulder every time I
play Duke, it sure as hell hasn't helped. You can look at that one of two
ways. I think for the most part any team that's missed as many free throws and
lost close games, we had a chip on our shoulder, too, but those things are all
great. If there's a lack of respect, if one school's talking junk about the
other school and all that, but you're not going to find that with these two
programs. Sure, they would have liked to have advanced last year, but kind of
like they went through a little bit this year, we had two key people out a lot
of games and we have been a higher seed and maybe there wouldn't have been
that match-up. I think, let's face it, they were a 1 seed 90 percent of the
year. So I think both programs know where each other's at and I don't know
what I would say to my players, you know. I don't think the pregame speech
will be, by the way, they've got a chip on their shoulder, and that wasn't
meant disrespectfully. But you get to this time of year, if you don't have a
chip on your shoulder, there's something wrong with you because my chip would
be if we won the National Championship, nobody's gone back-to-back, there's a
chip on your shoulder about that. If you haven't -- we got a little chip, we
thought we were a Final Four team, it broke a hell of a string for us last
year. This class last year was the first one that didn't go to a Final Four of
seniors. So I think Trice and Dawson and Valentine have a little chip, too.
But chip on your shoulder works more if you don't respect who you're playing
than it does if you do respect them. Good question but I don't have a good
answer for you.  
  
 Q. Rick Pitino was on the Dan Patrick show a few days ago talking about
that one and done rule, he doesn't like it, this is it should be changed. If
you could change that rule, would you, and how would you and do you think at
some point ultimately it will be changed?  
COACH IZZO: You know, I'm on a million different boards and I've been on
boards with the NBA and talking to them. No. 1, as we all know, it's
completely out of our hands. That's No. 1. Number 2, I get condemned for
acting -- if I could have five one and done guys tomorrow, I would take them,
okay? My biggest worry is what's happening to these guys. Like everything else
in the world, smoking cigarettes was cool, then after research of years and
years and years, it develops lung cancer. So we change our thoughts. We have
not researched where a large majority of these guys that come out early, one
year I think there were 70 some that came out, there's only 30 first round
picks and there's only 60 picks so that doesn't include -- so somebody's
getting fed a bunch of baloney. Especially for me at this point, I've had a
million chances to do a million things, it's not like I'm living every day --
if we get a guy back, I'm happy. If he goes to the pros, I'm even happier
because that will help my recruiting, sad as that is to say, more than winning
a National Championship, but I'm more worried about what happens to the kids
and I think everybody outside thinks it's the coach that's holding him back.
Some day, 10 years from now, there's going to be a study of how many kids came
out and ended up on the streets. That's the crime of this whole thing. There
is nothing wrong with being an apprentice. There is nothing wrong with being a
graduate assistant working your way up that way. In fact, there's some good
things for it. You know what, my buddy Mariucci and I, every time we get
together, the first thing we say is we both made a lot of money, we've had a
lot of success in different areas. God, I would die to go back to college. You
know, I really would, too. I think like a lot of my former players that are in
the NBA, it's a job. It's a nice job, but it's a job. College isn't a job and
I think so many kids are missing out. So I would take a completely different
approach, not what's best for the NBA, not what's best for the college, what
truly is best for the kid and how can we work around it. Is it the baseball
rule so LeBron can come out and the other guy has to go. I also worry that so
many of these kids go to school and they never get to enjoy it -- every shot
that's missed, does that mean that I'm not going to be able to come out. I
feel bad for them. I take a completely different look at it. Whether some
people think that's, think of the right word here since we're on TV, since
it's not -- some people think I'm just lying or really I'm looking out for my
own. Michigan State is going to be there if the kid leaves early or not. I'll
be there some of the time if a kid leaves early or not. It's the kid that is
going to lose out, and there's so many that have left because people have
convinced them to leave. Do I think it's healthy? No, and I think 99 percent
of the coaches, I think 99 percent of the NBA people, I just think there's
other people that get in there and that's where the problems are. But I'll do
it anyway. I'll take a four year guy, a two year guy, a two year guy and a one
year guy and if he can play it, it doesn't matter to me.  
  
 Q. I was wondering, you mentioned Magic speaking to the team. I was
wondering what his influence is like? Is he someone when March comes around
it's annually you'll let him address the team or is he like a trump card that
you pull out when you want a particular reaction or anything?  
COACH IZZO: No, he's actually boring because he's there all year long. He
comes back, his family still lives in Lansing. There's no trump card with
Earvin except he's one of the rare people in sports or maybe in the world that
has transcended time. You know, it doesn't matter if it's Tum Tum coming from
out of the country, everybody knows Magic Johnson. I've been blessed. I mean,
I'm telling you, the greatest thing that's happened to me at Michigan State is
he has supported us, I mean, he flies here from LA, he did it last year, he
did it the year before, he did it when I first started. He's kind of got an
annual thing now where he brings his dad, it's the coolest thing there is. He
sat there and when he talked to them today, I said to my assistants, they must
think I had a meeting with him before and gave him all these things to say
because he analyzed their team way better than I did. So it's just special for
me and I think it's special for my team that a man of his stature would take
the time on a regular basis. The negative is I can't use him as a trump card.
The positive is, I don't need to use him as a trump card because he's there
sometimes making a phone call, sometimes doing this, trying to help the
players out that went here. Boy, that's special, I promise you.  
  
 Q. In the last two games for Virginia they've given up the highest
shooting percentage to opponents that they've given up all year. As you watch
and analyze that, is that starting on the offensive end because of the quick
shots and not getting back or why do you see those numbers elevated?  
COACH IZZO: I don't know. We went into Wisconsin a couple weeks ago to play
there and they had the highest field goal percentage they've ever had
defensively both from the 3 and the 2 since I think Bo's been there and they
had us down 20. I think that happens once in a while. This tournament is all
about match-ups and styles. If somebody plays a certain style and it's a
little more effective in one way or another. I look at us and the last 10, 12
games, we've been very good defensively, too, but we're not rebounding the
ball as well. Sometimes we had foul trouble last night my best rebounder only
played 22 minutes. You look at a guy like Anderson and when he was out of the
lineup, that's a big guy out of the lineup both defensively and offensively.
So I don't know if there's reasons for it. I know this. There aren't many
coaches around the country that wake up feeling good about going against
Virginia's defense. I think it's more than just reputation. I think it's been
proven over time. Now if they had a slip up here and there, took a couple
quick shots, maybe the defense they're playing against gave them quick shots.
Tony's got a very disciplined system, discipline doesn't mean they just hold
the ball, it means they're going to get a good shot. Get it in 10 seconds,
maybe it's the other team isn't as good defensively, they're getting a quicker
shot. I don't know the reason, I just know this, they're awfully good
defensively and we're going to have for find ways to score and that's what
we're working on last night, today and tomorrow morning.  
  
 Q. This may be a little off the subject, forgive me if my memory's
fuzzy but were you involved in that game with Virginia that was canceled at
the Richmond Coliseum?  
COACH IZZO: Pete Gillen.  
  
 Q. Has that ever happened to you any other time?  
COACH IZZO: No, where I am from, an area in the UP where there's 11 months of
winter it should have happened a lot of times. In all honesty, it was amazing.
We were in Richmond and it got to about 65, 70 degrees there and I guess they
had ice underneath, it was a hockey arena. Our guys were slipping the first
half and we kind of went back and forth, we each went on runs that were
significant and I was talking to Craig Littlepage, I think what he did is when
they went on their run and went up on us, that's when they called the game. He
was hoping that that means they won but unfortunately they didn't. But Pete
and I, we both agreed on it, it was a tough situation but it was the right
thing to do, definitely the right thing to do.  
  
 Q. Tom, do you have to adjust your lineup to deal with their size, do
some things that you haven't done much this season?  
COACH IZZO: Well, maybe a little bit but we don't have enough bodies to adjust
it much. Could we play Branden at the 3, some, but we're always in trouble at
the 4 and 5. I think we'll make some adjustments, we'll cover some things but
I don't know if we'll make wholesale changes. And if I did, I wouldn't tell
you here, to be honest. I really think for the most part when you play 35, 36
whatever games we've played now for, it's not broke, why fix it. And it's not
been broke, we've been pretty solid against bigger teams, smaller teams,
sometimes free throws didn't go in and we lost for different reasons. This is
maybe we have an Iowa or a Maryland in our league that is very big and has big
wings, they're big but they're not as linebacker stylish as Virginia's are. So
maybe by halftime I'll be changing a lot of things but as it is right now
we're going to go what we have. I'm sure Tony's going to go with what he has
and should be a heck of a game. Hopefully it will be as good a game as I think
it could be.

_CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  
MODERATOR: We'll be starting with the Duke student-athletes Quinn Cook, Tyus
Jones, Justise Winslow.  
  
 Q. This is for Quinn and Tyus and Justise, too. Last night Coach talked
about how Quinn, you've shared that leadership role with a freshmen, and how a
lot of times freshmen need that go ahead to speak up. Can you talk about how
you guys have worked out that dynamic and it hasn't been a problem like it
might be for a lot of teams and kids?  
QUINN COOK: Definitely. One thing about our team, it's not just the
upperclassmen, the seniors, juniors doing all the leadership, the motivating.
A lot of times we have three freshmen on the floor at all times and even
Grayson has stepped up, which makes four. So we want to have leadership from
everybody and there's been times when I've been in a funk and either one of
these guys get on me telling me to step it up and that's one thing that makes
our team so special. We're close off the court so it translates on the court
so we can say whatever to each other and we can trust each other. It's not
just been myself. Amile, who's captain, everybody asks, played a part in being
a great leader this year.  
  
TYUS JONES: Quinn has been a great leader since day one, he's been a leader of
this team. But as a leader he told us coming in that everybody on the team can
be a leader, everyone can get on somebody, tell them pick it up or what they
did wrong and stuff like that. As the leader and captain of our team, for him
to say that it just gives you confidence and he made that known since day one.  
  
JUSTISE WINSLOW: Pretty much it's about keeping everybody accountable. Q's our
leader but at the same time if Q's not doing something right, then Tyus is
going to get on him. It's just about trusting, believing in each other, having
your brother's back and keeping everybody accountable.  
  
 Q. This is for Quinn first and then Tyus, and Justise can jump in after
that. San Diego State's a pretty good defensive team, seems like tempo's going
to be important for you guys to get the game going at a higher speed. Quinn,
what's going to be important for you guys to pay attention to in that
department?  
QUINN COOK: We have to play at our pace. I think they like to control the
tempo. They're a great defensive team, they're very long and they use their
length to their advantage. We still want to get in transition, get some early
3s, get Jah going, and I think the key did rebounding. Those guys are
humungous. I think if we can control the boards, and make those guys work, I
think we will be fine. Those guys are a heck of a team, they won some bigtime
games, especially last night against St. John's to advance. They're a
confident team and they're shooting the ball extremely well. We have to focus
on rebounding and it will be fine.  
  
TYUS JONES: Yeah, like Quinn said, they're a great defensive team so we know
that we're going to have to work on the offensive end and be sharp. But yeah,
we're going to have to keep them off the glass, hold them to one shot and then
try to get out like Quinn said and get some easy transition points and maybe
open things up for us. We've just got to be sharp and stay together, regroup,
not worry about last name. It's a new game, a new day, so we've just got to be
sharp and play Duke basketball.  
  
JUSTISE WINSLOW: Really just comes down to playing smart and playing our game,
push is when we can but at the same time know the time, know the situation,
know when to pull it back out. I think we'll do a great job of doing that, it
starts with the defensive rebound on the defensive end so we got to get that
first before we can run transition, but when we're playing in transition we're
pretty much unstoppable. With the way we can knock down 3s in transition, big
fellas on the floor, it just makes us real tough to beat.  
  
 Q. This is for Tyus and Justise, as freshmen talk about what it's been
like playing for Coach K and maybe one thing, one of the most important things
you've learned from him? And also you guys seem to be growing out your hair
all year, is that something that y'all talked about doing as a team or
something that you just ended up doing instinctively?  
MODERATOR: Coach K, then we'll deal with the hair.  
  
TYUS JONES: Playing under Coach has been great and that's a big reason why you
come to Duke, so you can learn from the best coach in the game. For myself
personally he's taught me just a lot, not even having to do with physical
skills on the basketball, but more leadership stuff, having to talk more, how
to control and run your team, just taught me how to be a better and more
complete point guard.  
  
JUSTISE WINSLOW: For me just as a freshman like Tyus said, one of the biggest
reasons you come to Duke is to play for Coach K. He's one of the best ever,
but just one of the biggest ways he's influenced my name is from the mental
aspect, mental preparation, mental focus. That's something that I kind of
lacked coming into my freshman year but just learning to be more consistent,
play consistent, be mentally consistent night in and night out is something
that Coach K has really taught me pretty well so far this year.  
  
QUINN COOK: I can speak on the hair. Justise, he had it when he first got here
and I was kind of growing mine out, so Matt started doing it and then Tyus and
Jah joined along, and Matt cut his. All the fans like it so we just kept it
going.  
  
 Q. For Justise and for Tyus, Rick Pitino, the Louisville coach came out
a few days talking about the one-and-done rule and he said should get rid of
that rule and top talent coming out of high school should probably be allowed
to go to the NBA if they can and players who go to college should probably
stay in college a few years. What do you guys think is fairest to you?  
JUSTISE WINSLOW: It's nothing we can really say, nobody can comment on that.
Whatever the rule is, that's what you've got to follow. Right now the rule is
right now one year. For a lot of players, if they're ready, they're going to
leave. But you just got to abide by the rule, whatever the rule is. Whatever
we think is fair, whatever, doesn't really matter. Just abiding by the rule is
the biggest thing.  
  
TYUS JONES: Yeah, same thing as Justise said. You've got to abide by the rules
no matter what. Players, we don't make the rules, so just kind of the new era.
10, 15 years ago, players were used to being able to come out right after high
school, but it's just something that's changed in this day and age.  
  
 Q. Do you wish you had a statement in that rule?  
JUSTISE WINSLOW: No, not really.  
  
TYUS JONES: Me, either. It's one of those things where you can't focus on it,
can't worry about it and that's -- personally that's not where our focus is at
this point.  
  
 Q. For Tyus and Justise, you talked about coming to Duke to learn from
Coach K. Can each of you talk about him and express the difference in your
game now as opposed to the beginning of the season, how much have you grown?  
TYUS JONES: I think I've grown, like I said earlier, just being a better,
complete point guard, just doing more of the leadership things. Coach has
taught me a lot with that as well as Quinn at the same time, just doing small
stuff like talking more at dead balls, bringing the team together, just making
sure everybody knows what play we're in, getting guys in the right spots.
Stuff like that, small stuff that you might not focus on in high school and
coming into college. He stresses that to me as the point guard. And like
Justise said, mentally, mentally how to approach the game, how to break down
defenses and reading defenses and stuff like that. That's what I feel I've
improved on the most.  
  
JUSTISE WINSLOW: The biggest thing that Coach K has been able to teach me
isn't anything physical like skill-wise but more mentally how to approach the
game whether it's through the game plan or scouting of your opponent. Like
Tyus said, it's really just a mental aspect, his leadership, his ability to
pass that down to us, but really just being able to focus and prepare for each
game, each practice and just the mental approach, learn how to defend ball
screens and those type of things has really been the biggest thing and biggest
advancement that Coach K's given to me.  
  
 Q. To Tyus, you and Jah decided you wanted to go to college together.
How hard was it to keep that pact and what led you to go to Duke?  
TYUS JONES: It wasn't that hard for us. People didn't believe us, but we were
in it one hundred percent together. We approached the recruiting process
together. We took visits at the same time. We talked daily about different
schools and stuff like that, ultimately Duke felt like home to us. Coach K, we
had all the trust in the world for him and the staff, and we loved the team
already. Duke was home and we're a hundred percent glad that we came here.  
  
 Q. For all three of you, do any of you know any of the San Diego State
players? Have you run across them anywhere, and if not, does that change
anything when you're playing a team that's knew?  
QUINN COOK: I know Winston Shepard just from the AAU circuit. We played on
Adidas AAU circuit, did camps together. So I know him. We all watch
basketball. We watched them play Arizona and Maui. We watched, myself and Tyus
watched them play against UNLV this year. We're fans of the game so we are
familiar with those guys and they're a great team. Coach Fisher does a heck of
a job.  
  
TYUS JONES: I don't know any of their players personally but like Quinn said,
we're fans of the game, so you know them through AAU in high school and
obviously from this year just watching college basketball, you see them play a
couple of times. Obviously you're just watching and observing. So we see them
and we're somewhat familiar with them, but on a personal note I don't know any
of their players close or anything like that.  
  
JUSTISE WINSLOW: Well, I know Winston Shepard just because he's from the
Huston area, just working out with him back home. Like they said, just being
fans of the game, you get to know a lot of players of a lot of the teams. Our
coaches do a great job of doing the scouting report on all the players so by
the time the game rolls around we're pretty familiar with all the teams.  
  
 Q. After the Notre Dame game, Coach K was pretty unhappy the way you
started the game and said he hoped you learned a lesson about having to
prepare and focus every timeout. Do you feel you've learned that lesson, is
that something you've got to be concerned about going on?  
JUSTISE WINSLOW: Definitely, we've got to learn to start better, have stronger
starts and just put a better 40-minute performance all together. We can't have
those lulls like we did yesterday in the second half where we let them get
back in the game, and if we can do that, start strong and play hard for 40
minutes, then we'll put ourselves in a great position to win.  
  
TYUS JONES: This is just a learning experience for us. This is something that
we can learn from and especially prior to the tournament, it's something that
we don't want to let happen again. So like Justise said, we've got to come out
the gate strong, focused and mentally prepared and be ready to go 40 minutes.  
  
QUINN COOK: Basically saying the same thing, just we can't spot a team 17, 18
points, especially in the postseason because guys are playing for their
season. I know seniors, they don't want their season to end and I think after
the Notre Dame loss, I think we kind of really realized that we are close to
the end, and we don't want the special teams to end our season, just starting
with attention to detail, sense of urgency for all 40 minutes.  
  
 Q. In that post-game press conference he said that he thought that you
guys took for granted what it takes mentally to prepare to win because you had
gone on that long win streak. Did you take that loss to Notre Dame, was that
fresh in your mind coming into the NCAA Tournament?  
QUINN COOK: I don't think so. I think we had a meeting after the game and we
didn't watch any film or anything of the loss. I mean, I just think it was
something that we knew what happened and we fought back and we had a chance to
win. So after, it's a new season. Coach said it was 0-0 and we just got
prepared for yesterday's game and we didn't have an opponent so it was a week
for us to really focus on ourselves, just get back in the right shape, get
back sharp the way we were because I don't think we were sharp as we were in
those 12 games, 13 games we were winning. So we kind of focused on ourselves
and just took it as one-and-done mentality.  
  
TYUS JONES: Yeah, just a lot of the same thoughts Quinn has, just we weren't
as sharp as we had been in the previous games. We played a really good game
versus NC State the night before so I think we came out a little bit more
relaxed and not as intense as we needed to be and it hurt us. We spotted them
15, 17 points and dug ourself a hole that we just weren't quite able to climb
out of.  
  
 Q. For Quinn, I'm interested, what's your perception of them? Obviously
they're not a college basketball blue blood but over the last five years
they've won just as many NCAA Tournament games as Duke has, I think they have
more players that have played in more NCAA Tournament games than on your
roster. Do you consider them a top 25 big-time school or are they just sort of
one of those other schools out there in the wilderness?  
QUINN COOK: They're here for a reason. Coach Fisher, he's obviously
experienced coaching the Fab Five, being in National Championship games,
actually winning the National Championship, going to the Elite Eight a couple
years ago. We respect those guys, they're a top 20 team, they're here for a
reason, they beat a great St. John's team that we played against and we
struggled with those St. John's guys and they were up the whole game. We
definitely respect those guys, they're here for a reason. We've got to prepare
the same way as we do for any team and I think we're doing a great job of that
and I know those guys will be ready.  
  
 Q. For the panel, does SDSU resemble anybody that you've played
already?  
QUINN COOK: They remind me a little bit of Virginia just the way they play
defense. Their length, they play at their own pace. And they're older, I think
they start three seniors, Polee, O'Brien and Quinn, juniors with Shepard and
the big guy. They're good. Chol, coming off the bench, they're extremely
talented and they play great defense, they play great defense and that's what
really sticks out to us. Defense wins games so we have to play defense just as
they do tomorrow.  
  
TYUS JONES: I agree with Quinn, they remind me a lot of Virginia just because
of how good a defensive team they are and their size and length. They've got
Polee and Shepard as a two and three and they're 6-7, 6-8, so when you've got
size like that, it's a hard match-up and it definitely gives you an advantage
so they remind me of Virginia just because of the size that they have.  
  
JUSTISE WINSLOW: Like they said, Virginia, with their length and ability to
control the pace and the tempo, that's the biggest thing that they do. Playing
at their speed and teams really have trouble with that, just their ability to
play defense and their length makes it really tough to score on them.  
  
 Q. I wanted to ask again about preparation last night, there was a lot
of talk about the balance between focus and looseness that you obviously don't
want to come out -- Quinn, you've been through everything, how do you keep the
team loose and focused at the same time?  
QUINN COOK: I mean, just be kids. I mean, we're all, you know, in college. I
mean, we want to have fun. We're not always in hotel room just talking
basketball. We want to be ourselves, that's how we stay loose. But also at the
end of the day when it's time to watch film and get prepared for the next
team. We take it seriously. On the way to games, it's all business, we're
never joking and laughing when it comes down to being prepared for the game.
We've been in some big time games this year and we created some good habits.
We don't play tight because we always remind ourselves that we've been here
before, especially with a younger team, that's the advantage we have, with the
amount of big games that these games have played in, it really helps us.  
  
MODERATOR: Okay, thank you. We're ready to begin with Coach Krzyzewski.  
  
 Q. Way back in December 2001, Coach Fisher was still building his
program and they came to Cameron Indoor Stadium for great exposure. Talk about
how far he's brought that program from that day?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Well, he's built a great program. San Diego State and their
community should be really -- should really value the fact that Steve's been
there. That's what we're going to face tomorrow. We're not going to face an
outstanding team; we're going to face an outstanding program. All the values
and principles that he brought there and developed, you know, after his first
year, his first year was difficult. Since then, he's brought in great kids who
played the game the right way. This team is no exception to it. It will be a
difficult game for us against Steve's team.  
  
 Q. You and Coach Fisher met a long time ago in the tournament and
you've been around coaching circles a long time. What is your relationship
with him? How much interaction, I know you have some common Midwest roots as
well.  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: We've been friends for a long time but before the
championship game in the early '90s, we're both old coaches who we got in it
for the right reasons and we're still in it for the right reasons. So he's a
good friend. He and his wife are good friends with my wife and I. He's just
been really good for basketball. I've enjoyed my friendship with him.  
  
 Q. Coach, Jah and Tyus wanted to go to college together. Do you recruit
them as individuals? How did you guys approach that or did you recruit them as
a pair?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: We really approached it, recruiting them, as individuals
because no matter what youngsters say, you can't be sure about that. But they
came on their visit together. Their families know each other really well
because of USA Basketball, and so we saw that connection. But the thing, if
one of them, if they were going to be true to that, if one of them didn't like
it, then the other one wasn't going to go. So obviously I'm glad it worked out
that way. We recruited them for a long time.  
  
 Q. Rick Pitino was on Dan Patrick show a few days ago, talking about
the one-and-done rule, doesn't like it. You've been able to adapt your program
to whatever system there is and done well with the one-and-done, but if you
had your way, would you change it? And do you think this is the best way for
the students?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Right now in college, a lot of students aren't completing
four years because they're getting out into the business world, so I think
there's a change anyway going on. Certainly in other sports, kids go all the
time. It really doesn't matter what I would want, it's what the players' union
and the NBA would decide on. I think the NBA would like two years. And the
counsel for the players' union came out a couple weeks ago, I don't know what
function this was at, but said that it didn't seem like they wanted the same
thing. They would even like kids to come right out of high school. We just
have to adapt to whatever's going to happen with the NBA and the players'
union. Really, it doesn't make any difference what we want, we have to adapt
to it.  
  
 Q. Just to follow up on that just a little bit, you've been through the
first third of your career where you never lost a guy early. Then you went
through another decade where you lost a few but kept a few, Battier, Redick
for four years. Now you have kind of been in this one-and-done era where
you've had a lot. Can you just talk about your career in that regard and how
much more difficult or is it more difficult now with this system?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: It's always difficult to get to the level of excellence that
we want no matter what the environment is. Basically it's up to us to adapt to
the environment and whatever culture is there and the rules. It's like running
a company. If you want to be a CEO for a long time, you had better adapt to
the changes that are occurring in business an the economy and international
relations and all that. So adaptability is the key thing. I'm also at a school
that allows me to adapt and the people, the infrastructure that we have in our
program and in our school and the leadership has allowed me to change
accordingly. But we've changed a lot over the years and we needed to. Now, I
don't think we've changed our values or our principles, but certainly the way
we recruit and how we play and how we interact with our guys continually
changes.  
  
 Q. Last night San Diego State shot the lights out from the 3, and I
think they scored the most points they have since February or January. How do
you prepare for that as this is a team normally that likes to muck it up but
now they're coming off an offensive outburst. Does that change how you
prepare?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: I think one of the things that changes is how Polee's
played. He was out for a long period of time and I think he's been back for
seven games or a small number of games. He was fantastic last night. And he
may be coming on. In other words, he may be regaining what he missed by being
out and then that gives them another 3-point shooter besides Shrigley and
Quinn and gives them even more depth. And you put more than one shooter out
there and it stretches and it gives O'Brien a chance to make more plays. So I
just think they're integrating him back into their system has helped immensely
and makes them a more difficult team to defend.  
  
 Q. Obviously not from here, so I'm a little bit confused how this
works. Is a Charlotte crowd a Duke crowd or is it going to be mixed tomorrow?
Because I heard a lot of Carolina, saw a lot of Carolina shirts last night.
Will the Virginia fans root for San Diego State? What do you expect in terms
of the crowd?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: I don't expect anything. You know, I expect to play San
Diego State. A crowd never influences us. We always play in front of a big
crowd and sometimes that crowd is for us, sometimes it's mixed, and sometimes
it's against us. I'm trying to figure out how to guard O'Brien, not how to
sell Duke shirts and dolls and all those types of things. I just hope we have
a great crowd, it's two tremendous games, four really outstanding programs.  
  
 Q. With the way they play defense, how important is getting your
transition game going going to be and what's the best way to go about that?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: I think St. John's is pretty good in transition, and I don't
think Quinn was up to par health-wise last night. I think they're a better
transition defense team than they showed last night, let's put it that way. I
think they're an outstanding defensive team for a number of reasons. One,
they're very athletic. Two, they have amazing length. Then they have
incredible experience and then they're deep. So they've done their thing a
long time with one another and then they have -- you can't practice against
length unless you have it. So I think you're surprised. I mean, kids can be
surprised with how long they are and how athletic they are. They're one of the
best defensive teams in the country and I think those four factors, a lot of
people can't matchup with that in putting a defense out on the court.  
  
 Q. You've talked a lot about Matt Jones as a guy who doesn't need the
ball as much on offense?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Right.  
  
 Q. How has he improved or changed your ball movement?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Well, Matt's helped us in every way. Before ball movement,
he's our best perimeter defender off the ball, and he's good on the ball also,
but he adds a toughness element. He hasn't been a consistent high percentage
shooter, but he's hit unbelievably big shots, and then he can streak but he
can also drive the ball. And then he can play where he doesn't take a shot and
he'll be all right. So the ball, the ball doesn't stop in his hands, it
usually moves to another good place. And then he can offensive rebound. Matt's
been a really good player for us and that's why he's been starting. I think
that lineup has helped, and then our two big guys coming off the bench,
Marshall and Amile have really improved during this last month.  
  
 Q. Coach K, Tyus and Justise talked about how much you have helped them
improve their game from a mental aspect. As freshmen. And as a Coach who has
been doing it for a long time, do you find it easier to relate to your younger
players or do you -- does it get easier as time goes on?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Well, no, it doesn't get easier. I think it doesn't get
harder, it's just always different. I mean, my middle daughter is here with
her three boys: Quinn, Rem and Caid and they're all different. She relates to
them in different ways and I think that's what you have to do with your
players. Tyus and Justise, they want to learn and they're capable. Their glass
is bigger as far as what you can fill it, you can give them more because
maturity- and then intellectually as a player, they can absorb more. And then
there's no stoppage because they believe in us. Not just me, but Jeff Capel
and Jon Scheyer and Nate James, so they're very willing learners. It's been
great coaching them because they give you energy. I think if you would ask any
teacher what class do they enjoy teaching the most, they would say the class
that wants to learn because it brings out more of your teaching. Those kids,
that's what they do, they're great kids to teach.  
  
 Q. You look at who Marshall has had to guard in practice throughout his
career: Miles, Mason, Jabari a little bit and Jah this year. How do you make
sure that, especially when he's going up against Jah, like, he doesn't get
frustrated or down on himself or just because that's a pretty tough assignment
for anyone to handle?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Yeah, it is, and also you're not getting like, even if you
did well in practice, there's no headline about that. It's a good observation.
I think we have to tell him how well he's doing. And then there's a point, big
guys come around at a different timeframe than the perimeter guys. This last
month he's just taken a giant step forward forward. Marshall is really a good
player right now. I do think throughout his career some of those times he was
hurt, and so that knocked him back, but playing against Jah, I think, has
helped him. I really think in practice when they're doing individual work,
playing against Sean Obi has helped, who's transferred and strong guy. Sean's
done a good job in practice sessions to be physical with Marshall and with
Amile and that's helped him.  
  
 Q. Mike, what about this tournament still surprises you? Like with the
way we started off this year with some of the 14-3 upsets, things like that.
Have you just seen it all before or are there still things that happen that
kind of take you back?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: No, I don't think you've ever seen -- you see different ways
to win and lose. I wish we didn't see a game starting at 10:45. I mean, I
can't even believe that that could happen. I can't believe that that could
happen. Could you? I mean, how did that happen, by the way? That's not right.
That's not right. But the tournament keeps growing and kids keep doing
magnificent things, some kids do things that aren't so magnificent which lead
to someone doing something magnificent. The tournament has -- everyone talks
about game pressure. When you get to the tournament, it's tournament pressure.
It's game pressure at the highest level. What that does creates even more
magical moments. We had tournament pressure on us last night when it got down
to 10 and Justise responded with three magnificent plays that gave us 8 points
and them none. So, like, that was a great moment because he was not -- he
hadn't been playing that well and then all of a sudden he was great. But the
pressure of the tournament can get to you. It can get you to perform high or
low. So there's always something new, always something new that's going on.  
  
 Q. Sort of piggybacking off that, you've been around the game a long
time, Austin Carr scored, I think, 61 points in an NCAA Tournament game. It's
a record that stood since, I believe, 1970. What are your thoughts about that
and do you think anyone is ever going to challenge a record like that?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: I think most records will eventually be beaten because they
just are, they just are. Nothing against Austin, he's pretty good. Wonder if
everyone knows who he is. Wonder if any players know who he is. Well, yeah,
they may not know anybody from the '80s. I have to be careful about that when
I make references, like is that out of date or whatever. But it will be broken
at some time just number of wins -- probably Coach Wooden's record will never
be broken, that's one that's -- that's pretty darn hard. But points, rebounds,
things like that, wins I think pretty good chance that they'll all be broken.

_CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  
MODERATOR: We'll have with us Justin Anderson and Anthony Gill.  
  
 Q. Justin, a lot has been made of your absence and how the team did and
how the team would do going forward. What are your thoughts on that and what
were your feelings about how your team did while you were out?  
JUSTIN ANDERSON: Wow, I think our team did a tremendous job without me. It
feels weird saying that, but I was still there cheering those guys on, it was
just a different role that I had to take. But our program is based on
something that's bigger than one player and I knew that we were going to be
very successful this season regardless of any one player or injuries that may
occur. I've had total confidence in my team since day one.  
  
 Q. For each of you guys, you need no more motivation ever in March but
you had this team last year and knocked out in the Sweet 16 at MSG. What does
it mean for you guys to have another shot?  
ANTHONY GILL: I just think it's a blessing to be in this position we're in.
We're not going to go into this game thinking of it as A revenge game or
anything like that. We are just going to go out there and play like we want to
continue to keep moving on in this tournament. Like I said, it's a blessing
for us to be here. We got knocked out by Michigan State last year, but, like I
said, we're not going to take it as a revenge game.  
  
JUSTIN ANDERSON: We're extremely hungry regardless of who we play, we know we
have an opportunity and that's what this is all about, March is all about an
opportunity and we're starting to see that on the highest level right now with
the upsets that are occurring and teams taking full advantage of their
opportunities. For us to sit here and dwell on what happened last year, it's
not going to help us win this game tomorrow so we're just going to accept what
we have to do and go in very hungry and try to come out on top.  
  
 Q. Anthony, I think it was 16 minutes left that you left that game last
year with the ankle injury. You guys were up. How difficult was that for you
to have to watch the end of that game, how was the post-game situation for you
and how much have you kind of envisioned getting an opportunity to turn things
around this year?  
ANTHONY GILL: You know, I think that that game last year was big for our
program, just to continue to make us hungry and want more for this program and
want more for each individual player. But I think personally I think I really
wanted to help my team out there and I wasn't able to perform the way that I
wanted to and I think that that really in a way made me a lot more hungry and
want to get better, just to know that I could have helped my team and I didn't
really do what I needed to do because of injury. So I think that if anything
it made me just a lot more hungry.  
  
JUSTIN ANDERSON: And that's one player that we actually did need at that
moment because he started off really well for us.  
  
 Q. What was your takeaway from playing Michigan State last year as far
as their style of play and how maybe better equipped will you be this year
having gone through it?  
JUSTIN ANDERSON: I think our team has realized that that was a total different
team that they had last year. You take away three guys that are playing at the
professional level, Keith Appling, Gary Harris and Adreian Payne, those are
three big-name players that had tremendous years for them last year. But this
team, we understand that their system is one that gets out in transition and
just like the teams we play in our conference, North Carolina, Louisville,
teams that like to run in transition, we have to get back and set our defense
is very important. And Valentine and Trice are playing at a high level this
year, they're stepping up and filling those shoes from the guys last year and
we have to make sure we keep constant ball pressure on them and not let them
get going offensively.  
  
ANTHONY GILL: I think it's going to be a physical game, especially in the post
they're really a physical team and we have to match that physicality from the
beginning and if we don't, we're going to find ourselves in a deficit. I think
Dawson and the other interior players that they have create some challenges
for us because of how physical they are and we're going to have to match that
physicality.  
  
 Q. Anthony, you said it was big for your program last year to play in a
game like that in Sweet 16, I think when you made the tournament you've made
four Sweet 16s in a row. You have to play teams like Michigan State. How big
for the program to get over that hump to beat teams like Michigan State
specifically with the history that they've had in the tournament?  
ANTHONY GILL: I think it's time for this program to take the next step. I
think that that means to go past the Sweet 16. I think we have the players to
be able to do that, we have the coaching staff, we have the system to be able
to do it and we all have the want-to and the will-to be able to do it. So it's
just up to us really and I think it will be great to bring something special
back to Charlottesville and to the UVA fans.  
  
JUSTIN ANDERSON: Yeah, it's definitely important to take the next step. Kind
of piggy-backing off of what Anthony says, we are going to try to stay hungry
and keep trying to achieve more. Last year we got to a point we were thankful,
satisfied that we got there but we want more. And hopefully this year we can
give ourselves that opportunity.  
  
 Q. Justin, a couple days ago you described Anthony admiringly as a
junkyard dog. Can you expand on that a little bit more given this match-up and
what he said about the physical nature of it? And just how important he is for
this team?  
JUSTIN ANDERSON: He's very physical. He thrives off of physicality of games
like this. Like I said, 15 and in is his wheelhouse, even though he can step
out and shoot the 3 in practice, but no one needs to know all of that. But
when he has it in the low post and he's taking his time, we have full
confidence in what he can do down there even defensively as well going against
guys like where he's going to have to see Dawson tomorrow, he's just an
animal, he's a beast, he's relentless we all respect him and we all know
that's what he's going to bring every night.  
  
 Q. For both guys, the post-game after last year's loss to Michigan
State, was that the most somber you've been and what sort of motivation was
that for not necessarily this game but for the season ahead?  
ANTHONY GILL: I think the biggest thing that hit me was we won't be able to
play with the seniors on the team anymore. I think having Joe Harris, Akil
Mitchell and Thomas Rogers and to no longer being able to play with them, I
think that was the biggest thing to hit me and I don't want my time with those
guys to end. I want to continue to keep playing with them, and I think when I
realized that was the last game I would be able to play with them, I think
that really hit home seeing them tearing up and things like that, I think that
was probably the biggest thing that impacted me and I don't want to see Darion
Atkins or Maleek Frazier or Rob Vozenilek go out like that and I just want to
continue to keep playing with them for as long as I can.  
  
JUSTIN ANDERSON: Anthony hit it right on the head, the senior class is always
their leadership and their ability to have an effect on the younger guys. I
know in particular being a guard, with much respect to Akil and Thomas, but
being a guard, Joe Harris kind of took me under his wing my freshman year and
kind of showed me the ropes and to realize that was my last game playing with
him and see how hard he did everything and how great he was at doing the
little things, he was kind of like my hero and it was sad for that day to come
and for us to lose the game that close that we really wanted, we thought we
had a chance to win, it was very emotional but at the same time it was very
hopeful because we understood that those guys laid a foundation that was going
to be one to compete with and we wanted to make sure that we wouldn't let them
down by this year and years to come.  
  
 Q. Anthony, is the physical match-up the type that you kind of relish
or look forward to as opposed to maybe a team that's more of a finesse type of
group or does it matter? I'm just curious?  
ANTHONY GILL: It doesn't really matter to me. I just think that I'm a physical
player, I like to draw contact and things of that nature, so depending on
whether they're going to be physical with me or they're not going to be
physical with me it doesn't really matter, I'm seeking the contact regardless.  
  
 Q. Last year they held you to I think 35 percent shooting. What did you
learn from that game against Michigan State and what do you got to do
differently this time around?  
JUSTIN ANDERSON: We've got to shoot the ball better. Maybe the rims in MSG
were a little tight, Carmelo Anthony wasn't even scoring that well on those
rims that year. But we feel good, we have confidence in our coaches, they
prepared us really well and we have full confidence in our offense. Even
though that stat was bad for us last year last season, hopefully I'm not
speaking too soon and something crazy like that happens tomorrow but we have
full confidence in our shooting and I think that we are going to come out with
that confidence.  
  
ANTHONY GILL: I think that we probably would have to execute on the offensive
end a lot better. I think we need to hit them with screens. They were physical
with us last year and we kind of took a step back and I think we need to come
out with the same physicality that they had last year with us and we need to
do it this year in this game, and just knowing the kind of team that they are,
they pride themselves on physicality and tough defense and we're going to have
to be ready for that.  
  
 Q. Could you guys talk a little bit about Brogdon, not just as a player
but he seems to be kind of an interesting guy, told me about his plan to wipe
out poverty, and he's got a lot of big plans after basketball, I guess. Can
you just talk about him as a person and as a player?  
JUSTIN ANDERSON: Well, he's different, and if I had -- and when I say that, it
could come off bad but I don't mean that at all. I wish I had an hour to talk
to you about how amazing he is on and off the court with his work ethic not
only on the court but in the classroom, with his interactions with people.
He's a great role model. He's someone that you want your son to look up to and
be around just because he's always setting the right example and he's working
as hard as he can to achieve whatever goals that he puts out for himself. I
wish I had more time to talk about just the little things that he does that
helps us grow as people and helps us grow as a basketball team and I think
that's what makes this group special is we have a lot of individuals like him.  
  
ANTHONY GILL: Like Justin said, he's an amazing person. I wish I had an hour
to talk to you. I get to live with him and just to be able to interact with
him on a daily basis is awesome. All of my roommates, it's just awesome to be
able to just do life with them and it's just great. If I had an hour to talk
to you, I would tell you a whole bunch of stories about him but I don't think
he would want me to put those stories in the media, so I'm just going to keep
my mouth closed on those.  
  
JUSTIN ANDERSON: Can you guys ask Anthony to name his roommates?  
  
ANTHONY GILL: My roommates are Darius Thompson, he's sitting out this year;
Devon Hall, London Perrantes; wow, I just went blank, and Malcolm. Did I
forget anybody?  
  
JUSTIN ANDERSON: DA.  
  
ANTHONY GILL: Darion Atkins, that's my favorite roommate.  
  
JUSTIN ANDERSON: Did you guys notice anything about that?  
  
ANTHONY GILL: Justin didn't live with us this year. He wanted to be outside
the basketball group. I think that speaks to his character and his lack of
teammate-ness.  
  
MODERATOR: Justin, rebuttal? Anyone else? Okay, on that note, thank you. _____  
  
 Q. As you look at the last two games, opponents have shot the highest
field goal percentage of the year against you. Is that starting offensively
with quick shots and getting sped up or do you see a different cause for
that?  
COACH BENNETT: Yeah, you always look at the quality of the shot, and against
Carolina they got some pretty good quality looks against us but they also hit
some tough shots. A good number of their guys were pretty well-contested.
There's good stretches. Even in the Belmont game, some of our breakdowns in
the Belmont game, we were playing them a little differently than other teams.
We were trying to stay at home more on the 3-point shooters so it did open up
maybe the lane for some drives and then some of their backcuts for layups.
Those were just break downs. But there's a enough contested shots but you want
to certainly not have that number go up, that's an important number for us, so
I don't know if our offenses dictated that as much as just some tough shots
being hit and then couple them with a few breakdowns or we talk about those
live ball turnovers that have hurt us. Didn't hurt us as much in the last
game, though.  
  
 Q. How big of a game is this for you guys not only because it's the
next game but because it's Michigan State and if you guys take that next step
as a program to get a marquee or a signature win like this, to get in the
Sweet 16 and hopefully further?  
COACH BENNETT: Yeah, Michigan State is a heck of a program, very good team,
excellent coach, and we know we'll have to play our best. As far as I don't
get too much into having to beat a marquee team. You play so many in the ACC
but just you want to advance. Any chance you can put yourself in an
opportunity to advance is significant. This is a very good team as a 7 seed
who's playing great. Seedings, throw them out, I said that before. But last
year they're the team that stopped us and they played real well, it was a heck
of a game. Again watching how well they're playing this year, I mean, if you
can beat a team that's playing at a high level, and certainly Michigan State,
that's great, but it's just about trying to advance, whether it's Michigan
State or someone else.  
  
 Q. What are some of the signature things that a Tom Izzo team does
better this time of year than January? Seems like his teams just keep getting
better and better as the years go on. What do you see that he does to improve
these guys for tournament play?  
COACH BENNETT: Yeah, I think well some of their staples, their ability to get
down the floor, I don't know if they improve that as the season goes but their
transition offense is terrific, how they will get rebounds, and off the pass
they're up the floor, and I think because they're so tough minded, that's who
he is, that's what he instills in his program. They really are -- they just
battle, you can see that. Of course they offensive rebound, that's something
they've always done. Those two things are there but they do them at a high
level but his players are good. Their three guys, Valentine, Trice and Dawson,
Dawson last year had 24-10 against us. He's got good players and he certainly
has them playing so hard and you just see it. His track record speaks for
itself, but their ability, you saw yesterday how they got some easy transition
buckets, how quick they're down the floor. Some teams in our league do that,
the Carolinas, some of those, certainly Duke, so your ability to as always try
to make them play against a set defense will be one of the keys. But I think
those two things and then just their toughness and their mindset that is part
of that program make them so effective come this time of the year.  
  
 Q. Rick Pitino was on Dan Patrick's show a few days ago talking about
the one-and-done rule, thinks it needs to be eliminated and has his own
suggestions. What do you think of that rule? Do you think it's outlived its
usefulness? Would you like to see change and how realistic is that?  
COACH BENNETT: When we get a one-and-done, I'll let you know, I don't have
much to say, I've never had one so I can't speak to that as much. It's hard. I
was fortunate to have some time in the NBA. It's hard to tell a young man, I
know other sports do it differently, but our formula's always been getting
more mature guys in the system. I don't have -- I was asked this last year a
couple times. I don't have a strong feel on it. Maybe I should because I can
take both sides of that. For guys, if there's the opportunity to go and play
at that level and take care of family and there's some security there, that's
a good opportunity. But I know when you go back and look at the draft, I just
go back to the draft and even some of the teams that you played against, just
seeing Grant Hill here, we were teammates on the Pan American team, so many
players, they were seniors, they were juniors. The strength of those teams
with maturity, I guess maybe in some ways we had an advantage because we've
been mature and a lot of other teams have been young. If there was -- if they
stayed longer -- is Coach Pitino saying there shouldn't be any rule or should
they have to stay longer? What was he suggesting?  
  
 Q. The LeBron level, the Okafor level talent can go straight to the
NBA, but if you go to college you probably have to stay a few years.  
COACH BENNETT: Yeah, I think if you did that, it certainly would strengthen
the depth of the college game just like maybe in the past in that regard.
Again, I don't have -- I haven't had a one-and-done, so I don't know. I said
this before, if they're going to allow the one-and-done rule, I get asked,
well, would you recruit a one-and-done guy? Of course, I would consider that
if we could get one but if you do that, you had better have the ability to
follow it up with another guy like that because that does -- I am amazed at
how programs that lose guys can just reshuffle or reload as they say and do
that.  
  
 Q. London yesterday hits the bucket in the lane in a 2-point game
earlier, they had made a run and he hits a 3-pointer from in front of your
bench. Do you ever tell him to shoot more? Just talk about what you're getting
from him from an offensive standpoint.  
COACH BENNETT: He's got such a good feel. The first game when Justin got hurt,
we played at NC State, we talked to him about trying to look to be assertive
more. I think he's got such good feel. Of course you encourage him. He knows
he has a green light to shoot the right kind of shots but if you take a guy
out of what's natural to him and make him into something that maybe he is not,
I think you have to be careful about that. That first game against NC State,
he was trying to be aggressive. I remember saying to him after that game just
be yourself, you take the shots from there, you know what's right, you know
you have a feel and I trust his feel and I think that's the biggest thing is
that I trust. If I need to whisper something in his ear, if I need to talk to
him, I will, but the game, he's such a classic point guard when you watch him
the way he's played. He understands the moment, when he needs to take the
shot, when he needs to get the guys the ball and that's really important. When
you have Malcolm or Justin, guys who are more geared to being aggressive, you
need a guy who understands that feel or can get it inside if we're not getting
touches, so I don't think I want to mess with that with him. I trust his feel,
as I said, or I can tell him hey, we can run a little action for him but he's
very timely with his shots.  
  
 Q. Touched upon a prior comment you made about the one-and-dones, and
you said you would consider that. It wasn't a we'll take a one-and-done in a
heartbeat. Kind of describe your philosophical approach to recruiting and I
was just talking to the players, they say a lot of the guys have the blue
collar, underdog mentality. Do you look for that in every single one of your
recruits? Say a one-and-done stud comes your way and maybe doesn't fit every
single one of those parameters, would you still take him?  
COACH BENNETT: Well, I haven't had a chance to recruit a one-and-done so I
don't know but there are a lot of guys that are that talented who are blue
collar and that hungry, of course. You don't want to take a guy, if you're not
sure about the character or if he just is -- it's just I'm not about trying to
-- I just want to use this as a touch point and I'm gone. You want a guy who
wants to come and be a part of making a team great, whether it's for a year or
two. We look for -- not everything has to be checked off the box, but we do
look for character first, we look for toughness, and so if there was a guy who
was that talented who was interested enough, absolutely I would go after that,
but if there was a guy that didn't fit, I would not go after that guy.  
  
 Q. When Coach Izzo was in here, he described your post-game encounter
last year at the Garden and said you remarked to him that's the way the game
is supposed to be played. The disappointment in the result aside, was there
kind of a mutual respect because of the way they played and was it almost like
looking in the mirror, that blue collar approach to Michigan State brings?  
COACH BENNETT: Yeah, I wouldn't say it's not -- I've said this, there's so
many different ways to play. I enjoyed that physical, it was tough, there
wasn't anything easy and it's just what I've been brought up on, I believe
what he believes and it was a hard-fought game. So again there's so many
different ways, but it wasn't -- that game was not sloppy, it was hard-fought.
Yeah, I think that's what I meant by that. What was the question part of that?
I kind of got off track.  
  
 Q. Was it almost like looking in the mirror?  
COACH BENNETT: Oh, yeah, yeah.  
  
 Q. You go way back with Izzo?  
COACH BENNETT: No, for sure. We're similar programs, they run more than us, of
course. They do different things, but I think we value a lot of the same
things. Like we talked about, you mentioned blue collar, just a tough mindset,
kind of that idea, the whole -- the cohesiveness, touching greatness in
concert with others, you need that. And you have to have talent, there's no
question. You guys can see that in their team, you can see it in our
individuals, but that ability to try to do something special and go beyond
requires a level of toughness on both ends of the floor, and guys that have
bought into that so I think we both subscribe to that idea.  
  
 Q. Justin Anderson, he's a guy maybe in the NBA next year. Just his
return and what it means because he looked pretty spry yesterday?  
COACH BENNETT: Yeah, it's good to see. Just to see him have a shot go in and
see him moving better and get a block, that was important. Everybody asks he
is he full strength? As much as he's missed, he can't be, but he is he
certainly closer and to see him have some success in that game and give us a
lift like that, I was really happy because I know how his attitude has been
unbelievable through this, but how much he's wanted to get out there and show
some, hey, I'm back and I can help this team in a positive matter and he did
that and he was so excited about helping the team. Yeah, he's very important,
we need all of our guys to be right.  
  
 Q. Tony, Tom Izzo said he wants his team to stay focused because he
knows you guys are going to run that shot clock down the screens and stay
focused throughout each possession. Are you stressing to your team because
watching them make or miss, it's two paces, sometimes the ball is hitting the
floor and they're at the other rim. You miss a shot, make a shot, get back on
defense against this team.  
COACH BENNETT: You have to, if you can't get back it can be a really long day
because again, I mentioned teams in our league that are like the Carolinas and
the Dukes and others, that discipline of doing that well. I mean, that's why I
said we're not the same, we don't go down the floor like that, but of course,
transition defense and that's why they've been good as of late. And when
they've had success even yesterday when they have got down the floor. Makes
misses on free throws that's kind of a discipline, something we know. That's
the first key, that's where our defense starts in the transition so you won't
see many better than I think the way Michigan State can go.  
  
 Q. When you saw the brackets come out and you -- obviously these are
the guys who put you out last year. Did you look at them and say, well, good
we're going to get another shot or were you like oh, it's Michigan State again
the second round? What was kind of your attitude when you saw that as you were
kind of maybe looking at the big picture?  
COACH BENNETT: Yeah, you usually look at your first game, all right, if we
win, Georgia, Michigan State. If we get by a dangerous Belmont team, we're
going to have our hands full. I watched Georgia play against Kentucky. I
haven't watched Michigan State in that Big Ten championship. Man, they're
playing really good basketball, you'll have to be at your best -- it's not
like oh, revenge, we have got to get that, or oh, it's just if we get here
then hopefully we can play at a better level than we did last time we saw
them.  
  
 Q. Coach, could you just talk a little bit about Brogdon not just as a
player and his competitive fire but just he seems to be a very unique
person.  
COACH BENNETT: Yeah, he sure is. I've said this before, he really is a great
ambassador for our program, for the University of Virginia and even for
college athletics. He's in the graduate school, the Batten School of
Leadership at UVA, which is just an incredible program. He's done so well
academically. He's a lot of what's right about this game and college
athletics. He's become a great leader this year, I love that. He's very
steady, humble, but competitive. One of the harder workers I've seen on his
game. I mean, you wouldn't look at him and say he's just this gifted natural
guy. He's gifted with his frame, his strength, his hands and all that but he's
kind of willed his way into being the player that he is, but I don't think
people realize how hard this guy works on his game and what he's done. Just
again, he's the whole package, he really is. He wasn't real highly recruited
coming out but that was an important get for us. I can remember seeing him at
the Peach Jam. He got hurt at the end of the year but he did some things, he
handles the moment well and his teammates love him. Those are the guys when
you have that saying, you know, a coach-led team can be good but a player-led
team has a chance to be very good or great, and I think he has that ability to
lead the team and the guys respond to him and he's making the most of his
college experience, he really is, from an athletic standpoint but certainly
from an academic standpoint, socially and all those things.  
  
 Q. I think we got a reminder last year when Gill went out how important
he is to this team. Can you just talk a little bit about what having him at
full strength in this match-up hopefully for the entire 40 minutes, how
important that is and just I guess the physical nature of their post players
against him?  
COACH BENNETT: Very important. That match-up was hard for us, we just didn't
-- Dawson had his way, they have Payne, they have Dawson and they have very
good players again. Anthony rolled his ankle in that game and we had a hard
time matching up, so we need Darion and Anthony and certainly Mike, Mike
didn't play as much in his last game but this is more of a traditional size,
traditional game. Whether it's Isaiah, we used Evan as the four. Our fours and
fives have to be right in this game, it is, because it's such a physical
rebounding game, there's a lot of ball screen, off ball screen set, they've
got to be sharp and showing and they've got to be engaged in what it will take
from a physical standpoint. And Anthony's one of our guys who can get on the
glass, can draw some fouls, he can manufacture some buckets if he has room and
I know certainly they'll be guarding him well and he's certainly a key and
when we've played well, he's been a part of that.

_CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

DUKE - 85  
ROBERT MORRIS - 56

COACH TOOLE: Obviously we want to congratulate Duke on their win. They're a
terrific team obviously, and made the night uncomfortable for us. I thought
our guys continued to battle regardless of score and I'm very proud of that.
Would have liked to have made a couple more shots or been a little more poised
offensively at times, but I thought we competed the way we wanted to compete.
But it wasn't enough.  
  
MODERATOR: Questions first for Rodney and Lucky.  
  
Q. For either one of the players, when you made the run there in the
second half, two part question, what did you do to be able to come that close
and what were you not able to sustain?  
LUCKY JONES: The way we played during that stretch, that's how we were
supposed to play for 40 minutes. We couldn't withstand that run. But hats off
to our team for pushing and still staying with it, still having the courage to
fight back and make the simple plays and the right plays. We did a great job
during that run.  
  
RODNEY PRYOR: We started to hit shots more in the second half, I think that
gave us energy on the defensive side. We were able to get stops, get out on
the break and make plays to get the run to, I think it was we got it down to
10 and we just didn't capitalize on the defensive end. When they went back on
their run we gambled a few times, I think, and they got out on a break and got
a few 3s, so we weren't able to get stops when we needed them.  
  
Q. Lucky, Robert Morris fans kind of gave you a nice round of applause
when you went out in the game for the final time. What were your emotions in
that moment going to the bench and you hear that? And also your thoughts on
Jahlil Okafor and what it's like playing him, you don't see guys like him in
your league.  
LUCKY JONES: Hats off to our fans. They're some of the most dedicated fans
you'll ever meet, thick or thin, win or lose, they're always there. I had a
great run at Robert Morris. I played as hard as I can for as long as I can.
And going off of Jahlil Okafor, he's a great player, one heck of a freshman
and I hope he do well at the next level.  
  
Q. For either of the players, the idea of coming in playing Duke in
Carolina has to be tough, but how does your expectations compare to what the
actual game felt like?  
RODNEY PRYOR: Obviously we expected to come in and compete, give ourselves a
chance to win the game. They had the home crowd advantage, but the energy in
the building just gives both teams energy, I believe, and we tried our best to
feed off their energy, stay poised, stay calm and things like that. So it was
fun playing out there.  
  
LUCKY JONES: I know my team enjoyed, you know, just being able to get this far
in the tournament. Winning that first game really gave us momentum and
confidence to come in here, give it our best. Win or lose, Robert Morris
really played hard this whole season to get to this point. Going off this
loss, it doesn't really define our season. We have some incredible guys in the
locker room and they're going to be back next year to do it again.  
  
Q. For either player, Duke came out, hit the first seven shots and nine
of the first 10, a really fast start. How difficult was it to maybe hold
composure there when they're seemingly making everything?  
LUCKY JONES: It wasn't that difficult. We just didn't finish when we needed to
finish. They had some wide open good looks and given those type of shooters,
especially Quinn Cook, who's one of their best 3-point shooters, those are
easy shots for him.  
  
RODNEY PRYOR: I think when the team get hot like that, you just make sure you
stay together, stay composed and try to get stops in a row and try to make
place on the offensive end to give ourselves a chance to get back in the
ballgame.  
  
MODERATOR: Thanks guys. Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. Coach, you guys didn't pull the ball out and try to grind the clock
down to five seconds on the shot clock or anything, you went ahead and played
it looked like. What were you trying -- what did you want your guys to do as
just play like you normally want to play?  
COACH TOOLE: They do such a great job of pressuring you. It's hard to hold the
ball. You can see at times where we were and trying to execute maybe some sets
or certain actions. They would take you out, all that stuff, so you have to be
able to make basketball plays. I really thought to start the game we got some
excellent looks. We missed four or five layups early in the game, that if
those go, it might be a little bit of a different game. I think it was 7-5 and
then it was 22-9 and I think we missed three or four layups in that span. If
you're looking at 22-15 or 22-17 maybe you're feeling a little bit better
about yourself but sometimes playing against guys that make you play faster
than you want, make you a little bit uncomfortable, you rush some of those
layups you normally would finish, that's why they're the 1 seed.  
  
Q. What does this situation coming in do as a teaching moment for some
of the younger guys going forward?  
COACH TOOLE: We just talked about that in the locker room. I said to them
especially some of our new guys, none of the guys on our roster had played an
NCAA game before Wednesday and some of our guys this is their first college
basketball season. What I tried to explain to them was one of the reasons that
we push so hard and we demand so much and hold you to such a high standard is
because these are the games that we want to compete it in, these are the games
we want to be in and we want to play better than we played tonight. And
sometimes players want to practice to prepare for the worst team on your
schedule and coaches want to practice like you're playing Duke. And so that's
the mentality and that's what we talked about, that these are the games that
we work so hard for in December because when you find yourself in this
situation you can't have any cracks, you can't have any chinks in your armor
because that's what they take advantage of, and you have to be so strong in
your plan and you have to be so together and so detailed that if you want to
be in these games you have got to be working at this year round and that's
what we try to explain to our guys who are coming back because that starts the
next two weeks when we get back to workouts and preparing for next season.  
  
MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

SAN DIEGO STATE - 76  
ST. JOHN'S - 64

MODERATOR: Coach Lavin will be joined by D'Angelo Harrison and Sir'Dominic
Pointer.  
  
COACH LAVIN: Just in terms of the game, foul trouble early clearly, you know,
affected our chances to be successful. Rysheed picking up that second so early
in the first half and that's when San Diego State put some distance. That's
when they kind of extended, went on their run. With him out and we fought back
some and cut it to 7, and we played them even for most of the second half
until late, so we were equal on the boards in the first half, shot 50 percent
in the first half. Their put-backs, second chance points in the first half is
where they were able to extend some, and then knock it in, in the seven 3s
also allowed them to extend. So the 3-point shooting in the first half and the
second-chance points is where they were able to put some distance between us
and them. But obviously we're a different team when Rysheed is on the floor,
and in the second half again we played them pretty much even until the very
end of the game. So big picture, just proud of this group of seniors taking us
on this ride, restoring pride in St. John's, getting us back to the NCAA
Tournament and representing the University in such a first-class manner and
all earning their college degrees. True to their character, they fought and
scraped and showed grit, fight, right to the last possession of the game. So
the most gratifying year of my coaching career because of the opportunity to
participate in this senior class' journey here at St. John's.  
  
MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes. Please raise your hand.  
  
Q. D'Angelo, how tough was it against their size without Chris? They're
going 6'7, 6'7, 6'8, 6'9, and you guys are playing all guards how difficult
was that?  
D'ANGELO HARRISON: It was tough but we didn't use that excuse. We did what we
can down low. You credit them, they've got some of the 50/50 balls and kicked
out for 3s in the beginning. They got off to a hot start. They were shooting
3s, we were daring them to shoot and they were making them. You credit them.
It was tough but we fought as hard was we could but it just wasn't enough
today.  
  
Q. Can you talk about what emotions you're feeling as you picked up your
fifth foul, walked off the floor and realized your career was going to end at
that moment?  
D'ANGELO HARRISON: No, just keep trying to do what I can to win the game.
Nobody was there to foul so I fouled. When I sat down that's when it hit me.
It's tough. I don't even know how to put it in words yet, but I owe this guy
my life, so I'll probably talk to him every day for the rest of my life,
that's just the kind of guy he is.  
  
Q. For Dom, after you got a couple of fouls early, how much did it take
away from your aggressiveness because you basically were the rim protecter
back there?  
SIR'DOMINIC POINTER: It didn't take away from my aggressiveness at all. I was
down there playing tough. The ball didn't bounce our way. A lot of times we
had the rebound in our hands, we slipped out of our hand and we gave them easy
layups like that. It was more the ball just didn't bounce our way.  
  
Q. D'Angelo, it looked like you talked to Winston there a little bit at
the end of the game. What did you guys say to each other?  
D'ANGELO HARRISON: Just continue to move forward. He played well, so just
continued success. That's my little brother, I talk to him every day, we're
all in a group text. Just saying keep moving forward and keep winning, win the
next game, it's important, for us.  
  
Q. For both of you guys, can you describe the way that when San Diego
State gets a second chance point, like after you've already gotten the stop
and then they get another chance, the way that that affects morale or spirit
or your ability to keep pushing?  
D'ANGELO HARRISON: It definitely hurts, but our goal was get the first rebound
but sometimes they're going to get the tip. I tried to do my best, when they
get it try to run up under them, try to grab it, too. They're just bigger than
us on some plays and sometimes you just can't do nothing about it.  
  
SIR'DOMINIC POINTER: Exactly what D'Angelo said. We did get our rebounding. We
were trying our best, the ball bounced their way a couple of times. Sometimes
we had, like I said we had the ball in our hands, we got tipped. Once it got
tipped around it, they a lot bigger so they longer, they get the rebound and
they put it back up. I wouldn't say it was deflating it until the end, but
more toward the end it hurt us.  
  
Q. If Chris is there, how different is today's game?  
D'ANGELO HARRISON: You could say the game would be different but we're an old
enough group that that wasn't a factor. We played without him, we played
without him before. I think we only lost one game when he wasn't out so I
think we're like 6-1 when he didn't play. We didn't use that as an excuse. I
mean, you can say it would be different, he's 6'9, does unique things. We
didn't use that excuse, we just tried to play hard.  
  
Q. For Dom, you had a stretch where you guys got back where you were
within 7 again and you were getting a lot of stops but you committed four
turnovers in five possessions. How frustrating was it to be there with a
chance and not be able to convert?  
SIR'DOMINIC POINTER: It's very tough but we just kept fighting through it. The
team, we don't let those turnovers affect us, we came out, we scratched it off
and kept playing. We started to come back at the end just we didn't have
enough guys.  
  
Q. I know that you guys are going out in a very well-respected class.
The last three games, you had three opportunities to do things that you had
never done before, beat Villanova, win a Big East tournament game, win a NCAA
tournament game. To have come up short on all three, how do you put that into
words?  
D'ANGELO HARRISON: That's a tough question, to be honest. We tried our best,
man. I couldn't do enough today. I played my hardest, I do what I could and we
just came up short. So you credit San Diego State, credit their coach. I mean,
it's tough, that's a tough question, I don't know how to answer that.  
  
SIR'DOMINIC POINTER: Like D'Angelo said, we played our hearts out and not
winning none of it was hard, but it happens. Like I said, we had a great year,
successful year as a team, our seniors played our hearts out, everybody played
our hearts out, that's all we can ask for.  
  
MODERATOR: Other questions for D'Angelo or Dom? Thanks, guys. Congratulations,
a great year. Questions for Coach Lavin.  
  
Q. Steve, I mean, it's the obvious thing's missing here, which is Chris,
and the number of second chance points that you mentioned. I mean, is this not
somewhat his, you know, his doing?  
COACH LAVIN: You know, it's interesting. If Rysheed doesn't get in foul
trouble, I think this is a game that comes right down to the wire. We knew San
Diego State was a very capable, you know, basketball team. They've had a great
run of success, six straight NCAA tournaments. But to me the defining or
turning point in this game was Rysheed picking up that second foul within the
first minute because he's been a catalyst in this run that allowed us to get
to the NCAA Tournament and the numbers bear that out, and even points in the
paint. We outscored them 40-30 with the points in the paint. Granted, there's
a plus 13 on the second chance points, so it's undeniable that their size was
a factor for them in terms of getting those second shots. But this group has
been successful without Chris. Ideally, we would have preferred to have Chris'
services today, but to me, when I look at the game, it was, when Rysheed
picked up that second foul because of the way he influences the game at both
ends of the court with his ball pressure, with his ability to put pressure on
defenses by breaking them down off the bounce, his playmaking ability,
finishing at the rim ability, drawing fouls. He's a real catalyst and a key
contributor to what we do at both ends of the floor, and he's one of the
better guard rebounders I've coached. When he went out with the second foul,
really the rest of the game was pretty equal until right there at the end
until we were in a situation where we were just fouling to try to get back
into the game. We cut it to 7, had multiple possessions but we never really
got back over the hump from the lead that they extended on us with Rysheed
out, even though I thought the group fought back admirably well given the
circumstances. And I thought the second biggest factor is Dom takes that spill
and he was just basically not the same. So now Obekpa is not with us,
Rysheed's in foul trouble and Dom goes down with the hip pointer. That just
now becomes too much to overcome, and we still fought back in spite of that,
had the ball on multiple occasions on the break and a couple possessions where
we can cut it to 5 or even to 4 if we hit a 3-pointer on one of those
possessions. So the group fought admirably well and I'm proud of them, but
those combinations, Rysheed and Dom being injured I thought was the difference
tonight given that we didn't have Chris with us.  
  
Q. Steve, if you had Obekpa for tonight, would you have opened in that
zone with Rysheed down low protecting against the guys 6'9, 6'10?  
COACH LAVIN: The hypotheticals are obviously, if we had Maurice Harkless
tonight or Jakarr Sampson or Amir Garrett, but I'm just proud of this group
and we got to give credit to San Diego State. They had a great season and they
played really well here tonight and we came up short but I thought the foul
trouble with Rysheed and then Dom's injury, the combination of those two made
it very tough on us tonight with the group we were competing with.  
  
Q. I know the game just ended, but is the door open on a return for
Chris Obekpa next season or do you expect that his time at St. John's is
done?  
COACH LAVIN: We'll get a chance next week to decompress and talk to one
another. We've texted the last couple days, we've been in communication and I
wouldn't be surprised at all if he doesn't return to St. John's.  
  
Q. Your post-season record at St. John's is 2-8. Why don't you think
it's better and how disappointing is that number for you?  
COACH LAVIN: We probably need about an hour and a half for that one, so I
won't, in fairness to the other writers who probably have deadlines tonight
I'm not even going to delve into that one because I have to talk about the
last five years, Harkless going pro, Sampson going pro. I'm just proud of this
group if they got us back to the NCAA Tournament and it's so rare to be able
to take two groups, the team we inherited from Norm Roberts, the team he left
behind, great character, they were such a special group, D.J. Kennedy because
they got us back after a decade in the dessert. D.J. Kennedy and Dwight Hardy,
Paris Horne, Justin Burrell, Sean Evans, Malike Boothe. Go right down the
list. That was a special group of seniors in my initial year at St. John's and
I was like a stepfather, as we all can appreciate. That's tough to do, coming
in as stepfather with someone else's kids, and they punched us back in the
tournament and then we had to start over with this wonderful group that now
got us back to the NCAA Tournament. Ideally I wish we finished in the Final
Four, cutting down the nets in the National Championship but they overcame a
number of things that you don't anticipate. We never thought Harkless would
leave after one year and lose Jakarr after two, and Amir Garrett to Major
League baseball. But these guys, the last of the Mohicans fought to their last
possession for St. John's, really represented the front of that jersey well.
And if we wanted to do an overview, comprehensive, sit down together, it would
be great to get a cup of coffee with you, Zack.  
  
Q. Your four seniors played 39 minutes tonight. You had a four or five
minute stretch in the second half where you your guys didn't score. Do you
think fatigue set in?  
COACH LAVIN: Those kids were so tuckered out, that's why I'm so proud of them.
The combination of Dom Pointer being injured, Rysheed Jordan being in foul
trouble and obviously we know we didn't have Chris Obekpa's services and yet
it's still a 7-point game with multiple possessions and a chance to cut it
inside of 7. These kids are super heros in my eyes. I look up to them and I
told them as much after the game. I've had 27 years in the business and I
probably admire this group more than any that I've coached and it's tough to
separate who's your favorite, I had some special groups along the way. This
one, because of what they had to overcome and where they started as the
youngest team in school history. Not the youngest team in the country but the
youngest thing in school history. And those things that we just talked about,
the number of kids along the way that decided to opt for the professional
route, which I can't fault them for, if I had a chance to play for the 76ers,
I would probably opt for that, too, if I was at that age and had that
opportunity, financial gain but it made it tougher and to me the story even
more remarkable of this group of seniors who will all earn their degrees. I'm
sure they were tired emotionally, physically. They gave everything they had to
this University and they gave us a special ride this year and took us back to
the tournament so couldn't be more proud of them. But they're probably a
little tuckered out.  
  
Q. Coach, you talked about how this is your most rewarding season as a
coach and we talked about these seniors and how they define St. John's and the
program going forward. How have they changed you as a coach going forward?  
COACH LAVIN: It's a unique group. The first year I didn't get to coach them
because of the cancer, so they arrived on campus and ended up playing for a
coach other than the one who recruited them. Right there, that's not something
they signed up for, yet they had a great attitude, they were eager to learn,
they worked their fannies off that first year and made progress. Then my
second year my father passed away. So any time you go through a battle with
cancer and losing someone so close to you, and this group, there's something
special about their character, their makeup, their demeanor. These phrases we
use in coaching and teaching and education, and they're just really a special
group. So I think their resiliency, their spirit inspires me. I mean, watching
that grit and that determination, that resolve, they were so resolute,
tenacious comes to mind as a word, they're just a tenacious group that would
not be denied, which, you know, which is why they're all going to earn their
degrees and why we're here tonight. I just wish we could have taken it
further. Obviously that's what makes it tough. It's kind of a bittersweet. It
comes to an end after a great run with this great group of kids. I wish we
could take it further but San Diego State played really well and we were short
handed and they deserve to move through the brackets and we're proud of what
we did. Now we go home and regroup.  
  
Q. This is another hypothetical question, I guess, but given Rysheed's
importance to the team, did you consider keeping him out there?  
COACH LAVIN: Yes, I did.  
  
Q. Or bringing him back early?  
COACH LAVIN: Yeah, in hindsight naturally as a coach, 20/20, but my concern
was that if he picked up a third or a fourth that maybe then we would look
back at the second half if he ended up fouling out, we didn't have him down
the stretch. But we definitely considered it and then we were staying -- I
didn't feel they were pulling enough, like you know, if it got past, if they
started to go double digits, it was 10, 12, 14, 16, I think I would have gone
back to him, but the fact that I felt we were right there within striking
distance, it ended up being a two, two and a half possession game at the half.
I thought we were in a good place, Dom's injury compounded it, because Dom was
dominating the game, but then after the hip he was not the same player. He
hung in there, didn't want to be taken out. The combination of no Chris
Obekpa, then Rysheed's foul trouble, if we didn't have all three of those
working against us maybe we get inside of 5 or 4 or 3 but it put us under
duress because we've shown we can beat everybody playing 6, 7 this year. But
we need all 6 of those 7. Now we're down basically to four. When Rysheed is on
the bench, there is no Obekpa, then Dom's injured. Essentially we're playing
four in a group of seven and that was a little too much for us to sustain
against a good team at this stage of the year.  
  
MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach.

_CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

SAN DIEGO STATE - 76  
ST. JOHN'S - 64

COACH FISHER: Tonight we beat a team that's very hard to guard, and we
statistically are a pretty good defensive team and we had a hard time keeping
them in front of us, especially in the first half. They had four guys play the
whole game and they would have had, Jordan probably would have played the
whole game had he not gotten two early fouls. So we thought we could create
tired legs, but we were the ones that got tired legs in stretches, but first
half we made some shots obviously and Polee and Matt combined to make a bunch
of 3s. When you do that, you've got a chance. When we score points, we've got
a chance. We score this many points, we've got a chance against anybody. St.
John's is well-schooled, they play hard and they were very difficult to keep
out of the transition game. But our guys did a nice job, I love the way we
compete and play for one another, so really good win for San Diego State and
we're glad that we're here and going to be playing another game on Sunday.  
  
MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes?  
  
 Q. This is for Dwayne. Dwayne, you came out and took seven shots
tonight, you hit five of them and hit three of them in the first five minutes
of the game, obviously you're feeling well coming out of the gate. Talk about
that a little bit.  
DWAYNE POLEE II: My teammates found me in positions where I could shoot the
ball. I found myself open a lot of times because, you know, we have a lot of
great players on this team. You know, Coach Fish, he just does a great job of
telling me to shoot your shot and I found myself wide open so I give a lot of
credit to my teammates as well.  
  
 Q. JJ, start with you first, can you talk about just kind of how
uncomfortable it was, this was definitely not the type of game that you guys
generally get drawn into, yet you were able to really score in bunches.  
J.J. O'BRIEN: Yeah, we haven't played a team like that all year. They do a
great job of pushing the tempo and they kind of imposed their will on us early
so we kind of had to slow it down and get back to our defense in the second
half. We did a good job of getting back to how we play, getting back to our
defense, getting inside and hit people on the outside or scoring inside. They
do a good job of that but we did a good job of adapting.  
  
 Q. Dwayne, how special was this for you to have this type of game
tonight in an NCAA Tournament given everything that you've been through health
wise?  
DWAYNE POLEE II: It's just a blessing, you know. I had a lot of positive
support around me, my teammates, the whole coaching staff, my family, my
girlfriend, they just stayed positive for me and that's the reason why I'm
here right now, just living by faith and just staying really positive. It felt
really good to have a good game in the first game of the tournament.  
  
 Q. Matt, you just kind of knew things weren't going well, you guys
weren't shooting. Like Coach said, when you guys score you probably can beat
anybody or at least be in the game. When you were getting hot right there, did
you know how important it was or how important it would be to score a lot of
points against these guys because they're tough to stop?  
MATT SHRIGLEY: Yeah, definitely. They push the ball and play a lot of
transition, that's a lot of their offense. Dwayne came out, making a lot of
shots. You kind of take it upon yourself to say, okay, let me make my shot
now, and you feed off each other. Coach says it a lot, take your shot, make
your shot.  
  
 Q. Is that what it will take to beat Duke?  
MATT SHRIGLEY: Definitely. I mean, to beat anyone you have to make your shots
and score a lot of points.  
  
MODERATOR: Other questions for the student-athletes?  
  
 Q. This is for Sky, you were playing in there against I don't think
anybody taller than 6'6 to start. What was it like to kind of play where you
are the big guy in there and kind of have your way?  
SKYLAR SPENCER: It was different but I had to kind of take advantage of my
opportunities and just let everything come to me and let the game flow.  
  
 Q. For JJ, obviously Aqeel wasn't feeling a hundred percent tonight and
you guys have all said he's your emotional leader. What was it like not having
him out there in such a big game, how did you guys adjust?  
J.J. O'BRIEN: It was different, usually he's out there with us, someone had to
step in in that role, I think we all tried to step up and be a little more
vocal. Someone had to fill in, we had to adapt to situations like that. But we
definitely missed him and we hope he gets better.  
  
MODERATOR: Any other questions? Thanks, guys. Head back to the locker room.
Good job. Questions for Coach Fisher?  
  
 Q. Coach, just give us an update on Aqeel and how were you able to play
him or not play him based on how he was feeling?  
COACH FISHER: At our open shoot around here yesterday, came into the arena
feeling good. Towards the end, he told Tom that he didn't feel great, had a
knot in his stomach. By the time we got back, he could hardly stand up. I
think they've attributed it to some form of food poison. He had an IV last
night. He had another IV this morning and he probably still is feeling pretty
miserable, but he said I'm good to go. He tried and competed, like AQ
competes, but he was not obviously at full strength. And hopefully we'll have
a day and a half to get him ready because we need him.  
  
 Q. Coach, what can you say about Duke? You have a big game ahead of you
playing them and it's going to be a tough match-up, they had a pretty good
game themselves tonight.  
COACH FISHER: They did, and they've had a lot of pretty good games, which is
why they're the No. 1 seed. We're glad that we're playing. It's them that we
have to play. We were 8 seed. That's the math, I used to teach math and we
will definitely have our hands full. But our players compete and if we make
shots and that's a big if, we will have an opportunity to make it interesting.
We know not only are they a terrific team but they are a premiere program that
is in that elite stratosphere, and that's where all the rest of us aspire to
get. We're inching our way along, building our own resume. They've got a
pretty good one that's built on a number of years of great, great teams. Our
players and our fans will be very excited to play the game and we'll see what
happens.  
  
 Q. Steve, I think you shot 16 3s in the first half and I don't think
you've shot more than 17 in the last nine games. Every game has its ebb and
flow, but were you at all surprised by that number, that high number there?  
COACH FISHER: Well, the 3s we got were wide open 3s, and they were taken by
guys that can shoot and make 3s. And between Dwayne and Matt, they made a
bunch, and I saw highlights of, I think it was, Davidson or one of the games
where a player banked it in and he turned to the TV and said I called that. DP
did not call his two banks but they were well received on our end. You have to
get a little bit lucky and we were ready to talk about had we continued to
shoot them and not make them about play inside out, throw the ball to JJ or
throw the ball inside and play inside out. But the 3s we had were great looks.  
  
 Q. Steve, I'm going to try to sneak in two questions. One, how much did
you watch tape of St. John's with Obekpa and what kind of a difference might
he have made in this game? And on Duke, where does Jahlil Okafor rank against
some of the great freshmen in college basketball you've seen and coached
against?  
COACH FISHER: Well, St. John's is not as good a team obviously without the big
shot block or the inside presence. We knew he wasn't going to play so I
watched very little without him. I did watch some segments, but they're
different. They're like us. When Skylar's not in there we're a little bit
different. When they get to the rim they can finish. When we get to the rim
tonight we could finish, and with him in there it would have been harder for
us to finish up going to the rim, but we earned a win tonight against the team
that they had. Okafor is a terrific player. I'm not an NBA scout but everyone
says he's going to be the No. 1 guy taken in the NBA draft this year. He knows
how to play, he plays within himself, he's a legitimate center that wants to
be a center and doesn't care to drift out and shoot 3-pointers. He's a hard
guy for anybody to guard. I don't like to do a lot of ranking because I'm not
very good at it, but I know he's good.  
  
 Q. Coach, from going essentially facing a five guard lineup in St.
John's how much of a transition will it be facing Jahlil Okafor, Marshall
Plumlee and Justise Winslow at Duke?  
COACH FISHER: Every game has a different storyline. Every game has a different
way that you have to play. Tonight our No. 1 concern is who's going to cry
uncle first, can we get back and can we have a bigger lineup and stay in front
of people without them driving around us time and time again. Obviously with a
smaller team, point of emphasis, go rebound the ball, go rebound a miss. I
think we had 13 out of 28 misses. We had a goal, rebound half of our missed
shots, so we were close on that tonight. The thing we did tonight, we not only
rebounded them, we got them in the basket. We got several points off of
offensive rebounds and Sunday will be different obviously. They've got some
size, and size that's quality, but they've got some perimeter play that will
be hard to deal with, too.  
  
 Q. Steve, it's essential obviously to win at this point in the season.
How proud are you of your guys, playing a team like they had not played all
season, that they did find a way to get it under control and to win and
advance?  
COACH FISHER: I've loved every team I've ever had but this is a unique group
and we're fed by our fifth year seniors. Got three of them, AQ, Polee and
O'Brien, and JJ is someone that I use often, play like JJ. If you have a team
that will be willing to give up -- give of themselves, we had to say, JJ,
we're going to play through you and we want you to be a facilitator when
needed but an aggressor to score, he's as happy if he scores two points or if
he scores 22 as long as we win. So this was a good win for our program. We
want to continue to play. This is a stage, as all of us know, where everybody
starts watching, the eyeballs multiply with each victory. So we'll have more
folks watching, it will be a bigger deal come Sunday, and if we happen to win,
it will be a bigger deal come next week in Houston.  
  
MODERATOR: Anyone else? Thanks, Coach.

_CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

MICHIGAN STATE - 70  
GEORGIA - 63

COACH FOX: Hard fought game. Michigan State is a very good basketball team,
and we congratulate them. Took us a while to settle down offensively. We
turned it over in the first half, not so much in the second. And then late in
the game we kind of, I thought our defense began to stabilize but I never
really was comfortable with how we were defending most of the night, but we
competed and we just had to play uphill. We had a very good start and then we
burped there for a minute in the first half and we had to play uphill, which
is so hard to do. They have a very good team, we wish them well and they
certainly earned the win.  
  
MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes, please raise your hand.  
  
Q. Two questions for the players. First, were there early game jitters
at all, and also, did it seem like you guys did sort of struggle to get into a
flow offensively?  
NEMANJA DJURISIC: I think we started the game very well. I think we were ready
to compete. I think emotions got us throughout the game because there were up
and downs every game. But throughout the game we just couldn't, first half
especially we couldn't stabilize. Our defense dictated the tempo and we just
gave up a lot of easy buckets in transition, which hurt us definitely and put
us behind and it's very, very hard to play against such a good team behind.  
  
MARCUS THORNTON: I thought we came out stronger, like Neme said. We didn't
deal with our first bout of adversity very well. Michigan State, they played
like a team that's been here before. So when you're playing against a team
like that, there's only a very limited margin for error. So it kind of caught
up to us in the end.  
  
MODERATOR: No others? Thanks, guys. Questions for Coach Fox?  
  
Q. Coach, was Kenny injured or did he re-aggravate his foot in the
second half?  
COACH FOX: Well, Kenny is injured. We knew he would be injured today. There's
no way to get him a hundred percent right now, and I thought under the
circumstances, it's very hard to play this game when you don't practice,
extremely hard to maintain your conditioning, your timing, and everything else
that you need to do. Under the circumstances, I thought he gave us a heck of
an effort. He's certainly fatigued. He was not nearly the defender he's been
this year because he can't cut and change directions. I give our trainers
credit and Kenny credit for getting as close to being able to play as he
could. But obviously we had some in and out and he wasn't quite as effective
as he's been earlier in the year but that's part of it.  
  
Q. Was that why maybe it was so hard to handle Trice?  
COACH FOX: Trice is a really good player, and when healthy is a great defender
and Trice requires a great defender. They have a very good team with he and
Valentine, they can spread you out and obviously they're very confident
shooting the ball. So it's one of the things we hoped to do was slow those
guys down, which I don't think we did very well in the first half. I thought
there were spurts in the second half we did a little better shot.  
  
Q. Branden Dawson picks up his second foul and I think you guys are up
11-5 or in that range. Did you think at that point that was a major break but
at that point Marvin Clark came in and almost seemed to give them a boost
offensively?  
COACH FOX: I don't think Michigan State has bad players, I think they have
quality depth, and so we didn't see it as a real advantage quite frankly. It
was not something that we focused on obviously. Dawson's a very good player,
but it was just part of the game. I thought we had -- had both of them been
two fouls, it might be a little advantage for us but their depth up front
certainly showed.  
  
MODERATOR: Any other questions? Okay, thank you, Coach.  
  
COACH FOX: Thank you

_CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

MICHIGAN STATE - 70  
GEORGIA - 63

MODERATOR: About to start with Michigan State.  
  
COACH IZZO: My father told me nothing would be easy, and we kind of live on
that, to be honest with you. I thought we played about three, four different
games today. I thought Georgia came out and really played well early and did
everything they do. What they do, we swear we weren't going to let them get to
the line 25 times and we didn't, they got there 26. We've been a team that has
been assists, we had 18. We did some of the things we do, they did some of the
things they do. Very good rebounding team, I loved the way they rebounded and
I thought they never quit. We made a couple of mistakes again, but for the
most part if you added up the minutes we played well, there would be a lot of
them. As they say, it's win and advance, that's what we're going to do and
move forward.  
  
MODERATOR: Questions for Travis, Branden and Denzel.  
  
 Q. For Travis, you're kind of emblematic of a Michigan State player.
Going to your senior year you basically doubled your production. What is it
about the program that guys always get better, especially by the time they're
seniors? Trice?  
TRAVIS TRICE: I think there's a lot of factors into this. Our coaches do a
great job of developing us from freshmen to senior year, they're pretty good
about spotting guys they feel they can help improve, but really it's your
teammates honestly, when you're going against a Denzel Valentine every day and
a Brenden Dawson every day, you have no choice but to get better. That's -- I
owe it to my teammates.  
  
 Q. One of the Georgia players said Michigan State played like they've
been here before. Did that experience help you, particularly in the last
minute they made the run and you had to hit those free throws?  
BRANDEN DAWSON: Yeah, as far as myself, Travis and Denzel, we've been in this
position plenty of times and in the huddle Travis mentioned we've been in the
position against Wisconsin where we had a big lead and we just didn't keep our
poise. In this game we kept our poise and throughout the game and as far as
myself and Travis and Denzel we just have to lead the young guys, we
definitely have been in this position, I wouldn't say just against Wisconsin;
we've been in this position plenty of times throughout the season.  
  
 Q. You pick up that second foul and have to sit for the final 14
minutes. Talk about what that was like in the first half, and in your second
half you've been about as efficient as you've been scoring around the
basket?  
BRANDEN DAWSON: I was frustrated. When I got my second foul, I was definetely
frustrated, but as far as my teammates and Coach Fife, they just picked me up,
they told me in the second half I have to play better. I actually had three
fouls, finished the game with three fouls but in that situation where your
team needs you, you just have to play smart like Coach has been telling us
throughout the season, play hard and smart, that's what I did, played hard and
smart even though I was in foul trouble.  
  
 Q. Denzel, can you talk about 6-6 from the free throw line, what your
mindset was in such a tight situation?  
DENZEL VALENTINE: I just knew that I didn't play my best second half so I
didn't want to let the team down. If we had a loss or something like that, I
didn't want to say it's because of me. So I just went to the line like I'm
going to make up for it and I just knocked them down.  
  
 Q. For Travis, Georgia said that Kenny Gaines was battling an injury.
Were you aware of that, and did that feed into your aggressiveness going into
the basket? Trice?  
TRAVIS TRICE: I knew he had missed some game towards the end of the year
because of the ankle but at this point in the season, I mean, all that goes
out the window. You know he's going to come out and play hard and he's got a
shot to play in the NCAA Tournament, so my thing was just sticking to our game
plan honestly.  
  
 Q. Travis and Denzel, when Georgia came out in the second half and cut
the lead to two, and they had a chance to tie, Matt made a nice defensive
play, that spearheaded a run, I think Brenden Forbes hit a couple of 3s,
Branden had and-1 in that stretch. What was going on on the court
communication-wise? What do you think fueled you guys to answer their
challenge and answer a run right when they were ready to cut it to 2 and tie
it?  
TRAVIS TRICE: Our thing was just sticking together. Basketball's a game of
runs, other teams are going to make a run but it's how you respond. Our thing
was huddle up and stick together. We've been in this situation before and
there were times we kind of fell apart and we knew we he couldn't do that this
time. We had to stick together.  
  
DENZEL VALENTINE: Like Travis said, we just wanted to stay together, stay
together and keep working, keep fighting. We can't control if our shots are
going in but we can control what we do and how we respond. So we just wanted
to respond in a way that let us to win the game.  
  
 Q. For Denzel and Travis, two months ago could you have survived a game
where in the first half Branden's in that kind of foul trouble, and Travis,
you got off good looks but missing shots. What's happened to you guys from
your other pieces on this team, could you have survived that two months ago?  
DENZEL VALENTINE: I don't know, you know. That's a good question. Give credit
to, we're going to give credit to Marvin and Colby, they played big minutes
for us, they came in and were ready to play early in the season. We wouldn't
know what we would get but those guys have stepped up big time, not just this
game but in the Big Ten tournament and a couple games late in the season, they
stepped up their play, so those guys came in and played good.  
  
TRAVIS TRICE: Like Denzel said, that's a tough question to answer but I
honestly feel more confident now with our guys coming off the bench and some
of our other guys, just the way they're playing right now, the energy and the
focus they're doing has been great for us.  
  
 Q. For any of the guys, going on his question about how this team
always gets better it seems this time of year. Is that the result of Coach?
What do you think it is as to why Michigan State at this time of year is
always playing at its best?  
BRANDEN DAWSON: I would say it's just our focus. Coming into this game, we
wanted to be different. We've been watching all the rest of the games and we
saw that good teams, the Baylor and Iowa States, those guys just came out and
I think they were too focused on just the seeding. Tonight Coach mentioned to
us let's be different. So we just wanted to play better, we just wanted to
come out and play hard and I think around this time is just our focus and we
were just dialed in.  
  
 Q. Branden, you've obviously been through this before. What is it about
this time of year that always seems to bring out the best in you guys?  
BRANDEN DAWSON: Well, I'll just say just having a great coach as far as Coach
Izzo and I would say our coaching staff, they do a great job of getting us
prepared. We had an up and down season but I think our chemistry has been
great, especially playing in the Big Ten tournament, I think that's when our
chemistry really started to flourish. As far as the team, like I said as far
as myself, Travis and Denzel, we just have to lead these guys and I think our
chemistry has to keep flowing in those late game situations.  
  
MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Izzo?  
  
 Q. Tom, there was a point this year where I think you just benched your
entire bench, so to speak, you just couldn't get anything out of them. To get
what you had out of that first half this year with Marvin and get that run,
where is that group?  
COACH IZZO: First of all, I benched myself a few games so I can appreciate
that. They learned. Marvin hasn't played a lot of basketball, a lot of years
of it so it took him a little while longer and we've got to remember like with
an Alvin Ellis, he was out the first six, seven weeks of the season. The first
game he sprains that ankle. He was out until right before Christmas. When
you're not a great player, it's hard to come back from that. And then we
couldn't get him time. It was Big Ten time and then we got him time by
necessity because of foul trouble and that, I think they got a little better
and I think they are practicing a little better. Matt has been really good,
him coming off the bench, too. And today he had been really good up until
today and just struggled a little bit today.  
  
 Q. You guys had a good run in the first half, got the transition going
a little bit. Did that come out of defense or what? And that's with Branden on
the bench. What was going well during that time?  
COACH IZZO: I thought we turned them over a little better or they turned
themselves over. One of our struggles has been keeping guys off the free throw
line. Seemed like they did what they did well, didn't have that many
turnovers, we only had nine, but we scored some baskets off turnovers, that
was one thing. We put them on the line a little bit early and didn't defend
very well, we started doing a better job of that. But I thought we got a
running game going of makes, misses, rebounds, turnovers, and I thought that
was the difference in the game in the first half. Give them credit. I'll tell
you something, this is a very good team. I'm proud of them, not because my
nephew's there. I'm proud of them because I've seen Mark go through some of
the same things I went through, where people are questioning this, that and
the other thing. We played a lot of good teams this year, that's as good a
team as we played. They got in a little foul trouble, too. I do think the
injury to Gaines was big. I watched him warm up and he was limping on that
thing and he still got 12 or 14 points, but that kid's a hell of a player. I
think that hurt. I thought we did a decent job on their two bigs. We couldn't
re-bound with them, which is disappointing but I thought we did a decent job
of walling them, we worked hard on that for three days. But that is a good
basketball team. Tough, runs a lot of good stuff. I just thought our fast
break was the difference in the game the first half and then in the second
half the same thing, once they cut the lead we got a couple quick buckets off
the break and that was the difference.  
  
 Q. In your running game, it's always been a staple of this team this
year, a lot of years but is it better now even -- I mean, the half court's
game a lot better, but is it better now than it was earlier?  
COACH IZZO: I think it is, I think BJ's pushing a little hard, and I think Tum
pushes it a little bit. And we have two wings that can shoot it. We had some
bizarre lineups in there because of the foul trouble we were in, but I
definitely think our running game is really good. The problem we have, we like
to what we call blitz and break, run up, makes and misses but for most of the
year, we did not have enough subs, and we were wearing Trice and Valentine
down to nothing. Now we're trying to get back to running, I still don't have
the substitution pattern I would like to have, but we're an interesting team.
You saw a lot of good minutes and then you saw some bizarre plays and I think
Georgia deserves some credit for that and we deserve some blame for that but
we're doing what you're supposed to do in this tournament. We survived and
we're advancing, and it's going to get tougher each game but I think we
learned something from the past games, especially the Wisconsin game.
Hopefully we'll keep moving forward here and our break is a big part of that.  
  
 Q. Coach, is there something that you would pinpoint as to the reason
why Matt was so inefficient from the field tonight?  
COACH IZZO: This is where you wish you were a politician, don't you, so you
could be politically correct? Hell, no, I can't figure it out myself. I think
he's having trouble figuring it out, too. He did some good things, he guarded
pretty well, he blocked some shots. He got six, seven rebounds, but I don't
know, I don't know. You know, I think I'll blame it on one of my assistants,
that's what we do at this level. Blame it on somebody, sure as hell isn't
going to be the head coach and you can't blame a player so one of my
assistants is in big trouble when we get back.  
  
 Q. Tom, given that you've heard your players say chemistry's at its
best so far this season, given that they're describing having learned lessons
and are applying them to games now, do you feel like the potential for this
team may be the highest that it's been?  
COACH IZZO: I think it's the highest it's been this year, but I think it's
pretty easy to see we're not a typical Michigan State team. We don't have
maybe as much talent as we had. We do have -- I appreciated Branden, but we've
had chemistry all year. We tell our guys you have to play hard enough, good
enough and smart enough. For the most part, we play hard. A lot of times we
play good. Now, the third one, that's got to fall on me because we're just not
playing as smart as we need to play in certain situations, and it's cost us,
between that and some free throws, it's cost us during the year. But we have
played well enough to be in a lot of games and I do think that it was fun to
listen to the players say, okay, remember what we learned in Wisconsin at
halftime in the huddles they said it. That's encouraging because that means
they're not treating the history like it's just that is the way it is, you
treat it that you can't change it but you learn from it. I think we had enough
guys that played well to win, we had enough guys that played poorly to keep my
job and coach, and now in the next two days we have to figure out what we did
right and wrong and somehow to stop one of these two teams we could play. I
think this team has had good chemistry, maybe as good as we've had in a long,
long time, they get along well, they hang together, they do everything
together, we don't have the super star syndrome and it's been fun to watch
them grow together. Sometimes, I've got to tell you, it's an out of body
experience once in a while the things we do for no reason. Clock's on our
side, we talk about it and we've made a few mistakes. I guess somewhere
seriously I've got to take onus on that because it's my job to make sure they
know what they're doing at certain times. We'll try to get better with that in
the next two days.  
  
 Q. Tom, to me that first half was as physical a basketball game as I've
seen and you let the kids play. Can you comment on the physicality, especially
in the second half?  
COACH IZZO: I know those are two physical guys we played against but they
probably think we are, too. For me, going through what I went through in my 20
years here, I constantly say this is like belly bumping. This isn't physical
at all compared to the way it used to be and thank God it's not that way
anymore. But I would agree. I think we learned something at Illinois and then
Purdue and then Indiana and Maryland and Wisconsin. We got tougher this year.
We were not a very tough team, we were not. We've gotten tougher, but I would
say that the proof's in the pudding. We might have played a little better, but
that was a tough team we played against. They had men on those boards, they
went after them, they did a hell of a job. That is a good basketball team, a
well-coached basketball team and I think one that has -- he's going to do
hopefully what I did. People were on my butt and we made it and all of a
sudden we took off. I think he's got a lot of bright days ahead of us at
Georgia.  
  
 Q. You said you wanted to follow without defending, that was one of the
keys?  
COACH IZZO: They shot 26 free throws so we did a hell of a job on that, but go
on.  
  
 Q. Especially early on, Branden gets a couple. Was he maybe too keyed
up, I think he bit on a pump fake, he helped on one, looked like he read what
the offense was going to do? What were your thoughts?  
COACH IZZO: Well, when you're too keyed up you sometimes can make mistakes or
when you're not focused in on what the scouting report says, those guys are
tremendous shot-fakers. Djurisic is unbelievable, I watch film after film.
It's easy to coach that, and tell them this is what he is going to do, but
when he's doing it on the floor I think it is different. Sometimes coaches
don't appreciate that but I think it's harder than you think. After that first
little part I think we did a decent job defending them, but, boy, when I
looked out there and there was Marv and Colby, I said wow, just hold on and
that's what we tried to do. Then we started building on it because of a couple
turnovers.  
  
 Q. You kind of go into where I was headed. Marv and Colby at the end of
that first half came in and played some pretty strong defensive minutes for
you guys. Obviously at the end Wollenman had that foul, but can you talk about
the job and the minutes that both those guys had?  
COACH IZZO: It was phenomenal. We just had no choice. Colby is a doctor, he's
in medical school so smart as they come and you really could -- he really
understands things. And Marv is a guy that I think has grown as much as
anybody. He was a kid that didn't play until he got to high school so he's
behind in some ways. He's improving, he's listening. His roommate is Tum Tum
and Javon. It might not sound like it, but I'm so excited that we're moving on
because not only do you worry about the first game more than any game, but the
first game against what I knew was a solid team -- I would rather play a team
that's got crazy athletes and not as solid than I would that's kind of like
us, that's solid, they can grind it, they can run a little bit, and I will say
that a healthy Gaines I think might have made that game a little different,
too. But we've had some injuries all year, we'll take it. I'm excited where
we're going and looking forward to the challenge ahead of us on whichever team
wins.

DUKE - 85  
ROBERT MORRIS - 56

COACH KRZYZEWSKI: First of all, just congratulations to Robert Morris. Not
just a good team but an outstanding program. This is their 8th appearance in
the NCAA Tournament and they've also had a number of NIT appearances, and what
Andy's done is not just built a good team but a really good program. Whenever
you beat a team that's a good program, that means even more. They have a well-
conceived offense to take advantage of those individual skills of Reed, Jones
and Pryor. Those kids can really score the ball. I thought our defense was
excellent tonight and we obviously shared the ball really well. To have 28
assists in a game is fantastic. Our bench, especially Marshall and Amile, gave
us a huge boost. They were real veterans in this game with offense and --
offense and on defense, they were outstanding. And then Quinn had another
outstanding game. We feel good about our performance. Grayson got 12 minutes
tonight, we weren't sure how long he would be able to play. Hopefully that's a
sign of him getting back into really good health. Any questions that y'all
might have.  
  
MODERATOR: Questions first for Quinn and Marshall.  
  
 Q. This question is for Quinn. Your leadership skills have really shown
through this season. You were on a couple of the Duke teams that had some
disappointing losses in the NCAA Tournament. What did you tell to the younger
guys on your team in order to get them motivated for the tournament, or did
you need to tell them anything?  
QUINN COOK: Yeah, it's a new year, it's a new team, it's a new season, we're
0-0. We played in some big-time games and earned a spot here in the NCAA
Tournament. I just told them to be their selves. I don't want them thinking a
lot so I kind of let them be themselves and act instinctively. Justise and Jah
made some big-time plays in the second half when they cut it to ten and
Grayson, him being under the weather, him getting some minutes out there was
good so going into the game Sunday, whoever we play, we have that confidence
with one game under our belt.  
  
 Q. Quinn, when you have bigs inside like Jahlil and Marshall, how much
easier does that make it for the guards?  
QUINN COOK: A lot easier, they create so much attention and they're always
talking on defense, helping us out. The guards in pick and roll situations.
They carve a lot of space out so for early drives if we don't hit them,
they're very unselfish, so when they get the ball inside, if they don't have a
shot inside they pass it out, so those two make our jobs easier as guards.  
  
 Q. You talked about telling the guys just be yourselves. What kind of
fine line is it to kind of be yourselves and be loose like it certainly seemed
you were and then when Jahlil missed that reverse dunk, and we'll talk to Mike
about that later, what's the fine line there being yourselves and also being
into the game one hundred percent?  
QUINN COOK: Just making the right plays, just -- we know what we need to do.
We've played in big, big time games where we know we can't have that. You
know, two points can end your season. Freshman mistake, Jah knows that that
and he bounced back from it. He made some big time plays when he made that
run.  
  
 Q. Either one of the players, after they cut it to 10, what did you do
really well down the stretch?  
MARSHALL PLUMLEE: I thought we really came together and responded. I think
there was a timeout, they got a little emotional, and every team here is very
capable of winning, they wouldn't be here if they weren't. So it can turn
around just like that and we've got to be ready and be able to respond. So I
would have to say it came from a little bit of emotion and drive that came
from a timeout.  
  
QUINN COOK: Yeah, like what Marshall said, Coach called a timeout and just
told us we're fine, we're missing some shots, we missed some open shots. They
hit some tough shots and that's how the game goes. The crowd got some momentum
to those guys and we made some big time plays. Justise's 3 was big time for
him to struggle in the first half and come out and have six big time points
was big for us. I hope it gives those guys confidence as freshmen, get that
good game under their belt. We'll be back on Sunday.  
  
 Q. Quinn, you get your first couple of 3s, how big is that to get it
going because obviously it seemed to sustain you and, it seemed, your
teammates throughout the game?  
QUINN COOK: It's big, just for a player's confidence just to see a shot go in.
Myself and Tyus have a great chemistry, so it's tough to guard. We work on
that in practice, so to see some shots go in was great, and cause a lot of
attention, when I hit a couple, guys run out to me and open things up. Coach
is always telling me keep shooting, doesn't matter if I miss six in a row, 10
in a row, he wants me to keep shooting so that does a lot for my confidence as
well.  
  
MODERATOR: Thanks, guys, congratulations. Questions for Coach?  
  
 Q. Mike, how do you draw the line between guys having fun and being
loose and not being as focused as they need to?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: You see it. I'm with them every day and I know them. We have
great relationships with our guys. So specially in this tournament, you want
them to be loose. I thought to begin at the beginning of the game a couple of
our freshmen were -- they didn't talk. Jah, Justise, they weren't talking,
they weren't themselves and that's why Marshall and Amile coming into the game
gave us a huge boost. You just do it by feel. I know them well enough, I feel
like I can get emotional, funny, serious and they'll respond because of the
relationships that are built. It's my responsibility to spontaneously act when
I do have a feel, when I do see something, and for them to react to me. And
they've done that and they did it tonight.  
  
 Q. Sort of following up on that, how much, I guess, were you trying to
-- what message were you trying to get across to your guys when you're
teaching a young team in the tournament in that second half timeout?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Which second half timeout? We had a number of them.  
  
 Q. When Jahlil missed the dunk.  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Well, you can't do that. That's the easy message. Like,
don't do that, especially don't do it when you've played four consecutive
minutes and you're tired. You just can't do that. So, I mean that's an easy
one.  
  
 Q. Coach, Marshall Plumlee seems to be really coming on. Is that
something you're seeing in practice or is it in the games or a little bit of
both?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: I think it's the last month really. Marshall has been
consistently good. He's had great practices. He's had mature, veteran
practices where he never takes a possession off, he's talking, he's sharp, and
it really sets a good tone, and it translates because he does that in the
practice. And in the game tonight, our guys threw three lobs to him, maybe
four, and that's showing confidence in him. But he deserves that because he
and Amile really did a great job for us tonight.  
  
 Q. Coach, could you talk about Quinn's leadership and just how the
whole dynamic has worked so well with him and Tyus this year?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: It's been a fabulous dynamic. They have a great
relationship. I saw in somebody's article, I do read articles, not every one,
but where someone had interviewed Austin Rivers, and Austin made a point I
think, which is very, very good, is that as a freshman you don't know about
how much you should talk about different things, and to have an upperclassman
say that's what you should do, especially when it's an upperclassman who has a
big-time role on the team like Quinn does. We as coaches say these things, but
when Quinn says them in his own language and his own way, they resonate even
better. This is our 30th win. He's led us to a fabulous season and hopefully
he'll lead us further into this tournament.  
  
 Q. Coach, what gives you the drive that you have that you win so much;
you won national championships, you won regular season championship. What
motivates you and keeps your drive up to keep winning like you do?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: I want to win, I still have the desire to prepare to win and
want to win, but along with that, I have a responsibility to have the drive
for the players that I have the privilege to coach. I mean, I shouldn't coach
unless I have the drive and you can't fake it, you can't fake it. And these
kids deserve it. It's their moment. I don't like to bring up what's been done
in the past, whether we've won or we've lost, because we've already done that.
It's what you're doing right now and how emotionally and mentally ready you
can be to help your team. And my staff's done a good job. I love my guys. It's
easy to do that, for me it's always come easy to have drive. Now, I'm not
necessarily smart. Sometimes I haven't been the smartest guy or whatever, but
the passion to win has never been a thing I've run out of yet.  
  
 Q. Mike, when you came back after the ACC tournament in preparation for
this tournament, what was the demeanor of the practices? High? Was there any
letdown?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: No, good. Again, we tried to prepare for this like we did
for the ACC tournament, and in that we had about 40 minutes of contact the
first day just to get back to playing some defense, but then after that was
individual work, 5 on 0, and to try to get fresh. Grayson didn't practice
until he got here. The open practice here was the first time Grayson has
played this week since the ACC tournament. And Quinn was sick last week, so we
wanted to make sure he wasn't rundown. And then Jah started -- we saw some
improvement with him and that's what we've done. We thought we played great in
the first game of the ACC tournament for some reason, we didn't play as well
for more than half of a game, and then we almost won that game. And so we
weren't -- we weren't going to punish our guys or anything like that. We
didn't want to wear them out, we wanted to get them healthy.  
  
 Q. Robert Morris runs usually a three guard set. You guys had a lot of
success in the front court. Was that something you saw coming in today, that
that's maybe something we can exploit?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: I don't know about exploiting it but what we tried to do was
not let them walk into their offense. When they walk into their offense, then
they have more energy. You have three explosive players. This way, they have
to, even if we didn't turn them over, we didn't think we were going to turn
them over, although we did a couple times, was more working in their offense
already and maybe having them out a little bit further than if they just
walked into it. Overall, it was good and I thought Matt did a really good job.
Matt sets a tone defensively for us.  
  
 Q. I just want you to talk about Justise and the stretch after they cut
it to 10, he had a 3, took two defensive rebounds, one for the layup, one to
feed Tyus for the 3. He really kind of kick-started you at that point.  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: He made the biggest play of the game when it was down to 10.
Robert Morris fought the entire game and put themselves in a position with
double digit minutes to maybe win the game. Justise had 6 points but the 3
points were worth a lot. I don't know how many, a lot. And then his verve
during that time, and Jah during that time all of a sudden went from 10 to 18
real quick. But that was -- I mean, that was a key part of the game and
Justise was key along with Jah during that time to get us back because there's
a lot of game -- just the tournament's different and you can get a lot of
pressure on yourself and have no pressure on the other team when they're
placed in a position like that. Justise really responded.

VIRGINIA - 79  
BELMONT - 67

COACH BYRD: First off, we played a great basketball team. Virginia made the
winning plays in the last three minutes that we didn't make, and they deserve
to win. They were the better team. That being said, I'm certainly proud of our
team's performance, I'm proud of their fight and grit and determination and
the plays that they made, and we played a great team and I don't have the
play-by-play but somewhere in the neighborhood of three minutes we had a real,
real chance to win that basketball game and just didn't get it done. They did
and they get to play Sunday, but this team right here's come a long way and
I'm lucky to coach them.  
  
MODERATOR: Questions? For the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Craig, you had things going there from 3 point range. What did you
see in their defense that allowed you to exploit that and can you just talk
about the feeling you had shooting the ball today?  
CRAIG BRADSHAW: I mean, honestly we just had a great game plan, we ran a lot
of stuff for down screens and we had a lot of open shots. My shot felt good.
That's about it.  
  
COACH BYRD: You guys think that bank shot was an accident but honestly he does
it all the time from right there. I'm not going to make him say for sure but
I'm about 90 percent sure he meant to bank that, truthfully.  
  
Q. Looked like when your offense was spreaded out, looked like you was
more effective then. What happened?  
MODERATOR: Directed for who?  
  
Q. For the Coach.  
MODERATOR: Student-athlete questions first.  
  
Q. Reece, you knew going in they were awfully good defensively. Were
they everything you thought they would be? And how did you counter their
toughness, because you guys did make your run?  
REECE CHAMBERLAIN: They're a great team, we knew that coming in, that the
shots we normally get were going to come tough. I thought we did a great job,
and there's only one stretch in the first half where we kind of got carried
away and didn't run offense but I think overall we did a pretty good job of
moving the ball and working in until we got some good shots.  
  
Q. Evan, the free throws, 25 to 6, did you kind of feel that they were
really taking it to you inside and how did you feel you dealt with their
height advantage?  
EVAN BRADDS: They shot a lot more free throws than us but I think it was just
because at the end we probably fouled seven or eight times so there's probably
14 right there. They're big guys, big, tall strong guys and they're hard to
deal with down there. Gill's a monster and he got to the line a lot tonight.  
  
MODERATOR: Any other questions?  
  
Q. Craig, when you hit the second of those two 3s and cut it to 62-60,
what did you think, did you think you guys were going to win the game at that
point?  
CRAIG BRADSHAW: I don't think you ever think you're going to win the game
against those guys, they string together some stops. I felt good about how I
was shooting. We were running a good offense and they just made some good
stops at the end, made more winning plays in the end.  
  
Q. Bradshaw and Bradds, you're coming back next season how do you feel
about this team going forward, do you feel like you'll be here again at this
very place in the NCAA Tournament in 2016?  
CRAIG BRADSHAW: I don't think you can say anything for sure but we have a
really young team and Mack Mercer played great tonight and I'm really looking
forward to his development. Amanze is the starter, we've got really young
guys, I think we're going to be really good next year. It's up to us.  
  
EVAN BRADDS: Like he said we are very young. I'm excited, we all work really
hard, so we're just hoping we can work hard enough to get back here next year.  
  
Q. The question is like when you had your offense spreaded out, looked
like it was more effective then than it was when they standing in their
position which they was getting the ball on the corners and at the top of the
key and your guys was hitting the 3s and stuff and looked like your offense,
well, that was a stop and they just went, you know?  
COACH BYRD: Looked like bad coaching, didn't it? We got out in the first half
and then a couple of times in the second half, we got out of the things that
we're supposed to do and tried to make things happen individually and you're
just not going to do that against a team that guards as good one-on-one as
they do. A big play was the play we kicked it out and they deflected it and
then our guy still reached out and touched it and it went out of bounds, that
was a big play. And we actually got Taylor Barnette two or three really good
looks late off of a throw back down screen kind of play and he made the shot
that got us here or we wouldn't be here. But those didn't go down today and to
beat Virginia, you've got to make plays like that. So we got a little stagnant
every time, but there's a lot of great basketball teams that tried to score it
good against Virginia and haven't been as effective as we have, so I was
overall pleased with the offensive execution and performance.  
  
Q. I was going to ask you about Taylor. Do you think he was pressing at
all or do you feel that they were very familiar with him?  
COACH BYRD: No, I thought he took -- he's 1-7 from 3 and I thought at least
two of those were quick and long. He and Craig both had some early that were
too early in the shot clock to take the shot they had to take. And then, you
know, 3-pointer shooters are going to have their good days and their bad days
and you live and die with it sometime and I just think he had a bad day. I
don't think he was -- look, he is an easygoing guy that doesn't seem to be
impacted much by pressure situations. If he was ever going to press, it would
have been on the shot he had to make to get us here and he didn't hit the rim
with it. So you look at any great 3-pointer shooter and they're going to have
one 1-7 days and they're going to have 6-7 days.  
  
Q. In the first half I think they matched you 5-12 on 3s. Were you
expecting that kind of shooting by them on the perimeter, and what did you do
to stop it later?  
COACH BYRD: Well, I don't know that we did a whole lot to stop it. We talked
about defense every timeout, all during halftime. Brogdon just had a really
good first half and not such a good second half shooting the basketball. It
looked to me like their shots from 3 just didn't go down. I think they focused
more on getting the ball inside and I think that's a big answer to the foul
shot discrepancy is that they had an inside game that we knew we would
struggle with if they went in that direction too much.  
  
Q. Can you speak to Bradshaw's day? He almost seemed like he kind of
willed you back into the game when it was a double-digit lead?  
COACH BYRD: When Craig plays like he did today and he's obviously a first team
OVC guy and played like that a lot he makes us a way better team. He's
fearless. He loves situations like that, that he's in. Who he's playing
against and the circumstances in the game matter not to him at all. I like
him. Plus he's just good enough, he's just athletic enough and simply good
enough to play against defenders from Virginia. And frankly we try hard but we
don't -- we don't get ACC level players very often, and he is that.  
  
Q. Rick, you seem to have better success on the screen roll getting the
ball to the basket maybe more than other teams have had. Was your 3-point
threat part of that or was it execution?  
COACH BYRD: I think when you have at least one big that can pop back and make
it, they can't have nearly as much help on the screen-and-roll as they
ordinarily would. Again it's funny but there aren't many -- I watched a lot of
their games and a lot of people they played, I watched a ton of ball screen
clips and there aren't many people at that level of basketball that really
have, Wisconsin obviously does, but really have the bigs that can pop back out
and shoot 3s. I know they were ready and I know they talked about it but it's
one of the hardest things to guard in basketball is a big guy that can set a
ball screen and pop back. You can ask Tony, but I think they did some things
they haven't done all year long about switching ball screens with Nick Smith
in for us that at least I haven't seen, and Taylor either didn't tell me the
truth but he said they don't switch nothing. That's what you say when you're
from Kentucky, they don't switch nothing. And Tennessee, I'm not throwing off
on Kentucky.  
  
Q. You pushed out to a really quick lead and then again in the second
half when you made your run to get back into it, you guys were playing at a
pretty fast pace, was that part of the game plan today to make a conscious
effort to push it?  
COACH BYRD: Yeah, you know, I don't think -- first of all, we like to play
that way, I like to play that way. In fact I like to play that way more than
our guys do. I'm always on them to sprint the floor. I think if you let
Virginia set up that defense, get their defense set every time and say, you
know, okay, guys, have at it, they're just going to shut you down. They're the
best defensive team in the country. So I told them before the game, even if we
only get 3 points, even if we only get 5 points on fast break situations it's
going to be worth it, it's going to be worth pushing it every single time. But
they're a great transition defensive team, too. If you look at their numbers
on the year, very few offensive rebounds by any of their perimeter players.
They get back and they wall off. They make it tough to get anything.  
  
Q. Coach, your team showed a lot of resiliency and confidence even when
they got down. Your 2008 team took Duke to the brink. Did you show them that
game or did you even talk about that game heading into this one?  
COACH BYRD: No, we really didn't talk about that game at all. I think most of
our guys know the history of that game. This team again is not really as good
probably as some of the teams we've had over the last several years, but it is
the best I'm-not-going-to-quit team that I've ever had. We came back from
double figures time and time again this year to either win games or to make a
game of it similar to tonight. So I don't know, I don't know what that says.
Again, we're not as efficient, as sound, as good as some of our teams, but
never give up stuff, this team's got it.  
  
Q. If you've seen a ton of their games you probably saw the Justin
Anderson of February. Do you think you got the Justin Anderson of January here
tonight?  
COACH BYRD: Well, I think he's closer than he was a week ago obviously. He
stepped back and made a 3 tonight and that had to make him all feel good. And
when I say I saw a lot of games, to be honest I focused a lot more on their
defense and let our other guys watch more of their offense than I did. I
watched some of it for sure, but he's obviously, overall he's their best
offensive player I think overall. But the beauty of their team is that you've
got guys, Brogdon can do that, Gill can have a great game, what did he get,
16? You've got a lot of guys on that team that can score 15 or 16 points in a
game and up can't just focus on any one guy. They're a better offensive team
than they get credit for only because they're such a great defensive team.  
  
Q. Coach could you speak about the youth that you saw in the game
tonight, especially Amanze and Mack, and what they really brought inside the
paint for you guys?  
COACH BYRD: We are, we don't have a post player that's older than a sophomore
on our team. You heard those guys speak to where we can get possibly. So we
played all year long with guys making freshmen and young player mistakes in
there and we made a few tonight that Virginia didn't make because they're a
little more experienced and they executed when it came time to win and we
didn't get it done. But I'm excited about our team moving forward a whole lot.  
  
MODERATOR: One more question for Coach Byrd? That was it. Thanks, Coach.  
  
COACH BYRD: Thank you.

_CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

VIRGINIA - 79  
BELMONT - 67

COACH BENNETT: First of all, congratulations to Belmont on an outstanding
season and run at the end of the year. Really, Coach Byrd is a tremendous man,
a tremendous coach. He's kind of near and dear to my heart because he wears a
sweater vest and my father used to wear a sweater vest when he coached, I told
him that before, but what he's done with that program and how he's lasted was
remarkable. We knew it was going to be a very difficult, challenging game,
very dangerous. You just don't see a lot of teams that can spread the floor
like that, that can shoot the ball and have the kind of guys that just keep
coming at you, that can even bank 3s where they're going the way Bradshaw did.
But it was good for us to be in a game like that. Our young men have been in a
lot of games like that where we had to just outlast and stay in there and make
some plays and even overcome some of our mistakes, but find ways. And they had
to do that and I hope it will serve us well heading into Sunday's game against
obviously a very good Michigan State team.  
  
MODERATOR: Questions for Anthony, Malcolm.  
  
 Q. Malcolm, seemed like it was a second game in a row that maybe an
opponent sped you guys up a little bit offensively. Did you come into this one
being okay with playing a little faster or did they do something to control
the tempo in the first half?  
MALCOLM BROGDON: I think we're not a team that can't play faster tempo. I
think we can adjust, I think we play well at a faster tempo. I think they were
able to get us a little bit out of sorts but at the same time I thought it was
more on us than them. I thought we had a few defensive breakdowns, back door
cuts, losing vision of the ball and uncontested 3s that really sort of broke
us down and got us out of sorts.  
  
 Q. Malcolm, when Bradshaw banked the 3 and followed it up with another
3, he was pretty pumped at that point, and then you guys immediately turned
him over a couple of times. What are you thinking at that time when they get
that close and what did you do defensively to kind of get them out of that
mode?  
MALCOLM BROGDON: At that point in the game you're just thinking you've got to
get stops and for a player like him, you've got to make him uncomfortable. If
he's comfortable, he can make shots and sort of dictate what he does. Me,
myself, I tried to just pressure him, tried to get the ball out of his hands
and swipe at the ball as much as I can.  
  
 Q. For Anthony and then Malcolm, seemed like it was a concerted effort
to get you going inside, felt you had an advantage inside. Was that part of
the game plan and Malcolm, how big was Anthony all game?  
ANTHONY GILL: Yeah, I think that Coach Bennett told us before the game we're
going to call one of our plays to get the ball on the side and I think we
really wanted to take advantage of that. I think we had some opportunities
where we could rebound on the offensive end, too, and we did a really good job
of that. Darion, I think he had six offensive rebounds and that was big for
us, that was huge. When everybody's rebounding like that on the offensive end
I think we have a good chance.  
  
MALCOLM BROGDON: To follow-up, AG was huge for us. I thought second half he
stepped up made some big plays, had some huge rebounds for us, but that's
nothing new, he's been doing that all season and that's what we expect from
him every game.  
  
 Q. Anthony, did it feel like January again when you see Malcolm and
Justin getting hot there in the first half?  
ANTHONY GILL: Yeah, I think so, just to see Malcolm hitting all those shots in
the first half was awesome. Even to see Justin out there doing his thing and
being more confident out there. Actually I don't think he ever lost confidence
but to see him get his flow back and rhythm back was great for us and great
for him, too, just to see that.  
  
 Q. Malcolm, you guys talked yesterday about not wanting a close game in
this first round, you got one anyway. Was there any concern heading down the
stretch, how concerned were you that this team was hanging around?  
MALCOLM BROGDON: Down the stretch you're definitely concerned because that's a
very dangerous team, they hit quick shots and they make a lot of 3s, so they
make big plays. But it's all about us, we've known that all season, we know
that now, coming into the NCAA Tournament, we have to lock down on defense and
that's what we lean on every night, that's our foundation, so to be able to
lean on that at the end of the game is what we do best.  
  
 Q. Malcolm, you didn't shoot it in the second half the way you did in
the first half, yet you made your free throws. How big do you think the free
throws were in this game, 21 of 25?  
MALCOLM BROGDON: I think that's actually pretty astonishing that we shot them
like that. I think that's a huge improvement and very good, especially with a
team like that. At the end of the game we're in the bonus, you've got to make
free throws if you want to win in the NCAA Tournament and tonight we were able
to make free throws and hold them off.  
  
 Q. Malcolm, two part question. First off, offensively most of your
points in the first half, did they change something defensively against you in
the second half? And then your matchup with Bradshaw, what made him so hard to
guard?  
MALCOLM BROGDON: Just in the -- I thought they pressured me a little bit more,
tried to make me a little bit more uncomfortable in the second half but I put
it more on me, I just wasn't making shots. And then Bradshaw, he's shifty, he
shoots it when he wants, he makes a lot of shots and he plays with a lot of
confidence and when you play against another player that is as good as he is
and plays with that much confidence, he's going to be hard to guard.  
  
 Q. With Anderson healthy out there, you guys obviously showed what you
can do offensively, do you feel that area of your game is overlooked because
of how good you are defensively?  
ANTHONY GILL: I definitely think we have some talent on offensive, too. I
think that people do overlook that at times, they see our defense and see how
well we play on defense and then they just X out the fact that we play offense
sometimes, but I think that we have great players on offense and I think that
once we get into a rhythm we're able to exploit a lot of different things.  
  
 Q. I just want to get y'all's thoughts on having a rematch with
Michigan State on Sunday?  
ANTHONY GILL: I think that it's going to be good for us. Last year they beat
us in the Sweet 16 and I remember in the locker room everybody just said
remember how this feels. I think this isn't going to be a revenge game, just
us going out there and do what we do. I think everybody's hungry to go to the
next round and wants to keep moving on so I think we're ready for the
challenge and we're going to go out there and do it.  
  
MALCOLM BROGDON: I agree with Anthony one hundred percent, it's not about
revenge, it's about going out there and establishing ourselves and making it
to the next game. The hungrier team is going to win on Sunday so we're going
to come out and try to be hungry.  
  
 Q. Malcolm, can you talk a little bit about London, he hit some big
shots at several junctures of the second half?  
MALCOLM BROGDON: I thought he was terrific. London is a guy who's very poised,
he knows when to shoot and make the extra pass. In the second half, he stepped
up for us. They were clamping down a little bit on defense, denying the wings
and making it a little bit more difficult for us, and London took the ball in
his hands and made some huge plays for us to keep us ahead and keep us with a
decently comfortable lead.  
  
MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Bennett?  
  
 Q. Coach, as the players put, were you nervous down the stretch when it
got to 62-60?  
COACH BENNETT: They made some tough shots. I don't know if nervous is the
right word. I knew we were going to have to make some plays, some stops and
free throws. If you look at our 25 attempts to their six, that was significant
but to step up and make them, but you're never safe when you play a team like
that, that has that big shot ability that can score in spurts and hit kind of
unlimited range shots, and we did obviously. We had a stretch but we had to
make some adjustments and guard in some unconventional ways that we haven't
had to do all year. Some teams in our league did some thing so we had that to
draw on, but of course I knew that game was in the balance. Even my
assistants, he finally put his guys in at 26 seconds and I looked up and it
was a 12 or 13 point game and I said they're probably a team that could bang a
few 3s. But it wasn't until that point, when you are up 11 with a minute, you
just never know how quickly they can shoot 3s so we knew we had to finish it
out.  
  
 Q. I forget the total, was high 40s in turnovers in the last three
games combined, only seven today. How important was that to you offensively
and were you pleased with the improved ball security?  
COACH BENNETT: It was better. I think there's a couple offensive fouls in
there, too, so that even would lower it. You know, you can't have your offense
cost you. I think someone asked a question to Malcolm early, and perhaps a
couple times we settled for some outside shots. I think when we established
the inside a little more, we were better. And I think as a younger guy when
your shots are going in from the outside, you want to have guys confident to
take it. That's maybe when the games got -- I don't want to say fast, but we
didn't establish enough on the inside. But the ability for us, as I said,
offensively to not hurt our defense is significant, and that was more like it,
though they were hard to guard. We had some breakdowns defensively but ball
security, getting attempts up every time is so important and it was good to
see that number come down. They didn't go out and pressure as much but you
still had to take care of the ball and they were feisty with how they would
get in there and swipe and they weren't going to quit.  
  
 Q. Coach, Justin said it was really nice for once to talk about his
game and not his finger or his appendix. Did he ever show frustration or
anything to you maybe in practice about, hey, I keep getting asked about this,
I can't wait to get on the floor and show them? How nice it was for him to
actually do some talking on the floor?  
COACH BENNETT: He's a unique kid. Young man, I should say, I get in trouble
when I call these guys kids. He is unique. He never got discouraged. I
remember when he was supposed to be able to play for Louisville, has one
practice under his belt, had a decent practice, was excited to play and all of
a sudden he has to have the surgery and he said, Coach, he just said, my faith
is big, I'll be okay, and he was such an encourager through it. That, to me,
is remarkable to see someone who's in his spot who's having such a good year
and such a part of it and how it kind of took the wind out of his sail. His
attitude was impressive. Even during the games, that's real stuff, and I'm so
thankful he had that because I think it's helped him in his recovery and his
ability to play 26 minutes. That was the best of his three games.  
  
 Q. Asked Malcolm and Anthony about having another crack at Michigan
State on Sunday in the tournament. Want to get your thoughts.  
COACH BENNETT: Yeah, you're going from a master coach in Coach Byrd to one of
the greatest coaches in Coach Izzo. Great respect for that program. How it's
built, the physicality, the sounds, the toughness. Grew up respecting it, know
we'll have to be at our best, but I think it's a real good team that seems to
be playing very good basketball. I did watch most of the game against
Wisconsin and I said Michigan State's back and that's a real good 7-seed, no
doubt. When you get to this stage even in the first round or second round or
the next round, you're going to have to play at a high level, so I'm sure it
will be a physical game and a hard fought game, I expect that.  
  
 Q. This is probably the last thing you're thinking about but were you
aware that this is the first time Virginia's won 30 games in back-to-back
seasons?  
COACH BENNETT: Yeah, I study all those records. I was really encouraged about
it. No.  
  
 Q. I mean, what does it say?  
COACH BENNETT: It's the first time, you said, in the history of Virginia
basketball? They probably only played a 20 game schedule so that's probably
another reason why. That's a credit to these guys and what they've done just
to be able to sustain it. You know, we had a vision when we came in to try to
turn the program around and there's nothing better than being part of a
turnaround. But to establish it and try to stay at that level, that brings
other unique opportunities and challenges to at least establish that from a
win number is good and I'm very thankful. I'm thankful for the guys that have
stayed tough-minded, that haven't gotten caught up in how we do it but that we
do it, and we do it together and in a way that's best for us and that's all
week of do.  
  
 Q. Was there any sense of relief either during or after the game about
having a team at full strength for the first time since early February?  
COACH BENNETT: Yeah, I mean I don't know if anybody's at full strength at this
stage of the year but to at least be able, you look at Malcolm's stat line,
I'm sorry, Justin's stat line and then I think Darion and Anthony were moving
better than they did in the ACC tournament with their ankle. I knew that would
be important because it takes an incredible amount of energy and some of our
guys' games are reliant on how healthy they are, so just to have that, to be
able to come in with Marial. We slid Evan to the four in this game, matchup,
that's what you need, you have to be flexible to be able to match-up with
different kinds of teams so that was obviously the most healthy we've been for
quite a while.  
  
 Q. Coach, would Justin be starting against Michigan?  
COACH BENNETT: Well, we're playing Michigan State, so I don't think he'll be
starting against Michigan. We'll look at it and see the match-ups and all
that. He'll play, how's that for you?  
  
 Q. You mentioned Anthony. How important was it to establish him inside
early and how different are you guys when he gets going like that?  
COACH BENNETT: Yeah, it was important and I don't know how good of a job we
did because I mentioned we hit some 3s early and we kind of got -- that's a --
it's not Fool's Gold, that's too strong of a word but, hey, there has to be a
balance. We're not a high volume, that was 17. That was the way they condensed
the defense and you had to take some of those shots, and we made some, but
even if you touch the paint first and then kick it out. And I thought we
didn't do a great job but when we did, usually good things happened and that
was important for us with Anthony, Darion, that was a hard match-up game for
Mike Tobey but the ability to get inside. I thought London made a terrific
ball that was really key in that run. That was a little sideball screen and he
slipped it and then Anthony had a nice finish, so that was big.  
  
 Q. Tony, was there any explanation given on that play where it looked
like the shot clock might have expired, there was a lot of confusion there?  
COACH BENNETT: Yeah, I was confused, but, no, the official said that Marial
had possession of the ball and I don't know when he had possession of the
ball, maybe that was at the, I think maybe that was while the shot clock was
at 3 or 4, I don't know. I guess maybe he did. I think the guy came and it was
so fast, it was kind of a bang-bang play where he got it and the guy swiped it
out and the shot clock didn't reset. I think if he had possession, the shot
clock should have reset on that if they called it a turnover. Everybody was
kind of standing around. Seemed like, I don't know what the right answer is
but that was the explanation, that we got possession so the shot clock should
have reset and it was a shot clock error on the scorer's table.  
  
 Q. You generally don't switch on defense very much, particularly on the
perimeter. You did that more tonight than normal. Are you comfortable doing
that?  
COACH BENNETT: Well, we'll switch, like, some ball screens, and, look, they
have four guards and that was what Evan gave us, the flexibility. Rotations
are really tough against them because of how spread they are and sometimes
they're coming off ball screens, they balance it out more to take the quick
pass depending upon when someone is in there. So we changed our philosophy a
little bit of what we do in this game and I thought it was good for us. A
couple times we miscommunicated and they got some shots but very difficult
team to try to blow up the screen when they have a four man who really slips
the screen, a little bit like Mitoglou from Wake Forest when we played them.
So we just thought we had our normal defense and then we had a plan B and we
went a little more to plan B. And we even had a plan C we went to, too. I
thought it was effective for us, I'll watch the tape, but you have to have
that when you go against that, so I am flexible.  
  
 Q. Tony, you mentioned Michigan State against Wisconsin. Have you seen
them at any other point during the year and have you scouted them at all?  
COACH BENNETT: Just bits and pieces, not a whole lot. I just know that Coach
Izzo has a knack for getting his teams to really rise up and play at a high
level come March. He's just done it, you look at his track record, but
watching because I know how good Wisconsin, just from my interest being from
there and all that, I watched them a few times, and I know how well Wisconsin
was playing, so when I watched that Big Ten final, that was impressive. I
think they beat Maryland to get into that game in a tough, hard-fought game
and how well Maryland's playing. They have a knack, they've got guys with
experience. I remember how good Dawson was against us last year in the Sweet
16 game. He's got them playing at a high level, without a doubt. But watched
them just bits and pieces.  
  
 Q. You said after the Carolina game last week that that's not who we
are. I don't know what the exact numbers are for a 2 versus a 15 in a
tournament but obviously people will think maybe you escaped today but the
sense is you feel you played very well?  
COACH BENNETT: I think we were solid enough and made some plays. Every year I
think the seedings become less significant. You just look around how close the
games are, the upsets are there. It's just happening more and more. Parity is
here in college basketball and yeah, there have been two 15 upsets. We saw
one, it happens. So when you play a team, match-ups are so important. That was
a difficult match-up, I think, for anybody the way they were playing but that
was a hard one for us. We have had some trouble with teams that play like that
so I thought we responded in some ways. I don't know how well we played. We
played well enough, and I have great respect and I think there's things
certainly we can clean up and it will be a different kind of game come Sunday.
