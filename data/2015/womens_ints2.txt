_IOWA CITY, IOWA_  
  

IOWA  88  
MIAMI - 70

  
COACH MEIER: Of course, huge congrats to Iowa. That was just‑‑ that second
half, their offensive performance was incredible. It was the team destined to
go to the Sweet16 the way they were playing. At one point I think they were
9‑for‑11 to start the half and it was 80‑something percent. They ended up
being 75 percent in the half and 60 percent from the three, and destiny just
started following at halftime. That's the only thing they did wrong, missed a
couple free throws. They were really moving the ball and doing a great job.  
I think the key to the game, we cut it to six there and had Samantha Logic
miss a free throw and Doolittle came and got the free throw and then hit a
jumper in our face. And that's a huge basically four‑point swing there in a
six‑point game and from that point on I think we just kind of broke. We were
holding steady and playing tough.  
I told my team, we're quite young and they have got some great experience, and
I think that showed, and that the mental toughness, they were just sharper
than us in key moments, key plays. We did something that wasn't really smart,
like get a rebound and throw it right to Iowa and they never did something
that wasn't really smart in the last ten minutes of that basketball game.  
So we are going to learn from that, because I made Jessica stay out there and
watch that celebration. I want us to be a Sweet16 team and I want us to know
what it feels like. We're not quite ready, but we've got to get mentally
tougher, and when we do, we're going to be celebrating, as well.  
But I could not have more respect; I'm joyful for Lisa Bluder and her staff,
because I know how they operate and I see them recruiting; I know what class
they operate with. I know those kids work hard. Those seniors on that team
came here with a dream and I think they can go a long way.  
If this was going to happen and we were going to lose, at least I have the
utmost respect for the program that we lost to and I'm really happy for them
and I wish them the best of luck.  
  
Q. Adrienne, did Bethany Doolittle's performance surprise you guys? Did she
do some things you maybe just didn't expect?  
ADRIENNE MOTLEY: No, I don't think we were surprised. We know that that team
is full of great players and she just had a great performance. Looked like she
had a double‑double, and she played like a DivisionI basketball player that's
trying to make it to the Sweet16.  
So I definitely have to give my hat off to her and the rest of the team but as
far as your question, no, I don't think ‑‑ it wasn't surprising at all. She's
a great player.  
  
Q. I just wanted to get your thoughts on what Coach said, that you stood
there and watched that celebration. What was that moment like for you to see
Iowa celebrate and how do you think it's going to help your team that you did
that?  
JESSICA THOMAS: Well, I mean, it hurt a little bit but somebody had to lose
today. But like Coach said, we have a lot of respect for this team. Just
watching that, and coming back next year, putting in motivation and just put
more work in and be ready to be a Sweet16 team, as well.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Iowa ‑‑  
COACH MEIER: Yeah, center, our fives, our Doolittle assignment was left center
and that was the choice that we had to make because of their perimeter talent.
We just didn't do as good of a job as we should have. And when you play Iowa,
you have to break some of your basic fundamental defensive habits. You haven't
over‑help and in the first half we over‑helped and Doolittle was recipient of
dump‑offs and cleanups on the back side.  
So then we tried not to help off of her but basically three of them get a
couple threes. But it's hard to break some habits and stuff that our fives
have been doing all year, and we tried to do it in one day in, one practice.
But I think that her offensive rebounding is something that's no excuse for;
that wasn't over‑help. That was just, we didn't put a body on her on the free
throw line. And her then her under sub (ph) shot was something we wanted to
take away. So half of her points you can put on me and the other half we
didn't execute the game plan.  
  
Q. Iowa was 18 ‑0 at home this season. Could you talk about the atmosphere
today and did that factor in at all? How did your team handle this
environment?  
COACH MEIER: I would like to invite the entire Iowa fans to come to a home
game at Miami. It's really nice and warm. And I'll give them all free tickets
and I'd love them to come cheer for us, because it is a huge factor, it's an
amazing impact on the game.  
I told the refs before the game that I heard a rumor that when you get an NCAA
bid and you get on someone else's home court that they give you an extra
time‑out. So they went and checked the book, but that's not true (laughter)
but I needed one. I ran out of time‑outs. The crowd had a lot to do with
having to run out of time‑outs because they have tremendous fuel.  
It's really warm, I mentioned; nice weather. (Laughter).  
  
Q. I wanted to get your thoughts on that stretch without Mot when she was on
the bench with the four fouls, how difficult was that?  
COACH MEIER: Difficult. I'm going to live with that one for a while. It was
difficult, and when I went to go put her back in, it was a defensive
possession, so then I had to take her‑‑ I didn't want her to go back in on
defensive possession. So I was trying to get her in where we had the ball in
offense, and I probably wasted maybe two offensive possessions going that
because it's not smart to put her in when you're on defense.  
But we unraveled a little bit. It really was, I think the back‑breaking play
that made us lose our composure was that offensive rebound by Doolittle on
that little shot when we had done everything in the world to cut that game
back to six. Mot was out when we were cutting it, so, you know, I could have
put her back in that moment, would have been my decision.  
  
Q. You were talking about the crowd. It's a hostile crowd but is it still
good for kids to play in front of a big crowd even though it was the other
team's crowd?  
COACH MEIER: That's the thing; unfortunately, the NCAA, I think I've played in
a neutral court once. Every time we get a draw at Miami, we've been at
Gonzaga, we've been here; it's definitely a disadvantage for the team.  
But I think more of a disadvantage is to play in an empty stadium and I'm a
big fan of the first round‑‑ they earned it. Iowa earned it. They had a great
season. If I want to cry in my soup, I've got to make my team better and we
have to get a Top‑4 seed. And that's what I need to do instead of complaining
about getting a disadvantage on someone's away court.  
But I do think that extra time‑out rule might be something we should propose
(laughter). But they earned it and I have no regrets. We should have won more
games in the regular season and we wouldn't have been in this position.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_IOWA CITY, IOWA_  
  

IOWA  88  
MIAMI - 70

  
COACH BLUDER: I am almost in disbelief right now, not that we did it. We knew
we were going to do it. We felt great about it. But just the way it happened.
Our great crowd, I mean, our crowd was amazing today. To go 17‑0 on our home
court this season, with these‑‑ excuse me, 18‑0‑‑ see, Sam's always correcting
me. 18‑0 on our home floor and with this group of four seniors has been so
special.  
You know, we beat a really good Miami team. Katie is an excellent coach, very
talented team, a team that did great things and beat some really good people
during the year. But four people in double figures, we shot the ball well
again. That's kind of our M.O.  
I'm just really, really proud of our team and proud of all of our Hawkeye
fans, too. They just came out and we want to share it with all of them, we
really do.  
  
Q. Could you recognize even within the first two possessions that you were
not going to get any open looks, pretty much all day, unless you created them?
How difficult was that once you saw that because that really limits what you
can do on the arc.  
BETHANY DOOLITTLE: Yeah, they did a really good job of just knowing where I
was at all times. But the beauty of our team is there's so many different
threats on our team that if they are going to take away my shooting; that I
have four other teammates that are going to have wide open looks. You can't
take away everything on our team and if they tried to take away that, then
other people are going to be open.  
  
Q. Sam, what do you think Bethany Doolittle looked like today?  
SAMANTHA LOGIC: A stud. I mean, simply put. She just played one of her best
games I've seen in a really long time, if ever. We just wanted to keep feeding
her and keep going to her and if she didn't do it, she got the O‑board and she
got it herself. We play like that, and then you combine it with like she said,
four other people on the floor that can spread you out and have so many
offensive weapons, it's going to be tough.  
  
Q. Sam, it's no secret that this has been a goal. Coach called this a
mission since day one this year. How does it feel to finally make it?  
SAMANTHA LOGIC: Unbelievable. We are really excited. I think it has not even
completely hit me yet. We are still playing, like Coach said, 18‑0 on our
floor, going to the Sweet16 is something we've wanted to do since we've gotten
here. Obviously it took four years but we're happy to do it right now.  
  
Q. Bethany, was this your best game?  
BETHANY DOOLITTLE: I mean, with the circumstances at hand, I think it was
pretty good outcome for us. I obviously don't want this season to be over, and
ending on this note at home is great, 18‑0\. So I think we just wanted to keep
going and I wanted to play hard for my teammates and play hard for the crowd
that came out today.  
  
Q. What is it like for a starter when you see, I think the three players off
the bench combined to go 7-for-9 from the field. What's it like when you see
that support coming off the bench?  
SAMANTHA LOGIC: It's huge. We flow, we have that much confidence in them every
single time they are on the floor. Kali played huge minute; Lexi have played
huge minutes. Chase was in there for five, but I mean, she had six points.
It's just huge. We're so happy for our bench.  
I mean, they come in and work their butts off in practice every single day and
not just those three. The other six that didn't get in, they come in and work
so hard making us better. So I mean, it's really nice to see them reap the
benefits of that because they deserved it.  
  
Q. For Beth, did you think you were going to get ‑‑ you had shots from
pretty much all over the floor. Was that where you thought you would get shots
today?   
BETHANY DOOLITTLE: I don't think you can ever kind of predict where you're
going to get shots but I just tried to take what was given to me and my
teammates found me in the right places and I tried to get positions so they
could get out better passes into me.  
So it just kind of worked out in our favor today. But that's what you look for
in this kind of energy‑‑ or this kind of environment, and the energy we get
from our crowd here. We got the best for what we were given in the game.  
  
Q. For all three student athletes, how will you remember this day with this
crowd with the stakes this high?  
BETHANY DOOLITTLE: It's something we'll never forget. The crowd that came out
today, our friends and family supporting us, this group of girls; our awesome
coaching staff, just seeing everybody in the center of the court after the
game smiling, singing, dancing everything together, is just something that
will be in my memory for the rest of my life. I can't wait to keep it going.  
SAMANTHA LOGIC: Yeah, I think she said it all. We've had that much support so
often since we have been here. It's just awesome to go out and win our last
game in Carver, and with those stakes so high, getting to the Sweet16 and
finally reaching that goal.  
MELISSA DIXON: Yeah, like the other two said, we are going to remember this
forever. We are so happy, especially with the huge crowd that came out; and to
play our last game in Carver and to make it to the Sweet16 is pretty special,
and we're going to remember it forever.  
  
Q. In the last eight minutes of the game, this team was at it's very best,
wasn't it?  
COACH BLUDER: I think we were pretty focused. I think the last three minutes
took forever and I thought this team was incredibly focused; that last ten
minutes, I thought we played very good basketball and we shot the ball well.
And when you shoot the ball 75 percent, you're going to be hard to beat.  
You know, we didn't shoot well from the free throw line. I was ready to have
us quit shooting free throws and start shooting threes because we're shooting
better from everywhere. Uncharacteristically from the free throw line not
doing a good job. But I thought we played very well during those closing
minutes.  
  
Q. So much of your success has been driven by the senior class. Can you
touch a little bit on the growth of the people that will be back in the
program next year and how much they have contributed to this run, too?  
COACH BLUDER: Well, I think our bench was really good today. The three women
that did get in today, Kali Peschel, people don't realize she's the second
best three‑point shooter on our team. She's the second best free throw shooter
on our team. She's coming in and doing great things. I think she's playing the
best basketball of her career right now.  
Chase Coley, she's automatic. She has got the best left hand I've ever seen.
We need to get her a little stronger over the summer, but we will. She
obviously played well. Lex came in and did some great things for us
defensively, took care of the ball.  
And then the other six players, as Sam said, that didn't get into the game
today, that worked so hard every single day and don't get the glory; and to me
they are the heros. Because you come to practice, and you give everything you
have to practice without the reward of getting in, which is everybody's
ultimate reward, that's hard work. That's mental toughness right there.  
  
Q. Coach Meier said that, I think I've got the right place in the game, they
cut the lead down to six, it was 69 ‑63, and Sam missed a free throw and then
Bethany got the rebound, and then she scored on a 15‑foot jumper. She said
that really sort of turned the game around. Was that indicative of the kind of
game Bethany played?  
COACH BLUDER: Well, I thought Bethany was outstanding, and you know, she was
pretty humble up here, but she's so capable of that. I told her over and over
again, I have so much confidence with the ball in your hands, and we really
challenged her to rebound today and she did it.  
She came out; and how important were those six offensive rebounds, and
especially the one I felt like when she missed and got it on rebound and put
it back in, that was big. But I mean, when you're getting down to now you're
playing against such good competition, it's about possessions, it's about
taking care of the ball and rebounding and today we out‑rebounded a pretty
good basketball team by nine.  
  
Q. Coach Meier said she was happy for you. She says you do things the right
now. These kids have been here four years and you've been doing this for about
30. What does this mean to you?  
COACH BLUDER: Do I look a lot lighter? I think there's a monkey off my back. I
feel like I might look a little bit lighter right now. You know, we've been
there so many times, and just not been able to finish it.  
This year, coming into the year, knowing that the Top‑4 seeds were going to be
hosting; and we started talking about it right away, how it was a different
year. It was a special year with the experience that we had returning. We had
so much coming back.  
This group had been there. They had been there before and it's time to be able
to finally do it and to do it on Carver Hawkeye Arena floor, it's a good
feeling. Quite probably has not sunk in all the way for me yet. I'm just so
happy for this group of seniors and Kathryn Reynolds in there with it, as
well. She's going to be a heck of a lawyer and I told her yesterday, she's got
one thing left to add to her resumé, she's a Sweet16 basketball player and
today she did that for us.  
  
Q. In the first half didn't shoot all that well ‑‑ did you notice something
they changed defensively that allowed such a drastic change in the second
half?  
COACH BLUDER: They really spread out. They were trying to take away the three
in our opinion. But again, if you take away the three, that's fine. We were
smart. We didn't shoot a bunch then. We didn't try to make a bunch of threes
that weren't there and I thought was really important because sometimes we
really want to make those threes.  
We only shot nine today and we made five of them, great percentage but what
that does is opened up the middle. It opened up things for Beth. It opened up
drives for other players. We always felt as a team, you take away one of our
weapons, we've got a lot more.  
  
Q. Question on fouls, especially the first half, Miami was really racking
them up. Did you and the rest of your staff get a sense of, just have to lean
on them a little bit and eventually that foul trouble will decimate their
offense; we saw some of that when some of their top players ran into that. Did
you get a sense it was going to work out if it stayed like that in the second
half?  
COACH BLUDER: We felt like when their centers got in foul trouble, we really
tried to isolate them with Beth because those two players are really good
rebounders. And we wanted them out of the game.  
And we felt like Beth had the upper hand inside, and I thought we did a really
good job of iso'ing those post players and being able to get them out of the
game.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Lisa. On behalf of the NCAA and University of Iowa,
we want to thank you guys for being here all weekend and hopefully you'll see
us in Oklahoma City.

_IOWA CITY, IOWA_  
  
COACH MEIER: Whoever made this tournament, these four teams, offense, offense,
offense, so unbelievable games yesterday. Unbelievable ball movement, great
coaching, and so you know, you game plan for a Washington team that you just
can't believe how talented they are on the offensive end and their ability to
make plays and make shots and how they put the ball in the right player's hand
at the right time.  
And then you win that game, you celebrate for about half an hour, and then you
start watching Iowa and you're like, my God, all right, well, here's another
team that knows exactly where the ball should go, plays at a serious pace.
Everybody takes gutsy shots on their team.  
I think that's the thing I love the most about them is that they have such
guts, and the dagger shot doesn't just come from one person. I mean, Dixon's
dagger (ph) is pretty darned impressive. But there's a lot of people on the
team who will take the big shot and step up. Yeah, nobody backs down; nobody
hesitates.  
So the bags under my eyes are well earned, and we've got a lot of work to do.
But it should be an awesome game.  
  
Q. Iowa has been an average to below average team rebounding this year. Is
that something you feel that you can exploit tomorrow?  
JESSICA THOMAS: Every game, we've got to come out and make sure we put a body
on everybody on the rebounding end, that's defensive, offensive. We see Iowa
has a lot of size in the paint, so as a team, it's just going to be a total
effort of beating every board, boxing out and getting our run‑outs.  
ADRIENNE MOTLEY: I agree with Jessica. They have a great amount of size, and
just making sure, like she said, finding a body and securing the rebounds.  
I think every game, that's pretty much the game plan, so can't say this is a
specific game where we focus on it. I think every game we should focus on
that.  
  
Q. For both of you, Iowa has not lost at home yet this season. To be able to
come in here and have to face that kind of environment, how prepared do you
guys feel for that, especially with what you guys were able to do in the ACC
this season?  
JESSICA THOMAS: I feel like you go back to the game we played Louisville at
home, it was a crazy environment. I mean, we are back in it. Hopefully we can
take that, come together as a team and just take on whatever comes in front of
us.  
ADRIENNE MOTLEY: I think any away game in the ACC can be comparable to playing
here. Playing at Duke‑‑ I think she forgot about, we played at Cameron; again,
playing at Louisville, playing at Pitt, playing at Carolina last year. I think
we do pretty well with playing away games. But we just have to focus and play
Miami basketball.  
  
Q. Obviously Katie touched on watching some of the film already. What have
you guys seen about what Iowa can do and the pace? Again, it's going to be
more basketball which you like, but what have we seen from Iowa already?  
JESSICA THOMAS: On the offensive end, they can score from anywhere on the
floor. You know, they have threats in the post, they have threats on the
perimeter, and they have a shooter that ‑‑ in particular, Dixon, but you know,
they have got shooters all around the perimeter. So we've got to lock down our
defense and make sure we take every stop serious.  
ADRIENNE MOTLEY: Again, they can shoot the ball ridiculously well point‑blank
period. They are a great‑shooting team and we just have to be grounded on
defense. We can't play lackadaisical. We have to know where our man is at all
times.  
Coach was saying we have to hold our own pretty much this game. I know we have
been relying‑‑ not relying, but we have help side, or rail as we call it, but
this game we really have to hold our own on the defensive end.  
  
Q. With Iowa's ability to score, do you plan to try to get into a track meet
with them and try to out ‑score them or do you hope to shut them down as best
you can and make it more of a defensive game?   
COACH MEIER: Great question but we're not going to give the game plan away
just yet. (Laughter).  
  
Q. You talked about Iowa's guts. Could you expand on that?  
COACH MEIER: Well, it's the games you watch, and who hits the money shot, who
is their gamer, what are very going to do. You watch the Big Ten Tournament
and they run an out‑of‑bounds play beautifully executed and it's Doolittle.
And then they run must‑shot (ph), they are going to run Dixon off some
screens.  
And then Samantha Logic is responsible for half the team's points. I mean, if
you literally break her down, she has 15 points in a game, she has nine
assists in their conference games; and half of those assists are
three‑pointers so you're talking about 20, 21 points right there. So you're
talking about 36 points from one player.  
So obviously it starts and ends with her, but then she puts the ball where it
needs to go in those moments and has every ability to find‑‑ she makes some
passes that you don't see a lot of females be able to make, because of her
strength, because of her balance. You might choose who you might leave open
and I think she's probably going to be a step ahead of most coaches in that
category. She's going to find what you leave open.  
  
Q. Just to get back to the environment that you guys are going to face
tomorrow; here a couple years ago, what do you think some of the older players
have taken from that, and obviously the ACC experience you hope everyone can
use tomorrow.  
COACH MEIER: I said this my first press conference here. The crowd is a smart
crowd. I mean, they are a disruptive crowd. They know when to get loud. They
celebrate a dag (ph) for three as well as any crowd does in the country.  
We love it. I love it for women's basketball and I love it for Lisa. I mean,
she's built this program and she's a great, great lady and she deserves this
kind of support. So I'm happy to be here. It's not going to be a negative for
us, but it did‑‑ it can be very rattling, especially when they go to some of
their traps and stuff and you're trying to communicate with your players.  
I remember that from two years ago, we were here, and players are far away
from you, you're trying to communicate and they are throwing some traps at
you, and so we have to prepare for that, as well.  
  
Q. Does the offensive preparation that your folks had for Washington, does
that translate into what you have to accomplish here today?  
COACH MEIER: For what we needed to score? Yes, I'm glad we scored 86 last
night (laughs) because there are some obvious ways, philosophical choices that
you have to make in playing Iowa. If one of them is okay, don't yell at your
defense too much, just score on the other end, don't have that hangover,
that's definitely one of them. They are great. They are going to score. So we
do have to answer with some points, as well.  
  
Q. Considering how the last week of the regular season went, I think I saw
that yesterday they needed that; they needed to see that they could put 86
together; that it wasn't just Mot. How much did they need that just to be able
to see that they were back on track and to feel like they were playing good
basketball after those three tough, tough losses, which were also good
basketball.  
COACH MEIER: In the ACC tournament, our first game against Virginia, we had
great looks; we didn't hit them, but our defense held. I thought the Notre
Dame game is actually where we freed ourselves up, got our dandy back, got our
pace back. And when you do that against Notre Dame, you feel good about losing
against almost anybody.  
And forget about them, I needed it (laughing). I missed them. It's nice to
have them back. No, they are a great group and they will do whatever you need
them to do. But I thought last night, our offensive balance, Motley was very
impressive but throughout the game; maybe you noticed or not, I thought
throughout the game: Oh, my God, Mot's on fire. She was hitting very rhythm
shots. I thought it was a quiet 30, if that ever has happened before.  
But I know Shelly Woods was being aggressive on the offensive end; and Nicole
Sterling kept us in the first half; and Jessica Thomas with a bit of foul
trouble coming off the bench and giving us that spark was huge. You know, I
see it every day in practice so it's just‑‑ you're right. Showing up in the
game and a big stage like that was huge for us.

_IOWA CITY, IOWA_  
  
COACH BLUDER: Good to be here today. Obviously love playing in the second
round.  
You know, right now, I think coming into this year‑‑ Patrick, our unbelievable
SID gives me all these great facts. He told me, I think there's only 20 other
schools in America that have made it to the last two straight NCAA second
rounds, and now we're in our third year of doing that. So I'm sure that number
is going to go down. And it's great to be here but I don't think it's any
secret that we want to go farther; that we would love to be playing next week.  
We know that Miami is a great team and they have the same goals as we do. I
feel like home‑court advantage is tremendous. I think we are going to have a
great crowd here tomorrow at 11 o'clock and I think they are going to help us.  
Our seniors have been great leaders all year for us and they are going to do
it again tomorrow. And I'm excited about the game. I think it's going to be a
great game. And we'll hopefully be pretty excited tomorrow at this time.  
  
Q. Is it fair to say that this is the best opportunity for advancement that
you've had in your four years?  
SAM LOGIC: I think on paper it is. You know, being the higher seed on our home
floor the last two years here, we've been eight and then a six, playing a
really good three seed last year in Louisville, probably deserved to be a
little higher than that.  
On paper, yes, but as you've seen in the men's tournament, and now in the
women's a little bit more, numbers really don't matter. It's just how you go
out and play. So we are not looking at numbers and how good of a chance we
have. We know we are going to have to execute and play a really great game
tomorrow.  
ALLY DISTERHOFT: Yeah, just what Sam said, it's the NCAA Tournament now and
anything can happen. You have to be ready to go on any given night. I totally
agree. Seeding doesn't matter at this point. You have to come out from the get
go with that intense mind‑set and that's what we plan to do tomorrow.  
WHITNEY JENNINGS: This is my first year in the tournament but on paper we are
the team that's supposed to win. We feel good that we're back in Carver and
17‑0 and just looking to build on that tomorrow afternoon.  
  
Q. With how you shot from the outside in the second half, how much of a
boost of enthusiasm did you feel from the crowd yesterday? We saw at key
points in the game you or Melissa would pop from the outside in the second
half; was that a nice boost to get at certain points when you needed it
against American?  
ALLY DISTERHOFT: Our fans have been amazing all throughout the year. We talk
about it all the time. There's nothing better than running out of the tunnel
to 10,000 screaming fans, whether it's hitting a big shot or passing it to
Beth, Sam, Melissa, whoever, for a wide‑open shot and hearing that the fans
are up, that's a great feeling.  
So we really hope that our fans again come out and support us tomorrow. They
make a huge difference in the game. They are influencers and they have done
great things for us this year, we really do appreciate it.  
  
Q. You've been at this for a long time, 15 years at high with a, in your
mind; this your best opportunity to break through and get to the Sweet16?  
COACH BLUDER: You know, I think it is. Again, I think the women explained it
really well up here. You know, on paper, definitely; but you come into a game,
and depth‑‑ Miami is a talented team. They are athletic, they are quick, they
are good outside shooters. They are well coached. We know it's going to be a
battle and this time of year, it's a lot of times, it's who gets hot: Who gets
hot at end of the year; who playing with that confidence; who has got the
emotion on their side.  
And so all those things come into play, and I think less important are the
seedings, especially when you get into the second round, and more important is
who is believing in them and their team at this point.  
  
Q. Does it get to a point where with a team like this, where you can almost
‑‑ I don't want to say being hands‑off in practice, but you know that they
know what the mission is. You have enough leadership on this team where you
can make smaller tweaks as the season goes on. Has it been like that for you
this year with this crew?   
COACH BLUDER: Well, this team, the leadership is amazing with this group. And
it comes in so many ways, not only in them directing each other on what to do
but also just in what they are saying in the locker room and how they lead by
example. And so all those different ways, it's been a great group for leaders.  
But I wouldn't say it's been hands‑off, but certainly they have needed less
guidance than other groups.  
  
Q. For what you need to do for tomorrow ‑‑  
COACH BLUDER: They are really good outside shooters. I mean, they are smooth.
I mean, Motley, she is a really good offensive player. I mean, she has 30
points last night against Washington. Her jump shoot is smooth and she is
very, very good with that.  
They are an excellent defensive team. They scored well over their offensive
averages last night but defensively, they are holding people well below their
averages, and so that's I think probably the thing that bothers us or worries
us the most as coaches is just making sure that our offense can run smoothly
and we can take care of the ball.  
  
Q. Maybe keep them away from the three point line and funnel them a little
bit further inside on offense?  
COACH BLUDER: Well, they get to the free throw line a lot, obviously because
they put the ball on the floor so well. You know, we definitely don't want to
get into foul trouble against them and draw fouls trying to defend their
drives.  
But if you defend their drive well, they will take out their three‑point
shooters, and they have got a variety of three‑point shooters, as well.  
  
Q. How does this Miami team compare to the one you played two years ago and
how does this matchup compare to the one two years ago?  
COACH BLUDER: I think there was only two seniors on the team that are the same
from that squad.  
They had a big center last time and she was a presence. She was really one of
those immovable girls. I think their inside game is a little different. I'm
not saying it's less effective. I'm just saying it's different. I think they
have more balance now than they did, and I think they are just a little bit
more‑‑ they are better shooters than they used to be.  
  
Q. Even though they are an 11th seed, they did beat Notre Dame. Is that
something that you can use to kind of get everybody's attention?  
COACH BLUDER: Yeah, and our team knows that. But they have beat Syracuse; they
have done their job all year long. I really don't know why they were an 11
seed to be quite honest because like three of their losses are a total of five
points. They have been right there with everybody.  
And so this is a good basketball team from a good conference. You know, again,
we're going to have our work cut out for us. But I think home court; I think
we're on a mission; you know, Sam Logic, I think she's pretty hard to defend.  
I think you look at her on film and you watch Melissa's shot on film, and you
think, yeah, that's pretty good, that's a pretty quick shot. But until you
play against it, you don't know what it's like.

_IOWA CITY, IOWA_  
  

MIAMI  86  
WASHINGTON - 80

  
COACH MEIER: Well, I don't know that I've ever coached a game where the other
team had five players in double figures and we won. But that had to be one of
the funnest games to coach in that I've had in my career, and it had to be
awesome for the fans and for television.  
I think there were 13 or 15 ties in the game. The players were just making
plays. It was just a beautiful women's basketball game. I thought well
executed by both teams, and just‑‑ I think when I watch it on film, I'm going
to have even more film. I just thought it was amazing. And it's not like
nobody choked or there was some all of moment. Everything was just really
positive. Both coaches were really positive with their teams and players made
plays.  
There were some awesome young people out there playing with toughness and
guts, and I got two of them to my right here and they carried us. They were
unbelievable. But I will say that if I had a third up here, I would have
Michelle Woods, because her defensive effort on Kelsey Plum was as fine an
effort as you're ever going to watch.  
  
Q. To be able to come into the NCAA Tournament and to put together the game
that you had today, I watched a little during warm ups and it looked like you
were in a zone. Did you feel going out there that you could do something like
what you did today?  
ADRIENNE MOTLEY: I woke up from my nap after pregame and was like, I feel
pretty good right now. Just going out there and getting a feel for the court.
I know Coach asked mehow I felt out there, and I was just like, it feels good.
I just had this kind of feeling today, and it just so happened that we came
out here and we executed and I was just hitting shots. That's basically what
it is. My teammates were setting me up and just talking to me as they usually
do. Today it just felt different. Like I said, just a different feel.  
  
Q. (No mic).  
ADRIENNE MOTLEY: No. I don't think so. It was just we really needed this game
and we worked so hard for it. I think everybody realized that when we play
hard and when we come together, great things can happen.  
  
Q. As Coach said, you've always prided yourselves on your defense and what
Michelle was able to do today; can you tell us what you were able to do with
Kelsey and maybe talk about Michelle's performance in particular?  
JESSICA THOMAS: Shelly's performance actually is what motivated us. You see
her going so hard on the backcourt and pressuring Plum, one of the best
players in the Pac‑12‑‑ not the best, but you see that happening, in the
backcourt, you're just, well, we've got to do our part. You're working your
tail off, we've to do our part in the back. Just came down to big rebounds,
big stops, big steals. All glory to Shelly; she played really well.  
COACH MEIER: If game time was 11:00, what time was the nap? (Laughter) All
right, go to bed.  
  
Q. Would you elaborate on what your student athletes had to stay?  
COACH MEIER: Yeah, looking at it, I think we got 66 of our 86 points from our
three starting guards, and yet that's not what we are going to talk about.
It's going to be their defensive effort. Jessica was being humble, too, but
she did, there's a lot of pressure on our guards to defend today and the fact
that they defended with such passion and energy.  
And then we had 66 of our 86 points, that's got a lot to do with weight room
and conditioning. We had the ten days where we really needed to get back to
who we were. We were kind of limp towards the end of the season and now we're
fresh again.  
  
Q. Mike talked yesterday about the pace, and your girls talked about the
pace being an advantage. Those practices, that conditioning that you guys did
in that ten days, if you could put into words what you saw out there and the
difference it made.  
COACH MEIER: The last thing I said at halftime when we were walking out is,
nobody's tired, nobody's hurt and nobody needs a sub. You just have to keep
this mentality. There's nothing to wait around for anymore. I said, spill it
out there on the court, spill it out there, you have to, and that's what they
did.  
There's times I thought in the first half, I thought our pace was really the
reason why‑‑ we had a great defensive stops at the end of the half, I think
maybe 2 for 17 they went and 0 for their last 9 they had not had a field goal.
I do believe that was our defense, it was the result of our offense's pace.
Our defense did hold but I thought we had an advantage there.  
  
Q. Adrienne also had the big game against Notre Dame.  
COACH MEIER: She is somebody that her pull‑up when she goes to shoot it, the
person on the bench is counting, they are already writing two as soon as she
elevates, it's just so consistent. If we get ourselves in situations where get
her teammates move the ball properly and we can get her in what we call
downhill a little bit, she's really hard to guard.  
And that Notre Dame game and this game, I thought it was‑‑ they did a great
job. She didn't start with the ball a lot but she sure ended up with it a
little bit.  
  
Q. A big play, Davenport got the rebound after the missed free throw and
kept the possession; can you just talk about that play?  
COACH MEIER: It was huge. It was really huge. The game was never‑‑ when they
took that five‑point lead, we've had a lot of close games. We've had a lot of
big‑time players make big‑time plays in our face and some are heartbreaking,
sometimes we are the ones making the plays. So we have been through it and I
thought nobody got rattled. I thought that was huge.  
But it's funny, because part of the pregame speech, I said, you know, you have
the confidence; you have enough big wins, you have the resumé, but you also
have the pain. You have the pain of some of these losses. You have the pain of
a missed box‑out. You have the joy of getting an offensive rebound on a missed
free throw, and we have won a game that way, too, and then it happened again
today with Erykah. That was the joy part that we really love. It was a huge
play by a freshman.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll let Coach get on with the business of getting prepared
for Sunday. Thank you.

_IOWA CITY, IOWA_  
  

MIAMI  86  
WASHINGTON - 80

  
COACH NEIGHBORS: Really want to thank the University of Iowa and the NCAA for
treating us first class. Our message to these three kids here when she showed
up at Washington four years ago was that the NCAA Tournament is a very special
thing. It took us four years to get here.  
But I can tell you that they have been treated in a first‑class manner; that
it was everything we had built it up to be and even more. So thanks to Iowa
for hosting, they are doing a great job and NCAA for treating us tremendously.  
Congratulations to Miami. They were tremendous this afternoon. I thought their
players did exactly what their players have been doing all year long. I
thought Michelle Woods really led her team, and Motley did the scoring and
they all just rebounded and really played a good game.  
All the credit goes to them. We were just standing back there in the media
room thinking that that was one ever our better games that we played. They got
us at our best and they beat us and our congratulations go to them.  
  
Q. Talia, looked be like down the stretch you needed one more bucket to get
over the hump. Was that the case ‑‑ you had some good looks, if one of those
shots would have gone.  
TALIA WALTON: Through the course of the game, coach always said you don't know
what play it is that's going to be a determining factor from flip to buzzer. I
think a lot of shots in the first half we missed, we normally make, the whole
team. But I think we fought really hard, and it was nice at the end of the
stretch for a couple of those to go down.  
  
Q. Maybe a little hard now but can you sum up your Washington career and
being able to end it in the NCAA Tournament, and just all you've gone
through?  
JAZMINE DAVIS: To sum it up, I would say I'm really proud of us. I'm really
proud of how we played tonight and I'm just glad that I have the opportunity
to play with such great women on this team. It made me a better person on and
off the court, and those are the moments and memories that I'll cherish and
take on with me.  
AMINAH WILLIAMS: It's been just an amazing ride starting from my freshman year
and ending at my senior year by going to the NCAA Tournament. I'm just really
thankful for the opportunity.  
  
Q. There was a lot of talk coming in about the pace in which Miami played
and in Coach said it looked like the video was faster, had been speeded up.
What was your thoughts going through it how quickly they can play and how
quickly they can move up and down the court?  
TALIA WALTON: Coach didn't exaggerate. They are extremely fast. They have a
lot of good players, good guards that can push the ball and keep the tempo
going the entire game and that works to their favor. They executed very well
tonight.  
So they were extremely fast, I would say that, as opposed to going back and
forth, back and forth with them, it was tiring. But you just fight through it
and big credit to them.  
COACH NEIGHBORS: You know, those three kids there‑‑ Talia is a redshirt
freshman, so she came in with those kids did. Their first day on campus was
one of my first days on campus. I was an assistant coach then.  
Y'all cover this game enough to know that in today's society, when things get
tough, sometimes a lot of kids don't stick it out. They transfer; they look
for the easy road.  
This group had about three or four chances to change and break apart. They
went through two coaching changes while they were there. One on their way to
campus. We had ups and downs and they could have at any point in time taken
that easy road and done what a lot of student athletes over the last four
years have done and they did not, in fact, they stuck together and they raised
the level of play at the University of Washington and expectations at the
University of Washington, and they will leave a legacy that's going to take a
long time to really supplant.  
  
Q. You talked about this being the best game you played all year. What would
have been the thing that would have made it a victory?  
COACH NEIGHBORS: Yeah, I think we could have made a few more plays. The first
half, we got some really good shots. At halftime maybe Kelsey and Jazz were
one‑for‑seven. Those numbers may be a little off, but I think that's pretty
close. I think we were a little nervous, and it's to be expected.  
Again, when we built this up for four years like we have, we were all nervous
mand it took some of us a little bit longer to get over it. If we could have
shaken the jitters off a bit earlier, that could have been the difference. It
was a one‑possession game down there so with he had to start fouling.  
Really proud of our kids for fighting back when we got down double‑digits to
go back and take the lead. We probably could have made a play or two more, and
maybe come up with a tough rebound. There was a couple times we got stops and
instead of being a rebound to go in transition, it turned into a jumped ball
and we had to defend on the out‑of‑bounds play.  
So I don't know that we were‑‑ that we executed the best that we have all year
but it was really, really close and they certainly took our best effort and
were able to win.  
  
Q. After they missed a couple free throws and the freshmen came in and got
the rebound ‑‑  
COACH NEIGHBORS: That was the one I was really specifically talking about.
Still a one‑possession game at that point. We could have gone down three.
Instead, she gets that rebound and it changes the complexion of the game.  
We work on that an awful lot, and you know, you can have the best technique in
the world and sometimes the ball just doesn't bounce your way. So I can live
with a couple of those but that rebound was a huge play for them. And I
thought it kind of turned the momentum. It maybe took a little bit of fire out
of our kids.  
I think our kids still thought until that rebound there was plenty of time and
a chance; but you could see the difference in their eyes when you brought them
out. We were having to go offense, defense at the end and when that offensive
group came out, there was a little bit of look in our eye like, that was our
chance, and you nailed it right on the head. That was a good observation.  
  
Q. Their early shooting, were you comfortable with the shots that Plum had,
maybe just didn't go down?  
COACH NEIGHBORS: Absolutely. We need to play fast. You hear it talked about a
lot in the Tournament, it's all about match‑ups. I would have preferred a team
that wasn't used to playing at the pace that we are. I think they probably
were really excited about the draw because they knew we wanted to play fast.  
I'm okay with it. And I think 99 times out of a hundred, a lot of those shots
go down. Just a general statement, too. Anybody that over the last few years
says women's basketball is not entertaining to watch, they didn't watch that
game. There were only ten turnovers combined by the two teams. Had to be a 90
possession game, up‑tempo, very athletic. I thought it was very well played.
And I hope a lot of people got to watch it and we'll continue to support
women's basketball because it's a great game.

_IOWA CITY, IOWA_  
  

IOWA  75  
AMERICAN - 67

  
COACH GEBBIA: Seeing kids cry in the locker room is never an easy thing. I'm
so proud of them; they have never been here before. They have never played in
front of so many fans before cheering against them, and yet throughout the
entire game, they thought. And if you told me we were going to shoot 44
percent from two, 43 percent from three, and 87 percent from the line and
lose, I would have been shocked by that.  
I just think that this group represented American University extremely well
and the Patriot League extremely well. Had three great seniors that have led
us all year.  
Iowa is a terrific team. They just shot better than we did, which, credit to
them, playing on their home court, home crowd, ready for the Tournament, you
have to give them credit. But I'm just so proud of this team because they were
able to keep it close the entire way.  
  
Q. You guys got behind by ten or 12 and then cut it down 69 ‑64 and had two
possessions where you had 3‑pointers. Anything in particular that you were
trying to get out of those possessions against Iowa's zone, it was tough to
get shots it looked like.   
JEN DUMIAK: Yeah, it was tough getting shots. They are long, probably longer
than most teams we've faced this year, especially in our league. We were just
looking for an open shot, honestly, just a bucket. Ari was on fire. I think
one of her rimmed in and out.  
We just wanted to score, really. Obviously they didn't fall and they were
critical possessions but that's the way the game goes.  
  
Q. Ari, you seemed to have the really hot hand today. What was it about
Iowa's defense that let you get such great opportunities?  
ARI BOOTH: I had a lot of space pretty much, and if you give me that much
space, I'm going to shoot it. Again, I was getting great screens from my post
players and I just felt good about it, had a clean look and was able to shoot
it.  
  
Q. Following up to that, what happened in the second half? It took a really
long time for you to get another basket. Were they just a little more
cognizant of your position?  
ARI BOOTH: Yeah, they started pressuring me a little more and getting their
hands up as soon as I caught the ball, so I had to either dribble or pass it.  
  
Q. It was a big crowd, kind of noisy. Did it cause any trouble as far as
setting up the plays or directing the whole offense?  
JEN DUMIAK: Not so much in the first half, but definitely in the second half
when it got loud in their zone, we were trying to call out plays. We have hand
signals but I'm not the best as using them or remembering them. So that's kind
of a problem.  
But yeah, I mean, it was great playing in front of the crowd, even though they
were rooting against us, it's just a great atmosphere. For us seniors we've
never really had that. To kind of go out with that, it was really nice.  
  
Q. If I may, as a senior, can you explain for the group the journey, the
experience this week, the game today from your perspective as a senior?  
ARRON ZIMMERMAN: Women's basketball has never done that before, so that was
just the start to an amazing experience. Got a chartered jet here, just
something that so many people on our team have not ever had before. Most of us
have never had it before. Just an amazing experience‑‑ thank you.  
It was just a lot of good things that we didn't even know that we would be
getting and it's just been an awesome experience. We were so happy to play
today. Just wanted to come out and give them a game, and we can go out saying
that we did that.  
COACH GEBBIA: Jen, getting her three that she made, that was her 100th of her
career ‑‑ so I was really hoping that was going to go in.  
Jen's Patriot League Player of the Year, Scholar Athlete of the Year, First
Team Academic All‑American; what she's done for our program has been amazing.
And as a head coach, you don't know if you'll ever coach another kid that can
do both extremely well.  
So Jen, I'm going to miss you a ton, and I appreciate all the effort and
energy you put in. She's really bought in. I don't know if most of you know,
but she changed from a two guard to a point guard this year. So she's actually
playing out of position‑‑ but maybe not. Looking back, I wish I would have
last year put her at that position. She's been terrific.  
I think people that come in in the future can look at Jen Dumiak and say, I
want to be like her, I want to play like her. That's a compliment to her and
the effort and energy she's put into her game. Thank you, Jen.  
Arron has been‑‑ Arron's had an interesting senior year. Arron has not scored
as much as she has in the past, at least from last year to this year but she's
done so many intangible things for us. We've said it before‑‑ she finally
showed up today. She's been struggling and been shooting the three a ton in
practice, and it finally paid off for her at a big time. That's what seniors
do, they show up when they need to show up, and I feel so proud those two
because they were able to do that.  
And AB is called the 'Silent Assassin' for a reason. She's probably the
quietest kid on the team, but at the same time she's got a bold confidence
about her and you guys got a chance to witness that from her tonight, and I
expect big things from her next year when she comes back. So really proud of
the group and I'm just glad we could make it a game.  
  
Q. Arron, wonder if you felt like Iowa just wasn't quite aware of your 3
‑point shooting prowess, and as you were able to get loose a little bit more
as they were concentrating on Ari. And what was the discussion at halftime?
You have a tie game at that point.   
ARRON ZIMMERMAN: Shooting‑wise, I probably wouldn't have guard me at the
three‑point line, either. I have not been shooting well. But I hit fire and
just had confidence in my shot and kept shooting.  
At halftime as long as we were down by a few or tied or up by a few, we felt
confident going into the second half. We've been a second half team and we
were just ready to come out and compete again.  
We knew the second half, they were going to come out ready to go. Maybe they
were a little surprised by us in the first half. But second half, we knew we
were going to have to come out strong and knew we were going to have to battle
and that it was going to be another 20‑minute battle. I think they hit some
big shots and we did what we could, but it was a game.  
  
Q. Why does Booth not start?  
COACH GEBBIA: That's a good question. Well, you know, we did start her earlier
in the year one game. Just seems like she plays better coming off the bench,
so that's why we went to that.  
We started our freshman, who pretty much was a little scared today I think.
You know, since we had started that freshman, Emily Kinneston, we've been on a
win streak. So it's kind of like a superstition and we also know AB likes to
come off the bench and light it up. That's probably why. She'll probably start
next year. We'll see.  
  
Q. The NCAA went back to this top seeds hosting again and it got the crowd
they were looking for. Your kids seem to indicate playing in front of a crowd
is big, even though it might be to your disadvantage.  
COACH GEBBIA: Yeah, I think that's a great point. I've been to the NCAA
Tournament several times, and I've had the opportunity to do both: To play on
a team's home floor and a neutral site location. I watch the men's tournament
and I see how many upsets there are because all those games are at neutral
site locations, yet I know they still get crowds.  
But I said to my team when I walked into the locker room, I said, if this was
a neutral site location game today, there's a good chance we could have won
this, because maybe they don't shoot the ball as well. It's disappointing, but
I will never take away the fan support that Iowa has. It's impressive.  
Like I said, I've been to many tournament games and never played in front of
this many people in a first round game. I've enjoyed it. The people are
friendly here. I really like them; they are very nice.  
Yeah, it's tough. If I had to pick my poison, I'd probably choose neutral
sites.

_IOWA CITY, IOWA_  
  

IOWA  75  
AMERICAN - 67

  
COACH BLUDER: Just want to congratulate American on a great year. I thought
they played very, very well. I think coach has done a tremendous job in two
years getting that program to the NCAA Tournament. They came here on an
11‑game win streak. I thought they played outstanding, did just a great job,
so congratulations to Megan and American on a fabulous year.  
Proud of our team's efforts, five people in double figures, I love that. We
shot the ball well, especially from three‑point range and from the free throw
line. Hit our free throws down crunch time when we needed to.  
I also want to thank the crowd that came out today. I thought they were just
instrumental. You get down to crunch time and you have a great crowd behind
you; I thought we used the home‑court advantage today, and that was really
nice to see. Hopefully we'll get a great crowd at 11 o'clock on Sunday.  
  
Q. What happened there at the beginning of the second half where you finally
took control of the game?  
SAM LOGIC: I think we got a couple more defensive stops. We want to push out
in transition, and you know, really attack the paint so we can get some
threes, and I think Al shot the ball really well today for us, which really
spreads the floor.  
So we had to get those rebounds, though, and get some stops so that we can
push, and we were getting stops on defense in order to get that so they
weren't getting their points. But we just turned them into ours.  
  
Q. Melissa, they came out in the first half and were shooting ‑‑ set the
place on fire. Did you realize with them shooting from the outside that you
guys might need you to equal that?   
MELISSA DIXON: Yeah, we knew that American was going to be a really good team
and they have a lot of great players. But shooting is something that is a
strong point for us every game, and we did really well at that tonight.  
  
Q. Everybody always said they take it one game at a time and don't look at
the seedings or whatnot, but was there a point where you thought, we're in an
actual battle here; was there a point to say, okay, we need to focus even more
than we already are?  
SAM LOGIC: Yeah, I don't think we ever overlooked them. I thought we did a
really good job in practice, knowing that they run their stuff well; they will
run the shot clock down as much as they can, and they will be disciplined
throughout that.  
I think they hit a couple more threes than we originally probably scouted for.
They got some open looks towards the end being patient. That was just
something we had to fight through.  
So in that sense maybe you had to focus a little bit more but it wasn't
anything that we didn't expect. But they just did a really good job of hitting
some threes, especially in the first half.  
MELISSA DIXON: We knew once the game started, seeds didn't matter anymore.
Everyone is going to play their best game in this tournament, do‑or‑die. So we
were prepared for them to play their best game and we knew that from the
start.  
  
Q. Defensively in the second half, your zone seemed to really bother them,
even though they had shot the ball well from the outside in the first half.
What were you doing that was causing them such problems?  
SAM LOGIC: We moved on the pass a little bit better. I think when you can
contest shots and contest the ball, just so it slows down a little bit from
moving so quickly, and getting not open shots or being able to reverse the
ball really fast; we did a good job of that, and I think we did a little bit
better boxing out in the second half, too.  
Sometimes they get an offensive rebound and will run it again so you're on
defense for about 50 seconds and then hit a three in the first half. I think
we limited that in the second half, too.  
MELISSA DIXON: We were really aggressive in the zone. We were getting some
deflections which were leading to steals and stops. Our zone has been good for
us all year and we are good playing zone.  
  
Q. What would you say was the biggest surprise playing against American?  
SAM LOGIC: I don't think anything they really did surprised us. I think our
coaches did a really good job on scout. Like I said before, I think they
probably hit a couple more threes than we probably thought. But credit to
them, they are a good shooting team and we didn't think they are not going to
hit any.  
But they hit a couple more than we anticipated, and we gutted it out and we
are going to take everyone's best shot in this tournament and we are going to
take any kind of win right now.  
  
Q. Do you have any specific examples being the fifth seed today, 14th seed
coming into your building? What was your message to the girls about the
ballgame today, and was there any motivation from the downfalls of some other
teams that have been in this situation?  
COACH BLUDER: Absolutely not. I did not want to bring that up one little bit;
that there had been so many upsets in the men's side of things. So we didn't
talk about that whatsoever.  
  
Q. Bad time to be a three seed, but at least you survived with that. Don't
want to be negative but is there anything that you think your team needs to do
better? I know maybe it's too early to scout Miami, but that you need to
sharpen up for Sunday?  
COACH BLUDER: Absolutely. We need to do a better job on the boards than we did
tonight. We need to do a better job in transition defense than we did tonight.
You know, I always find things we need to work on, but definitely those things
we need to do a better job with.  
  
Q. What do you think changed the second half around?  
COACH BLUDER: Melissa got open for some threes and I think that is just great
momentum for us when we can get those threes going. I think that was a big
deal for us.  
You know, in the first half, I thought Booth really kept them in the game. I
think‑‑ you ask somebody, what's the surprise, that would be the sun surprise
for me. I thought she overplayed what she usually does, and so to me she
really kept them in the game. But she had 14 in the half and only three in the
second half. So our players did a much better job identifying her in the
second half. And I'll take credit for the first half, letting her loose,
because I didn't have them prepared for her enough.  
  
Q. Third consecutive season round of 32, is there a different feeling in
Iowa City heading into this year's tournament than the last year here?  
COACH BLUDER: You know, it feels good to be‑‑ I think there's less than 20
teams that have accomplished that in the country. Been to the third round
three years in a row. So we are very proud of that.  
Does it feel differently? I think it does because of the senior leadership,
because of the experience we have in our team and because they have been
around so much. Today was their eighth NCAA Tournament game and Sunday will be
their ninth NCAA Tournament game. I think that experience really helps.  
Again, I can't say enough about our crowd today. I thought they were
outstanding. I thought they were loud. I thought they helped us. It really
felt like a home court and we are really going to need that Sunday.  
So I thought they were outstanding, and I think that's one thing different in
the NCAA Tournament, you don't always get a home court. Certainly nice to have
that three years in a row. But this year I think our expectations are just a
little different. We know Miami is a great team. They have the upset today.
They have played extremely well. We'll probably talk about them a lot more
tomorrow.  
  
Q. How big was Whitney Jennings today?  
COACH BLUDER: I thought Whitney played very well. She came back‑‑ we gave them
a little time off, and I thought she came back with a kind of different
attitude. I think our little Logansport girl went back to the berry bowl (ph)
and got a feel back for what it feels like to put the ball in the hole. She
was so successful as Miss Indiana Basketball, and I thought she all week has
played very, very well and tonight I thought she did, too. Again, five players
in double figures, I love that.  
  
Q. What do you know about Miami so far; 86 points today. How do you slow
them down?  
COACH BLUDER: Again, I don't know a whole lot about them, and again tomorrow
at our press conference, I'll be able to talk a lot more about them.  
Again, upset today, great for them. I know that they have beat a No.1 seed,
Notre Dame. They beat a No.2 seed, Florida State. Obviously they are a great
team from a really good conference. And so we know we are going to have our
work cut out for us on Sunday. Hopefully again home court is going to help us
out a little bit.  
  
Q. Sam alluded to the fact that they ran the clock down quite a bit. They
seemed to have an uncanny ability to hit shots at that point. Was that
something you were ready for?  
COACH BLUDER: We felt they were going to be patient: Push when it was there;
patient when it wasn't there. And that's good basketball. That's excellent
basketball. And they had a good game plan, and they stuck to it and those are
kids you like to coach that really believe in your game plan and go out and
perform it.  
You know, I thought they were very confident, especially Jen with the ball in
her hands as the clock was going off, going down there at the end.  
Yeah, they hit probably more end‑of‑shot‑clock shots on us than I've seen all
year.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Lisa.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST & 2ND ROUNDS: IOWA
CITY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+%26+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+IOWA+CITY)

  

## March 19, 2015

  

### [Suriya McGuire](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28727)

### [Katie Meier](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23619)

### [Adrienne Motley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28316)

  
_IOWA CITY, IOWA_  
  
COACH MEIER: We are thrilled to be here. We returned to Iowa City and we are
thrilled to be in the tournament first of all and we had some nervous days
there, and wither in a mind‑set we are very, very grateful but when you give
Miami an opportunity, we are going to take it and we have been opportunistic
all season. So we are in a great mind‑set, great game, and our kids are
excited, but hungry, and we want to prove something here.  
I'm always very, very happy; I think this is one of the classiest athletic
departments and institutions in the country. They run such a great tournament.
When we saw Iowa City again, people said, oh, no, we are like, no, it's
awesome there. Great crowds, great support and special environment.  
We are happy to be here and have a heck of a matchup in Washington. I think
this is one of the more exciting first day games in the whole tournament,
Miami versus Washington. Good scoring from the backcourts on both teams and
the physicality and tempo. So I think a lot of TV sets should tune into this
game.  
  
Q. What's the challenge you face on the backcourt with Davis and Plum,
what's the challenge they present?  
COACH MEIER: To be honest, I remember watching one of their games and hearing
that Davis was their all‑time leading scorer. She's great, 2,000 points.  
Kelsey Plum and I are very familiar with each other. We did USA Basketball
together and spent some time with Luana (ph); I believe her mother is the one
that brought me hair dye on the last day of the World Championships because my
hair grayed out a little bit trying to get that Gold Medal. Katie Plum came by
the hotel and gave us hair dye.  
Pretty familiar with Kelsey and her ability, but yeah, their backcourt is
phenomenal. Mike does a great job of giving them space and room I think we
have very similar offensive philosophies.  
THE MODERATOR: Can you comment on the experience of participating in the NCAA
Tournament?  
SURIYA McGUIRE: It's a great experience for me. I know it's what I really
wanted for my last year, playing with Coach, this is my third time being in
the NCAA Tournament, and like she said, it's just an opportunity we are ready
to take on and I'm just excited to play tomorrow.  
ADRIENNE MOTLEY: I agree with Suriya. It's just a great first experience for
me and something I definitely want to look forward to and keep going to it in
the previous seasons. Just play our hearts out, because a lot of teams don't
get this opportunity. So just focus on living in the moment.  
  
Q. Would you like to comment specifically on the two young women?  
COACH MEIER: I love them, and it's really obvious what they mean. Suriya's
journey here and having this reward being her journey is phenomenal. But I
think we are in the mind‑set of continuing to play and continuing this journey
and having a very, very forward, positive mind‑set.  
But when you coach and you have successful teams, and I've been blessed the
last couple years at Miami to be able to be in this tournament four of the
five; but each year isn't about me. It's about this particular group and their
particular journey and their rewards.  
And these two to my right absolutely deserve this. You'll see how hard they
play. You'll see that we don't hold back on emotion in our program, and that's
fine. We are going to show you who we are. We are going to give you our
hearts. We are going to fight and claw and do whatever needs to be done. We
are going to celebrate, and we'll do whatever it takes, so these two will
bring that out in me and I think I bring that out in them.  
THE MODERATOR: As a University of Iowa staff member, I appreciate your nice
comments. But is there any particular advantage having been in Carver‑Hawkeye
Arena so recently?  
COACH MEIER: I think so, the crowd‑‑ it's a real positive crowd, too. We've
played some in environments this year in the ACC, but the Iowa City folk are
awesome people. They are real positive. And so they cheer, they know
basketball like crazy. You hear some comments, I remember scouting the game
before, and being like, my God, these fans are smart. Like they were saying
high‑level kind of things. I thought, wow, they know what they are doing here.  
It's fun. And listen, as serious as this is and how much of a business it's
becoming and everything else, there's pure joy in our program and I think
there's joy here in Iowa City so we are happy it matched up again.  
  
Q. Does Washington remind you of anybody, comparable to anybody in
conference play that you've seen?  
COACH MEIER: In a way, a little bit Virginia I thought presented a lot of the
same‑‑ we just recently have played them. The backcourt talent of Notre Dame
we have matched up with, too.  
But when we are watching film on each other and I'm sure Mike is saying the
same thing, we run a lot of the same stuff. We have a lot of the same
concepts, so in guarding and not having the scout team because we had to leave
on Tuesday and everything else, okay; we had to play against each other. It's
pretty familiar.  
ADRIENNE MOTLEY: I have to as far as Virginia, just having two big guards, and
their post players that can shoot the three, too. So pretty much everybody on
the floor is vulnerable just like Virginia, you have to bring your P's and
Q's.  
SURIYA McGUIRE: Like Adrienne said, their guards remind me a lot of Virginia's
guards, their ability to take anybody one‑on‑one is very much the same. Their
posts are very diverse. They can shoot and they can post up, but to have the
ability to pass the ball ‑‑ as a guard; so I can just say that Virginia is
very tough.

## March 19, 2015

  

### [Jazmine Davis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24833)

### [Mike Neighbors](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28339)

### [Kelsey Plum](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28340)

  
_IOWA CITY, IOWA_  
  
COACH NEIGHBORS: Very honored to be here. Really excited about our bid to play
in the NCAA Tournament. Proud for Jaz as a senior who came four years ago when
our program was not really considering be played in the NCAA Tournament, and
she's led us here along with Aminah Williams, another senior. Talia Walton
came in with that class.  
With the infusion of some young kids, Kelsey included, very excited to be part
of this tournament and we know we have a tremendous opponent in Miami in the
first round and we are excited to be in Iowa City.  
  
Q. Wonder if you can discuss the impact Kelsey has had on your program in
two years.  
COACH NEIGHBORS: She came in freshman‑ready to make an impact. She didn't come
in expecting to get her feet wet and kind of get acclimated. She came in ready
to play and we needed that, because we had this class I just mentioned, with
Jaz, Aminah and Talia sitting there waiting; and we needed the infusion of a
player that came in confident, that came in ready to compete.  
And she gave us just that. These kids that I mentioned first, welcomed here
with open arms and really blended in to a cohesive group over a very, very
short period of time.  
And that's really hard to do, and it really says a lot about the kid to my
immediate right who is our school's all‑time leading scorer and at that point
in time had been taking the bulk of the offensive load on her shoulder.  
For her to come in and mentor a young player, develop her into the leader that
Jaz had been for us, was tremendous. And as a result, I think Jaz has had her
best two seasons, as well. Her leadership, her distribution, command of the
offense, and making everybody else on the floor better has just really
continued to grow. You can see that in the growth of Talia Walton, another
player that has had a tremendous season for us, a very consistent season.  
But Kelsey's insurgence into a team of kids that had developed a pretty good
identity was the difference in us playing in the NIT Tournament and the NCAA
Tournament.  
THE MODERATOR: What can fans expect to see on the floor tomorrow from the
Huskies?  
COACH NEIGHBORS: If we play like we're capable of, we're very efficient. We
don't turn the all over a lot. We are one of the top teams in the country in
turnover rate. We don't normally turn it over a lot but we are playing a team
that tries to turn you over a bunch.  
So you should see a team that's very hard to guard. Everybody I talked to when
they prepare for us say that we are really difficult to defend because we can
really space the floor. We have got a lot of weapons. We are not just one‑ or
two‑dimensional. We have a lot of kids that can really score, and we play
pretty fast. That's a little unexpected kind of when you look at our team
pictures. You don't really expect that.  
So I think we are a little bit‑‑ it's kind of a surprise. It's fun. I think
that makes it fun. That's the reaction I get from a lot of people who see us
for the first time, and hopefully you'll see that tomorrow.  
  
Q. Jazmine, what does it mean to you to be back in the NCAA Tournament as a
senior?  
JAZMINE DAVIS: It means a lot. I would say it just means, one, it's our motto.
It's something that we stand by. And we put a lot of hard work into this and
we stuck together through a lot of adversity as a team, especially with the
coaching changes. We just got together and we are one.  
  
Q. Kelsey, what's your reaction to being in Iowa City and participating in
the NCAA Tournament?  
KELSEY PLUM: Just to add on to Jaz, this team's been through a lot the last
couple years, and I just think it shows the resilience of our team. We've had
some ups and downs, but we've been able to stick together and we're really
excited to be here.  
  
Q. What kind of team do you think see at your opponent? What can we
expect?  
COACH NEIGHBORS: I purposely said I'm going to stay away from the term
athletic, because I think that sometimes it doesn't accurately label this
team. They are very, very skilled. They make shots. They create shots. And
they do it at a really fast pace.  
I accused our video girl of showing me the film and speeding it halftime
because I thought it was not accurate, but that was realtime. So it took me a
minute to adjust to that. They are very, very skilled and they do it with a
pace that can be uncomfortable if you allow it to be.  
So we know that we have got to use our momentum and our craftiness to use that
against them, but it's a tremendous challenge.  
We have a few teams in our conference that play that way but it's not really
the way our conference is set up. We tried to schedule a couple non‑conference
games in Texas A&M and Florida State that play that way and we had good
success against those two teams, so hopefully we can carry that over.  
I want to echo what these two guys said and just briefly hit on, I think this
group right here is a real good example for a lot of people out there to stick
together when times of tough. Jaz's group, particularly, had four different
coaches impact them at the college level, some recruiting, some coaching. And
in our climate of college athletics right now, a lot of kids would have left
and none of those kids did. Jaz, Aminah, Talia, they stuck together and they
embraced this group that came in.  
There were many opportunities for them to not stand up and face adversity, and
I think in our climate of our athletics situation today, that's too easy to do
and I'm really proud of this group to be able to have stuck together and be up
here representing the NCAA Tournament.  
  
Q. New arena, new environment, I know in talking with players it takes maybe
a shoot around or two to get a feel for the court, the shooter's eye, things
like that. How long does it take or is there more made of that from the
player's perspective?  
JAZMINE DAVIS: For us, I think we got well‑adjusted to the court yesterday. We
are fine. We are used to being in different environments. It's a court; we
play on basketball courts every day, so it doesn't really matter. We're fine.  
COACH NEIGHBORS: Jaz, we're not playing in the practice gym tomorrow.  
JAZMINE DAVIS: We're in Iowa, it doesn't matter. (Laughter) doesn't matter.  
KELSEY PLUM: As long as the rim is ten feet, I think we're okay. The ball is
round, we're fine.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_IOWA CITY, IOWA_  
  
COACH GEBBIA: We are excited to be here. This is American University Women's
Basketball's first time in the NCAA Tournament. So these young ladies, these
seniors sitting in front of me have done a terrific job in leading this team
to their first‑ever title.  
Being in the Tournament for the first time is an exciting time, a fun time,
and we are just happy that we get to play a terrific Iowa team who has been to
the Tournament several times and they are very talented and a smart time, and
we just look forward to the challenge of being out there and hoping to make a
game of it.  
  
Q. Could you just describe Iowa, what problems they present for you?  
COACH GEBBIA: Iowa, because they are so well balanced, I think one through
five, they all can score. They shoot the ball extremely well from the
perimeter, and they have a terrific center in Doolittle, great young lady, who
is a tough person to guard inside. It kind of stretches our defense out a
little bit and we have been working a lot on our defense all year.  
So not being able to help off as much as we would like to presents a problem
for us, and having to contest all threes that they are going to take. With the
heady point guard who is a terrific player and their senior leader, it's going
to be a challenge for us to stop her in transition. We have a lot of things to
figure out and work on. But again, we are excited for the challenge.  
  
Q. Could you compare Sam Logic with Jen? They have remarkable similarities,
both academically and on the court it seems like.  
COACH GEBBIA: Yeah, that's the first thing I think we said to Jen when we
started watching film on Iowa was that, you know, her counter part at the same
position, basically plays the same way in that they both kind of run the team.  
They run the team's tempo. They both like to get into the paint. They are both
big on getting the assist, as well as scoring. Just their feistiness and their
heart that they bring each and every day; they both go 100 percent every
possession, both ends of the court. So there's amazing similarities.  
And then off the court, I know the Logic kid is an Academic All‑American, and
Jen is a first‑team Academic All‑American and Patriot League scholar Athlete
of the Year. It will be interesting to watch those two go at it from a mental
perspective, as well, because a lot of the game has to do with decision making
and that side of the ball, so I'm excited to see how Jen competes.  
  
Q. I would like each student athlete to take an opportunity to speak briefly
about what it means to compete in the tournament.  
ARRON ZIMMERMAN: It's just an amazing experience so far. We are so happy to be
here, especially our senior year. It's something we have wanted since I
started playing basketball, we thought about coming here. Didn't realize how
hard it would be when I was that age.  
But as I worked through college and things like that, it's just awesome to get
here and nice way to end my senior year, so keep going.  
JEN DUMIAK: Yeah, I have to just to piggyback on what Arron said, I think we
first so hard to get to this point. Obviously the Patriot League, you're not
going to get an automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament.  
But we worked so hard: And then everything you work for in high school, and
then to college, just to get to the tournament and this point. So it's just an
honor to be here and we are just excited for the opportunity to compete and
play.  
SHAQUILLA CURTIS: To piggyback off of them it's really exciting. I know me
personally, I'm really, really excited. But like everyone else, it's about
working hard and getting in, and like Jen said, we don't have no automatic bid
to get in if we didn't win the Championship. But, I mean, we are here and
trying to play.  
  
Q. Coach Bluder earlier talked about the tremendous momentum you're bringing
into the tournament. I think she mentioned you had won 11 games in a row and
there's not a loss on your schedule; you have to go back to January. So what
does it mean to be bringing that kind of positive momentum into the
postseason?  
COACH GEBBIA: I think it's important because I think our team has generated
confidence over the last ten, 11 games, in themselves, with each other, with
our defense, and just being able to kind of control the games that we have
been a part of.  
That's going to be our biggest challenge tomorrow is can we control the tempo;
are we going to let it get out of control. We have worked on that. And I think
part of that has to do with the seniors and their leadership and the chemistry
of the team. The chemistry has grown throughout the year, which helps I think
any team as you go through the second half of the conference season and into
the postseason.  
I just love how this team bonds, how well they get along and how much they
care about each other. It's fun as a coach to watch it happen and just see
their faces and see how excited; every little thing from this point on is
exciting for them. You know, popcorn is the locker room is exciting; the
little things they don't know about until they get here.  
So like I said, it's just exciting to see this group come together at the
right time.  
  
Q. A lot of fans supporting Iowa, is that going to be a challenge with so
many fans for Iowa?  
COACH GEBBIA: I'm sure it will. I'm sure it will be loud and stuff here. We
have played in front of some crowds. We played at Maryland this year and there
was a lot of people there; another Big Ten team that's really, really good.  
We've had those opportunities but we talked about being able to do hand
signals and looking over to the bench more and making sure they know what they
are in. Might be a better question for them than me.  
  
Q. For Jen and Shaquilla. Can you just talk about what responsibilities the
guards are going to have to slow Iowa down, because they are going to try to
run, run, run the whole game.  
SHAQUILLA CURTIS: Well, first in transition, stopping it early, and then
making them play in the halfcourt.  
Also just playing a consistent‑‑ having a consistent offense and running
through our reads all the way through sometimes, and get the easy bucket.  
JEN DUMIAK: Yeah, I think the defensive end starts with Gurley (ph) picking
the ball up, giving Logic a hard time, bring the ball up the floor. Kind of
slowing it down and not letting her bet in the paint.  
But on the offensive end, it starts with me and I need to kind of understand
the game and how the game flow is going, and deciding when we can run and when
we need to slow it down and pull the ball out and run a halfcourt game. I
think both of those tasks kind of fall on our shoulders.

_IOWA CITY, IOWA_  
  
COACH BLUDER: We are very, very excited to be here, and I know everybody is
this time of year. But I think this year is special for us for a number of
reasons.  
One is we earned the right to play at home. We have been very happy to play at
home the last two years, but this year we had to earn it. We talked about that
at the beginning of the year, and it's really nice to see that happening this
weekend. Another reason why it's special is because of the three women that
are up here with me. These three have been just a big part of our program the
last four years and they have put in so much hard work to put themselves into
this situation.  
And so very excited for these three women, extremely, extremely talented
athletes.  
We know American is a great basketball team. They have not lost the entire
month of February or March. You have to go back to January to find a loss on
their schedule. They have won 11 straight.  
I think Megan Gebbia in two years has done a great job with the basketball
program at American and bringing them to their first NCAA Tournament. I'm
hoping that experience, the home court, will help us, because we understand ‑‑
you know, very good scorer in Jennifer Dumiak; they have a great three‑point
shooter in Zimmerman, and we know it's going to be a very, very good
basketball game tomorrow. I mean, they are holding opponents to 57 points, so
a very, very good defensive club.  
  
Q. Does American remind you of anybody that you've played, some team that we
could figure out?  
COACH BLUDER: I'll probably take that because I've seen more than they have.  
This goes back a long time, but these guys remember playing Marist last year
in the first round of the NCAA Tournament. Megan came from Marist, she was a
long‑time assistant coach there.  
They run a lot of the same things, and they are very good at reading switches,
reading screens, making you pay for not staying in your stance and having a
mess‑up basically on a screening situation, and they run a lot of unusual
screen action.  
So I know it goes back a year, but these guys remember preparing for that game
very well.  
  
Q. What sort of defenses do they like to play?  
COACH BLUDER: Almost all‑player.  
  
Q. You guys are 16 ‑0 at home this year. Just talk about what it's like
playing in Carver and to have a chance of playing potentially two more games
here.   
BETHANY DOOLITTLE: Yeah, we are obviously really excited to find out we were
hosting like Coach said. It was something that we really set our goals to at
the beginning of the year, being a Top‑16 team in the country, being able to
play in front of our fans at Carver.  
Obviously it's been our best year at Carver, and we just want to look to
continue that and obviously that starts tomorrow and can't look too far ahead
obviously. We are just excited and we love playing in front of our fans.  
  
Q. Playing a couple of the same opponents as American, does that help in
preparation?  
COACH BLUDER: Not really, because those opponents were so early in the season.
We have two common opponents. We both beat Gonzaga; we both lost to Maryland.
Again those are both in their non‑conference season, and both so long ago, I
don't think it really affords either team much advantage.  
  
Q. Melissa, what sort of ‑‑ have you guys watched much film at all on these
guys?   
MELISSA DIXON: Yes, we have watched film on American.  
  
Q. What sort of things do they like to do on perimeter defense?  
MELISSA DIXON: Defensively, well, they play all‑player, so we'll be ready for
that. They just play really good defense. So we'll be ready for that on
Friday.  
  
Q. It's been so long since you've played. How have you handled that? You
don't get breaks during the year; does it seem longer than a week and a half
or whatever it has been?  
BETHANY DOOLITTLE: I think last week we just focused on ourselves a little bit
because we didn't know who we were going to play. I think that was pretty
beneficial in our preparation for this game on Friday.  
I think we have been having pretty energized and focused practices, just kind
of focusing on our skills as a team, defensive, and rebounding like we have
been focusing on all year.  
So I don't think it's been a long time. It doesn't feel like a long time
because we've been practicing the whole time. I think that just will help us
out in this game Friday.  
  
Q. For Sam, this is kind of an unusual position for Iowa. You guys are
expected to win and you're expected to advance to the Sweet16. How do you sort
of handle that mentally?  
SAMANTHA LOGIC: I mean, I don't really think that our team really cares about
what other people expect of us. We set our own expectations for every single
game.  
So whether we are seeded three or six or eight like we have been our four
years, we go into every game expecting that we have a chance to win playing
well enough.  
So that's the way you have to approach it; just thinking what we have to do
and not really worrying about what other people are expecting you to do.  
  
Q. Their leading scorer, I don't remember her name right now, but she's a
guard. Can you sort of describe her game?  
COACH BLUDER: Yeah, she's a point guard. She is very, very effective when she
gets into the paint. She scores, really with great ease when she gets in
there. She scores from all different areas: Three‑point penetration; free
throw line, she's over a 90 percent free throw shooter. She shoots the most
free throws of anybody on the team. But, when she gets into the paint, she's
pretty deadly. We need to make sure that she stays out of the paint.  
She's really the key to the team. In my opinion, she's a big key to their
offensive success.  
  
Q. Can you comment on ‑‑ Sam just touched on it, but how important it is
that this is another game, despite the seed; how important is it to keep your
preparation the same as it's been all year?  
COACH BLUDER: Yeah, we've really tried to keep our preparation the same but
it's hard to say this is just another game.  
And I almost don't want them‑‑ I want them to understand, this is special.
This is a great opportunity for us to be playing in a national tournament on
our home court.  
It's not just another game. It's a very important game. It's a special
opportunity and we want to take full advantage of that opportunity to play at
home and to play again together for another game.  
But our preparation as far as getting ready for the opponent and the amount of
focus that we've spent in practice on them has been about the same as every
other game.  
  
Q. Earlier today, Coach Meier from Miami had some very kind words to say
about both the University of Iowa's athletic administration for their ability
to stage events, and how intelligent the fans at the University of Iowa are
about the game of basketball. Can you expand on that a little bit?  
COACH BLUDER: First of all, I think our administrators have done an
unbelievable job getting ready for this event.  
The last two years, we knew we were going to host and we had a year to prepare
for that, and that's a lot different than having four days to prepare for an
event of this magnitude and still making every athlete and every coach feel
special and feel like it is a national tournament.  
Kudos go to our administration, for not only getting ready but also for
embracing it; for wanting to have it here. We have the National Swim Meet
going on at the same time. This is incredible for us to have to stage both of
these events, and then to want to do it. It's amazing.  
So our administrators have done a great job.  
As far as our Hawk fans, I know it's a Friday tomorrow. I know it's during the
workday. I honestly believe they are still going to come out and support us.
They have been great. We had almost 10,000 in our last game and they have been
absolutely tremendous in supporting this team, and especially this group of
seniors.  
I think everybody realizes, you know, this is the last time you may see this
group on this court, and that's pretty good incentive to get out and support
us, no matter what time of the day it is and no matter what day of the week it
is.  
I'm pretty sure they will show up. I hope they will. They have been so
important to us all year and they know it, so I'm hoping that they will be
here tomorrow at 1:30.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

### [Ka'Nesheia Cobbins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28814)

### [Joe Foley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28768)

### [Taylor Gault](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28770)

  
_TEMPE, ARIZONA_  
  

Arizona State  57  
UALR - 54

  
JOE FOLEY: It was a great game. You know, somebody is going to win and
somebody is going to lose, but to have three seniors to show their character,
I can't say any more. It wasn't because we quit. Those guys, both teams played
with their hearts, both teams played their guts out. Somebody like I said is
going to win and lose, but I'm so proud of coaching these three seniors. This
has rejuvenated me in coaching. It makes me feel like there's kids that really
care, and it's a great feeling.  
  
Q. Gault, what changed in those last nine minutes of ASU's place or your
play to let them back into the game?  
TAYLOR GAULT: They were just determined. We never gave up, we just let little
things slip our minds, and they just came back and won.  
  
Q. Ka'Nesheia, you did such a good job of any time they started to get
something going to answer with a basket and turn them back. Was there one play
in particular that was just kind of overwhelming and you couldn't, that got
the crowd going or whatever?  
KA'NESHEIA COBBINS: No, I can't really point out just a single play. They had
their run. We didn't give up. We tried to hang in there, which we did, but no,
I can't pick out just a single play.  
  
Q. Ka'Nesheia, you went down in the second half midway through I think with
your right ankle. Was that something that ultimately ended up bothering you in
that last nine ‑minute stretch?   
KA'NESHEIA COBBINS: No, I just had a cramp.  
  
Q. Taylor, can you just speak on your start, just the first half for you
guys? I think you got up 12 in the first half and were up nine at halftime.
What was working for you and what was the feeling in the locker room there?  
TAYLOR GAULT: We just were doing what we've been doing, just had a lot of
energy, just were determined to have a good focused mind. We had our runs, but
their run just happened to be the last three minutes of the game.  
  
Q. Taylor, how proud are you guys to be part of that senior class that went
far in the tournament, was able to get Coach Foley's 700th win, a couple
bounces away from making a Sweet 16?  
TAYLOR GAULT: I'm very proud of my teammates and proud of Ka'Nesheia and
Kiera. We're just tough. Ka'Nesheia is just so tough for even being out there
because her ankle, and Kiera has given this team so much, and we're all just
so proud of each other. We don't have anything to hang our heads about because
we fought and we never gave up, and I couldn't ask for better teammates.  
  
Q. Taylor, when they made that banked ‑in three at the end of the shot clock
that got it within three, what was your reaction to that play, just kind of
the moment and how it got the crowd going?   
TAYLOR GAULT: Really the crowd never really bothered me. I really just shut
them out. I think most of us actually did. But the fact that it went in, I
think it was just a lucky shot. I mean, we were there, so it just went in.  
  
Q. Coach, what did you do, especially in that first half, where they were
pounding the post and you guys were playing really good defense, contesting
all their shots in the paint?  
JOE FOLEY: Well, I think they just wore us down. We had a lot more energy that
first half and of course they kept rotating. We knew they were going to and
they just kept pounding and pounding, and we just wore down. We didn't get
some block outs when we needed them, when they missed shots, free throws. We
knew they were going to‑‑ I felt like they were going to pound us the whole
game with their size, and that was the difference in the game. We just didn't
have enough energy to stay with it.  
  
Q. I think not long after that banked in three, was that possession where
they scored and the foul and they got the ball back. How deflating was that
and what did you see on that play?  
JOE FOLEY: Well, I thought that three they banked in, I thought that was the
difference in the game. If she hadn't made that shot and we get the rebound,
then it might have been a different outcome. That was huge right there.  
  
Q. Kind of the same question I posed to Taylor. How proud are you of this
group that was able to have a record ‑breaking season for you and a couple
bounces away from the Sweet 16?  
JOE FOLEY: Well, Ka'Nesheia didn't get to play last year so I didn't know how
she was going to come back. Kiera really went into a slump early in the year,
didn't play very well, and Taylor, until this year, defense didn't really mean
a whole lot. Three seniors, as I just got through telling you, watching three
seniors mature like they did the last three weeks of the season and care about
each other so much and come together and play so hard, that's what coaching is
all about. I mean, it was amazing what they've done in the last month of
basketball, and that's what you want out of your seniors. It's a great example
for our young kids, but to see three seniors lead like that and play like that
and to show the courage that they've showed, I mean, it's just unbelievable to
coach that right there.  
  
Q. Ka'Nesheia did a good job on Hempen for about 35 minutes. Was it the
cramp that limited her or she got kind of wore down like the others?  
JOE FOLEY: I think we wore down just a little bit. We don't have the depth
that they had and we are playing on their home floor and the home crowd picked
them up. It's a huge advantage. It's great for women's basketball. I'm not
complaining. I think it was a great atmosphere, but that helps. If we'd had a
crowd picking us up when we were down a little bit to give you that energy,
then you make a big play or something good happens for you, that's the
difference in a game. It's fun, and like I say, our kids‑‑ I couldn't ask any
more from a bunch of kids than what we got these two games and what we got
last week. I can't tell you how much respect I have for our basketball team,
and I have a lot of respect for them. I knew Arizona State was going to be
tough. I knew they had good kids inside, and we did a great job on the
shooters, and we cut down their driving opportunities, fast break
opportunities, and you look at the score, 54‑57, that's our kind of game
against good teams. If it gets over 60, we struggle sometimes. We gave
ourselves a good opportunity on the road, and you can't ask for anything more
than that.  
  
Q. I know you have confidence in your team, but for about 35 minutes you
outplayed a top ‑10 team on their floor. Was anything that happened tonight
kind of more than maybe what you thought coming into tonight, and does that
make this just a little bit harder?   
JOE FOLEY: It was such a great game. We played so hard that I'm not going to
take anything away from the game. I thought it was just a great game. Like I
say, I felt like we got a little bit tired, we missed some shots, we drove the
ball well, got to the rim, missed some shots. If they go in it's a different
story. That's what I'm saying. We wasn't standing back and throwing it away
and all that. We just missed some shots and they missed some shots early and
they made some shots late and got some offensive rebounds. It was just kids
playing their hearts out. To me either team has got to respect each other when
you walk off that floor. I respect the heck out of Arizona State, but I sure
respect our team, too.

_TEMPE, ARIZONA_  
  

Arizona State  57  
UALR - 54

  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: Wow. I just want to start off by first of all thanking
all of our Arizona State staff and the NCAA. It was amazing to get to host,
and everybody, Rhonda Bennett and everybody, Cheryl from the PAC‑12 office,
thank you guys for an amazing experience. It obviously made it a little bit
more amazing because of these young ladies over here and their ability to just
stay tough and stay with things.  
You guys like the movie Elf? That's a great movie, isn't it? Well, you know
how they have to believe, right? I think our fans believed, we believed. We
just all believed, and before you know it we're banking in 40‑foot threes and
finding a way to win. Just really happy for this team. They've worked so hard
all year long, and just very excited to keep playing, keep coaching them.  
  
Q. Elisha, was that bank ‑in three the biggest shot of your career?   
ELISHA DAVIS: Yes, it was. Believe. That's all that was running through my
head, believe, and that was God, though. That's why that went in. That was
God. Yeah.  
  
Q. What happened in the first half? You guys were 6 of 28 from the field.  
PROMISE AMUKAMARA: I think we just needed to take our time on the shot. We
were getting‑‑ not wide open but contested two‑footers and we just needed to
take our time and make those shots. But we knew we were going to make them in
the second half, so that's what we did.  
ELISHA DAVIS: I would just say I needed to do a better job as a point guard
that the floor was spaced and we were in our correct spots before even
starting the play, and just knowing that if you look at your point guard and
see if I'm antsy and nervous and not really on point then that's going to feed
into my teammates, so I just have to do a better job as a point guard in
making sure our plays are set and making sure we're executing to get better
shots.  
  
Q. For Promise and Sophie, what was so hard about guarding their motion
offense?  
PROMISE AMUKAMARA: I think the hardest part was just defending all the
screens. They set weak‑side screens, strong‑side screens, and it was just kind
of defending them because right when you get a screen you're getting another
one. It really tested our communication and our ability to defend screens off
ball.  
SOPHIE BRUNNER: Yeah, kind of what Promise said, the screens were really
tough, just knowing when to be in help and when not to be. Just getting
caught, I got caught in no man's land a couple times and gave up offensive
rebounds which wasn't acceptable. We had to adjust to them the second half and
adjusted and started boxing out a little bit better, but just glad we
finished.  
  
Q. Elisha, you had a rough night shooting. You looked like you were a little
reluctant to shoot the ball later in the game. Was that the case?  
ELISHA DAVIS: As you seen in the first time when we had four seconds left on
the shot clock and Katie gave it to me, I wasn't ready because I wasn't
expecting it but after that I was just like now or never, like what is this,
you've missed 10, hopefully you make the 11th one so you never give up. And my
teammates and my coaches believed in me and they said it's going to fall, it's
going to fall. It's a really tricky shot for that to be the only one that
really fell, but I was glad that it did.  
  
Q. Promise, was it ever in the back of your mind late in the game that this
could be your last game as a Sun Devil?  
PROMISE AMUKAMARA: No, not at all. We've always battled back from tough games,
so I knew that we were going to click and finish this game out strong. They're
a tough team, but I've got to commend our team, like I feel like we're
tougher.  
  
Q. How big was it to go 13 for 15 on free throws throughout the game and
Katie's two huge free throws to almost ice it at the end of the game?  
SOPHIE BRUNNER: I just think it's really important because recently we just
haven't been shooting free throws consistently well, so coming out today and
making our free throws made the difference in the game, and because we weren't
shooting well in the first half and that's what kind of kept us in the game,
and in the second half things started clicking, but free throws, like you said
with Katie's free throws, kind of pretty much kept us in the game and almost
won us the game.  
  
Q. Sophie, after Elisha made her shot, you and Kelsey made several baskets
down there low. Do you feel like you kind of wore them down at the very end of
the game?  
SOPHIE BRUNNER: Yeah, definitely, because they were definitely keying on the
guards more because they knew that Kelsey and I were just going to go and
clean it up. They just kept doubling Katie and we just happened to be open and
see each other, which was great. We just have a good connection in that sense.  
  
Q. Elisha, you said that was the biggest shot of your career. Was that the
biggest blocked shot of your career at the buzzer?  
ELISHA DAVIS: It's very interesting, just from all the close games that we've
battled back in or close games that we've gave up leads and we just had really
close games we had to have, we had to have faith, that's what our culture is
about. So just having those games and knowing we have to get this stop, we
have to get this box out, we have to get whatever we have to get. I was just
very, very focused on following my player and just being there, and because I
felt comfortable doing that because I got a lot of deflections in the first
half and a little bit in the second half, I just kind of put my hand up and
the ball went to it. Yeah, I'll say I'm very excited I was able to get that
and not foul, but I'm just more excited that our team was actually able to
finish. Our defensive collectively did not have anybody iso them or not have
communication and things of that nature.  
  
Q. Promise, you guys held Taylor Gault to only two points in the second
half. What were you doing to do that?  
PROMISE AMUKAMARA: I think it was just a whole team effort. We were
communicating on defense a lot better, and I thought I did well of getting
over screens and just following her, staying with her, just making it
difficult for her to get open and catch the ball.  
  
Q. Promise, you took a shot to the eye on a rebound. Was there ever any
doubt that you were going to come back in the game?  
PROMISE AMUKAMARA: No, I knew I had to come back in. I had to come back in.
The doctor gave me some eyedrops and I was fine.  
  
Q. I'm just wondering, how big of a boost was the crowd for you guys at the
end of the game?  
ELISHA DAVIS: Yes, it was beautiful. Our crowd was beautiful. It just felt so
good to have so much support and to see that not only our teammates and
coaches believed in us but also all of our supporters and people that have
been there since day one. You know, so it's just very good to see that even
some of the students came out when they could have just gladly clapped us off
from being at home or seeing if we won or not. So to see that big crowd it
gave us that energy like we can't let this down and we can't let our
administration down for doing so much for us to even have this game and host
us. That crowd were a part of that win just as well.  
  
Q. Charli, you've been around this game for a while. One of the most
incredible comebacks ‑‑  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: Are you trying to say I'm old?  
  
Q. I'm not trying to say that. One of the more incredible comebacks you've
seen?  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: Yes, yes. We've actually been in this situation for
those of you who have been with us through the season. That's what we talked
about at halftime. Especially the last half of the season. We had a lot of bad
halves offensively. We got in there, took a breath, just said, okay, just slow
down. Really a lot of times we start talking about our defense but we were
turning the ball over so much we couldn't even set our defense, and when you
factored out those turnovers in the first half, they only scored 10 points on
us. So we felt pretty good. We just needed to take a breath. And a ton of
credit‑‑ I don't want to play that team again. I don't. I mean,
Arkansas‑Little Rock is good. They're legit, and I thought they played an
amazing game. It was really something like both teams deserved to win. So I
just want to say that. My hat's off to them.  
And we've been able to come out, but it's up there. That game ranks up big
time.  
You know, in our deep runs into the tournament we've usually had a game like
this in the first or second round. In '07 we struggled to score‑‑ we basically
beat UC Riverside as a 3 seed in the first game and we had a one‑possession
game with Louisville. Like you said, I'm old. There's been a lot of games, and
just so proud of this group for staying with things and finding a way.  
  
Q. What was your reaction after Lee Lee hit that shot?  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: I joked about the Elf reference, but we did feel the
crowd. They were standing, they were into the game, and I feel like we're a
feel team. We feel each other. You know, I was elated, okay. I was just
elated, because now that they're gone‑‑ Katie was supposed to get the ball to
Sophie on an iso. She gave the ball to the wrong person and it got deflected,
so now I took a timeout to set something. We didn't set up the 40‑foot bank in
the timeout. I'm just going to confess that. That was all them. Now we're down
to two seconds and Katie didn't feel like she could make the pass, she gives
it to Lee Lee, and ‑‑ Elisha Davis practices deep threes. We always have some
of our better three‑point shooters, like she probably did not quite that deep,
but probably maybe two feet in from that, she probably shot 30 of those
yesterday in practice and some in shoot‑around. But for those types of
situations. Kylan Loney we used to shoot from the Wells Fargo all the time,
and it's amazing when you get to that situation and then just have confidence.  
  
Q. I know you've had bad first halves this season, but are you sitting on
the bench wondering if you ever are going to make a shot in this first half?
Were they just rushing their attempts because you got good shots?  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: We did, and that's what you feel good about as a coach.
If you're getting good shots you're fine. I mean, the turnovers were
frustrating, but the missing of the good shots I was okay with. Big game, just
a little tight, and again, we've‑‑ down the stretch the last three or four
weeks of the season, we had way too many halves like that for those of you
that come every week. You know, it was familiar territory, so in that sense
they didn't panic. They were okay.  
  
Q. In those nine minutes was it just that you were making more shots or was
there anything else you noticed from your team?  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: Well, we certainly were making‑‑ we shot 54 percent in
the second half, so we came out and I think played Sun Devil basketball and
did a much better job. We got the ball inside, and I think someone referenced
did we wear them down, and I thought we did because in the first half they
were‑‑ we passed to the post and they were coming and looking to strip. By the
end of the game they weren't helping each other at all, so we had one‑on‑ones
and obviously Sophie took advantage of that. They wore down a little bit,
Katie got free for some good looks, and that's what‑‑ and I think our team
kept working hard to get their good looks.  
The biggest difference was just taking care of the basketball. It's hard to
score when you don't get a shot up.  
  
Q. Same question I had for the girls. How important is it as a coach to see
the girls hitting free throws the entire game?  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: Well, I mean, you hit on something huge. One, that we
didn't foul them because we were very disappointed in our first game. We gave
Ohio 21 free‑throw attempts, and that's not us. We really work hard to not be
in the bonus either half and we've done a great job of that all year long. It
was one of our big areas of emphasis going into the season. All the best teams
can play great position defense, no matter how good and athletic you are, so
that we did a great job of, and for us to step up and make those free throws
was‑‑ I mean, especially when you're not making field goals. You had to take
advantage of it. And Sophie Brunner has struggled a little bit and for her to
step up with that level of confidence just shows you how tough these kids are,
and we probably couldn't have scripted it better to miss that one and get the
rebound and be able to pull it out.  
Just the rebounding off the free throw, and boy, we've talked about that, too.
Everybody is watching the men's and women's tournament. How many games have
been decided by a rebound off a free‑throw attempt? I know at least four that
I've been watching. It was great hustle by Kelsey and our team.  
  
Q. You touched upon this in the last answer, but how do you practice not
fouling?  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: Well, we just work on our defense, and we play great
position defense. We move our feet, and we call fouls in practice. If you
foul, you come out of the game that you want to play, and you don't foul. When
we played Notre Dame in the second round last year, that's when you really see
it. Like if you can't guard a great team without fouling, and I think for us,
we wore them down and they did foul us, and we were able to stay tough and
keep working. Now, they got some good shots down the stretch, don't get me
wrong, but the fact that we had the discipline to not foul them has been a
great strength of this team all year long. It's discipline. It's just
discipline.  
  
Q. What do you tell the kids at halftime, and also, will you be bringing
back any of the former players to talk to them before the Sweet 16 like
January or anyone?  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: No, I think Bree is still in Brazil. We had a lot of
former players here at the game and we always invite them in the locker room.
We're going to be turning around and leaving here pretty quick, so I don't
know if I'll have an opportunity for that. Well, again, I kind of alluded at
halftime that I just tell them to take a breath. We just needed to slow down
on offense, take our time. We felt really good about our defense because they
were just mainly scoring off our turnovers, not off our half‑court defense. We
had a few adjustments, and to make our transition defense was pretty tragic
for stretches. We weren't getting to the ball. We weren't getting anywhere,
and they ran it right up our you know whats. But we adjusted. We adjusted like
this team does. I've mentioned that a lot. I mean, they're just really
coachable. Joe Foley was funny before the game, we were talking, he's like, I
love this time of year. They listen to you because sometimes you're in the
grind and they're tired. But this team, they've listened to us, the coaches,
all year long. They've been just so respectful, so coachable, so mature about
things, and hopefully we've had a few good things to say and it's helped them.  
Yeah, we've been pretty good at evaluating and adjusting at halftime. Good to
see. And that's to their credit.  
  
Q. You guys faced a Little Rock team that had three really versatile,
experienced seniors. What was the biggest challenge in trying to defend those
three?  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: Well, when you're playing against seniors in March, just
the banking of the three from the non‑shooter, you know, just the stepping up
and doing things that they haven't done all year because they're just willing
it in because they don't want their season to end, and I thought they did
that. They just stepped up and made plays, and some of those plays I don't
think are plays that they always make. You know, and that was our concern.
That's always my concern. I look at who are the seniors. Who are the seniors
and how big a role are they playing, and all the great teams, usually the
seniors are the ones that do step up in this time of year for sure.  
  
Q. Can you just give us an early ‑‑ some early thoughts on playing Florida
State next?   
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: You know I don't look ahead. I'm going to tell on Debbie
Antonelli. She told me to look at us‑‑ no way this team is‑‑ I was prepared,
but I haven't actually‑‑ obviously Sue Semrau, head coach at Florida State has
done an amazing job. They've been in the top 10 for a lot of the season. I'm
not that familiar with their team. I watched them play Washington on tape
early, and they lost to Washington, and they didn't play well and they didn't
have their point guard Romero who was a transfer who got eligible, transferred
from Kansas State. I know she's a big difference maker for them, and then they
have a bunch of other transfers, they have like five transfers from other
schools. They're kind of a whole new team this year. I think they're very
talented and usually play man. I think they've pretty much played man all year
long. That's kind of consistent with us. I think that's kind of good. We
started playing a team that was all zone with one day of practice, that would
not be ideal. But I think‑‑ usually to be honest a lot of the best teams in
the country are some of the simplest to prepare for because what they do, they
do really well. They don't do a lot of things, and I think Florida State, they
have great personnel, they execute really well, really good man defense team,
but I will be getting on that as soon as we're wrapping up here.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST & 2ND ROUNDS:
TEMPE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+%26+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+TEMPE)

  

## March 22, 2015

  

### [Elisha Davis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28821)

### [Charli Turner Thorne](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24830)

  
_TEMPE, ARIZONA_  
  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: Well, we're definitely excited to be back for Game 2.
We've had some time to break down the film as well as‑‑ as much as we never
expect a game to be, the point spread to be quite that big, there's a lot of
things that we've looked at that we can do better, so we're excited about that
because obviously Ohio is a very good team. We've had a chance to look at
Little Rock. We've pretty much prepared for both. We knew that they were an
exceptional team and we thought that game could go either way as good as Texas
A&M is. Ultimately we think it's about us, and we think we can rebound better,
we think we can take care of the ball better, can play better position defense
without fouling.  
  
Q. Girls, Coach mentioned last night about UALR, their motion offense. How
often have you seen a true motion offense where that's what a team does all
the time and what are the challenges of playing a team that does that?  
ELISHA DAVIS: Well, Ohio ran a motion offense, so that's what we've prepared
for, so it's helped us a lot. We played a lot of teams in the preseason like
Villanova that had a lot of motion offense, as well. So we played against it.
The challenges with motion would be just us mostly be us talking on defense
about switching screens, making sure we jump to the ball and just make sure
everybody is guarding and stay between them and the basket. I'd say that's the
biggest challenge.  
KELSEY MOOS: Yeah, in PAC‑12, Utah did a lot of motion offense, too. We've
played against it fairly recently, too, so we just need to play our team
defense, talking, listen to each other, and just play great defense without
fouling.  
SOPHIE BRUNNER: I think the biggest key is just to know your scout because at
any given time you could be on anyone. So I think to key off what they said is
knowing everyone's tendencies and what they want to do and being ready to
switch out on people.  
  
Q. Elisha, how are you approaching this mentally, especially this being the
second year and the second round for you, a little bit different now that you
guys are hosting? How are you mentally preparing for this?  
ELISHA DAVIS: I'm mentally preparing by just knowing that I need to do
whatever my coaches and teammates ask of me, so if I need to stop the ball
better, if I need to push the ball harder, I need to do better with my
decision making, if I just need to make sure that I'm being that leader on the
court, that coach on the floor for Coach Charli and our coaching staff, I
think that's what's needed of me mentally. Also just staying poised because at
this time there's a lot of emotions flowing into these games, and I know that
my teammates look to me and I'm kind of like the spark plug of the team, so if
I'm down, they're down, if I'm up, they're up, so being that leader that Coach
Charli needs me to be is how I'm approaching this game.  
  
Q. Coach, could you talk about the luxury of being able to host these first
two games and just having that home ‑court advantage?   
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: Yeah. I mean, obviously to earn the right to be able to
host is a true advantage. We have our fans, we haven't had to travel‑‑ with
this team we actually are really good on the road, and we can kind of lock
them down. You know, I will say there are two sides of that. When you're home
and you're not away from the distractions of your home area. But I think it's
more of an advantage than anything, certainly just being able to have our Sun
Devil Nation here to cheer us on, and again, I can't thank our administration
and the PAC‑12 office enough for making that possible because it wasn't going
to be. But yeah, we take a lot of pride in playing at home. We lost a couple
games at home this year, and we don't usually lose more than a couple, and our
team took it really hard. So it's not just the NCAA Tournament, but it kind of
promises a second senior day, if you will, too. You have your last home game
and you celebrate and everything, and obviously we had hoped to be back, and
now this truly will be her last game in Wells Fargo Arena, so a little added
significance with that, I guess.  
  
Q. You mentioned their motion, UALR's motion last night. After watching
film, how is it different from some of the teams you've seen this year, or is
it at all, and what are the biggest complications with guarding them?  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: Yeah, it's different. It's definitely different from
Ohio, it's different from Utah. There's some similarities. I think some of it
is kind of based on the personnel. To me they're probably‑‑ they're the best
motion team we will have played all year long from what I've seen. Some of
that is their personnel. They just have some really good players that at any
time can just take you one‑on‑one and create their own shot and do some really
nice things with the basketball. They find each other well. They know each
other. So they're not reliant on, okay, we have to get open off these screens
for each other. They can get out of their motion and score in multiple ways.  
But they execute it well, and they read off of screens very well. You know,
Villanova, the difference between Villanova is they bounce the ball for 20
seconds at half court and then they get into their offense and it's a lot
slower‑paced game, and they did execute well. But I think from what I've seen,
they might be the best certainly that we're going to have played against.  
  
Q. Yesterday you mentioned Promise would be keying in on Taylor Gault. What
would be different on her as opposed to some of the other great guards from
the PAC ‑12 that you'd be looking at for her?   
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: That's a great question, and I don't know who I would
compare her to. She's a little different than‑‑ I mean, she's a little bit
like a Kelsey Plumb, I guess, but probably more athletic. The fact that she
can just raise up above you and hit a pull‑up shot consistently is a really
impressive thing that not a lot of players can do. It's not like, oh, just
take away her three or take away her to‑the‑rim game. Promise and I have been
watching a little bit of film and talking about that. She's a great player so
I don't think we're going to completely shut her down, we'll just try to limit
her. It won't be just Promise, it'll be an entire effort keying in on her. But
it's not just her, either. They've got other players that have stepped up in
games and scored well for them, too, and that's why they've won 29 games.
They're a very balanced team.  
  
Q. Last night you mentioned, too, with UALR just about their level of
confidence from them. Where do you see that most, either from watching a
little bit of the game last night or watching film? Where does that stick out
most, I guess?  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: Well, I think they get it from winning 29 games, and so
it just kind of oozes out of them, I guess, because they don't‑‑ they just
don't let things bother them. I think you can see it in their body language,
how they respond to a call that maybe didn't go their way or just maybe a team
goes on a little bit of a run. You just see them just keep playing and staying
with things like we talked about yesterday. I think that's the biggest thing.  
  
Q. It seems like this is a special group. You've got the experience, the
talent, all of it coming together. How do you keep the focus maintained with
this group, especially when you guys have lofty goals of making the Elite 8
and then even more than that?  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: Well, we're just taking Arkansas‑Little Rock right now,
and honestly we don't really talk about those things. We don't talk about
Elite 8 or beyond or even Sweet 16. We really just survive and advance. One of
the things that I told our team the other day, it was kind of fun that we
didn't play the first round and they had seen a couple days of the men's
tournament, the women's tournament, all the little details that teams, it
costs them. I just said to them, I don't know this for a fact, but I would
hazard to guess that a lot of these teams that were supposed to win, it wasn't
that they weren't the better team, they didn't focus on the right things.
There's so much hoopla around March Madness and this tournament and so many
distractions and a lot times I think teams just don't lock in to winning and
on the process. That's the biggest thing that we're focusing on, and we're
just kind of trying to keep in here, and I know that we have to play better
than we did last night or yesterday to win Monday, and they know it, too.  
I think shooting, we can shoot the same. We shot it pretty well, but every
other aspect of our game, we weren't really satisfied with.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST & 2ND ROUNDS:
TEMPE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+%26+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+TEMPE)

  

## March 22, 2015

  

### [Kiera Clark](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28769)

### [Ka'Nesheia Cobbins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28814)

### [Joe Foley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28768)

### [Taylor Gault](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28770)

  
_TEMPE, ARIZONA_  
  
JOE FOLEY: Well, we're glad to be here. Two more days of sunshine. It's been a
lot of fun. Going to play against a great team. I think the crowd is going to
get another great game. I think both teams are pretty evenly matched, and I
think that they've got a lot of weapons. They score well. They've got a little
bit bigger inside, but we're looking forward to the match‑up and looking
forward to play again, and like I say it's been a great trip for all of us and
these three seniors, it's been pretty special. I'm not looking forward to it
ending, but I'm enjoying what they're doing.  
  
Q. Girls, for any one of you, what's your initial thoughts on Arizona State
after watching some film last night and getting an initial kind of look at
them so far?  
KIERA CLARK: It's going to be a great match‑up, I think. It's going to be an
exciting game. We're looking forward to it.  
KA'NESHEIA COBBINS: Like Kiera said, it should be a great game. We're really
excited to be here. Like Coach Foley said, they have a bigger inside game than
we do, so hopefully we can step up and do our best to guard that.  
TAYLOR GAULT: Like they said, I think it'll be a pretty good match‑up at the
guard spot, but the bigs are a little bigger than us, but I think we can hang
tough.  
  
Q. For any one of you, how much tougher does it make it defensively when
they don't necessarily have a go to player, when they kind of spread it
around?  
KIERA CLARK: That means that we just have to lock in and focus a little bit
more, make sure that we help each other out.  
KA'NESHEIA COBBINS: We have to have a lot of help defense. When you have a
team like that who has multiple players who can do multiple things, that just
makes our team defense have to dig down and get to it.  
TAYLOR GAULT: Yeah, I think it'll just show us what we're made of defensively,
considering that they have multiple threats. We just have to pull together as
a team to play team defense.  
  
Q. Taylor, it didn't seem like yesterday any of you guys were really afraid
of the moment, the stage or the opponent or anything. Do you guys feel that
you guys belong here in the round of 32, in the top ‑30 teams, and how much do
you feel like you belong in this game and maybe even beyond?   
TAYLOR GAULT: Yeah, I think we deserve it. We've worked so hard this season,
and us being seniors, we're leaders on the court. We just know that we're not
going to let each other down, and we know what it takes. With that being said,
I know that we deserve to be here.  
KIERA CLARK: Basically what Taylor said. I do believe that we deserve to be
here, and it's a great experience.  
KA'NESHEIA COBBINS: Like these two, I have so much faith in these two along
with all my other teammates. You know, no, we're not afraid. We're the
underdog, so we just have to step up to the plate.  
  
Q. Taylor, what do you expect defensively from ASU's Promise Amukamara?  
TAYLOR GAULT: I don't know who that is.  
THE MODERATOR: No.10.  
TAYLOR GAULT: I really don't know. I think she's a good shooter, but I think
we can defend her, whatever she does.  
  
Q. Kiera, I talked to you last week about your feelings about being back in
the rotation after being in and out all year, and especially after yesterday,
how are you feeling confidence ‑wise, just being back in a role that you're
probably more comfortable with?   
KIERA CLARK: Well, it feels good. I'm just here to do whatever my team needs
me to do. It's about the team, not about me individually. I'm just here to do
whatever my assignment is, and here it goes.  
  
Q. Those 38 minutes yesterday were a season high. Were you a little sore or
tired after yesterday?  
KIERA CLARK: I did make a comment, and I told my teammates, y'all know I'm not
used to these kind of minutes, so I was tired. It was funny, we just made a
joke out of it.  
  
Q. For any of you guys, are you guys worried at all about the home ‑court
advantage that Arizona State is going to have tomorrow?   
KIERA CLARK: No, we're not really worried about that. We've just got to worry
about what our assignment is and get it done.  
KA'NESHEIA COBBINS: You know, we're not really too worried about this being a
home game for them. They're having a really good crowd, and the thing with‑‑
at the free‑throw line, we're just going to have to mentally block that out.
But I think we can get it done.  
TAYLOR GAULT: Yeah, they do have a nice crowd or whatever. Home‑court
advantage is always good for a team. It gives them momentum and a little more
courage, but it's not anything that we can't handle.  
  
Q. Ka'Nesheia, you brought it up. I can't remember what their free ‑throw
thing is called‑‑  
THE MODERATOR: Curtain of distraction.  
  
Q. I've heard a little bit of talk from yesterday's game. Have you heard
about it at all?  
KA'NESHEIA COBBINS: Actually my roommate and I, in between our little breaks
at the hotel, and we were watching reviews, and when they showed it up, and
it's like at the free‑throw line of the opposing team, like when they're
shooting the free throws they'll open a curtain, and it's like a clown. Every
time they open it, it's a different character, and we're like, how do they do
that? But the commentators were saying that they think that's something good.
It's cool, I guess. But we're just going to have to block it out and don't let
it be a distraction to us.  
  
Q. Taylor, how much of a boost have you guys gotten from Kiera the last two
games? Yesterday offensively there was a period where you were both hitting
pretty regularly yesterday. How much are you helped with her in the flow of
the offense?  
TAYLOR GAULT: A lot. Kiera is a big part of the team. She knocked down‑‑ she
had a spectacular game yesterday. It was unbelievable, not just on offense but
at the end of the game she had some clutch defensive plays, got some steals,
stuff like that. We need everybody to win, so with Kiera doing what she does,
it's just adding to what we can do.  
  
Q. Joe, they don't really seem at all intimidated about kind of the home
‑court advantage they're going to be against or the seed or anything or the
setting. Does this team have something that maybe some of your others in the
past haven't had, just mentally, I guess?  
JOE FOLEY: Well, they've had the experience of being in the division‑‑ NCAA
Tournament Division I tournament. They've played big games throughout their
careers, they've experienced playing in big games, conference finals, playing
at LSU this year, beating LSU on their home floor to start the season, to have
a team like Oklahoma come in and handle them pretty easy. I think the
experiences they've had is coming out right now, and I think that's what's
showing. We've been through this before. It's not anything new, so they know
they've got to play well. They know they've got to prepare well. But they've
been prepared, so they know what to do.  
  
Q. What makes ASU such a tough defensive team and how do you keep from
getting sped up when you get out there and they're pressing you?  
JOE FOLEY: Well, they're so diverse in the way they can score. That's going to
be the hard thing is the size inside, overcoming the size like we did
yesterday. They've got guards, No.0 is one of the best shooters I've seen. So
when she can spread it out, extend the defense as far as she can, that opens
up the middle. Same thing for the bigs, with her being able to spread it open,
so the inside‑outside action they've got just makes them a super ballclub.
There's no doubt about it.  
  
Q. You mentioned their size. You guys were able to kind of combat that
yesterday with I assume your ability and quickness of the guards. Is that what
you think it was yesterday and how much confidence does that give you that you
can do it again tomorrow night?  
JOE FOLEY: Well, we've had to overcome it all season but not to this extent.
When you're playing against 6'4", 6'5", like you are, it makes it a lot
tougher. I thought we were fortunate yesterday that we were able to get the
big kid to miss some baskets early so she didn't get her confidence going. We
helped really well. Their outside shooting is not nearly as tough as ASU's, so
that's going to be a much bigger concern. The Texas A&M guards can shoot but
it's not extended. They're more the mid‑range jumpers, so that helped us a lot
that we didn't have to extend our defense. It'll be a different story against
this bunch.  
  
Q. Charli Turner Thorne called your offense a thing of beauty. What do you
think of ASU's defense in particular?  
JOE FOLEY: I thought they did a very good job of trying to pressure. I think
the bigs helped well inside. The good thing about our offense that a lot of
people are starting to enjoy again, I think, is the mid‑range. Our kids are
used to playing in the mid‑range, so we don't have to rely on the three‑point
or lay‑ups. A lot of teams have gone to either getting threes or lay‑ups.
We're not that way. We still believe in the mid‑range. I think you see that in
Kiera's game, you see it in Gault's game, and we take threes with the addition
of AD, Lexus, gave us the addition of threes this year, so that really helped
our offense, and then our post players, we don't get the 6'4" and 6'5", at a
mid‑major you don't get those type of players, so I think it's to our
advantage when you run a mid‑range game that those big kids can't guard up. We
have a hard time guarding them but they have a hard time coming off those
screens. In my career, and I think that's the reason I've been successful,
that's kind of our equalizer is that mid‑range game, and that helps us.  
  
Q. You guys were in this place five years ago as an 11 playing on the home
floor of a 3. What can you draw, obviously the opponents are different, but
can you draw anything from that experience, maybe prepare a little bit more or
Oklahoma was a good team ‑‑  
JOE FOLEY: Oklahoma ended up in the Final Four. We didn't know it at the time.
To me it's kind of the same situation. You're playing on their home floor.
They're going to have a great crowd I'm sure, and Oklahoma had a great crowd.
They got after us right off the bat. We hit a lot of threes against Georgia
Tech and really played well. They pressed us and we handled the press very
well. Same situation here. They like to press, so if we can handle the
situation and hit the threes the second game, we missed a lot of threes early
against Oklahoma and got down about 10 or 11, and we got to the second half,
we'd get back to eight or so but we never could get back to the lead. So they
ended up closing us out, had big kids inside that really hurt us that second
game in three days. So it's kind of the same situation, and hopefully we'll
handle it a little bit better. Hopefully we'll shoot the ball a little better
than we did that second game. Like I say, nobody knew it at the time, but I
knew Oklahoma was a good team, but I didn't know they were a Final Four team.
If we'd have got by that game, no telling what we would have done. At least
the Sweet 16, maybe Elite 8. I think we're looking at the same situation kind
of.  
  
Q. I asked the girls this, but how much confidence do you have in this team
just belonging in this round of 32 and beyond? Do you think you guys should be
among or deserve to be among the top 16 if you advance?  
JOE FOLEY: Well, you've been with us the last two weeks, so I've got a lot of
faith in them. They play like they're playing the last two weeks, they're
capable of doing anything. When you shoot the ball like they've been shooting
it and you play defense as hard as they've been playing it, they're capable of
doing anything. I've got a lot of faith in them right now.  
  
Q. What's the biggest thing that you're emphasizing mentally for your team
in preparation for this game?  
JOE FOLEY: I think the main thing right now is you've got to focus even more.
You've had a lot of success in the last week, all the teams have had a lot of
success, especially the ones that had to win their tournament like we did. You
won three games, everybody has been patting you on the back, you've been
playing well, then you come in, beat Texas A&M, all the moms and dads patting
them on the back, you did this, you did that. They've got to overcome that.
They've got to get focused. I got from Butler's coach a few years ago, one of
the things I was really impressed with what he said was our kids play through
winning. A lot of teams you learn from losing, but when you can learn from
winning, you've got a pretty focused ballclub. I'm hoping that's what we are.  
  
Q. Promise Amukamara is ASU's top defender. What will that match ‑up of her
versus Gault be like?  
JOE FOLEY: It's probably going to be a lot like yesterday. A&M was trying to
push her off the line and trying to get to her and she handled it very well,
and of course Taylor has been the focal point all year long for everybody's
team. She's had a heck of a year with all that focus that they've had against
her to keep herself under control, handle the pressure and let the game come
to her. It's been pretty phenomenal. She's had a heck of a senior year. And
Taylor in the past, she's grown into a young lady and especially matured in
the basketball sense. Things like that used to bother her if she didn't get
off to a good start, but now to me she's very focused, she's very confident in
herself, and she's letting the game come, and she's making a lot more assists.
If people are running her off the line, two or three people at her, she's
improved her game to making assists, getting other people involved, and that's
the reason why we are where we're at right now.  
  
Q. When Kiera started getting a few more minutes in the tournament, did you
anticipate she could get to this level this quickly after kind of coming off
the bench through most of the year? What was your thought as to what you could
get from her?  
JOE FOLEY: Well, you know, early in the year we were playing Kiera a lot, and
she went into a little bit of a slump, and with her in the offense, especially
in Shan's spot, we had her playing, rotating a lot, just in the guards, we
were playing four guards quite a bit, and now that we're rotating her at Shan'
spot, Shan is not near the scorer, Shan has always been a defensive player,
and putting Kiera out there has made it super tough for us to guard that
mid‑range game with Gault and AD and of course Neash drives a lot and kicks to
them, so when you put the four guards out there that can handle the ball, that
can shoot the ball, that can drive the ball, our offense becomes ‑‑ we're at
constant movement and don't ever know where they're going to be, so that's
really helped our offense. Defensively she's improved and she's helped us
there some defensively. That's always been the drawback of Kiera, the
defensive aspect of it. But offensively when we get her on the floor
offensively, we become a much harder team to guard.  
  
Q. Do you anticipate Kiera starting tomorrow or do you like the rotation
that you've gotten to?  
JOE FOLEY: I would have anticipated her starting. Actually it's funny that you
ask that. I was going to start her yesterday. But we got screwed up. I told
Asriel, she didn't understand. I said I'm going to ask Neash if she can go or
not. If Neash can go, then we'll be starting Kiera. If she doesn't, then we're
starting Shan. Well, she thought because I was going to start both of them
then, and she got mixed up because when Ka'Nesheia told me she was going to
go, she automatically put Shan out there, and I asked her what did you do
because it was right at the 10‑minute mark when I made my decision so we
couldn't change it. I was going to start her yesterday. It was funny the way
it ended up.

THE MODERATOR: Coach Joe Foley is joined by Taylor Gault, Ka'Nesheia Cobbins
and Kiera Clark.  
COACH FOLEY: They had a great game. I thought both teams played hard. These
three here were unbelievable. You take these three seniors with Ka'Nesheia
with the turned ankle, so much fun to watch.  
  
Q. Taylor, can you talk about the start you and Kiera got, how did that lift
things, mindset and morale?  
TAYLOR GAULT: I came out with my set up. I knew what I could do offensively
and defensively. That's the thought I had was to shoot and drive and do
whatever I knew I could do best for my team.  
  
Q. Taylor, talk about the defensive effort you were able to do on Courtney
Walker. What did you feel you were able to do there?  
TAYLOR GAULT: Oh, we were just trying to stop her. That was our thought, stop
her from doing that. So I think we did pretty good on that.  
  
Q. Ka'Nesheia, can you talk about how our ankle feels, and how it felt when
you got here and how that was feeling throughout the game?  
KA'NESHEIA COBBINS: Once my adrenaline got going, it wasn't about my ankle, it
was about helping my teammates and converting on offense.  
  
Q. (Inaudible)?  
KA'NESHEIA COBBINS: No, I wasn't really thinking about myself. I just knew I
had to tough it out because I didn't want to leave these two alone, the rest
of my teammates hanging. We made it this far. I did whatever it took. Rehab
the pass two days to get ready for this game.  
  
Q. Kiera, can you talk a little bit about the fact this could have been your
last game and you had the career high points, how exciting that was for you?  
KIERA CLARK: Very exciting. We came into the game, like this is all or
nothing. This might be our last game, what did we have to lose. So we just
locked in and had a great game.  
  
Q. Kiera, you came into the game about 90 seconds in. Did you expect to get
the call that quickly? What is the mindset when you're coming into the game to
get something going?  
KIERA CLARK: You're ready. Coach emphasized these last couple of practices, in
order to help my team I'm going to need to shoot and score, and that's what I
did.  
  
Q. Can you talk about your team was able to take the leave, late in the
half, can you talk about what you feel your mindset was after having the lead
and losing it?  
KA'NESHEIA COBBINS: At any point in the game I just know we're going to leave
our heart on the court. And I just know that we're not going to leave that
court without a fight. And so I wasn't too much worried about it all, because
I know what our team is made of and the kind of people we are on the court.  
  
Q. Taylor, several times they made a run at you guys in the second half and
somebody, usually you, seemed to make a three. Also Dawn had a big three. How
important was it that every time they came at you that you guys came up?  
TAYLOR GAULT: That we came up? Oh, my mind is on a different issue, just
knowing that shots might not fall, but you can always play defense. So even if
shots don't fall, defense is key. And anybody can play defense. But being able
to combat with them scoring, us scoring, that's always good. That's what we
do.  
  
Q. Kiera, you shot 52 percent in the second half. Did you guys think a
shooting day like that was needed to win?  
KA'NESHEIA COBBINS: We had good practices, too. So carrying it on to the game
is just a plus.  
  
Q. Same one I asked them, did you think you had to play this well
offensively to win?  
COACH FOLEY: The only way we can combat it is score well. That's the reason
Kiera was in the lineup. She's been scoring well, but we had to have that
extra score in the lineup. I'm a little surprised we stopped them as well as
we did, especially 33 and the big kid. So that helped out a lot. But I felt
like we were going to have to score pretty well to win.  
  
Q. Were you trying to take away one or two players from them or go man to
man and see where you might match ‑up?  
COACH FOLEY: We concentrated on 33. We were trying to give help. We even
switched on that first half. And I think it paid off for us.  
  
Q. You've seen quite a few games from Taylor Gault and a lot of games she
scored points. Put this in perspective. Seemed like she was always in a flow,
and always hit a shot when she needed it?  
COACH FOLEY: Big time. Big time. She's done it over and over. But under this
situation and the game we're in today, the pressure, I mean she's got ice in
her veins, it's unbelievable what she does.  
  
Q. During the second half stretch Clark kind of took over. How important was
it to have two of them?  
COACH FOLEY: I think they ‑‑ looked to me like they were really emphasizing
make sure whoever Gault goes, you've got one or two coming at her all the
time. That opened it up for us a little bit. You've got to give them credit to
get the ball to the open man. We talked about it the last two days. I felt
Clark would be the one to get the shot, and that's why we focused on it the
last two weeks, and she came through for us.  
  
Q. You were controlling the first half, out played them. What was your
thoughts at halftime?  
COACH FOLEY: Looked like maybe they had their heads down a little bit and I
was a little worried. We just talked about, hey, guys, we dominated the first
15 minutes. We can do that. We can go back out. And I felt like we were very
well conditioned at that point. We beat a lot of teams in the last five
minutes. So I just told them, I feel like we'll win the game. And I think they
got their heads up a little bit.  
  
Q. What was your confidence level what you could get from Ka'Nesheia today
with that ankle? I don't know she was on the list of starters when we got
here. Was that a late change of heart there?  
COACH FOLEY: All I was waiting for her was to go through warm ups and tell me,
Coach, I'm ready. I said do you want to go or stay? She said I'm going. I was
just waiting on her. I've got all the confidence in the world on every one of
our players. I think everyone is going to give up whatever it takes to do it
all, they're going to give all to their team, whatever they can give.  
  
Q. Where will No. 700 rank in your career?  
COACH FOLEY: Tops right now. Top game. It's unbelievable, playing against a
friend. Playing in an NCAA tournament. It was fun. And to play as well as we
did. We played great, and we deserved it. And I'm proud of our kids.  
  
Q. You said it just now, a lot of people will look at it, but was this an
upset?  
COACH FOLEY: I told the team yesterday we were going to win. I felt like we
were going to score.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

ASU  74  
Ohio  55

  
THE MODERATOR: We have Coach Thorne, Sophie Brunner and Katie Hempen.  
COACH THORNE: First I just want to say I think Ohio is just a really good
basketball team. I thought we brought it at both ends and they never quit. And
even had one good run down the stretch of the game. The way they execute
offensively, shoot the three, get to the rim, you know, it really clogged up
the paint. We had 17 turnovers.  
I'm really proud of our team. It's been two weeks since we played a game. We
‑‑ we got some shots up, shot the ball like we can shoot the ball. And I
thought our defense was ‑‑ in a team that we hadn't really played anybody with
them, I thought Sophie was just sprinting. We had to work hard and I thought
we did. I thought we had a complete effort from our entire team.  
  
Q. Sophie, the guards did a good job of penetrating. Was there anything that
you did to get open, or were you just waiting for the ball?  
SOPHIE BRUNNER: No, actually the guards did a really good job penetrating, so
just an easy two footer.  
  
Q. Your thoughts on the win Monday night?  
KATIE HEMPEN: It was a great team. And the preparation we had for this game
was so ‑‑ I think the coaches knew what we needed to do, and Sophie and Quinn
did a good job of helping. They did a good job. Our defense was what led to a
good offense.  
  
Q. You shot 60 percent the first half. The ball was moving well and you were
able to find an open shooter.  
SOPHIE BRUNNER: Yeah, I think we just knew that we had to fake them out and
move the ball for each other. That's what we've been working on all week, and
play well together and looking for each other, that's what we mainly focused
on.  
KATIE HEMPEN: Our main focus was going from the weak side in and seeing the
post. Pretty much we knew they were going to, you know, kind of focus on ‑‑ we
had to skip inside and inside out, and that's what helped us in the game.  
  
Q. I was wondering, you guys seem to play more cohesively this time. What is
it that you guy did during the last couple of weeks that helped you prepare
for this game and especially you Katie with all your three pointers, pretty
impressive.  
SOPHIE BRUNNER: I think we just got back to just focusing on playing together,
and just finding that chemistry again, because we kind of got it away from it
a little bit towards the end of Pac‑12 season. We made eye contact, just the
little things. And I think we did well. They showed up in the game. We focused
on trying to get consistent with the little things and had a good result.  
KATIE HEMPEN: Yes, exactly what Sophie said. I think our teammates were
helpful. You're going to make them, they're going to fall. And just their
support is amazing. And it's funny, because every time I catch the ball and
shoot it, but I know that they can rebound it. So kind of an ‑‑ they know I'm
going to shoot it. So it all works out.  
  
Q. Katie, in going back to the beginning of the game you guys seemed a
little frustrated at first, but then you broke off in a huge 13 ‑0 run. What
was said in that huddle during that first media time that got you going?  
KATIE HEMPEN: I don't think we were frustrated. We were just taking our time,
like what are they doing? Are we doing what we prepared for them to do? And we
just evened out in that first huddle. Our coaches do great about what we
should do. We were mobilized after coming out of the first huddle.  
  
Q. Katie, it was a big challenge in preparing for this?  
KATIE HEMPEN: Pretty much just go one‑on‑one. So you need ‑‑ I think the
biggest challenge was getting used to their game. We did a good job of it and
I think we started to connect.  
  
Q. What are your thoughts?  
SOPHIE BRUNNER: Yes, a great basketball team. They're tough. They're going to
try to outwork you. You try to work for everything. And you can tell that
nothing really bothers them. They just make things work and they'll run you
and stay with things. It will be a tough match‑up, but we're excited for them.  
KATIE HEMPEN: Just like Sophie said, they're a tough team. It's going to be a
fun match‑up. It's going to be exciting. Just great.  
  
Q. (Inaudible)?  
SOPHIE BRUNNER: It's great. It's a fun atmosphere to play in. We appreciate
what we've been able to do here, and being able to host, and just really
thankful.  
KATIE HEMPEN: Our fans do a great job staying in the game. Whenever we make a
good play they just ‑‑ it's awesome. Their support is what we always want.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about how you were able to play a pretty complete game?
Was it being more rested, preparation? Some of the away games you played late
in the season you weren't able to do that.  
COACH THORNE: Yes, we hadn't practiced a lot the last part of the season.
Kelsey hadn't practiced very much. It was amazing for us to get two weeks to
rest up and get in the gym. Get sharp defensively, that's what we did. The
first few minutes ‑‑ we haven't played in a couple of weeks, and they did
exactly what we thought, and we weren't having to ‑‑ but, yeah, I think it
definitely showed that our team has been working hard to prepare for the NCAA
tournament. And hopefully we'll build on it.  
Our team is hard on ourselves. We are not happy with our rebounding after this
game, at all. We're happy with our shooting percentage but not our turnovers.
We probably should have moved the ball better than we did. There's a lot we
can look at and get better for Monday night.  
I think it's hardest not playing for two weeks. We did have a game against our
scout team on Sunday, so that helps, but that's not quite the same.  
  
Q. That run in the first half, was that kind of when you guys are at your
best?  
COACH THORNE: It is. When our defense is turning people over and we're getting
easy buckets in transition, that's when we're at our best. This team didn't
really turn the ball over. I thought we worked hard. I thought our defense
looked fantastic at times, against a team that's done a great job of taking
care of the ball. They don't pass a lot. They take you one‑on‑one a lot. They
couldn't get to the rim and then they couldn't find teammates, and that was
just ‑‑ our team was working really hard.  
  
Q. One run in the middle of the second half. What allowed your team to be
able to go on those long spurts that separated the lead?  
COACH THORNE: Well, you know, we also had a long drought where we didn't score
down the stretch. As coaches, that's what we remember. Oh, my gosh, we haven't
scored for this long.  
Our defense. Our defense is just like we just said. If we're getting soft, I
think our shooting was better, our efficiency was better, so I think great
defense.  
And our transition game, we like to play fast, and not just in the full court,
but in the half court. If we can get out and run a little bit ‑‑ our goal is
‑‑ they're a tough team, and they're going to play hard, we want to outwork
teams. We took advantage when they got tired and we put our foot on the gas,
and this team is pretty good at that.  
  
Q. Obviously your team played well. What are the main things going into
Monday night's match ‑up?  
COACH THORNE: You know, things that stood out to me, they were in motion about
as well as any team I've watched this year. You see how many ‑‑ it was a thing
of beauty at times the way they just hit you with screen after screen after
screen, and they come out ready to knock it down, and obviously 24 buckets
from an All‑American. We know who Promise is guarding. She's a little rested
today, not quite as many minutes. She'll be fired up and ready to go. And they
have a Hall of Fame coach, and their offensive execution is amazing.  
The other thing that impressed me is they bumped out. They really bumped out.
And so I think, again, we're not happy with our rebounding. We weren't making
moves to get second shots. Second shots are huge for us. Those are a couple of
things we'll be talking about and focusing on.  
  
Q. That last nine and a half minutes, is there more you want to see, or is
that one of those times?  
COACH THORNE: That's what I was alluding to. That's why I put the group in at
the end. They were pissed, excuse my expression. These guys are the reason
that we are here. They got us here. And they were very frustrated that we
weren't scoring and letting the other team score, and they wanted to go back
in. So I put them back in for a little bit. They weren't always doing the
right thing, either, but, we got up almost 30 and we let up. And honestly in
the Pac‑12 it didn't happen very often. I thought we refocused well. It wasn't
that we were just missing shots. Our execution was really poor and we were
turning the ball over.  
  
Q. You've been scoring in field goals for a fair amount of time. And was
there a point of emphasis on attacking the rim, if you weren't going to get
the shots were you just going to take Ohio out of the game?  
COACH THORNE: We didn't think they were going to play us, and we wanted to
take some perimeter shots and draw them out and go right inside. Part of me
was wondering if that was their strategy, because they just hammered us. They
were hammering us. I was concerned about someone getting hurt, to be honest.
And they got in some foul trouble just coming over, but, you know, it's always
our goal to go to the field goal line. We're really good at that. We didn't
want to settle. We didn't want them to sit in and settle, and I thought we did
a good job of balancing that and getting to the field goal line.  
  
Q. You had a lot of great shooters in your time here at ASU. Where does
Katie Hempen sit on that list?  
COACH THORNE: We don't know; she's got another year. I think she's right up
there at the top. She works at it. I mean all of them do. Bree was an
efficient player, she didn't take a lot of threes. She shot a super high
percentage.  
Katie, you saw her at mid-range. It's exciting to see her game develop. She's
not just a three point shooter. So I think that makes it more impressive what
she's doing for us. I think she has a chance to be our all-time best. And I
know she has the work ethic.  
  
Q. I think Katie said you guys share some similarities, and it's tough on
top. Do you see that, too, from the little bit that you were able to see
today?  
COACH THORNE: Yes, we talked about that in the locker room. I said did you see
how tough they are and they said, yeah. You see they play through stuff,
nothing really bothers them. That's what we saw in that team. Our team knows.
Obviously I think that's where we are at. They had an amazing season. That's
what we're used to. We see that day in and day out in the Pac‑12\. But it was
impressive.  
  
Q. Are you planning your squad ‑‑ is it a hungry squad?  
COACH THORNE: They are now. They're waiting in the locker room for 30 minutes,
they really want dinner (laughter.) They're scrambling for snacks. I think
they found some waffles.  
Yeah, I do think this team is hungry. They really aren't satisfied just being
in the second round. I think they've worked really, really hard and they're
going to show up Monday night and leave it all out on the court. I think that
they want to obviously ‑‑ at a minimum, surpass their last year's postseason.
And obviously ‑‑ and they really believe in themselves.  
They've been hungry all year. It's a tough question for me to answer. Our team
has been hungry from game 1. And I think one of the reasons that they had the
consistency is because we try to rest them up and they just come out and you
guys see them. And they play hard. They get after it. And I think something
that is impressive about them.  
So I expect them to stay hungry. We talked about that at halftime. This is
their moment. This is why they've worked so incredibly hard offseason and game
in and game out to this point. They know how meaningful this time of year is.
They do.

### [Quiera Lampkins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28815)

  
_TEMPE, ARIZONA_  
  

ASU  74  
Ohio  55

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Bob Boldon and Mariah Byard and Quiera Lampkins.  
COACH BOLDON: I have no real comment. But I'd be happy to answer your
questions.  
  
Q. (Inaudible)?  
COACH BOLDON: No, not really. I thought they shot the ball well. They're
obviously a well‑coached team, and very skilled, very talented, and a very
good basketball team. And they showed it tonight.  
  
Q. Your thoughts object the game, difficult end to the season, but I guess
anytime you make it this far it's a success.  
MARIAH BYARD: I wasn't happy with the way the game went and the way we
finished off, but I think that ‑‑ I mean we had a great season and I think
this gives the rest of the guys something to work on in the future.  
  
Q. Your thoughts on the game and the season?  
QUIERA LAMPKINS: I think it was a great season, especially from where we
started last year. I don't think we had a great end to it, like Mariah said.
The rest of us will be here next year.  
  
Q. Coach, second half, obviously it was a little closer at halftime, but
things tended to get away the last ten minutes of the game.  
COACH BOLDON: Yeah, they should be happy with this team. It's a good team.
They played well tonight. They played well all year, and today was no
exception. Shot it well, had a good post presence.  
  
Q. Your thoughts on the season as well. And obviously it ends here today,
but it took you here?  
COACH BOLDON: This is a disappointing end to a tremendous season. It was a
team that wasn't ‑‑ I don't know where we were picked. It wasn't first or
second. Probably wasn't third. Might have been fourth or fifth or sixth. They
showed a lot of toughness throughout the year. And they persevered and worked
incredibly hard. They're a tough team. And were able to win a conference and
the conference tournament and put themselves in a spot that Ohio University
hasn't been to in a long time. And it's obviously something that we're very
proud of.  
As I mentioned earlier, just disappointed on the way it ended.  
  
Q. Coach, can you just say what do you think was the biggest thing they did
today that threw you? Was it the defense, the 3 ‑point shooting? What were the
biggest factors that allowed it to get away from you?  
COACH BOLDON: I just think they're really good. They do a lot of things well.
They shoot well. Guard well. They have a good post presence. They're obviously
well coached. They're a good basketball team.  
  
Q. Kiyanna Black was in foul trouble. How big of a factor was that in
today's game?  
COACH BOLDON: I mean, I would rather them not be in foul trouble. But KB ended
up playing 30 minutes. I don't think she was quite as aggressive as she wanted
to be.  
Lexie played most of the game. She picked up a couple of fouls late. It didn't
have nothing to do with us losing the basketball game. We could have been a
little more competitive if they played more. But basketball happens.  
  
Q. Coach, did you expect ASU to press that early?  
COACH BOLDON: Yes, I thought they would press us the entire game.  
  
Q. Coach, obviously painful now, but do you see the team getting back to
this position, in a NCAA tournament in the future?  
COACH BOLDON: I think that's the goal. That's the goal for every team. A bunch
of teams talking about getting to the tournament. We're going to try like
crazy. We've got to play basketball without turning it over 18 times. That's a
big number. That's a huge number. Obviously didn't shoot the ball very well.
And I don't think we guarded very well. We have a lot of things to work on.
We'll give the kids time off, and get back to the gym and try to get better.  
  
Q. How tough is it to leave a player like Mariah Byard this season?  
COACH BOLDON: We'll miss her percentage‑wise, and the things that she does on
the floor. But she's a tremendous help side defender. She has a tremendous
understanding of the game. She understands things as good as anybody we have.
She's a 3.89 student in nursing. She's a kid that gets it done. She's a
tremendous role model for our kids and how to conduct herself as a student and
athlete.  
There's a lot of different levels that we'll miss Mariah, but seniors have to
go and graduate and she can go make some money, and then we've got a bunch of
young kids coming in, and we try our best to coach them.  
  
Q. Your message for the squad after the game?  
COACH BOLDON: That they had a great regular season and if they want to win an
NCAA game they've got to get better.  
Thank you everyone.

Texas A&M  60

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Blair is joined by Courtney Williams, Courtney Walker.  
COACH BLAIR: Folks, appreciate the coverage. I'm sorry we didn't give you an
A‑game today. Arkansas Little Rock did. They were the best team on the floor.
It had nothing to do with injuries or missed shots or whatever. Right now
they're playing better basketball than us. That's all on me as the head coach.
My job is to get my team playing better, more cohesive, our offensive sets
better, and not let a team shoot 52 percent in the second half, like they did.  
When we fought back in the first half we played so poorly, except for about
five minutes, and I thought we had weathered the storm. We came out and traded
baskets with them for an while, but eventually it just happens, they were
cutting, moving to the ball. We were dead tired. We couldn't guard their three
ball, because basically we were too tired to get to it. They were doing a
great job of running their motion and we've got to do a better job of getting
our kids in better basketball shape and being able to do the little things.  
But right now, really applaud Coach Foley and his 700th win. It seems like I'm
making a lot of my best friends happy this year because this happened about
two or three times and hopefully we can put a stop to it.  
This basketball team up here, you're look at them, we're all back next year,
and we're going to be better than ever. But to do this the commitment has got
to start from the head coach first and these three young ladies up here,
because they're the answer. We've got to look ourselves in the mirror and find
out what are we going to do to become a top ten basketball team again. Maybe
getting kicked in the butt and slapped around a little is going to be good for
us, because we're going to get on that practice court as soon as we take a
week or so off and try to get better and find the answer. But, again,
appreciate the coverage. It was good. Again, commend Coach Foley, his team,
Taylor Gault was by and far the best player on the floor. It wasn't even
close.  
Williams did a good job on her birthday trying to carry us, because we didn't
have much going anywhere else. And so sometimes she was having to take some
shots because she wanted it so bad, sometimes she would force them. Sometimes
they were not going. We had a well called ballgame. Little Rock played well.
They had a lot to do with us not playing well.  
  
Q. Courtney Walker, could you talk about, you seemed like you never got your
shooting touch today, could you talk about why your game wasn't coming to you
today?  
COURTNEY WALKER: It's hard to get going today.  
  
Q. Courtney Williams, you were trying to do so much in the first half, did
that take a lot out of you, talk about your game, when he took you out for a
rest, looked like you were awful tired at that point.  
COURTNEY WILLIAMS: Well, I think I was completely dead. I think the offense
that Arkansas ran, they had a lot of movement and you had to do a lot of
thinking real quick. It could be mentally tiring, but you have to hook it up.
And we didn't really have it today. But I think we could get a little bit
better shape. We have to practice harder during practice and we have to go
through practice and be mentally tough enough in practice to finish our games
like this.  
  
Q. Courtney Walker, could you speak about the troubles today?  
COURTNEY WALKER: It seemed like it was easy for her. She would come off, she
was always ‑‑ she was ‑‑ we just had to give good health, and she was taking
all her shots today.  
  
Q. Talk about dissecting their man to man defense. Could you talk about what
they were able to do that maybe other teams weren't able to do to stop your
offense?  
STUDENT‑ATHLETE: I think because I penetrated more, trying to get back in the
game and just taking care of the ball. As for me, I need to ‑‑ I needed to
make better reads in the defense, getting the ball to the post at the right
time. But they did a very good job of taking away the paint.  
  
Q. Courtney Williams, where did you feel your team was at halftime?  
COURTNEY WILLIAMS: I think we were playing really good defense at the end of
the first half. I think that's why we got our defense. And the second half we
let them shoot more. I think if we would continue to play good defense like we
did at the end of the first half I think we would have been just fine.
Arkansas, they played well on the offense. They were making big clutch shots.
We weren't tough enough to defend that.  
  
Q. Gary, you mentioned without Jordan your bench was not as deep. You did
look a little tired, and you mentioned it. Any idea on why at this point you
felt your team might have been a little tired?  
COACH BLAIR: They've been off for two weeks. Haven't played a game in two
weeks. There's no excuse. There's no excuse. That's on me. If my team is tired
that means I looked tired and that means I wasn't getting the job done. That's
the head coach's job. Our energy has been good for practices and the whole
nine yards. Just look at it, Walker had zero rebounds, it didn't even look
like she was a senior out there. That killed us right there. We don't have our
best energy player. Gault not only guarded Walker and shut her down in the
first half, then she shut down Williams in the second half. Okay, 5‑8 guarding
6‑1 down there. We were turning corkscrew shots up instead of face planting
her, because Gault is not known for her defense, she's known for her offence.
But like it is, we turned the kid into an All‑American today and I'm happy for
her. Six out of thirteen from the three, we hadn't given that all year, but we
were too tired to chase them. I had no other point guard to put in. Walker was
struggling when she went in.  
When we got the ball inside we had great looks. We didn't get all the finishes
we wanted. 26 minutes, 10 rebounds, 9 points, no turnovers, but still, it's
better numbers than a lot of my so‑called veterans had. So we've got to do a
better job, that's the bottom line.  
  
Q. Coach, you mentioned that their motion kind of tired you guys out. But
the way they played defense, that had to have an effect on it, too, it's like
they had you on both ends of the floor, right?  
COACH BLAIR: Their defense is a great help defense because of their lack of
size. When we had our people open inside we didn't finish when we got the ball
in and couldn't get to the foul line enough. That's on us. And we had enough
touches in there. We still outscored them 30 to 24 in the paint. But you've
got to score on some of those offensive boards, then you've got to be able to
turn them over. You've got an assist turnover ratio ‑‑ we were 13‑12\.  
  
Q. In the second half, both teams were struggling. Then Gault hit a three
pointer to go up by six. It looked like you couldn't believe that shot,
because your defense had been so good, but the last second shot was there, and
she did it a couple of times?  
COACH BLAIR: Yeah, the thing that was hurting us in the first half, they were
taking us down to the end and I think Curtyce put one in to help us. But that
was Walker and Williams not creating, and throwing it to somebody with one
second to go on the clock.  
Gault creates her shots. What we've got to do ‑‑ that shot clock is going
down, they better be able to shoot, and we didn't get it done.  
  
Q. Did you think that if you kind of pulled her down on the perimeter, that
would take away things that worked for them in the tournament or was that a
big focus today?  
COACH BLAIR: She hit the one shot that hurt us when we were dead tired, she
had an open look, we couldn't get to it. We had a couple of kids that ran into
a lot of screens instead of avoiding screens. You know they are coming. We
worked on it a bunch. Dawn's a nice little player, but it just wasn't her day.
And it wasn't ‑‑ all of a sudden you have other players step up. When he went
to his bench, his bench delivered, outscored us 24‑10\.  
We played Scott and Chelsea Jennings a lot of minutes, but they couldn't guard
her, because Walker sure couldn't, we were trying to put Walker off on
somebody else, and I thought we did a decent job on dawn. Cobbins didn't hurt
us. Dawn didn't hurt us. But my gosh, Gault and Clark, that's all it takes
right there. They played very well. I think they'll have a great chance
against the winner of this ballgame coming in. I'd love to see them advance.  
Thank you for the tournament, it was very well run.

### [Joe Foley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28768)

### [Taylor Gault](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28770)

  
_TEMPE, ARIZONA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by UALR student‑athletes Taylor Gault and Kiera
Clark. Coach, an opening statement?  
COACH FOLEY: We're just proud to be here. We played a great tournament last
week. Conference tournament was as well as we've played all year, so it's a
good note to come in on and great place to be. Actually, I wouldn't mind
living here.  
  
Q. Girls, for either one of you, I mean, you guys have beaten Oklahoma,
you've beaten LSU. Those are two tournament teams. How much confidence does
that give you coming into this match ‑up against A&M tomorrow?   
KIERA CLARK: Well, we've played well especially during the tournament, so
we're going to try to keep that edge and come out excited and ready to play
for Texas A&M.  
TAYLOR GAULT: Oklahoma and LSU, that was like the beginning of the year, so
we're probably (No Microphone) but just knowing what we can do defensively,
we're just going to carry that over to tomorrow's game.  
  
Q. Keira, how do you guys overcome your height situation when you're
obviously playing bigger teams?  
KIERA CLARK: How do we overcome them? Whatever defensive strategy our coach
gives us is what we're going to follow by?  
  
Q. Since you're a guard, studying the film of A &M, how do you think they've
changed since Jordan Jones season‑ending injury?   
TAYLOR GAULT: I still think they're a well‑rounded team. The point is, she
really doesn't try to score that much, she drives very well. I think it's an
advantage for us, so we're just going to try to thrive off of that?  
  
Q. A lot of talk this morning was about A &M and all the tournaments they've
been in. I know I talked to both of you earlier this week about it. But what
do you draw on your first tournament as freshmen? You both played in that
game, but does that help getting to this stage knowing that you've been here
before or are they comparable at all?   
KIERA CLARK: We're coming in more experienced now. Our freshmen year we didn't
know what to expect. So now that this will be our second time appearing at the
tournament we know a little bit more what to expect.  
TAYLOR GAULT: Same thing what Kiera said. Just learning the game and the
college experience, and knowing what to expect in the tournament. We didn't
have a good tournament freshman year, so I think it gives us more drive and
makes us more hungry to know what we can do with our seniors.  
  
Q. Just to kind of expand a little more on that hype question with Texas A
&M, they've got 6'7" players, 6'3" player, and 6'5" player. So what is the
challenge of trying to play against people with that kind of height or a team
with that kind of height?   
KIERA CLARK: Keeping them off the boards, boxing out. That's basically what
the expectation is right now.  
TAYLOR GAULT: It will be different for me or for us. We're playing against
bigger guards, so that is pretty much a change‑up for us.  
So I just think as far as that, we have to crowd them and don't let them get
the shot off. I know they're taller than us, but doesn't mean we can't defend
them.  
  
Q. The NCAA tournament, you're playing a team from the SEC, a team that's
won a National Championship four years ago. Does that mean more? Is that more
of a challenge or is it a fact of it doesn't matter who you play in the NCAA?
What about that thought?  
KIERA CLARK: We haven't really focused on that. So just trying to keep our
game plan that we've prepared for and go with it.  
  
Q. Gary talked about your friendship and just the sort of relationship that
you've had over the years. Can you talk about that a little bit and what it
means to be playing against him in this game?  
COACH FOLEY: Sure. It's special. I mean, ever since he was at Arkansas for ten
years and at Arkansas Tech we played golf, and I played in all his functions
that he raises money for. We've done trips together, so it's a special
relationship. You don't have that very many times in coaching where you're
going to play against your best friend in an NCAA tournament. Now I've been
fortunate. He's come to our place. We've been to his place. Just the regular
season, non‑conference, he's good enough to play us. Played a mid‑major, and
he's actually had some great teams. I think we played them the year or year
after like the one NCAA tournament.  
But to play in the NCAA is a whole different level. I respect the guy. I think
for women's basketball you talk about a spokesman for women's basketball, I
think Gary is one of the best. He always promotes the game before he promotes
himself or his team. And I think you won't find many individuals like him in
the coaching career.  
  
Q. I was talking to Gary earlier this week, and I asked him when your
friendship sparked. He said he was at Arkansas either first or second year,
and he showed up to Arkansas Tech unannounced to watch practice. Do you
remember that at all? What was your reaction to that?  
COACH FOLEY: I do. I'm surprised. You've got one of the better coaches in the
country, and you just come to Arkansas, and we've had great success at
Arkansas Tech. There is no doubt. But to have one of the better Division I
coaches walk in the gym and say, hey, do you care if I watch practice? That's
pretty special. I think that shows you how much Gary respects the game. He's
always trying to learn. Even though he's one of the more well‑established
coaches, that shows you how much enthusiasm he has for coaches. He loves to
coach, he loves to talk, he loves the media. I know he's a great guy. But for
women's basketball, he's one of the best.  
  
Q. What is your strategy for height, and how have you dealt with that?  
COACH FOLEY: There is no doubt that is a problem for us. We don't have the
6'3" kids, 6'2" kids even. It will be a major problem. We're going to have to
pressure the ball and try to give them good looks to get it inside. They're
going to naturally score some in there. But the good thing is that's not their
focal point on their offense. Their focal point is the two guards. They've got
two great guards, and we've got to shut those down as well as we can. We're
not going to shut them down, but we've got to at least limit what they can do.
Naturally that will open up the inside probably a little bit more. So that is
going to be the X‑factor of the game, I think is how much they go to their
bigs.  
  
Q. Talk a little about your defense. Gary said you're basically a man to man
defense guy. You get your post players to play hard when sometimes they don't
even get the ball to score. Can you talk about your defensive philosophy?  
COACH FOLEY: Our defense is always‑‑ take away the strength of the other team,
we play man. We'll try to pressure some, but not‑‑ it's not just all‑out
pressure. We're not trying to steal the ball or make turnovers. We're just
trying to take away what you do well.  
It's been a philosophy I've had my whole coaching career, and I think we're
fifth in the country in scoring defense this year. I think we were taught two
or three there for a long time.  
But the size that they've got will hurt our defense, there is no doubt. We'll
just have to make up for it on the other end. We'll have to score a little bit
more. In the conference tournament we scored really well. We shot the ball
well and hit some threes, so that may be a little bit of a problem for their
bigs to cover our small.  
Our advantage on offense is I've never had the big kids at a mid‑major or
D‑II, so you learn to play with post players that can play out on the floor
and cause the big kids problems. So they have a little bit of a mismatch
problem too.  
  
Q. One more on you and Gary. I imagine you guys have had countless
discussions about basketball over the years. But what have you taken from him
that you've used in coaching over the years?  
COACH FOLEY: Probably recognize our position as coaches to help
student‑athletes to make the game better, promote the game better. He really
takes it serious. I've learned more in my career just about coaching. I think
the relationships, enjoying the relationships more with the kids, being around
somebody like him influences that, how much we should enjoy what we're doing
and things like that. X's and O's, we're probably as far apart as you can get.
He's extremely set offense. Defense doesn't matter a whole lot to him. We're
just the opposite. We're going to run motion offense. Defense is the most
important thing, so you couldn't get two coaches any farther apart as far as
coaching philosophy. But as far as philosophy of life, I think we're right
along the same lines.  
  
Q. Gary compared your coaching style to Bobby Knight. Is that intentional?  
COACH FOLEY: I studied Coach Knight. I've been to every clinic that I could go
to, every film, that is my philosophy. I enjoy the way that the game is
played. It's a team game. We're screening, cutting, we wear a lot of people
down with their man defense and motion offense. I think it goes hand in hand.
It's to wear the other team down. I think that's what we've done and that's
why we've been successful. Most teams can't stay with the pressure that we put
on them offensively and defensively and wearing down everybody in the game. We
usually have a chance to take over.  
  
Q. If you guys win tomorrow it will be your 700th career win. What would
that mean to get the milestone on this stage?  
COACH FOLEY: If we win tomorrow, it will be the biggest win of my life. It
won't be because of the 700 either.

_TEMPE, ARIZONA_  
  
COACH BOLDEN: This is an opportunity that kids dream of from the first time
you pick up a basketball, just to be here and play in this tournament. We're
just very excited about that opportunity and looking forward to the challenge
ahead.  
  
Q. For either player, what have you guys learned about ASU and how are you
game planning around them?  
KIYANNA BLACK: We know they're a physical team. They like to get out and
pressure the ball. I think our game plan is just to stick to our principles
and take care of the ball.  
MARIAH BYARD: I would agree with KB. I think that we've really been working on
taking care of the ball, which is what we've been working on all year. So I
think that'll be key for us in tomorrow's game.  
  
Q. You have a time differential. This is the first time you've had it this
season. Has that affected you at all, and do you have that going against you?
You also have to play at a home court. They've got the Curtain of Distraction,
if you've heard of that, during your free throws, stuff like that going on.
How is this different than playing like in Cleveland last weekend?  
KIYANNA BLACK: Personally the time difference hasn't affected me. I mean, we
just did the same thing we would do in Ohio, going about our day, eat, sleep,
practice. I wouldn't say it has affected me personally, but I don't know about
the team.  
I have heard about the Curtain of Distraction. I've seen it on SportsCenter. I
think I'll just stick to my principles shooting free throws, just do what I
do.  
MARIAH BYARD: And once again, I agree. I think that, first, with the Curtain
of Distraction, I've seen that on SportsCenter, as well. But I'll just stick
to my routine and shoot my free throws the way I normally do. The time
difference for me, we got out here Thursday morning, so I've already got back
on track and am ready to go.  
  
Q. Can you talk about how good you guys are at shooting the three ‑pointer
and how difficult that is for a match‑up for another team?   
KIYANNA BLACK: I think that's one of our strengths. We like to shoot the ball.
We find each other, get open, easy shots.  
MARIAH BYARD: I think that that's what we practice every day, and so yes, it
is one of our strengths. And we will continue to practice that until game
time. I think when you have a strength like that, you should use it, and
that's what we plan on doing.  
Our team doesn't just shoot the three‑pointers. We can also drive and you'll
probably see a lot of both in tomorrow's game.  
  
Q. These are two quality teams that hold other teams to 55 points. How much
of a chance do you think this could be a low ‑scoring, defensive type of game?
  
KIYANNA BLACK: There may be a big chance. Defense wins games, so in order for
us to have a chance to win tomorrow, I think we need to get stops.  
MARIAH BYARD: I agree, and I think that that's ‑‑ another one of our huge
strengths is keeping teams in low‑scoring numbers. From what I've seen and
what I've heard, they do the same thing, so I'm interested to see how
tomorrow's game works out.  
  
Q. Mariah, you mentioned it a little bit, but what do you guys rely on when
your three ‑point shot isn't falling, and do you think you could beat Arizona
State if you guys aren't hitting tomorrow?   
KIYANNA BLACK: Certainly if we don't make shots, it's going to be a tougher
game, but I think if the three is not working, we've got to look for lay‑ups
and then maybe that'll open up the three‑point shot.  
MARIAH BYARD: Yeah, we've also had a lot of games this year where our
three‑point shots have not been falling. We've been in that situation, and
we've relied on driving and getting to the free‑throw line and everything like
that.  
  
Q. Arizona State hasn't played for two weeks. Going into this game are you
worried at all about them being fresh, having a lot of energy? I know you
technically haven't played for a week, but does that come into your mind at
all?  
KIYANNA BLACK: No, I don't think that's a problem. Coming into the MAC
tournament, we hadn't played and other teams played, and we figured that was
their advantage and it was our disadvantage. It's just ‑‑ at the end of the
day, it's who's ready to play when the ball tips.  
MARIAH BYARD: I agree, and I think that the way we execute in practice, it's
just like a game, so really we're ready to play any day.  
  
Q. You guys have been the favorite in the MAC for the past two months, now
you're the 14 seed. How do you adjust to being the favorite all this time and
now you're kind of the underdog?  
KIYANNA BLACK: I don't really buy into favorites and stuff like that. At the
end of the day, I feel like whatever team comes out ready to compete is the
team that's the favorite. So tomorrow my mindset and the team's mindset is
just to come out and compete, not worry about seeds or numbers or things of
that sort.  
MARIAH BYARD: I agree, and I think that from my own personal experience, I
enjoy being the underdog more than I enjoy trying to stay on top. I'm excited
for tomorrow's game.  
  
Q. I'm not sure if either of you know, you have a couple players from
Illinois on your team, and ASU does, too. Do you know if there's any
connection? Do they know each other at all?  
KIYANNA BLACK: I have no idea. I've heard nothing about it.  
MARIAH BYARD: I think one of them just knew that they were from Illinois, but
that's really all the further that conversation went. I don't know.  
  
Q. Do you think your team has developed a chip on its shoulder being a 14
seed?  
COACH BOLDEN: You should have asked them. They were just here. Why didn't you
ask them? I don't have any idea. I think they're a team that will come out and
play basketball. Whether they're a 1 seed in the conference or a 14 seed in
this tournament, I don't think it makes any difference to them. I think
they'll come out and play as best they can.  
  
Q. Arizona State doesn't really have a go ‑to person, they're all kind of a
bunch of equals. What kind of challenge does that present defensively?  
COACH BOLDEN: Well, they present all kinds of challenges offensively and
defensively. Their balanced scoring is right at the top of that list of
challenges. You've got to guard everybody every possession. We talked about it
when we were getting ready for the tournament, that there weren't going to be
any bad teams in this tournament. That's just not the way this tournament
works. Good teams are made up of good players and they've got a bunch of them
and they're very balanced and do a tremendous job of sharing the basketball. I
think it's crux, it's the challenge of guarding them. That's why they've had
the kind of season they've had. They are incredibly balanced.  
  
Q. This is the first time in 20 years that you've made it to the tournament
and had such a record ‑setting season. What's different about this team that's
allowed them to make it this far and have that kind of season?  
COACH BOLDEN: A lot of trust. They really are a group that really trusts each
other. Offensively they share the basketball and look to get each other open,
and defensively they do a pretty good job with their rotations and really
count on one another to help through the tough times, whether it's the lull of
the season or a tough couple possessions or maybe we have a couple possessions
where we don't shoot it. There's a lot of trust that they'll make the next
shot, and there's a lot of trust that they'll be in the right spot with their
defensive rotations.  
  
Q. Mariah talked about how she enjoys being the underdog. Is that kind of a
philosophy that you like, too, just being kind of the ‑‑ kind of have nothing
to lose out there?  
COACH BOLDEN: I really like it when we're favored by about 25. That's when I'm
the most comfortable. But it's a challenge. It's what you get by being here.
And then I think it's something that we'll accept and we'll try to do the best
we can with it. I don't think anybody is necessarily intimidated by the idea
of this being a 14 seed or whatever number you happen to have beside your
name, but it certainly is a challenge.  
  
Q. You guys are third in the country in field goal percentage defense. What
do you think accounts for just such a dominant effort during the course of the
season?  
COACH BOLDEN: Coaching. (Laughter).  
I don't know. We have kids that play hard. And as I mentioned earlier, they
have a lot of trust in each other. They guard within our system, and whether
we're switching screens or not switching screens, they trust that their
teammate is going to do the right thing. And they have a lot of pride in doing
their job and trying to do their job as best they can, whether it's guarding
the ball and helping or guarding the post or guarding the screen or whatever
their job happens to be that possession, there's a lot of pride in doing that
job correctly.  
  
Q. I asked your players if they thought this might turn into a defensive
type of game. Could you see that happening, too? And also, I'm interested in
just what you think of watching Promise Amukamara as you've been preparing for
this.  
COACH BOLDEN: Yeah, if we can stop them it'll turn into a defensive game. That
is going to be the challenge. They're tremendous on defense, and really enjoy
watching them, until I realize we've got to play them. They do a lot of things
well.  
They've been solid throughout the year guarding different actions, and they
guard it well, move very well as a team. So I think if we can hold up our end
of the bargain, I think it could turn into a good defensive match‑up, but I
know they'll come out and put a good defense.  
  
Q. And Promise?  
COACH BOLDEN: She's good. She's really good. She's a complete basketball
player. You know, she's what you would expect out of a wing in this
tournament.  
  
Q. Two years in you already have an NCAA berth, a new record in school wins,
and now a new five ‑year extension for you. What does that mean for you as a
coach, to see the success happen so quickly?  
COACH BOLDEN: I think it's tremendous. You know, I'm fortunate to be in a good
place. I've got tremendous support from our administration. It's a beautiful
school. It's just a wonderful place to be. Hopefully this is a step in the
right direction‑‑ surely it's a step in the right direction, but hopefully
it's something that we can continue to build on and make sure it's not 20
years before we come back to this thing, and that's the challenge, and
hopefully that challenge is a couple weeks away. But that's the next step for
our program. But it's really an exciting time right now to be a part of it.  
  
Q. There are three veteran coaches here that you're coaching against. You're
kind of the rookie. I'm kind of interested in what your thoughts are on the
other three coaches that are here in this sub ‑regional.   
COACH BOLDEN: Oh, I mean, I hope I can coach as long as they have. It's a
tough gig. It's something that, just because you're good one year doesn't mean
you'll be any good the next year, and all three of the other coaches have been
able to sustain winning throughout the longevity of their career, and I think
it's an amazing feat. You see people get‑‑ people's patience, whether it's the
administration or the general public, is getting shorter and shorter it seems
every season, where people are‑‑ coaches aren't making it through their
contracts, sometimes coaches aren't making it through a season. Years ago that
was unheard of, and it wouldn't be outrageous for that to happen now.  
I think for‑‑ I guess it's something I would aspire to. It's hard to think
about it when you're competing against them, but if you ask me in two weeks
when I have time to reflect on it, I think I would say that that would be
something I hope that I could do, and hopefully return to this tournament, and
hopefully some day be the old guy of the tournament. But I'm not that old yet.
Don't let the gray hairs fool you.  
  
Q. Coming off of Arizona State's bench, how do you approach attacking a shot
blocker like Quinn Dornstauder and then, on the other end, are you guys
planning on fronting the post and just trying to stop them from getting the
ball inside?  
COACH BOLDEN: Those are two really good questions. I guess everybody is a shot
blocker. We don't have anybody over six foot on the roster, so there's a lot
of shot blockers in our conference in every single game we play. So yeah, I
mean, that's obviously an issue. We're going to have to, as I said, take care
of the basketball. We're going to have to move the basketball, we're going to
have to more their defense, going to have to be patient. There's a lot of
things we're going to have to try to do to score on them. It's one of the
reasons why they're so good defensively. At the other end obviously their size
is an issue, and they're really efficient around the rim. Their shooting
percentage around the rim is incredible, and they've done it against people
that are much bigger than us, so we've got to be really solid down there.  
  
Q. Arizona State's coach said that they can put out a short roster on the
floor, they still have players that are 6'4 ". What do you think in terms of
Lexie, Jasmine, players like Mariah Harris, down low. How important will they
be at the start of the game to ensure your players can go down low and don't
have to work around the outside perimeter?  
COACH BOLDEN: Yeah, at this point everything is important. We're a 14 seed
playing a 3 seed in their gym. Taking care of the ball is going to be
important, shooting the ball is going to be important, getting three‑point
shoots is going to be important. You're going to have to play a pretty good
basketball game tomorrow to win, and we understand that. There's a lot of
things on that list of what's important, and it's something you've got to take
seriously. Everything you can control you've got to do your best to control.  
  
Q. ASU rotates a lot of players in and out, they play nine, ten players, and
execute freely and all that. They tend to wear people down. Is that a concern
for you, and your players were asked about the Curtain of Distraction. Does
that matter to you that they're allowing that?  
COACH BOLDEN: No. I mean, yeah, the fact that they're skilled enough to play
that many players, again, they're a really good basketball team that did some
really good things this year, and your questions are solid because that's why
they're good, because they can play a lot of people. They can sustain winning
because if they get in a little bit of foul trouble early, they've got people
they can go to and they play incredibly hard. And when you play eight, nine
people, your kids can play hard, when they know they can take a break and come
sit down for a few minutes. There are a lot of things that contribute to them
being who they are, which is a really good basketball team.  
I think I'm the only person in the room that's never seen the Curtain of
Distraction, so I can't really comment on it. I hear it's pretty cool, so I'm
looking forward to seeing it.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST & 2ND ROUNDS:
TEMPE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+%26+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+TEMPE)

  

## March 20, 2015

  

### [Promise Amukamara](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24829)

### [Sophie Brunner](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28348)

### [Charli Turner Thorne](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24830)

  
_TEMPE, ARIZONA_  
  
COACH THORNE: I'll just start by saying how appreciative we are of getting to
be here, not only by being selected by the NCAA but our administration and our
PAC‑12 office arranging making it possible for us to host because a month ago
it wouldn't have been possible. So we are so grateful to just get to be at
home and be in the NCAA Tournament. We're very excited. This team has been
amazing to coach all year long, just really mature and hard‑working. We're
kind of ready to play. It's just been two weeks. Right, guys? Yeah, so we'll
just take questions.  
  
Q. Promise and Sophie, last year you guys kind of had a rough ending to the
PAC ‑12 season. How much, if any, effect did that have on your mindset, and
how did it affect how you approached this year and your success this year?   
PROMISE AMUKAMARA: I think it took a toll on us for the season. We knew how it
felt getting knocked off the first‑‑ well, our first‑‑ well, it wasn't really
the first round, but in our first game. We didn't want to be in that situation
again. And so we worked hard in the off‑season. People developed their skills,
and I think we did a lot better this year.  
SOPHIE BRUNNER: Yeah, how she was saying, I think we really took it to heart
that we didn't do well in the PAC‑12 tournament last year, and there was just
a lot of motivation going into this season and knowing we would be better than
last season and building on that, so that was our big motivation this year and
doing the little things better and becoming more consistent as a team, so I
think we've done a great job of that this year, so I think that's why we've
had so much success.  
  
Q. I'll start with Sophie. If nobody ever saw you play, how would you
describe this team?  
SOPHIE BRUNNER: I would describe us as really hard‑working because if you
problem I just look at us, we're not huge looking for anything like that. I
think we play well together and that's why we succeed. That's our main
ingredient to success is how we play together and our chemistry and how hard
we work. If no one ever watched us play I would just say we're a hard‑working
team and that we make other people work harder for us, so if they're going to
beat us they're going to have to work harder than us.  
PROMISE AMUKAMARA: Yeah, just like Sophie said, we're a hard‑working team, and
we're a very tough team. We're never going to give up, and we're just going to
fight for the whole 40 minutes of the game.  
  
Q. Can each of you talk about what you've gained from the break, the
benefits of having this break now, and then also what you think of Ohio and
what you've learned about them in preparing for them?  
PROMISE AMUKAMARA: I think during the two weeks we had off, I think it helped
us get rid of all the little kinks and really prepare for the game plan we
have going into these first and second rounds. Ohio is a great‑‑ they're a
great offensive team, and we're going to do our best trying to stop their
three‑point shots because they like shooting, and then just playing good
defense as a whole and rebounding.  
SOPHIE BRUNNER: Building on what promise said, I think we just got back to
like focusing on what we need to do and not so much the other team, just
getting back to working hard for every play and just getting back to like hard
practices. I think that was good for us, just getting tough again and
rebuilding that muscle. That was good, and then going into Ohio I think we're
focusing on just Ohio right now, and obviously want to go past that, but we
know we're going to be a really tough team and that they're good just like us.
We know it's going to be hard and we're going to have to make them work for
everything.  
  
Q. Coach, is there any personality trait of this team that you've seen
throughout this year that's something that stands out that's different than
any other team you've coached?  
COACH THORNE: Work. This team definitely stands out in my mind, and every team
every year is different. Every team has a different personality, and obviously
I think for this team, they're so young but yet they're so mature. They're so
serious but yet they have fun. And I think, like I've had to do so little.
They're usually like how do I make it fun. They make it fun for themselves and
yet they show up focused and ready to get the job done. I think their maturity
and their ability to balance enjoying the process as well as the hard grind of
preparation has been maybe the best of any team I've ever coached, and I think
that's truly exceptional for them.  
  
Q. What's it mean to you two to be playing at home?  
PROMISE AMUKAMARA: It means a lot to have the support system we have here at
home, and then just like Charli says, we just so appreciate that our
administration has‑‑ they allow‑‑ they made it possible for us to play here.  
SOPHIE BRUNNER: Yeah, building off what Promise says, we really thank our
administration and what the PAC‑12 did to make this possible and allow us to
play here and just the support we've gotten from ASU as a whole and the
students just really means a lot.  
  
Q. You guys played on the road last year. What do you think the difference
will be having a home court, and the Curtain of Distraction at your game a
couple of times. Does it make a difference for you guys like it has for the
men?  
PROMISE AMUKAMARA: Well, according to the statistics, I guess the Curtain of
Distraction has made a huge impact in the free‑throw percentage of our
opponents, so hopefully that plays a role during our games. But like I said,
we're just very appreciative to be playing here. Our support system is huge
from ASU and we're just happy to play.  
SOPHIE BRUNNER: Yeah, I think having the Curtain of Distraction will be cool.
They've been at a couple of our games and it's worked out well. That'll be
cool, and then just being able to play in front of our home crowd, I think
will be a really cool experience, too. I think overall it will be a good
experience, and we're just thankful for it.  
  
Q. Promise, I was there on senior day, but how does this game feel
different? You guys are hosting the tournament in your senior season, so how
does this game feel different for you?  
PROMISE AMUKAMARA: Well, first of all, since it's the NCAA Tournament, it
makes all the difference. It's not like a normal home game, we're playing for
so much more. This is for like the whole of our season, the National
Championship. It's huge, and it's worth way more than my senior game.  
  
Q. Promise, you mentioned their three ‑point shooting and that does seem to
be a strength of theirs, but you guys have done a good job with three‑point
shooting and of course you're known for your defense. What do you do when you
have a really good three‑point shooting team to keep them from getting that
going?   
PROMISE AMUKAMARA: I think we just have to‑‑ we all have to step up our
pressure, make them put it on the court, and then it's not against‑‑ it's not
one‑on‑one, it's one against five. It's not going to be me against my
opponent, it's going to be my opponent against myself and the rest of my team.
We're just going to play great defense and try to get stops.  
  
Q. What do you think about this group of coaches that are here for this sub
‑regional?   
COACH THORNE: Well, obviously it is pretty‑‑ it's very impressive, a couple
Hall of Fame coaches in our sub‑regional, which hopefully just makes the
experience here, having the NCAA Tournament in Tempe, that much more inviting
for our community to come out and watch because it's not just ASU and our Sun
Devils, but we've got some great teams with some amazing coaches, which is
usually the case in the NCAA Tournament.  
  
Q. Can you expand a little bit about the description of this team, and did
you see this coming when you first started practicing?  
COACH THORNE: The "did you see this coming question," you know, basically I
really‑‑ we really believed that we would be better than we were last year. We
had a good year last year, and we had a lot coming back, and we knew that we
could get a lot better. We expected to build on last year's success. The
consistency of this year's team has been amazing, and I don't know that I
would have predicted it. Probably would have predicted us to have a few more
letups or stumbling blocks. It didn't hurt that we stayed pretty healthy
because then when we did lose Kelsey for about three weeks, other people
stepped up and did an amazing job in her absence. We've already said it, but
just how much they came together as a team and how hard they worked from the
off‑season and through November and even as we got into the season was why
they were so consistent. I think we just have kids with big hearts that just
are really competitive and passionate, and I know you might think that every
athlete has that, but they don't. These kids are special that way. I mean,
anything we ask them to do, they do, and a lot of times they'll come back and
they'll want to do more. And when a coach has to shut her kids down instead of
saying, hey, don't you want to do some more shooting, that's a great problem,
and I think that's a little bit more along the lines of the character of this
team. And it is character. We don't have an All‑American‑‑ we don't have
necessarily a player that's going to take over every game or two players or
three players like some of the best teams in the country do. So their ability
to share the ball and take turns stepping up and just the essence‑‑ the thing
I keep saying, it's really the essence of teams. What everyone really loves
about team sports, our team exemplifies. Tia Kanoa, Sophie, then we have other
people that can step up and score and do things, and we've done that all year
long.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit more about what you've learned about Ohio?  
COACH THORNE: I mean, Ohio is very good. In watching them, I'm wondering why
they're a 14 seed, to be honest. But they've won 27 games, just like us, so
they're a confident team that knows how to win. They know who they are and
they play to their strengths really well. As Promise says, they love the
three‑point shot, but they're not just a three‑point shooting team. They're
kind of a three or key team. They're great at attacking the rim. They've got
great penetrators, and when you cut them off, they keep their dribble and they
find their teammates. They're a very good offensive team, and then they're a
very good defensive team. They've been holding teams to in the 50s all year
long. They play from the inside out, so it's more of that saggy match,
sagging, switching. They know they're a little bit undersized, so they're
going to just double and triple‑team our post and they're going to work really
hard to take away our paint touches, and if they beat us, they beat us from
the outside. Like a lot of great teams, I think they kind of keep it simple,
and what they do, they do really well. And when I say simple, I mean like they
don't play five different defenses, they play one defense and they do it
really well. They run their motion offense, and they run it really well.  
  
Q. You talked this season about how well your team does in preparing for an
opponent. I'm assuming that you would think that would be the case here, the
time they've had to get ready?  
COACH THORNE: Yeah, I think we've had good time to prepare. We'll be very‑‑ I
think we'll be very ready for what they do. I mean, we are preparing Wednesday
because we took Tuesday off, so it's not like we've had an enormous amount of
time, but we've certainly had the same amount of time in the Conference and
everything to prepare for somebody. But I think we feel good about what we
need to do to win, and it's a balance right now because we do‑‑ we really want
to be prepared for this team, and then we also just want to go out and kind of
do what we do, so we're trying to balance that. There's no secrets anymore,
it's just part of the season. In this day and age with technology, we have
every single game. We pretty much know everything a team did. We should
definitely be prepared.  
  
Q. When you went into the postseason last year, into the NCAA last year,
there were a lot of freshmen. What would you say are the main differences that
this team is going to bring to this postseason?  
COACH THORNE: Right. The only thing I'll say about Ohio, too, is they're
different than any team we've played this year, so I think that makes it‑‑ it
is making it more challenging to prepare. Usually you play a team, you're
like, oh, they're like this team, like Villanova, like Utah. This team‑‑ we've
played some five out but not quite with this personnel, so it is different and
their motion is different, and they have some dribble‑drive concepts but it's
different.  
In terms of this team, what's different this year? I mean, it is a different
team, but obviously the people that are making the plays, the majority of the
minutes this year, are all returners, and I think it's that one extra year.
With all that experience last year of kind of building on being the team to
beat, building on we expect to win game in and game out, kind of
reestablishing our winning tradition here at ASU and our team culture. So I
feel like we got it back last year, but this year we really‑‑ we didn't need
to get it back; it was here. Now life is a lot easier when you've got your
culture, your winning culture and you've got great relationships and you can
just focus on basketball.  
  
Q. I think if I've got this right, there's three basketball teams playing at
home this week?  
COACH THORNE: Four.  
  
Q. What does that say about your conference?  
COACH THORNE: Thank you. Yeah, we have four teams in our conference that are
getting to host this weekend, and I think it speaks volumes to the strength of
the PAC‑12 this year. I think we finished the regular season with four in the
national rankings, too, which speaks to something. I think a lot of that is‑‑
we've always been a great conference, but I think it's really helped with the
PAC‑12 Network. Having the PAC‑12 network has allowed people across the
country to watch us, and so I feel like our teams and our players are getting
a lot more respect now than we did when we were only having a few games on TV,
and we were waiting until the NCAA Tournament, and they were like, oh, they're
pretty good, and people didn't see them enough, and now they're seeing them.
So I think that has really allowed for a lot more recognition and respect.  
  
Q. You've gotten good production off your bench from at least four players,
and then Shaq has been doing some nice things for you lately. Is she ready to
‑‑ in key situations here if you needed her, Shaq to come in and help you,
just because of the extra size she gives you?  
COACH THORNE: Absolutely. Ohio is a tough match‑up. I'm just stating the
obvious for her with five out, they're playing virtually no true posts,
everybody is playing on the perimeter the whole game. But I think Shaq, Ayanna
Edwards, has really come on strong at the end of the season. We've put her in
in big games in key situations, and she's performed well, so we have
confidence in her, and depending on the situation and the match‑ups, we
absolutely will utilize her. Nicole Iademarco, she missed a few months with a
broken hand. She's gradually gotten back and playing better and better and
with a four‑guard lineup, maybe we can go‑‑ we're already pretty small, but we
could go a little smaller, too, and she's been progressing, as well.

_TEMPE, ARIZONA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We welcome head coach Gary Blair from Texas A&M University and
continuing down are Courtney Walker Courtney, Williams and Achiri Ade. Coach,
an opening statement?  
COACH BLAIR: It's good to be here. I had a chance to walk around the wall of
fame and Hall of Fame in the concourse, and just see some great names. A lot
of you do not have a clue who Oda Mae McDowell is or Barry Bonds played here,
Phil Mickelson, or JoAnne Carner, the great golfer.  
But there are just so many great athletes and so many sports that have played
here at Arizona State. This is my first time here. Of course, I've been to
Phoenix or Scottsdale, but it's good to be here. Arizona State has had a
tremendous year. It didn't take her long to take that year off sabbatical. The
rest of us could do that and have a year off and be assured that we'd have a
job. When we got back, we'd all do it. But give a lot of credit for Charli,
because she served our WBCA very well as president. We're looking forward to
playing UALR. It's going to be a great match‑up. We know what Coach Foley
likes to do. He's a Bobby Knight disciple, so that means man‑to‑man defense.
That means motion offense. That means execution. So we're just looking forward
to the game tomorrow afternoon.  
  
Q. Courtney Walker, talk about on film and scouting reports what you've
learned about Arkansas Little Rock, and what do you feel are the top two
challenges for you ladies?  
COURTNEY WALKER: We noticed that they run their offense very efficiently. It's
not like a set offense that they have to do. They run off of a lot of screens,
so defending those off ball screens and cuts will be one of our biggest
challenges defensively. Also, getting back in transition. They force a lot of
turnovers and when they get those turnovers they're able to convert them.  
So just not turning the ball over in the first place will be a big thing for
us so they can't get those easy baskets, and getting back in transition off of
a make or a miss.  
  
Q. Courtney Williams, could you talk about how your role changes when you
have to run the point with Curtyce, you have run some point, but could you
talk about how that changes your dynamics?  
COURTNEY WILLIAMS: I don't think it changes my dynamics because I like to
touch the ball anyway. I just pick my times when I need to pass the ball. If I
have a teammate open I'm going to get them involved. If I need to score the
ball, then that just comes with the flow of the game, having instincts and
just probably rebounding a lot more, getting the ball, pushing it up, and that
will make it easier to go in transition and make a play.  
So I don't think my role has really changed much. Just playing off of
instincts, passing the ball and scoring.  
  
Q. I guess for each of the players?  
THE MODERATOR: We'll go with Courtney Walker, Courtney Williams and Achiri
Ade.  
  
Q. If you could talk about how this evening has gone for you and how you
look at your team right now, and sort of describe your team a little bit for
us that haven't seen it that much?  
COURTNEY WALKER: We are‑‑ how would you describe us? One of our, I guess,
points is we have a lot of guard play that can be very active and we're very
deep at the guard position. We also have a lot of players that can get us up
and down the court.  
COURTNEY WILLIAMS: I describe our team as probably sharing with the guards,
sharing the point guard roles between me, Courtney and Curtyce, because we
know we have to help Curtyce out, because Jordan was the starting point guard,
and she was very vocal, more vocal than Curtyce. So at the guard position I
say we have to share and distribute even on the wings and everything.  
So the fours can run the floor, make the rebound and play hard like they do.
And the fives, I guess they just need to be big in there, especially against
University of Arkansas at Little Rock, because their biggest player is about
6'1". So if they're going to be big in there, I guess they'll make it better
for us because it will make it easy on us, because all we have to do is get
the ball inside. I think we want to press more this year in NCAA tournaments.  
ACHIRI ADE: I'd like to say even though we're a veteran team, we accept a lot
of challenges and we've been through a lot of challenges a lot of people have
to step up and accept new roles and things that they do. Just because we play
one position doesn't mean you can't play other positions. With the five
position we've really grown a lot in the five position since the beginning of
the year. They've gotten better each game, each practice. We're a growing
team. Every day we learn something new.  
  
Q. Courtney Walker and Courtney Williams, what are your impressions of the
guards of Arkansas Little Rock after watching them on film? What do you think
of that match ‑up?   
COURTNEY WALKER: Their guards do kind of different things. You have the point
guard, number 10 that is a very good three‑point shooter. She has a lot of
range and runs the motion offense. Then you have number 24 who is really good
at creating her shot, getting to the hole, and really good step back jumper,
so she's the main scorer out of the three. Then you have number 32 who can get
to the hole and drive, but she's also the leading assist player. So you have
to try to press with the ball while she's looking the floor over. So college
paired to us, you know, we also like our three guards that we have, so I think
it's going to be a good match‑up.  
COURTNEY WILLIAMS: I would describe their guards as very different players.
Like you said, they all do different things, so we really have to study the
scouting report on the bus and in the hotel so we'll probably match up with
different guards coming in transition. I might be on number 10 coming down in
transition, and we have to stay on the man number 32.  
So we just have to know the scouting report. I have to get number 10 up the
line, and Curtyce will have to push the ball, because 32 is like a facilitator
in and same thing for number 24. She can score, so we have to play good solid
defense on her.  
  
Q. Each of you played in an NCAA tournament previously. Can you just talk
about how that experience comes into play when you get to this time of the
year?  
COURTNEY WALKER: I think that's a good thing because you know I could probably
describe my freshman year as being very big time, which it is the biggest
tournament of the year. I think far younger players and players that don't
have as much experience, having these older players that have been here before
and kind of a little more calm and not so much in awe at the moment can help
them relax on the floor.  
Also, the fact that we've been deep in this tournament and have people on our
staff, coaches and former players who have won the whole thing before also
helps us keep our head in it, keeps us focused and gives us good experience
knowing exactly what we need to do to go far.  
COURTNEY WILLIAMS: Us in the past having NCAA tournament experience is really
good for us for a lot of the younger players like Khaalia, we have to tell her
this is the regular game. It could be your last game, but you have to go out
there and give it everything you have because you never know, this may be the
end of your season and we don't want to have a short spring break.  
But I think last year we got to the Elite Eight. That really helps us out
because we've seen what we need to do to beat the big teams like Connecticut,
which we played in the Elite Eight. Me and Courtney's freshman year we played
Nebraska. And we can't understatement that team because Nebraska had a real
good game against us. I think we're ready to play. Every team's going to be
ready to play in the NCAA tournament, no matter who they play during the year
in non‑conference. I think for us, we just have to go out there and be very
calm and play as hard as we can.  
ACHIRI ADE: Having the experience, we know what it takes. We know we have to
seize the moment. Not every NCAA Division I team makes it here. So we know
each game you have to give it all you have, leave it on the floor, and most
importantly have fun with it. That's basically it.  
  
Q. Courtney Walker, Coach was talking about how you guys were getting on a
roll and hitting a stride and Jordan Jones goes down. Where are you guys at in
trying to get back to that point? Do you think you're close to the team you
were when you went down or is that something you'll be chasing the rest of the
year?  
COURTNEY WALKER: I want to say we're a completely different team because we
have all our players except for Jordan. But Curtyce is a different kind of
point guard than Jordan. She can score. It's just what she can do. She's
naturally very quick and has good defense just like Jordan.  
But Jordan was more of a facilitating point guard. So that gives us a
different feel as far as running our offense goes. But we still have been
working on that since the SEC Tournament. We've had a lot of time to continue
to get used to Curtyce at point. She's a great point guard, so we've been
doing very well with that in practice.  
We just have to go out there and execute and keep the composure and do that
just like we did in practice these past couple of weeks.  
  
Q. This is for Courtney Walker, how do you think your play as changed?  
COURTNEY WALKER: I think since we've both been running point guard, for
Jordan, it's also a chemistry thing. Jordan kind of knew exactly where I'd be
in transition and stuff like that. Just because we played longer. That's
because we played longer. Curtyce is the point guard and she also can do the
same thing that Jordan can, finding open people and reading the defense. So
that would be the main difference, just more experience with Jordan. But I've
also played the one time now that Curtyce is taking a break or something.  
COURTNEY WILLIAMS: The biggest thing, I think is chemistry. Because she knows
where everybody on the floor is going to be. We know at the end of the game if
she needs a steal, she's going to get there. When she does get the steal, we
know we're going to Leak out in transition and go get an easy lay‑up or
something. But the biggest thing I think is transition. But I don't think my
game has really changed because I just play off of instincts.  
So, I mean being it's a little bit easier because Jordan knows that she can
get me the ball anywhere and she can get Courtney Walker the ball anywhere.
Curtyce, we look for her to score a little more and be a little less vocal.
But I mean, she's vocal in her own way. She comes up to us and tells us you're
not going to go in front of everybody, like Jordan does. But the biggest thing
is chemistry. But I think we're getting that chemistry with Curtyce.
Especially this last week in practice.  
  
Q. You and I talked earlier this week about your past with Coach Foley. When
you used to go, and you were at Arkansas and at Arkansas Tech, you'd watch him
practice. What did you take from that? Are there still things that you take
from some of those that you still use nowadays?  
COACH BLAIR: He executes. He's a perfectionist. They just run the same drills
over and over and over. A lot of times it's not five‑on‑five basketball, it's
three on three basketball making sure the pin screens are good and everything.
I'd like to know where Coach Foley was this morning. He missed the first
meeting. Isn't that a $10,000 fine by the NCAA? He's probably playing nine
holes of golf and trying to get ready for my golf tournament.  
What else I learned about Coach Foley is it's not about Coach Foley. It's
about a team, it's about a we. He is the most low maintenance, great coach
that there is. I mean, you're talking about a guy that most people around the
country could not even tell you where UALR is or who Joe Foley is. But the
coaches that know the game realize he's one of the best. He is one of the best
at putting X's and O's together. She's always in the playoffs. I think you're
going to see him there for a long time. As long as he stays there, UALR is
always going to be in the playoffs.  
  
Q. You heard your players talk about chemistry, trying to create chemistry.
How do you create chemistry in such a short time period when you have to play
two and a half games without Jordan?  
COACH BLAIR: It's hard. That's why I avoided chemistry in college. I took
biology. Didn't do too well there either. Chemistry, Jordan's not dead, okay
first. Get that across. She's going to be back with us next year and have a
chance to win Defensive Player of the Year for three times in a row, and
that's never been done in the SEC. She's going to be leading from the bench
and practice. She'll be in Curtyce's ear, but she'll also be in all of our
ears, because she, even though she's not on the court, you've got to listen to
your point guard. We might see the Xs and O's of it, but she feels it. She's
always constantly coming up to me now while she's sitting over there with her
crutches saying, hey, Coach you he need to stay in this a little longer or
this. She is so good at acknowledging the game, and that is what a point guard
is all about.  
Now, Curtyce is learning. The chemistry, she's getting better at being able to
take me. That is the most important thing. Can a point guard take a coach that
is getting on her, because I always will get on the point guard harder than
any other player out there on the court at all times because they're an
extension of me. And she's learning to handle it a little bit better. She
started in her safety net about always being behind Jordan. She started her
senior year after Jordan graduates, and she was very comfortable with that.
Now we're trying to get her out of that element and go on and teak charge of
this team.  
Courtney Williams is doing a great job leadership‑wise with her voice, because
she knows the game very similar to Danielle Adams who played for us before.
Danielle Adams knew everybody's position on every inbounds play, sideline
play, the whole nine yards. Well, Courtney Williams is filling that role for
us, and we want that voice to be heard. A lot of times we'll play Courtney
Williams in four to five positions in this tournament because she's the kid
that is a nightmare for match‑ups. Particularly if she's at the point guard
position. Because she's got the 6'1" size. She can take you down post‑up,
shoot the three or take you on the drive.  
So chemistry is coming along. But the best thing about chemistry is you start
winning and the kids enjoy themselves, what a place to come during spring
break. Right here. Your attitude is better all of a sudden. The sun is out.
The kids are out having a good time. You feel good instead of going up to New
York or Boston where it's snowing right now.  
  
Q. Gary, going back to host sides for the regional sites instead of
predetermined sites, what is the channel for your team? Can you play in the
second round in Arizona State? What is the challenge of playing on someone's
home court?  
COACH BLAIR: We've hosted for three straight years because the NCAA knows we
put butts in seats, and we've averaged 6500 for three straight years. We know
how to host championships. Aggie sports supports winners and we've always been
able to draw well even though that's our spring break weekend. I'm not sure
where Arizona State is on their spring break. But Charli has done a good job.
I think they average around 3,000 fans a game. But I'm sure for an NCAA
tournament that should go up. It's better for the top 16 seeds. I was all for
it because we were picked fourth or fifth in the nation to start the year. We
also almost had a chance to host, but the NCAA I really believe in the
committee room, even though Charlie Creme had us in bracketology for four
straight weeks hosting. Even though we were going to be a 6 or a 7, it wasn't
going to be fair to Louisville who was going to have to come in as a 2 or 3
and play in front of 6500 because the NCAA was using their facility for the
men's regional.  
So you've got to feel a little for Louisville. Send them to South Florida
where they might put a thousand in the stands. I think that had a lot to do
with where somebody was going to go. I think we were going to Florida State
first, Corvallis second, Arizona State third and we ended up here. I love it
here.  
  
Q. How much advantage do you feel since your team's been in the playoff, the
NCAA tournament the last three years as compared to a team that hasn't been in
the NCAA tournament last year?  
COACH BLAIR: UALR has been in three out of the last five; is that correct?
Four out of the last six. So there's no problem there. Joe has been there. Lot
of times you're looking at the jockey, not the team. So I'm looking at Coach
Foley, a veteran coach that knows the game, nothing upsets him. Nothing upsets
him. So he'll have his team ready. The guards are SEC style guards. They can
play in every league, particularly gulf. She's one that the rest of us, all in
the SEC, well, in the Big 12 then, all missed out on. He did a good job of
keeping her at home. She could play or start for most SEC teams. The little
junior college kid, Dobbs, they just fit within his flow of the offense.  
To be able to take post players like he takes and say, hey, you're going to be
a screener in my offense. Then you're going to go get offensive boards or
we're going to give you your points on the scores, but your primary thing is
you're going to be setting screens, like Bobby Knight set screens. We're not
going to call‑‑ you've got to have the right type of mentality to come in here
and say I'm going to play for UALR and I'm going to be a post player and I'm
going to set screens. That is my number one job. Then I'm going to get the
rebounds, I'm going to run the break, and I'm going to play good defense. You
have to have the right person to do that. There is a whole lot of all SEC post
players that wouldn't do that. They want the ball more often.  
  
Q. What would you say was the biggest weakness for your team over the
regular season that you'll be focusing on for the tournament?  
COACH BLAIR: The biggest weakness? Well, I found out really quick when Jordan
Jones went down five minutes to go in the first half she was more valuable
than I was over there on the bench. When you take out the heart of your
defense, because defense is created‑‑ creates a lot of offense. You can take
chances behind her. She had 37 charges already. Okay, because she's in your
shorts. In particularly, we were playing Little Rock, that 5'4" guard might
not be able to see those wings getting open and the post setting the screens.
That is how much pressure she could put on.  
So if that's how weakness, we've got to play team defense now instead of
individual defense knowing that Jordan was going to bail you out. Weakness
also is consistent scoring at the 5 position. We've got 6'5", 6'7", 6'3". It's
like eenie meenie miney mo, whoever is playing. I keep them in there and the
other two can come sit by me until we can get them ready. But we need
consistency at the 5 position. But we knew that going into the year. They're
young and experienced, okay? They just hadn't played that much. They're
getting better. But the season is getting to an end. I've got to get better in
a hurry.  
  
Q. A lot of people might look at this and see it's 6 versus 11, and kind of
label you guys as favorites. But you sound a little bit more cautious. Does
that come from what you know about Joe and his program and whatnot?  
COACH BLAIR: I think I was a mid‑major student at Boston, when you look at the
Middle Tennessees, the Green Bays, ourselves, the Gonzagas of the world, and a
lot of schools that are like that‑‑ I don't mean to leave anybody out‑‑ their
coaches are BCS coaches. They're just not playing in BCS leagues. That's why
their programs are always winning at the highest level because their
administration says I want the best coach. Some of those guys or girls never
get a chance to get to the BCS level, but they're going to win consistently
where they're at. Those programs are never going to lose, just like when I was
a student at Boston and Louisiana Tech. They're going to win because of
tradition and good coaching.  
I don't know if I answered that all the way, but I usually ramble anyway. So
just throw some adjectives in there.  
  
Q. You mentioned in your opening statement about Charli coming back from an
absence. Do you see anything different from what you've seen of her team to be
the same as what you've seen before or do you feel like just that you were
able to take a step back and take a breath and all that?  
COACH BLAIR: You have a great situation that happened in 2009. Correct me if
I'm wrong. Were they the 6 or 11 seed? I think we were the 3 that year. Okay,
we're up near Trenton, New Jersey, won our first two ballgames up in South
Bend, I believe, beat Minnesota and then go up there. We're the higher seed.
They had taken care of Florida State already. Is that right? And two good
teams. She's got that type of team again, okay? Now, she might not have Briann
January. We made Briann January a lot of money. Y'all shot 62% on us, we
couldn't stop.  
She was going to be drafted anywhere from 10 through 15, we made her a sixth
round draft choice. And of course an Aggie helped choose her, because Kelly
Krauskopf who is an A&M grad played. She's the general manager at the Indiana
Fever. She tore us up. They did everything well in that ballgame. It wasn't so
much that we played poorly. They played so good that was not a thing we could
do.  
That is the trademark of Charli's teams. It's the we, not the I. It's not the
head coach. It's the assistant coaches. It's the we factor, and that's why
she's one of the best at getting it done. She might not get all the McDonald's
All‑Americans that go up to Stanford or sometimes the other Pac‑12 schools.
She's getting it done with players that fit within a system and give her a lot
of credit. She could go to anyplace in this country, and you all are lucky to
still have her here. She doesn't want to leave. She's like Sherri Coale. She
doesn't want to leave Oklahoma. Mulkey doesn't want to leave Baylor.  
There may be more entertaining places than those three, but this is pretty
entertaining right here. This is a good place.

_TAMPA, FLORIDA_  
  

Uconn  63  
Notre Dame - 53

  
THE MODERATOR: On the dais from Notre Dame head coach Muffet McGraw,
student‑athletes Jewell Loyd and Taya Reimer.  
COACH MCGRAW: Disappointing way to end the season, but I thought it was a
great achievement to get here. Disappointing in I think that we weren't able
to really play our game. I feel as though offensively we ever got into any
rhythm. I thought Jefferson was outstanding, I thought they put a lot of
pressure on the ball, and that really hurt us.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Could you talk about their defensive pressure? It seemed like they were
doing a lot of different things to harass you, made it kind of difficult for
you scoring ‑wise in this game?  
JEWELL LOYD: It was a normal face guard where everyone was pressuring us,
Lindsay was getting pressured all the way up the floor. Got us out of our
rhythm ‑‑ well, when we had a rhythm.  
And we didn't execute as well as we planned.  
  
Q. Brianna, you had ten points in the first half against South Carolina and
then you scored your first two points in the second half. Did they change
anything defensively that you didn't see against South Carolina?  
BRIANNA TURNER: I think I wasn't aggressive enough, I was really timid in the
first half.  
  
Q. Taya and Brianna, could you talk about how difficult ‑‑ you guys are used
to how difficult it is sometimes you think, it's tough when they have those
shot blockers inside, especially Stewart, and also if you could talk a little
bit about the way Stewart rebounded tonight?  
TAYA REIMER: I mean, they have great bigs on their team. We knew that they had
shot blockers on their team, and, I mean, they're very good inside. So we were
just trying to run stuff that I guess could avoid that shot blocking somewhat,
and we were just trying to attack them.  
But like you said before, we really couldn't find the rhythm offensively.  
BRIANNA TURNER: What Taya said, they were long and athletic. We couldn't get a
rhythm going.  
  
Q. Jewell, seemed like there was a point there, I don't know if it was about
seven ‑minute mark, I'm not sure when exactly when it was, you were close and
they were able to get that last surge. Do you think that was sort of the
difference in the game there, they made that last run on you?  
JEWELL LOYD: I think we kind of lost people in transition, lack of
communication at times, and allowed them to get open shots at times when we
really needed to break away. We kind of relaxed a little bit, and that's when
they ran the shots.  
  
Q. Taya, I have to say you guys seem more ticked off than anything. But also
like kind of I know you all are coming back. Can you tell me about your
emotions right now about this game and maybe going forward to next year?  
TAYA REIMER: I mean, obviously it hurts. You know, we had a lot of growth this
season. And we really came together. And it's really tough. We really wanted
this. But we're just going to use it as motivation for next year.  
Obviously offseason starts now. So we're using it as motivation, because we
want to get back to this moment and we want to be the ones out there holding
the trophy.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. You mentioned Moriah's defense. How has her presence on both ends of the
court changed in the two years you've faced her?  
COACH MCGRAW: I thought she was a great defender tonight. I thought she made
things hard for Jewell. She made‑‑ we weren't able to really get anything
going, because most of our offense runs through Jewell. And she really did a
great job denying her the ball.  
I thought she made a couple of 3s that hurt us and other than that, I think it
was mostly her defense that really bothered us.  
  
Q. Muffet, Brianna Turner had a tough time getting touches. Seemed like she
didn't have much offense going. What changed in the second half? Because it
did seem like the light came on then.  
COACH MCGRAW: We didn't look for her enough, I thought. I thought we needed to
get her the ball more, talked about it at halftime, trying to get her in the
pick‑and‑roll, going high/low, and we were able to do that a little more
successfully in the second half. But I thought our point guards had a little
trouble finding her.  
She didn't seem to be able to find her even when she was open. I thought that
the pressure on the ball really disrupted us.  
  
Q. Wonder if you could talk about Stewart, she didn't have sort of the
offensive game she normally has but she was really tough on the board. How did
she impact the game maybe in ways that the stats didn't show?  
COACH MCGRAW: I thought Brianna Turner did a great matchup on her. That was
the matchup we were hoping for. She was able to stay out of foul trouble, and
I thought made it difficult for Bri to get any shots. And I thought just did a
great job both guarding on the outside and the inside.  
So I was really pleased with the way we defended her. She had 12 defensive
rebounds, but I thought we could have attacked the offensive glass a little
bit more, but we weren't able to do that. A lot of times we just had one
rebounder in there. But she's an outstanding rebounder.  
  
Q. Has this team come the farthest than the past five?  
COACH MCGRAW: No question about it. When we looked at the way we played in the
past season and what we've been through, we didn't expect to get this far. It
took us losing at Miami to really start to turn things around, and I think
from that point on we really saw the potential.  
  
Q. Going for the (indiscernible) I see you guys have a lot of players coming
back. As far as getting your team mentally prepared, do you think it will be a
better situation versus last year from now, because a lot of your team is
coming back? Do you think you guys could get back to this point and maybe pull
it off next year?  
COACH MCGRAW: We have everybody back but there's no guarantees that we could
get back here. I mean, it's going to take a lot of work and we've got three
All‑American guards coming in.  
We've got a great opportunity to look at some of the weaknesses that were
exposed to tonight. I think those guards can really help us. So I've got
really optimistic, high hopes for next year.  
  
Q. UConn's been dominating teams all season and a lot of double ‑digit
blowouts. Maybe other than Stanford no one has been close to beating them as
you were tonight. Why was it so close, and do you feel like your team was just
giving them their run for their money, a dogfight out there with UConn not
letting them slip away to the final seconds?  
COACH MCGRAW: I thought because we defended pretty well. We felt at halftime
we were guarding them in the half court offense pretty well and our problem
was in transition and second‑chance points. So if we could stop turning the
ball over, we'd have an opportunity to close that gap that we had at halftime.  
So I was relatively pleased. We held them to 63 points. That's probably a
season low for them, I would guess. And our problem is the offense; we
couldn't score.  
  
Q. You said the problem was the offense, you couldn't score, the turnovers
also hurt. They've got a lot of pretty good players over there, too, is it
not?  
COACH MCGRAW: I'm sorry, I didn't get the question.  
  
Q. The question is they're a bunch to handle, UConn is, are they not?  
COACH MCGRAW: Yes, they are.  
  
Q. Is this a good example of what UConn is? Because it seemed you did a good
job on a lot of people tonight. Stewy didn't kill you. Tuck didn't kill you
like she did the first time, and yet big basket here, Mosqueda ‑Lewis or it's
Jefferson. Is this a lot about who UConn is? Is that what we saw?   
COACH MCGRAW: I'm not sure I understand the question.  
  
Q. They seemed to get a big play here, there, or everywhere, without anyone
standing out individually. Did we kind of see maybe they didn't play their
best game? You guys made life difficult for them yet they found a way? In a
funny sense, is this what UConn is all about, just here, there, and
everywhere?  
COACH MCGRAW: I thought the 3 that Lewis hit was in transition was critical.
We had just cut it to 6. We didn't switch the ball screen. They got a
free‑throw jumper for 2, came down and turned it over. Transition from
Mosqueda‑Lewis for 3, and now it's a five‑point swing, 6 went to 11, and that
was the game.  
And so I would say that's pretty typical of Connecticut, that scoring in
transition, especially for Lewis.  
  
Q. What do you attribute some of those turnovers to, because some of them
seemed uncharacteristic for you guys?  
COACH MCGRAW: I thought so, too. I don't know. I guess the moment. You're in
the championship game. I think we were a little tight during the game. I
really thought we had nothing to lose. We would come out real loose and we
were the opposite. It was disappointing to see.  
I don't know why‑‑ I mean, they wanted to win and put too much pressure on
themselves.  
  
Q. Do you think ‑‑ as far as the game is concerned, do you think it was good
UConn defense or you guys just struggled a little on offense? Do you think it
was more so you or them?  
COACH MCGRAW: I thought it was mostly their defense. We had a couple of layups
we missed, but overall I thought it was mostly their defense.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_TAMPA, FLORIDA_  
  

UConn  63  
Notre Dame - 53

  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us on the dais from UConn, student‑athletes Moriah
Jefferson, Kaleena Mosqueda‑Lewis, and Breanna Stewart. And we're waiting on
head coach Geno Auriemma. We're going to start with an opening statement from
coach Geno Auriemma and then take questions for the student‑athletes.  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, obviously it's incredibly rewarding to be able to do
what we did. And it was really hard to do it. We knew playing Notre Dame was
going to be really, really difficult. And it was everything that we thought it
was going to be.  
But these guys made some plays in the second half that kind of showed our true
character. We talked about it in the locker room a little bit that every time
we were challenged, we responded.  
And couldn't be happier for them tonight. You know, every senior that plays
college basketball wants to win their last game in their career. And I'm happy
for K that she got a chance to do that and with Kia as well. And I'm glad that
the two buckets that K made down the stretch were kind of the difference in
the game. And that's the way she's supposed to go out, because she made a big
difference all year and throughout her career.  
So I'm thrilled for them. And what else can I say?  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Breanna, you came to UConn saying you wanted to win four national titles.
You're one away. Does it seem surreal in any way? Or just describe how that
feels, a lofty goal up there and now you're pretty close to it?  
BREANNA STEWART: I think it's really surreal, and I think I haven't had a
chance to even think about that, the fact that I've won three National
Championships. But I said I want to win four, and you can't win four without
winning three.  
  
Q. Breanna, on stage I think you said this is the hardest championship or
the hardest season. Why is that compared to the other two?  
BREANNA STEWART: Well, I think that this season was different. And Coach
(indiscernible) when we went into the locker room, we had to grow as players
and as people off the court, and that's what we did. And you saw us struggle
in November when we lost to Stanford and that kind of thing, and just the way
we've grown to become the type of team that you saw tonight and national
champions.  
  
Q. Kaleena, what did it mean to you to make those key shots, only up 6 in
the second half and after the game to be there holding on to the National
Championship trophy?  
KALEENA MOSQUEDA‑LEWIS: It meant a lot to be able to step up for my teammates
in a big time where they needed me. And definitely kind of had it in the back
of my mind that we wanted to go out with a National Championship and being
able to hold that trophy up at the end of the game and end my senior year the
way I wanted to and the way that any basketball player wants to was amazing.  
  
Q. Breanna, looked like you turned the ankle there with about eight minutes
left in the first half. Looked pretty painful. Can you talk about how much
pain you were in throughout the game, and then just seemed like you were still
able to really impact the game with a lot of so ‑called little plays but they
made a big difference?  
BREANNA STEWART: When I turned it I wasn't sure I stepped on someone else's
foot or rolled it on my own. Obviously it was painful. Anyone who has rolled
an ankle knows that. Rosemary, she does a good job, taped it to the point
where I really couldn't feel it during the game.  
  
Q. Moriah, you've also won three titles in a row. And I wonder just how you
feel about that accomplishment as well?  
MORIAH JEFFERSON: I feel the same way Stewy does. I had the same goal coming
in, wanting to win four national championships. And to be able to do it with
these guys and to do it on the type of season we had, I can't be more proud of
my teammates and I couldn't be happier.  
  
Q. I know everyone on the panel affiliated with UConn, you all have multiple
championships. My question is: As far as basketball is concerned, is it harder
during the tourney to get to the tournament or are the practices ‑‑ the
competition in practice, is that just the competition because you guys
continue to win? So my question is, is it harder in practice or are the games
actually harder for you guys?  
MORIAH JEFFERSON: Coach does a good job of making practices extremely hard. I
think when you're playing against the type of practice players that we play
against that are so well played throughout the whole practice and they're so
much stronger and physical than you, it's definitely hard.  
But I think it's two different types of situations because Notre Dame is a
great team and they play hard. But I think practice is something you really
can't imagine unless you go through it.  
  
Q. Breanna, you set out to win four championships. Alongside of that you've
won three Final Four Most Outstanding Player awards. The only player to do
that was Kareem Abdul ‑Jabbar. The only woman to do that. Can you describe how
that feels like?  
BREANNA STEWART: I think that, you know, it's a cool feeling that kind of
thing. But the championship is most important. And as I said on the stage, I
thought that Moriah should have gotten the MOP. I thought the way she played
was phenomenal these past two games. And I think that people wanted to give it
to me just because it was my opportunity to win three in a row.  
  
Q. Moriah, Coach McGraw credited your defense on Jewell Loyd as being one of
the most significant factors in the game. Can you talk about what that matchup
was like and how you defended her and basically what you did?  
MORIAH JEFFERSON: Jewell's a really good player. And you have to try your
hardest to not let her catch the ball. I really just tried to deny her and
make sure that she couldn't catch it and send it back door to Stewy and Kiah
who were there to block it. I give a lot of credit to them because it makes my
job on the perimeter a lot easier.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Rebecca Lobo told me that your players now maybe don't see the same
"Crazy Geno" that she saw 20 years ago. And I want to know, she said that
changes with each championship. So with each championship, how much or how
much do you change I guess as a coach and as a person as well?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I think it's natural. It's just natural that you go through
some changes. I ask my players to change. I ask them to grow up and to be
different than they are coming in. And I want them to be better in March and
April than they are in October and November.  
A lot of times that goes for coaches, too. I wanted to be better. I wanted to
be better as the season went on. I wanted to be a better coach for them at the
end of the season. So we spent a lot of time during the season growing up
together.  
They didn't trust very much early in the season. They just thought everything
was going to be real easy. And they didn't really depend on each other that
much. They kind of wanted somebody else to do the hard work. And little by
little, they became trustworthy. And I trust them now and I think they trust
me.  
When Rebecca was a senior and we won that championship, we all were in a
situation where none of us knew what we were doing. We were just kind of
winging it. None of us had been there before, none of us had done that, it was
like a magical ride, and we all just roll with it.  
With each year it's gotten increasingly more difficult to get to the same
point, because now you know where all the pitfalls are.  
I'm going to look back at some point and it's going to be‑‑ I'm going to have
to read it to really comprehend everything that we've done. I'm really going
to have to actually read it.  
  
Q. I know you've been asked and commented on this a lot this week, but now
that it's here, 10 up, 10 down: Phil Jackson, John Wooden, and Geno Auriemma.
Can you reflect on that now that it's here?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, none of those other guys you mentioned coached any bad
teams with bad players on them. So we all have that in common. We all coached
some of the most iconic players to play the game of basketball.  
So I think we have that as the thread that runs through all three. Anytime
you're in a championship situation, anytime you're trying to win any
tournament, but especially the National Championship, so many things have to
go right and you have to have players that make those plays that make it go
right.  
To do that 10 times in a row, to win 10 and be 10‑0 in National Championship
games is ‑‑ again, it's too big for me to think about it. It's too much. Too
much.  
  
Q. A question along those lines, when you match John Wooden with 10 National
Championships, invariably there will be people who will say: Well, you coach
women. Wooden coached men. It's different. How do you hope UConn's 10
championships, your 10 championships, are measured in the scope of basketball
history?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Whichever way they want to mention it, whichever way they want
to acknowledge it. Whenever way anybody wants to put it on a pedestal or keep
it somewhere else, you know‑‑ I said this the other day to people, you know,
we're not real good in this country about appreciating just people that are
good. We always have to compare. We don't appreciate Stewy. We have to compare
her to somebody playing in the NBA or somebody playing college basketball.  
I go through that with our Olympic team. Our Olympic team is the best team in
the history of the Olympics. We won five straight gold medals. But because we
travel with the greatest basketball players in the world, when you make a
comparison, you always come up short. So you kind of got to appreciate it in
its own element and say, okay, well, relative to their peers, those guys are
really, really good.  
Because if we don't, if we start relegating it, you know, and we go by what's
the most important sport in the country, the NFL. Bill Belichick is the only
coach worth a shit right now. Everybody else is just trying to catch up to
him. But every other coach that you mentioned, whether it's Phil Jackson,
Coach K, Anson Dorrance down in North Carolina, the women's soccer coach, when
you accomplish something that's really hard to accomplish, you should be proud
of yourself.  
And how people want to compare you to anybody else, that's their prerogative.
Some people are going to say this is really, really great and historic, an
unbelievable achievement, and some people will pooh‑pooh it.  
So as you can tell by some of my comments in the last couple of weeks, I've
lost the ability to care, give a damn what people think.  
  
Q. Because this team had overcome so much in growth over the course of the
season, was it one of the most satisfying and rewarding?  
COACH AURIEMMA: It is. It is. I didn't like this team in October. I mean,
don't get me wrong, I tried to like them. I was really nice to them. But that
always backfires. I tried to like them.  
Like last year, with that team last year, I liked them, they liked me. We
started off October15th loving each other, and it just got better and better.
It was Barney. I love you, you love me, we all loved everybody.  
This year I didn't like them in October and they didn't like me either,
because I knew. I knew what we were doing in October and November wasn't going
to be good enough to get what they wanted, which is what they have tonight.
But they didn't want to listen to me. They didn't want to hear it.  
How do you tell a group of guys that have won two national championships in a
row that what they're doing isn't good enough? So little by little, though,
they started to understand. They started to see what we were talking about as
a coaching staff. And Shea and Marisa and C.D., they put a lot of time in with
these guys, and little by little they started to see the results of that hard
work, how they started to trust each other more, depend on each other more, be
held more accountable to each other. Last year's team we had three bad
practices in five months.  
I remember all three of them. Great. That's it. In five months. This team we
probably had three a week. Because in the beginning they didn't know, they
didn't know, and as the season wore down, every day was great in practice.
Every day was a great day. Most of January, February, March, these last couple
of weeks, every day was great.  
I shouldn't say‑‑ there were a couple that were not so great.  
  
Q. During the breakout session, Breanna talked about when she was a high
school senior, she would talk to you, you guys would have conversations, check
up on each other, and she said a lot of times those conversations revolved
around sort of expectations, what she wanted to do when she came to UConn,
what you sort of either expected from her or said: I can help you with this
but you have to work. Can you recall even in general what those conversations
were like when she was a high school senior prior to heading in?  
COACH AURIEMMA: It's part of the evolution of our program. And it's part of
the evolution of the recruiting process. When we were recruiting Rebecca, it
was Rebecca. You could come to Connecticut and you could help us be really
good. You can help build a program that people will say Rebecca Lobo helped
build that.  
So that was the conversations that Rebecca had and I had on a regular basis
were about what she could do to help us and how much fun it would be to play
at Connecticut, close to home and all that.  
As the years have gone on, and now culminating with recruiting Stewy, my
conversations with Stewy were more about Stewy: Think of it this way, what do
you want? Tell me what you want, because even if you don't come to
Connecticut, I mean, there's a chance we could still win national
championships. So it's not like we're dependent on just one player.  
So what do you want? And she said: You know I want to win four national
championships. I want to be Player of the Year. I want to make the Olympic
team. I want, I want. She wants all these things.  
I said: Well, why don't you sit down and take a look at all the coaches that
you think can help you do that and you tell me where you want to go to school.
So it was more about now the conversation and recruiting, this is what we can
do for you, as opposed to Stewy: If you come here you'll help us do something,
what, we've never done before?  
So it's all about appealing to what they want now. And the thing with Maya,
the same with Stewy, all these guys, those kids that don't necessarily know
what they want, I don't know what I want, we don't get those kids. Those kids
have to play 35 minutes, lead the country in scoring, want to have fun, want
to love their coach, want to be buddy‑buddies with their coach. We don't get
those guys. We get guys who don't like me but want to win championships.  
  
Q. I know you said you just don't like comparing things, but three
Outstanding MOPs for Stewy. First woman to ever do that. And, again, Kareem is
the only person in college basketball to do that. What does that mean in her
legend?  
COACH AURIEMMA: There just hasn't been a player like Stewy in the women's game
in a long, long time. I think she might be like two inches taller and longer
than Cheryl Miller. And Cheryl Miller was one of the best players I ever saw
that size.  
Lisa Leslie was a great, great player, but I don't know if she was as
versatile. Stewy is not as big as Lisa, but I don't know that Lisa was‑‑
Stewy's the kind of player that women's basketball probably has not seen,
because it's still young. Kind of like when Kareem came to UCLA. Not a whole
lot of players coming out of high school were like Kareem, in the history of
the men's game.  
So for her to get three most outstanding players, as I said, she set her goal
to do that and maybe that's why she broke down up on the stage today, that she
knows how hard she worked to get here, and I'm proud of her. She has to do it
under unbelievable expectations, the weight of expectations on Stewy are way
different than any other kid playing college basketball.  
  
Q. You just touched on this a little bit comparing Stewy to Kareem Abdul
‑Jabbar in terms of the timeframe in which they played, and there's a lot of
similarities between you and John Wooden. Not just the 10 titles now but also
the era of the men's game and the women's game. Have you considered that, and
also like the role you've played in the evolution of the women's game?  
COACH AURIEMMA: That's a good question. And I like it better when it's phrased
like that. Because we are in that stage, the NCAA Tournament is only 30 years
old, or 34, 35, maybe, the NCAA Tournament. Used to be a different tournament.  
So we haven't been doing this a long time. College women's basketball being in
the public eye hasn't been‑‑ that hasn't been a constant in the media, the
social media, the fans, the everything.  
This is all new to us, relatively new. 30 years. And even in the last 20
years, you know, since 1995, things have changed dramatically for the women's
game. And I can remember as a kid you couldn't get a college basketball game
on TV, in the late'60s, early'70s.  
When UCLA was going through their run, you couldn't get college games on TV.
There was no big Monday, ESPN no televising those games. You were lucky if you
ever saw a game. So the game didn't have the appeal that the men's game has
today. And the NCAA Tournament was different back then. You play two games
close to home and you went to the Final Four.  
And we're not quite that, but there's a lot of similarities. So I think John
Wooden was one of the reasons why the college game became the game it became.
Like the game down at the Astrodome in Houston, that kickstarted a lot of
things.  
And I hope that we at Connecticut have done our part to grow this game. When
people say is this good for the game, what you're doing, I'm part of it so I
think it's great for the game.  
But I do think there's a level of attention that we're given that I think
helps everybody. It helps everybody. And just like it ended at UCLA, they're
not what they used to be. History has a way of reminding you that the same
thing is going to happen with us, the same thing. Just want to enjoy it while
we're in it.  
  
Q. You said in October/November your players weren't doing the right thing.
What weren't they doing or maybe what were they doing that wasn't right? And
was there a point in the season where that changed, where you saw that they
started trusting you, where they started doing the right thing?  
COACH AURIEMMA: It's never like big, big things. It's not like they didn't
feel like coming to practice. Or they were dogging it in games. Never anything
like that. It was more of this little detail is really important and they
would tell you by their actions no, it isn't, and that would just piss us off,
like big time.  
So this thing in practice, this drill we're going to do, I know it's really,
really hard. But if you're going to stand there and complain that it's really,
really hard, now you're just not good enough to be where you want to be.  
So there was a lot of going on like we were making it, we were trying to
prepare them and they didn't necessarily want to work at it, they just wanted
to play games and win. They didn't really have an interest in practicing
great. And I think after we played at Notre Dame and came back, because that
time leading up to the Notre Dame game from the Stanford game was pretty
important. A lot of changes were made on our team between the Stanford game
and the Notre Dame game. A lot of good stuff happened on our team.  
And from January1st, pretty much, until everything changed. They embraced how
hard it was. Every drill we gave them that was impossible, they embraced it.
They tried to win at it any way. Everything we threw at them they tried to
win. Every obstacle they tried to get over it instead of, oh, well, Coach,
there's only four us on defense and there's five of them on offense, how do
you expect us to guard them? What, do you think I'm stupid? I know there's
five of them. You're supposed to figure out how to guard them.  
As the season went on they started to embrace the challenge, and that
basically is what got us to where we are now.  
  
Q. I know you said you've lost the ability to give a damn about what other
people think ‑‑  
COACH AURIEMMA: That's not really true. My wife, I care what she thinks.  
  
Q. I'm just wondering whether you might also care what the team thought when
they sort of lifted you up and carried you off the floor. What was that like
for you, that experience?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, that first started in 1995. Every year since then it's
become less enjoyable, because back then they were overjoyed at the fact that
they could carry me off the floor.  
Now when they pick me up, all they do is bitch and moan how heavy I am. Well,
I make it worse because I kind of just lay there like a stone. So Kaleena
Mosqueda‑Lewis took the brunt of it today.  
Yeah, that's just something that started. I don't know that they like it or
don't like it, but they do it. They have fun with it. And we have a lot of
traditions on our team. Some are like really, really dopy and some are pretty
cool.  
And as I've gotten older I embrace more of the traditions that they think are
important. And it's a fun‑loving group, and I'm happy for them.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## April 6, 2015

  

### [Geno Auriemma](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14072)

### [Kaleena Mosqueda-
Lewis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23275)

  
_TAMPA, FLORIDA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us on the dais from UConn, head coach Geno Auriemma and
five student‑athletes, Morgan Tuck, Kaleena Mosqueda‑Lewis, Breanna Stewart,
Moriah Jefferson and Kia Nurse. Questions?  
  
Q. Geno, I'm guessing a lot of your freshmen weren't even born during your
first championship run in'95. And the players who maybe were don't remember a
time where UConn wasn't a powerhouse. So, can you give us some insight onto
the challenges you and those maybe early'90s players faced that these players
have never and will never face?  
COACH AURIEMMA: We've been really lucky the way that you would like the way
programs get built, that there's some kind of blueprint for it and that every
coach would aspire to have that same blueprint.  
You take a job that not a lot of people want at a school that has never had
success, then you win a little bit and a little more and a little more, and
you win with players that are not being recruited by the bigger schools, the
really good schools. And little by little you end up winning a National
Championship in 1995.  
Doesn't always work out that way. And we were lucky that it did. A lot went
into those first 10 years. And it went from hoping we make the NCAA Tournament
and then hope we win a game in the tournament because we lost our first two
games, the first two years we were in the tournament we lost in the first game
that we played, hoping we get to the regionals and then hope we ever get to
the Final Four.  
So it was always like I hope we can do this, I hope we can do this. So what's
changed that these guys haven't had the experience is there's no like I hope
we do this. It's all this is what we're going to do. And in some ways I think
they missed out on the excitement of getting there. But they get to enjoy all
the fruits of what all those other players did. And now they come here with a
different set of expectations, this is what we're going to do.  
Some of the kids that I recruited, I want to help build a winning program and
I want to maybe go to a Final Four. Stewy says I want to come to Connecticut,
I want to win four national championships.  
It's a different world that they live in, different expectations that they
have. And I'm lucky that I got to be part of all that.  
  
Q. Can you sum up Kaleena's career and what she's meant to this program?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I had a coach tell me the other night that Kaleena is a
one‑dimensional player. I thought it was pretty funny because Kaleena's
freshmen year she had 31.  
And to me, the beauty of somebody like K is that because she's such an
incredible shooter, that if you're not paying attention, you think that that's
all she does.  
And yesterday she had seven assists. And she's probably our best screener.
She's one of our best passers. She gets in the way defensively once in a while
and causes her man to‑‑ she confuses the offense the way she plays defense.
She makes you think she's guarding you but she's really not. That's a real
talent that not a lot of players have.  
But over the last four years, she's become a really good basketball player,
somebody who is very dependable and reliable and somebody you can count on.
And that didn't used to be the case when she was a freshman. And each year
after that.  
And that's what you want players to do. You want them to grow and become a
little more than what they are coming out of high school. And she's had an
incredible career and she's put her name in the record books, and those
memories will last a lifetime.  
  
Q. Among the five of you, which one of you I guess are the biggest UConn
history buffs, that maybe grew up following those early 2000 teams? And if any
of you guys are, what do those teams mean to you, even though you just watched
them on TV?  
KALEENA MOSQUEDA‑LEWIS: I didn't like watching basketball very much when I was
little. So I really didn't get a chance to watch as much as I probably should
have. I know them now because they come back and visit.  
  
Q. Any of the rest of you?  
UNIDENTIFIED PLAYER: I wouldn't say like the early 2000s because we were in
grammar school and I don't think we were all into basketball as much as we are
now. But I know definitely middle school and high school all of us pretty much
got to watch some of the games and got to aspire to be there one day.  
COACH AURIEMMA: You have to rephrase that for Kia Nurse because in high school
she was watching the dogsled races in Alaska. This is a different Yukon. You
have to be specific with her if you want her to answer.  
  
Q. Geno, you're a Philly guy so you appreciate and understand the underdog.
A lot of times the city reflects and represents that. It's been a long time
since your program or team has been an underdog in a game. Is there any part
of you that misses that, what Muffet has today, the idea that nobody believes
you can win and to sort of overcome popular perception?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah. I mean, I think we all aspire to be in that situation at
some point in our lives, you know, where you're going to capture the
imagination of a lot of people. It's that whole Rocky Balboa thing in
Philadelphia. The city has a statue of a guy who made a movie, a fake boxer,
in front of one of the great art museums in the world. You know what I mean?
It's a crazy city.  
But I think it's part of the lure of sports, that feeling that‑‑ let me tell
you what it's like to be the underdog, what I think, what it was like for us
when we were in that situation.  
When you're the underdog, all your game plans are about this is what we're
going to do, we're going to do this, we're going to do this, and then we're
going to do this and we're going to beat their ass. And everybody gets all
fired up, yeah. And you go out and you play.  
When you're in our situation, I get up every day and I go, damn, if they do
this, this, and this, we're going to lose. So it's a flipped way of thinking,
because when you're the underdog you think all things are possible. All you
have to do is play the perfect game and all things are possible.  
And, yeah, I miss being in that situation. But hopefully history holds true.
The underdogs don't have a really good record against the top dogs.  
  
Q. Geno, I'd like to see if I can get your players to chime in on this first
before you address it. But here you are on the verge of a tenth title, and
it's been said that the reason being is that you've been able to collect the
best players. For the players, when did UConn come up on your radar? If you
didn't watch them on TV or didn't know as much about their history, when was
it that you became aware of UConn as a national power? And, Geno, when did
that happen for you when you were able to start recruiting that type of player
that could put you in the situation where this program is right now?  
KALEENA MOSQUEDA‑LEWIS: As Morgan said, once we started getting really serious
with basketball, it wasn't easy to know who the‑‑ we knew who the powerhouse
was, and a lot of times that was UConn. And we've grown up watching them since
we were high school, junior high, and that's when we got interest from UConn
and then created the relationship with the coaching staff.  
And once you do that, you pay attention to the teams more because you want to
see how they're doing and think about going there.  
COACH AURIEMMA: All right. Stewy was National Player of the Year in high
school. And Morgan Tuck was All‑American. K was All‑American. And maybe Player
of the Year senior year, although some other people thought some other people
were. And Moriah was First Team All‑American and Kia was All‑Canadian.  
If she hasn't already been up here, when Muffet comes up here and brings her
five starters, they were all First Team All‑Americans at some point in their
careers, if I'm not mistaken.  
And any other coach that brings their starters up here at this point in time,
generally speaking, has five of the best players that played in high school
playing on their team. That's how you get here.  
I don't think any of the coaches should apologize for getting the best
players. I think that's part of the job description when you sign up to be a
coach. A lot of coaches think it's noble and honorable to recruit bad players
and make them better. I've been there. It sucks. You don't get to play in
March when you have that kind of team.  
We hear that all the time: You've managed to collect the best players. That's
true. Honest to God, that's true. There's a lot of kids that graduated the
same year that Kaleena Mosqueda‑Lewis did. A lot of them. They're not here.
They're All‑Americans, they went someplace, but they're not here. It's
something else, once you get them here, to get here. This is not easy. Whether
you have the best players or don't have the best players. Getting here is not
an easy thing.  
And I think any coach that coaches at the level that we're trying to play at
right now‑‑ it's like, well, yeah, you know, you have Maya Moore and you had
Diana Taurasi and you had Stewy ‑‑ they start naming all these iconic players
I've coached. Yeah.  
I don't know of any really good coach that coaches bad players to the Final
Four. Every coach is blessed to have the best players when they get to the
Final Four.  
  
Q. Coach and players, what do you remember about the last game between you
guys and Notre Dame back in December, and maybe tell the media here where you
think that Notre Dame team has come and where have you come as a team?  
COACH AURIEMMA: It was early in the season for both of us, obviously. Anytime
you play a really good team on the road that early, you don't know what's
going to happen. We could have easily as gone out there and gotten blown out.
We were down 10 kind of early in the game.  
I don't think any of us expected to go up there and just outscore them by 30
the rest of the way. That was a surprise. I think that they were missing one
of their best players. And you look at their team now, and they're a different
team, they're a better team.  
I think they were more centered around the great talents that Jewell Loyd
brings to the team, and I think they're more versatile now. They have more
players doing more things. And we've changed a lot since then as well. And
we've found out a lot about ourselves as well. We've gotten better at every
area of the game. And I think that the two teams that are playing tomorrow
night are not the two teams that played against each other in December.  
Any horse racing fans in here? Anybody know who Steve Cauthen is? Who did he
ride? He rode Affirmed. Anybody know who the jockey for Alydar was? Hard to
remember. I have no idea because he didn't win any of those three races.  
  
Q. Moving off horse racing ‑‑  
COACH AURIEMMA: That's why people become famous, because they ride the best
horses and they coach the best players.  
  
Q. You mentioned back when you first started it was a hope to do something
and now it's an expectation. Is it ‑‑ I don't know if easier is the right
word, but for these players to I guess kind of advance further? And you said
expect it. So, I mean, they have to expect it, too.   
COACH AURIEMMA: They do. They do. They come to Connecticut expecting to win
National Championships. But you know what? We had a team from 2005, after
Diana graduated our team in 2005, 2006 and 2007, that didn't make the Final
Four three years in a row, and the world was ending in stories as we knew it.
We would never be any good again. Our time was over. Our program was history.  
Those kids all came to Connecticut expecting to win national championships.
Expecting to do it and then being good enough to do it and then paying the
cost of what it takes to do it, those are all variables that you don't know
going in. So whatever expectations these kids have, they still have to come
and prove it.  
They don't just show up in September, go to practice, and somebody says here's
when the championship game is and here's when the parade is, here's your
schedule: You have English at 10:00, you have history at 11:00, you have math
class at 2:00, and the parade is April12th. It doesn't work that way.  
  
Q. You have a chance to pass Coach Wooden if the team wins with 10 national
championships. I believe you had nine, if my memory is serving me ‑‑  
COACH AURIEMMA: He has ten.  
  
Q. Tie. There's always been this criticism that it's too easy to do in
women's basketball, but it strikes me when he won his it was in an era about
30 ‑odd years after the beginning of the NCAA Championship for men, and you're
winning it about 30 years after the beginning of the NCAA Championship for
women. Can you see a comparable development string and that as we look forward
the competition will grow wider? There are 40‑odd‑thousand high school girls
playing basketball, and one would think that the talent could wind up
elsewhere, too.   
COACH AURIEMMA: Those are the similarities in the era that the game is played
now and similar‑‑ I was in high school during that run for some of that run.
So obviously I was a big fan of UCLA just like every other kid that played
high school basketball. You might not know a lot of kids playing college
basketball, but you knew who UCLA starting five were. And they did get all the
best players.  
You read the stories about UCLA and their freshmen team. When they weren't
eligible, the freshmen team beat the varsity and varsity were returning
national champions, four starters back. They did have the greatest collection
of talent. But still gotta go out on the court and still gotta win the games.  
And, yeah, the NCAA Tournament was different. You win four games, you win the
National Championship. The first two probably played a bus ride from Pauley
Pavilion or certainly in that area. So we do have a lot of similarities
between where we are now and where the men's game was then.  
And you look at where the game has gotten to today on the men's side and what
the popularity of the men's basketball tournament is. Is it going to be‑‑ are
we ever going to be that popular like the men's tournament is? I don't know.
Women's sports in this country, team sports especially, have always had a hard
time reaching that status.  
I think in this country individual women sports are more celebrated than team
sports. Women's tennis or women's golf or women's skiing even. Will we ever
get there? I don't know.  
Will there be more good teams? Yeah. Like I said the other day, look at South
Carolina. Look at Dayton. Things take time. UCLA hasn't been what it was
since. Things do change.  
  
Q. Last year it seemed there was a lot of attention for tomorrow night's
game with off ‑the‑court stuff. Is it nice that the focus this year is what's
going to happen in between the lines tomorrow?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Nobody likes to have more fun than me with stuff when I can. I
try not to take myself or‑‑ I think that's one of the reasons why we generally
play pretty well during this time of the year, because we don't take ourselves
that seriously. We understand what the deal is.  
So when it gets to be more than that, I'm not really comfortable with it,
because it didn't seem like it was fun. But it's really good right now. I
think on the outside people might not really understand the level of respect
that we have for them and that they have for us.  
So no matter what anybody says or does or thinks, it's there and it's always
been there and it will always be there. Always.  
  
Q. Can you talk about your vision of what good offense is supposed to look
like, and do you think that if more teams ran offense like these two teams do,
the games would be easier to watch?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah. Yeah, you know, I think in any sport, in any sport
people are kind of drawn to players who make things look easy, five players
who pass the ball to each other, cut, help each other get open, get an open
shot, knock it in. That draws people like, wow, how did they do that or I like
the way they do that. In any sport. Doesn't matter what the sport is.  
I grew up in Philadelphia. So I saw one version of hockey back in those days:
We touch the puck. We throw into that corner. Five guys are going to run after
it. Three guys are not going to come out of that corner; they're going to the
hospital. And then we're going to score and we're going to win. So that's one
version of the hockey that I grew up with. Then there's the Edmonton Oilers
version of hockey.  
So there's a lot of ways to win but some ways I think are just more appealing.
And you don't have to necessarily have the best players. Look at Dayton again,
because it's more recent, a perfect example of a team that figured out this is
what we have, how do we make these guys into a good offensive team.  
And basketball is a beautiful game. I don't know if Harvey is still here. But
he wrote a great book about the Knicks in their heyday with Bradley and
DeBusschere and Reed and those guys. And part of the beauty of the team was
how well they played together and how they moved the ball.  
And that's why I get on my players all the time, let's get an open shot and
let's try to make half of them. And let's get a shot from inside ten feet and
let's try to make 70 or 80percent of those. Why? Because if you don't make
them then why am I paying you‑‑ like not giving them money‑‑ like you're
getting a scholarship. Let's not get confused here.  
  
Q. Geno, obviously to get to where you are and where you have been, it
requires an obsession, attention to details, standards, things that have been
with you a lot of years. But also beyond the Xs and Os, it's like college,
you're dealing with people, college, you're dealing with March. Sometimes you
seem very fascinated with. What is your general philosophy toward dealing with
people and dealing with getting them to play their hardest? Are there certain
things that they're very important to you that make you learn that are vital
that you've always got to have with you?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah, and I've been through a lot of different cycles. Early
on my career in my career I thought that I could control every situation that
I was in and make it turn out the way I wanted it to turn out. And I realized
at some point in my career that no, I can't. And even to this day, like even
going into tomorrow, I'm going to worry about things that I really have no
control over.  
So once I realized that was the case and I learned to just let that part go
and spend more time with my players and getting them to feel and think a
certain way about how we're going to play, how we're going to perform, that
believe in the way we practice, believe in our training, believe in our
preparation, and not put the emphasis on winning, not put the emphasis on what
happens if we lose.  
And I had this conversation with them just recently. I think one of the
reasons why we win a lot, other than good players, one of the reasons why we
win a lot this time of year is we're not afraid to lose. We don't play with
any fear of losing. And I think sometimes that kids, adults, they paralyze
themselves with fear of what if we lose, what if I screw this up, what if I
miss this shot, what if I turn the ball over.  
Like there's this paralyzing nature that comes with that. So as a coaching
staff, we try really, really hard to eliminate that from our way of thinking.
And to be honest, that's the best we can do.  
Once you get into March, you're not going to get a lot better physically.
We're not going to get bigger, quicker, faster, stronger. If we sucked at
guarding ball screens, we're not going to get a lot better at it.  
So it's more of that kind of mentality as opposed to anything else.  
  
Q. You've always spoken very highly of Jewell Loyd on and off the court.
What makes her a great player? What makes her a great person?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, I liked her a lot better in high school before she told
me she was going to Notre Dame instead of coming to Connecticut. I don't like
her as much now.  
I watch her play and I think there's something about her that is different
than any other woman playing college basketball today. It's just something,
she just has something, she has the way she moves, the way she touches the
ball, the way the ball comes out of her hands. She just has something.  
And not very many players playing men's or women's basketball have that. And
she plays with a confidence. And she knows she can make any shot. She knows
she can do‑‑ when she touches the ball she knows she can do anything with it.  
And she does it in a way that's very classy, I think, I just admire everything
about her. I wish she was a little bit older, you know. Then she wouldn't be
here tomorrow night. So that's a big part of it.  
I wish she was a little bit older, that way she'd give Diana and those guys on
the Olympic team a run for their money. She's that good. She's that good.  
  
Q. Jose Velazquez was the jockey.  
COACH AURIEMMA: You had to Google that.  
  
Q. I wanted to ask you about Morgan Tuck and the psychology of kind of
coaching somebody right now that's suddenly nationally being called
underrated, overlooked, and could you just talk ‑‑ you can get mileage out of
that at key times. Could you talk about‑‑ because very rarely do we come up
and ask you about somebody who has been overlooked on one of your teams. It's
been sort of every drop has been squeezed out of their publicity. Could you
talk about as a coach addressing that and bringing her through the National
Championship, obviously being very motivated by being overlooked?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I think it came up recently how‑‑ the reason why she might
appear to be overlooked is because of the way Stewy towers over the game right
now. And Stewy casts a pretty big shadow. So within that, it's easy to look at
our team and say those other guys are pretty good but they're not Stewy.  
Then she didn't play last year. So the fact that she didn't play and we won a
National Championship and went undefeated, it was like she must not be that
vital. She must not be that important. But if somebody just came to our
practice every day for a month, they would think Tuck was the National Player
of the Year. That's how good she is every day in every area. You're right
about it's hard to be under the radar on our team, I understand that.  
But there can't be ten players in the country better than Morgan Tuck. But I
understand. I really do. And all those kids, whenever people say, well, Tuck
should have made All‑American, my response is, okay, which one of those ten
kids would you take off. They all deserved it, too.  
I think right now what Morgan is showing is that I'm not Stewy, I'm not
Kaleena. I'm not Moriah Jefferson. But there are things that I do that nobody
else on my team can do. And that to me is the beauty of Morgan. She doesn't
try to be anybody but herself.  
  
Q. Brianna Turner didn't play in the first matchup you guys had. Now she's
back in the lineup, playing exceptionally well. What changes does she pose for
you guys and how do you go about stopping her?  
COACH AURIEMMA: You watch her and physically she just runs right by you. If
she can't run by you, she just jumps over you. So she impacts the game in a
way that the rest of their post players can't.  
She impacts the game on the defensive end with her athletic ability and her
length the way some of the other post players at Notre Dame can't.  
So obviously there's an element now in the mix tomorrow that wasn't there in
December. How do you stop her? I think at this time of the year, I don't think
there's any such thing as stopping anybody. I think you just try to make them
uncomfortable a little bit.  
Tomorrow we have to try various things to make Notre Dame uncomfortable.
They're a great offensive team. And trying to stop one person or trying to
take them out leaves you vulnerable to so many other things.  
So they're having the same discussions at their staff meetings that we have.
So I don't think there's any stopping to be honest with you.  
  
Q. On the subject of Coach Wooden, what stories do you have about him? Did
you ever meet him? Did you ever talk to him? Did you subscribe to his
philosophy of the pyramid of success?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, we are a lot different. Come from different eras,
different backgrounds. I couldn't tell you one piece of that pyramid, because
at the time that I was growing up and they were winning every game, I was more
interested in, you know, how good Mike Warren was. I was more interested in
how Valley shot the ball or why Shackleford was so good, or, holy shit,
they've got Sidney Wicks and Curtis Rowe and they're still winning like that.
So I didn't pay attention to the other stuff.  
And I've told this story a bunch of times, and it's probably nothing. It loses
its luster after you tell it enough times. But I did meet him one time. I was
fortunate to be at the same clinic he was.  
And I got introduced to him because I asked to be introduced to him. And it
was like I never knew my grandparents, but it was like sitting there and
talking to your grandfather. I'm 61, so I was probably 45, 46, 47, maybe.  
And he put his hand on my knee and patted it a couple of times and we talked
for about 10 minutes, 15 minutes. He did all the talking and I just listened
about basketball, about how he enjoyed watching the games and why I reminded
him of when he coached blah, blah, blah. And I thought that was pretty cool.  
And then the next thing you know, we win the National Championship in 2004.
And Sports Illustrated makes these things and Diana's on the cover. This
little thing on the top: "Why I love UConn Women" by John Wooden. So it's a
nice article by Coach Wooden about why he loves UConn and how unselfish we are
and we move without the ball, blah, blah, blah.  
And he goes on and on about our team, and he says: I've never met their coach,
but he seems like a nice young fellow. When I read that, I'm like, okay, so
much for my impression that I made on Coach Wooden.  
  
Q. You have such a vast knowledge of sports history. So you know that
sometimes the most dynastic team in sports, how well prepared they are,
something weird can happen in a championship game, a weird bounce or whatever.
You're 9 ‑for‑9 in championship games. Is that something that you're most
proud of, that every chance you had to win a championship you've won on?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I think when I look back on our career at Connecticut and our
success, that is‑‑ especially in a one‑and‑done environment, it's like college
football bowl game or the NFL, where you're undefeated during the regular
season and you have one bad night, one bounce of the ball goes the wrong way
and doesn't mean the best team won, but you didn't win. That other team won.  
So to be in that situation for us nine times and have it all work out our way,
that's kind of improbable, when you look back. You don't realize while you're
doing it, but when you bring it up like that and you really force yourself to
look back, man, I really can't explain it either. Can't explain it.  
And I said this yesterday, for those of you that were here, it's going to end.
It might end tomorrow. Might end if we're in that situation next year,
following year. This isn't something that's going to last forever. Not going
to win every single championship game that we're in, if we're in some more,
but up to this point, man, it is something that's really hard to explain. And
I'm just incredibly grateful.  
  
Q. When you're talking about Jewell, you described her and this sort of
intangible way, it's like that that old song (indiscernible) gotta get
rocking. I don't know what it is, but you only know it when you see it. Is
that what you're saying? And, also, is ‑‑  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah.  
  
Q. ‑‑ it seems as if in the tournament early in the season she knew she had
to carry the team. Turner developed, other people developed, but in the
tournament she's back to the feeling I've got to do too much? Have you seen
any of that?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I think the great players all feel that way. Like at this time
of the year, they want to be responsible for winning because they feel like
it's their responsibility.  
So, yeah, in addition to all the intangibles, she makes shots from all over
the floor. And I think being the leader of that team, I think she probably
does feel a sense of I've got to put the team on my back and I've got to carry
them.  
And sometimes that is a heavy load to carry, you know. But you look at the way
Lindsay Allen has played in the tournament, you're right, having Turner back
and that kid Cable had only one bucket yesterday, the only one she had to
have. Taya Reimer scoring more points.  
Everybody's doing a little more. And I think that's why they are where they
are. We have training camp coming up in May for the U.S. National Team. I'm
going to get into her stuff, I'll figure her out a little more when she comes
to training camp. I'm going to straighten her out.  
  
Q. A little off topic, but this morning Lisa Leslie got enshrined or
inducted. Talk about her, her impact on the game, and as a fellow Naysmith
Hall of Famer, what does that mean?  
COACH AURIEMMA: We were saying earlier, the game is older than 30 years, but
the NCAA Tournament, the NCAA taking over college basketball for women was in
the early'80s, I believe. And since that time there's been like some names
that eras and the names, you know, whether it's Sheryl Swoopes winning a
National Championship and doing all that or more recently the Brittney Griner
era or the Diana era or Maya, guys on my team.  
There was for a long time the Lisa Leslie era, in college, in the WNBA, in the
Olympics. She was a towering figure in women's basketball. There's never been
a woman built like her that could do the things that she did.  
And she might have been the kind of forerunner for guys like Stewy. The impact
that she had on the women's game. At the time, it didn't get the attention
that it's getting now. But I'm glad people remember. Because sometimes people
forget. I had a chance to be on the coaching staff in Sydney when she was on
the team. And she was once‑in‑a‑lifetime kind of player.  
  
Q. Got a conference ‑related question for you. Your colleague Jose Fernandez
got a contract extension and raise today. I presume you would think that was
well deserved.   
COACH AURIEMMA: How big was the raise? Pretty big? Good. He owes me a lot of
dinners when he used to cry that he didn't get paid enough.  
I met Jose on a recruiting trip in Sacramento‑‑ not Sacramento. Where did they
play the Rose Bowl? Pasadena. Met him on a recruiting trip, and at the time I
had no idea who he was. And he had been the assistant at South Florida. So I
kind of knew that maybe and he had just gotten the job.  
And we were just sitting there, and I just met him five minutes earlier and we
were just sitting around talking blah, blah, blah, and he said: What are the
chances I get you to come down and play us down there. I said I don't really
need a lot of arm twisting to come to Florida to play a game in the middle of
winter.  
So we came down and we played them. And the following year they came to our
place. And we beat them pretty good down here, down in Tampa. They come to our
place the following year and we barely won the game in overtime. I remember
telling him that day done, the series is over, we're not playing you guys
anymore.  
I didn't get into this so you guys could take us into overtime. I was
expecting come down here, go to Burns or Molly Os over here and smoke cigars
and have a great time. And it dawned on me right then and there, he coached
the team and he did things, I thought if they ever get pretty good players,
they're going to be really tough. And it took a long time for the school to
realize what they had because they kind of strung them along for a long time.  
And what happened today with him, long overdue. Long, long overdue. He's one
of the best young coaches in America. And they're lucky to have him.  
  
Q. You talk about paying the cost. And with Stewart, when did you get a clue
that she could take what you would throw at her? Was it before she got here or
did you have to wait until she gets to you?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Hard to tell when kids are in high school how much they can
handle, physically, emotionally. You really can't tell. Sometimes you mean get
an inkling, but with Stewy, there was none.  
There was no foreshadowing anything. Only her amazing talent. When she got to
Connecticut, it was pretty evident her freshman year that she was going to be
great. But I'm glad it went the way it went her freshman year, because she
couldn't take you being hard on you. She couldn't take the other teams being
physical with her.  
It was all brand new to her, the physical pounding that she took, the way
people just‑‑ you saw her yesterday, the way people just foul her on every
possession, trying to get her out of her game.  
And for about a month, month and a half she lost her confidence. She lost her
ability to play basketball because it was such a shock to her system. She had
never been under that kind of duress in her entire life. She's 18.  
And since she was 14, it was a magical ride for her. Everything she touched
turned to gold. That freshman year, that kid she got knocked senseless. And
you know what, show you how tough she is, when March came around that year,
she just took over the tournament, after doing nothing all of January and
February. That's when I realized that this kid's got something that very few
kids have.  
I still don't really get on her as much as I did like some other players. But
when it's a big game and big plays and big moments, man, I've had some great
ones, but this kid's something else. She's something else.  
  
Q. The UCLA men were a dynasty. The Yankees have been a dynasty. The
Patriots are a dynasty. How do you feel about that word being associated with
your program?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I don't know. I guess everything needs a moniker. Everything
needs to be labeled, I guess.  
I think since 1995, in the last 20 years, we've been as good and as consistent
in our sport as anybody else has been in their sport. I never‑‑ and the guys
that cover our team on a regular basis‑‑ I never compare our sport to any
other sport. I don't compare our team to any other teams. I don't compare what
we do to what anybody else does.  
I just know that in our sport, from 1995 to today, what we've done against our
peers is as good if not better than anybody else has done in their sport
against their peers. I don't care whether it's harder in that sport or this
sport or that sport.  
I understand all that. Don't get me wrong. But given the rules that we play
with, with all the people we compete against, I'm pretty proud we've done it
the way we've done it for as long as we've done it.  
  
Q. I was just curious, at the end of the game last night, I couldn't help
but notice your reaction where you threw up your arms, and it was as if to say
here we are, here we go again. Was that the overriding emotional feeling that
you had at that moment and what do you suspect it will be like if you reach
that same moment tomorrow night and you're able to thrust your hands up in
triumph again?  
COACH AURIEMMA: That moment was‑‑ I don't want to say it had any connotation
about anything. Really, it didn't. We have some real strengths on our team and
there are things that we do that are really, really good. If Moriah Jefferson
is knocking in 3s, we're really hard to play against. We're really hard to
play against.  
If Moriah Jefferson specifically and Kia Nurse are knocking in 3s, we are
really, really hard to play against. So really when Moriah knocked in that 3,
for me it was like‑‑ I don't know it was Easter Sunday, right? So maybe like I
hope there's a whole bunch more of those where that came from. That's kind of
what that was.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_TAMPA, FLORIDA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Notre Dame. Joining us from Notre Dame we have
head coach Muffet McGraw and the five student‑athlete starters, Brianna
Turner, Taya Reimer, Lindsay Allen, Michaela Mabrey and Jewell Loyd.  
  
Q. Coach, is this year more special in a sense they're all special making
the Final Four and championship, but because you guys were not expected to be
here maybe as in past seasons?  
COACH MCGRAW: This one is definitely different. I think when we started the
season and looked at what we lost last year and were wondering where all the
offense is going to come from, to say that we've come a long way, I think it's
a little bit of an understatement.  
I'm just proud of where we've gotten to and how this team has just been
resilient and continued to pursue their goals this year.  
  
Q. Can you just give us a quick thought about how long you are still living
off of what happened last night, how long it took you to come back to earth
after the way that game ended?  
JEWELL LOYD: We're still talking about that on the ride over here. Just
everything that kind of went into that game and the emotions and everything.  
So I think that's a game you actually can't forget. Great game for women's
basketball and we're all excited how we played and how we fought back.  
TAYA REIMER: I mean, yeah, same thing as what Jewell said. We were still
talking about everything just on the way over here and there were a lot of
emotions in that game and it was a great game. It was a battle, and I think at
this point now we're trying to come down from that and focus on what we need
to do now.  
LINDSAY ALLEN: Like Taya and Jewell just said, a lot of emotions and a lot of
highs and a lot of lows in that game. Just very proud of how this team
responded and how we stayed tough throughout the game.  
  
Q. Coach, Breanna Stewart is a great challenge. How do you plan on defending
her?  
COACH MCGRAW: Well, she is a difficult matchup because of her size and her
ability to play on the perimeter and on the inside. So we've got a couple of
ideas that we're going to try.  
I don't think anybody's been very successful with her this year. She didn't
have a great game against us last time, but I would say that was more her than
our defense.  
  
Q. Probably not by you guys, because she had such a good game against you
guys last time, but Morgan Tuck had another big game last night. Is she
somehow ‑‑ which would seem kind of impossible for you, but is she somehow
overlooked on that team?  
COACH MCGRAW: I was asked that the other day in the conference. It's
disappointing that the media decides ahead of the season who the best players
are going to be. Because I think she's their second best player. I thought the
game that we had with them she was the best player on their team. She really
did so many great things. She's incredibly overlooked on that team.  
  
Q. For any of the players who haven't played UConn, how much do you enjoy
playing them or do you not enjoy playing them and why?  
JEWELL LOYD: I like playing UConn. It's definitely a learning experience.
Winning and losing against them, whatever it is, you learn so much and it
really‑‑ I think it's good. Every time we've played them, it's always been a
good battle. That's what you want for women's sports.  
  
Q. Coach, what impresses you the most about Morgan Tuck of all her
abilities?  
COACH MCGRAW: You know, I think it's her versatility. Because she can go
inside and out. She's really worked on her perimeter game. She's tough to
defend around the basket. But you've got to guard her at the 3‑point line.  
But they have so many weapons you want to try to find somebody that you don't
have to guard, and she would be the wrong choice if you decided not to guard
her.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about growing this team, especially since the UConn
game and just what have you done to replace the All ‑Americans you lost and
get them back to the Final Four?  
COACH MCGRAW: I think we've had two big areas of growth. The first would be in
our leadership. I think that Jewell has really done a great job of taking over
a lot of the leadership. And I think Lindsay Allen has really grown as a point
guard who is much more vocal this year than she was in the past. She's really
done a good job of talking to the team. And I think Jewell has taken the time,
when we needed somebody to kind of rally us, she's gotten them all together.  
And I think the second area is Taya and her leadership with the post. She's
become a mentor to the post. She's only a sophomore and we're expecting so
much from her. And she just continues to deliver. She's been our steadiest
player all year long, and I think it's because of her that our whole post game
has really improved.  
  
Q. Michaela, you played UConn a lot. And your impressions of the last game
that you played back in December, and also to Bri, you didn't play in that
game but you were on the bench, and tell me what you saw from that game?  
MICHAELA MABREY: Well, we're definitely able to compete with them. And I mean
able to compete with them. And tomorrow night, playing defense, definitely.  
BRIANNA TURNER: I think I remember in the beginning of the first half I
thought we played really well. I think that the second half I think we let
players get off, especially Morgan Tuck. And in that game we weren't really
focused on her, and she really made us pay for that.  
But I think our offense kind of disintegrated and we're not playing well on
offense, I don't think it translated well to our defense. So that's what I
think about the game.  
  
Q. Muffet, Brianna obviously didn't play in the first UConn game. How
different is this team with her in the lineup?  
COACH MCGRAW: She's our leading rebounder and one of our top three scorers. So
I think she makes a difference in our team at the defensive end, with her
rebounding, her presence of shot blocking and the way she can run the floor. I
think that she adds a lot to our team.  
I think that we are a much better team with her on the floor.  
  
Q. Jewell, can you talk about embracing the challenge of leadership, what
were the important lessons you had to learn and how do you think you've grown
and developed into that role since the Connecticut game?  
JEWELL LOYD: It makes it easy when you have great teammates and great coaches
and everyone kind of believes in you. I've been learning from them as well.
We've been learning from each other and it's easy when you have unselfish
players that want to learn and are able to just help you out when you need it.  
So I give credit to my teammates and coaches for that.  
  
Q. Lindsay, this is an intense rivalry, maybe the most intense in the
women's game. When you're on the court, how much talking is there between the
two teams?  
LINDSAY ALLEN: There isn't much talking. We both have tremendous respect for
each of our programs. And they don't talk much and we don't talk much and we
just go out there, let the game speak for itself.  
  
Q. Muffet, does it feel good that a player like Madison Cable, who has
contributed a lot over these four years without getting big numbers, a lot of
recognition, now is part of Notre Dame legend forever?  
COACH MCGRAW: I thought the greatest thing about the game last night was that
the two people that really were stars for us down the stretch were Madison and
Hannah, and two that have come off the bench all year and given us a great
lift, brought a lot of energy, did so many great things.  
So I think for them to have that feel‑good moment, I don't think any of us up
here could be happier for them.  
  
Q. Jewell, you and Brianna are generally considered right now the two best
players in the game. Do you feel any individual rivalry with her, even though
your games are different and your positions are different?  
JEWELL LOYD: Not at all. Like you said, our positions are different. I have a
lot of respect for her. We're friends off the court. It's not about a
one‑on‑one matchup. It's about team basketball. It's Notre Dame versus UConn.  
  
Q. Taya, can you talk about having to be a mentor and a leader of a
sophomore for two freshmen posts and what has helped you develop yourself and
them to become a Final Four team?  
TAYA REIMER: I think I was lucky to have two amazing senior leaders last year
like Ace and Ariel, and I learned so much from them. And I think being in the
experience that I was in last season, playing in the Final Four and having to
contribute as a freshman, I think that I learned a lot from that.  
And I was kind of forced to grow up, and I think that I really tried to
embrace that role. Even though I'm still really young, just being able to use
those experiences and help them out, Bri and Kathryn, it's just something that
I've had to do for the betterment of the team. And I'm just happy that I can
help them out any way that I can.  
  
Q. Jewell, how much has last year's loss in this spot to UConn provided
motivation for this team and is there a sense of unfinished business going
into tomorrow night's game?  
JEWELL LOYD: Anytime you lose in a game you're always motivated to win and try
to figure out what steps you need to take to finish the goal. But that's last
year. It's a whole different season, different team. We're just really lucky
and blessed to have the opportunity that we have to fight for another National
Championship.  
  
Q. Brianna and Lindsay, can you explain the emotions of walking off the
court after fouling out and watching what transpired the last couple minutes
of the game when you can't do anything about it?  
LINDSAY ALLEN: There's just a range of emotions, a lot of highs, lot of lows,
and I think we were both pretty disappointed when we fouled out. The call
could have gone either way. We were just really disappointed, but our
teammates kept telling us they believed in us, they were fine, they were going
to close the deal for us.  
We have really unselfish and passionate teammates and eases the nervousness
that much more. We're fortunate to be in the position we are in.  
BRIANNA TURNER: I agree with what L.A. said. Our teammates just fought out
there, like we'll get you to the Tuesday game. They were so encouraging. On
the bench I was cheering so loud for Madi and Huff. It was good.  
  
Q. You've played them so many times. When you're scouting and evaluating
them, is it different than another opponent because you have so much
familiarity with them? And if it is different, specifically how is it
different?  
COACH MCGRAW: I think it's a little different just in that we don't have to
worry about learning the numbers and the names. We know them so well and I
think our offenses are pretty similar so we run a lot of the same stuff. So it
does make it easier to understand the scouting report.  
At the same time it doesn't make the game easier, but the familiarity, I
think, helps us in a lot of ways. I don't think we have the intimidation a lot
of teams face when they play UConn.  
  
Q. Lindsay, after the weekend you had last week in Oklahoma City, how did
you get through the frustration? Looked like everything was ‑‑ just nothing
flowed last night. How hard was it to just try to get in the flow of the
game?  
LINDSAY ALLEN: I think it was really tough. I think South Carolina did a great
job of making us uncomfortable and not letting us get into our offense and get
into the flow of the game.  
But I just put trust in my teammates. They kept believing in me no matter what
happened. When I fouled out, they just told me everything is going to be fine
and we're going to get the win.  
And I'm blessed and fortunate to be able to make it to the National
Championship.  
  
Q. Brianna, I know it was an early season game against UConn, but how
difficult was it for you to miss that game and how excited are you to play
against them tomorrow night?  
BRIANNA TURNER: It was definitely difficult to miss that game, and along with
the other two games missing my team. I'm excited to be out there tomorrow
night and be out there with my teammates as well.  
  
Q. Jewell, the runs in last night's game with your game, UConn has their
runs. How do you avoid that when UConn might be up against team 10 where it
tilts to 20 or goes back the other way, how do you prevent those runs?  
JEWELL LOYD: Basketball is a game of runs. Comes down to who wants it more.
The 50/50 balls, rebounding, I'm playing with passion, and that's what you're
going to see tomorrow night.  
  
Q. Coach, can you elaborate a little bit how you grow leaders? Is it within
them, you wait and see it emerge, or do you do things to speed up the
process?  
COACH MCGRAW: I think it's a little bit of both. I definitely think there's
leadership traits that some players have that others don't have as much. I
think the willingness to put yourself out there, to be vocal, to say what
needs to be said, not just to go with the popular opinion. Sometimes people
really need to hear an honest answer.  
And we do a lot of things. We have a great leadership workshop at Notre Dame,
Rosenthal Leadership Academy, that our players go through separate from
basketball that a lot of our student‑athletes do and we do a lot of things
just to encourage the way they talk to each other and we listen really hard
how they talk to each other and kind of give them some different scenarios of
how that could have gone.  
  
Q. Jewell, you weren't aware of it at the time during the game, I'm sure,
Tom Cruise was in the house, the star of Mission Impossible. Do you think it
was kind of appropriate the way the game ended last night?  
JEWELL LOYD: Yeah, we didn't find out until after the game that he was there.
Obviously having someone of that caliber at your game is pretty cool. That was
a great ending to a really great game. So it was awesome.  
  
Q. Muffet, throughout the season you're essentially the favorite in every
game. This is one game where you'll be considered the underdog and a lot of
people will pick your opposing team. What is it like to basically be a
favorite, to be the team that everybody goes for, you're the biggest game for
everybody all year, but in this game your team does sort of a reversal here?  
COACH MCGRAW: I love being the underdog. Always have. I think it's a great
position to be in. The pressure is not on us; it's on UConn. We can go out,
relax, play our game. Nobody expects us to win, nobody's picked us to win.  
So we can really have a very loose attitude going into the game in terms of
being relaxed.  
  
Q. (Off microphone)?  
STUDENT-ATHLETE: We like to have fun. I think we play our best game when we're
loose and we're smiling and just having fun. That's how you play when you're
at the parks with your friends, you're smiling, enjoying the game, enjoying
the moment.  
We're definitely just excited to be here.  
  
Q. Early this morning, Geno described himself as being nauseous playing
against you guys Tuesday night because you're so hard to play against. How
would you describe the way you feel?  
COACH MCGRAW: I agree. We have so many similarities. We've played each other
so much. And I think it's become such a great rivalry that it's a game that I
really enjoy because it's the two best teams right now going at it and
battling and they're a very difficult team to match up with.  
They do present a lot of problems for us defensively. And you have to be able
to withstand their runs and try to make some of your own. But overall I think
it's a great game for women's basketball.  
  
Q. Not to take away anything from defense because I think both these teams
are very strong defensively, but is this game, being the championship game
again and the fact that both of you guys have been in this position so much,
really a sign of how great your offenses are in terms of execution, and is
that something you feel like other teams really need to look to aspire to?  
COACH MCGRAW: Yes, I agree with that. I think offensively we both generally
are 1 and 2 in the country in field goal percentage. I think shot selection is
a big factor with both of our teams.  
The shots that we get are the shots that we get all year long that the same
people are taking the same shots I think in every game. So I do, I think for
us this team is a lot about offense. Because I don't know that you can stop
them.  
I think they're going to score. And so the question is can you keep up with
them by scoring as much.  
  
Q. You won the National Championship a while back. This will be four times
in the title game in five years. You haven't won it again. Is it frustrating?
Is there some feeling, well, I have won this or does it drive you crazy that
I've been one game away three previous times and we weren't able to get over
the hump?  
COACH MCGRAW: You know, I think getting here is a great achievement for any
program. I think that there's probably 350 schools in the country that would
love to trade places with us.  
So I think being here has been just a great achievement for all of us. I think
probably because we did win one that maybe I don't feel that sort of pressure.
But I want this for this team. I want to win for this team so they can have
that feeling of looking up in the rafters and seeing another banner.  
  
Q. You said how this group has relished the underdog and a loose team right
now. How different is that from last year when it seems there was so much
different mentality going into this game, the pressure of two undefeated and
such, whereas now you're the underdog and just the difference last year and
this year?  
COACH MCGRAW: Last year was a business‑like approach. We had a really good
team coming in undefeated, which was an amazing, amazing feat for us to
accomplish.  
We lost Natalie Achonwa so it immediately put us back in the underdog role. I
think we came into the game with an underdog mentality. But I think that team
was different because we were so experienced. We had so many players that
could score. Kayla McBride has had so much success against Connecticut in the
past.  
I think it's a lot different in that way just because our experience last year
and this year. We're still a little giddy.  
  
Q. Have you gone through the last eight minutes of last night's game yet and
figured out what went wrong at that time and how to fix that?  
COACH MCGRAW: You know, honestly I thought we got really good shots. We missed
a couple of point‑blank layups. We missed a couple of shots we normally make
and we didn't rebound. I think it was a little bit of both ends.  
When we were making our runs, we were holding them to one shot, scoring in
transition. Then when we were missing shots and not getting rebounds, I think
that was the difference in the game. So I still felt pretty good because
execution‑wise I thought we were still getting the shots we wanted. Our
problem at that point I thought was at the defensive end.  
  
Q. You talked about not having the same intimidation factor. Is there any of
that with Stewart also that she's not just a two ‑time National Player of the
Year, that they've been on the court with her?  
COACH MCGRAW: No, because I think we've had that kind of player ourselves. I
think we feel like Jewell was a Player of the Year also, and I think she's a
great player. But I don't think that we have any intimidation factor going
against us.  
  
Q. Connecticut's in a position to win a tenth title. Is there some common
denominator among these UConn teams that they're able to put themselves in
this position? Are there two or three things they do consistently that allow
them to be in this spot?  
COACH MCGRAW: I think they have a great coach, and I think they have a lot of
the best players in the country. So I would say there were two really good
reasons for that.  
  
Q. You played UConn so much. You've gone up against Geno so much. I'm sure
this thing has evolved. You've been on top. He's been on top, all kinds of
things happened. What are the myths and the realities of your relationship
with him and all the times you guys have gone up against each other?  
COACH MCGRAW: You know, we have a really good relationship. I think we see
each other out recruiting. We talk on the road. I think he's the kind of guy
that if you‑‑ if I wanted to talk offense and I called him, I think we would
sit down and talk about offense, recruiting or really anything that we wanted
to.  
I think that both being from Philly, we just share some sort of a bond. Jim
Foster is kind of best friends with both of us, and so we've got a lot of
common threads running through our relationship. But I think a lot of respect
on both sides.  
  
Q. The offense that you run, how has it evolved? And who taught you?  
COACH MCGRAW: Well, it's still evolving. We run the Princeton offense which
Pete Carril started at Princeton and one of my former players, Liz Feeley, was
the women's coach there at the time. So she did a lot of the work for me.  
We went out to a lot of different people. We went up to Northwestern and Bill
Carmody was an assistant with Pete Carril, so we watched his practice and
talked to him a lot. UC Davis runs it. I sent my assistants out to different
places. Went out to Air Force and Coach Scott was out there.  
We've been to a lot of places to see people, and it constantly evolves because
we have different players. This year we're still evolving. I don't think we've
run it nearly as well as we have in the past. Natalie Achonwa was really
special in that. We put our own wrinkles in to fit our team.  
That's what I like the most about offenses, tinkering with it and changing it
up to see what fits us.  
  
Q. Did you catch yourselves last night after the game going back and saying
all the things that have occurred this season and saying to yourself I still
can't believe we've gotten this far with this young of a team?  
COACH MCGRAW: Yeah, we had some really bad practices this year. And the
coaches were kind of going: Remember that time at Mohegan Sun, it was the
absolute worst practice of the year. Not just of the year but of my 30 years.
We had some awful practices at times during the year.  
And I remember telling the team we were pressing like an NIT team. And, I
mean, we just had so much that we should have forgotten, but just drawing back
on some of those things and we had some games, too, where we didn't play well.  
But I think it's fun to look back now and say look where we've come.  
  
Q. You've been around the game for a while, and for so long it used to be
Old Dominion and Louisiana Tech, UConn and Tennessee, and now you guys and
UConn. Is it nice for a sport that's still growing that the two teams that
people really know more than anybody else are playing for a championship
tomorrow night?  
COACH MCGRAW: I think it's a rivalry people want to see. I think that it's two
well‑known teams and the games ‑‑ we've had some good games in the past, so I
think it's one that people want to tune into.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_TAMPA, FLORIDA_  
  

Notre Dame  66  
South Carolina - 65

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by head coach Dawn Staley and student‑athletes
Tiffany Davis and Alaina Coates and Aleighsa Welch. Coach, an opening
statement.  
COACH STALEY: We gave God the glory when we made it to the Final Four. We'll
give him the glory for the defeat. I feel that our team did what they had to
do, put themselves in the position to win the game. Unfortunately for us, it
came down to them making a play when they needed to make a play and we didn't.  
But really proud of our effort. Proud of the women that represent the
University of South Carolina women's basketball team.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Tiffany, on the final drive, was it air ball from the tip? What were they
showing you on defense? Looked like you never got a look on that final try.  
TIFFANY MITCHELL: I came off the ball screen. They were making it hard for me
to try and find a shot. And on one of the passes, they deflected it.  
  
Q. As much as you fought back tonight again and again, how much tougher is
this one to handle?  
ALEIGHSA WELCH: Anytime you end your season, it's a tough pill to swallow. I
credit us, I credit my teammates for still fighting and never dropping their
heads. And I think a lot of people thought we were down and out in the second
half.  
But it's always tough to swallow when you put so much effort and energy and
you don't come out with a win.  
  
Q. Tiffany, can you talk about kind of the flow of the game. They would push
out to a lead and you guys would push back. Did you feel it was an uphill
battle for a lot of the game?  
TIFFANY MITCHELL: I mean, it started out slow the first half. Second half I
think we came out with a better start. But it's always hard to kind of come
from behind especially against a team like Notre Dame.  
  
Q. Tiffany, when you have to come back like that again and again, how much
does it take out of you in a game situation?  
TIFFANY MITCHELL: We put ourselves in that position. So at that point it
doesn't really matter how much it takes out of us. We still have to do it. We
have to play. I don't think we're thinking about being tired.  
  
Q. Alaina, can you tell us a little bit about the first Final Four
experience? Did you feel like the big stage ‑‑ do you think it was nerves at
the beginning of the game was why you guys got off to a slow start?  
ALAINA COATES: Same story. I do credit nerves a little bit, but I do feel like
we were able to just suck it up and just get over all that. We're used to
playing in front of big crowds, and we knew our fans were there and we saw the
energy, and we just went with it.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the start of the game and did you think it was
nerves?  
COACH STALEY: I don't think it was nerves as much as just‑‑ as much as we
started the Sweet 16 and the Elite Eight, that's kind of what's been happening
to us‑‑ I mean, it's just bad plays, bad decisions at the beginning of the
game. And you think with the five that we do start, they've been in situations
like this last year and this year. And we put ourselves in a position to
overcome a slow start.  
So I don't know what the answer is. But I don't think it was nerves. I think
our players were really ready to play. They just made bad decisions like they
would at any point in the game.  
  
Q. Aleighsa hits the putback and you lead for the first time in the day.
Especially when you got the ball back, did you feel like you pulled another
one out? And what happened in the boxout at the end?  
COACH STALEY: We were in the game. We fought our way back. We got the lead. At
that point you don't exhale and think you have the game won. Because we've
been in some tight ones the last three times out.  
It's just they made a play. We defended pretty well. I think the shot was kind
of short that Loyd missed, and I think it was Cable that got a beat on the
ball and did the same thing that happened on the other end.  
  
Q. You talked a little bit about the play in the front court. They had a
couple of ‑‑ Notre Dame had ‑‑ their front court players had a pretty good
game against you guys, and there might have been a lot of folks who thought
you would have had an advantage there.   
COACH STALEY: I mean, you know, I think they're not bad players. They're very
good players. I thought what we were able to do over the course of 40 minutes,
I thought we equalized what they were able to do early in the basketball game.  
It's going to take for us a rotating post play in the depth that the post play
kind of beat teams in the 40‑minute period. So they got off to a really good
start. When the game settled down, I thought we made them miss a couple of
easy shots at the end of the game to get ourselves back in the game. And that
is our death over a 40‑minute period taking its toll with their post plays.  
  
Q. Can you set up that last play for us, what were you expecting to see from
Notre Dame and what was the play designed?  
COACH STALEY: It was just horn's action, a play that was pretty effective for
us all game. What we wanted Mitchell to do was to kind of turn a corner, see
if she can get an angle to get inside, maybe get to the basket. But they were
hedging out and they made it difficult for her to have an angle to get to the
basket.  
They did a really good job of shading her and forcing her outside of the
paint.  
  
Q. How much are the missed free throws going to haunt you?  
COACH STALEY: That's key. We left a lot of points at the free‑throw line. But,
you know, still we overcame that to put ourselves in a position to take the
lead, had another possession after that.  
I thought if we could get that possession to fall, it gave us a little bit of
cushion. But we couldn't.  
  
Q. You have a lot of talent coming back, but how hard will it be to say
goodbye to Ibiam and Welch, especially Welch who's been here for the beginning
of this?  
COACH STALEY: It's truly hard. They leave a big void in our program. They won
a lot. But what's great about the senior class that's leaving us is they're
leaving us with a legacy of leadership.  
They didn't come in as the best leaders in the world, but they leave as
probably one of the best leaders, one of the best class of leaders that we've
had come through our program.  
So I think our players have taken note to how they led our basketball team.
And if they're half the leaders that Elem and Olivia and Aleighsa were to our
basketball team, our program is in a great place.  
  
Q. I know it's a team moment, but can you give us a sense of what you said
to your team after the game already?  
COACH STALEY: I told our team that we came up short. Obviously we wanted to
win the National Championship. But I just hope they take note of how hard it
is to get to this point and how hard it is to win a semifinals game and also
how much it took.  
And we're not far off. We're not far off. We just have to‑‑ we just have to
continue and get the experience of playing in the Final Four. So our
experience is going to have different outcomes.  
  
Q. You've been in their shoes. How long does it take for the sting to turn
into those warm memories of what they were able to achieve this season?  
COACH STALEY: It takes a while until you get back, till you get back to a
place where you can at least compete for it and taste it a little bit.  
But I'm glad our players got a chance to experience this so they can get in
the gym and work hard, so they become better students of the game so if we
ever got to this point again, we're going to have different results.  
  
Q. Obviously you guys had at the beginning of the year a goal to win the
National Championship, and it was a loss tonight, obviously. But when you look
back when the journey started with training camp back in September and
October, how would you describe or how are you going to remember the journey
of this season that you guys win an SEC Tournament for the first time and
making it to the Final Four for the first time?  
COACH STALEY: We did a lot of firsts for our program. They have a very
memorable year. And I want us to enjoy the year, but I also want us to have a
certain hunger, a certain bad taste in our mouth from experiencing and being
so close to competing for a National Championship that it will fuel us to be
better individually, to be better collectively so we can get back to this
point.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_TAMPA, FLORIDA_  
  


Notre Dame  66  
South Carolina - 65

  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us is Notre Dame head coach Muffet McGraw and
student‑athletes Madison Cable, Jewell Loyd and Taya Reimer.  
  
Q. Madison, take us through that basket.  
MADISON CABLE: Jewell shot it, which usually it goes in almost all the time. I
was just crashing anyway to try to get a rebound. And it bounced right where I
was, and I turned around and had an open shot so I took it. Luckily it went
in.  
  
Q. Tay, can you talk about the front court play you had tonight? A lot of
people thought South Carolina is a big team, they might have an advantage
there, and you guys especially early in the game really took it to them?  
TAYA REIMER: We knew that they were a really good team inside; that they get a
lot through their interior play. Our game plan was to try to contain that and
try to shut them down and on the offensive side just attack them.  
So I think that we did a pretty good job of that especially in the first half.
And then, I mean, at the end of the game it just came down to trying to
contain them and get a rebound.  
  
Q. Madison, your transition offense was solid tonight. What helped you play
so well in the front court and pushing the ball?  
MADISON CABLE: It's something that we try to do every game and we work on in
practice and stuff. So our guards did a good job looking up and finding the
streaking post or whoever it was down the court.  
  
Q. You guys went a long time without a basket at the end of the game there.
Can you talk about what it was like out there? Did you feel you were starting
to tighten up a little bit?  
TIFFANY MITCHELL: I think so. But it happens. We knew it's all about defense
and getting stops and battling. We looked at each other, and we were like:
Let's go. We need a stop. We knew that shots aren't always going to fall,
we're not going to get calls, whatever it was. But defense, that's something
that we can to control.  
  
Q. Jewell and Taya, can you talk about the very last play, their play, and
what you saw and the defense you played on that particular play?  
JEWELL LOYD: We knew they would have the ball in Tiffany's hands and they
would have a screen up top and whichever way they got off, we would double
her. She went back and forth a couple times, and then she came over to my side
and Hannah and I trapped her.  
Hannah, a great block and kept the ball in play, which allowed more time to
come off the clock and everybody was able to contest. And great team defense
all around.  
TAYA REIMER: The guards did a great job containing Mitchell up top not letting
her get a good shot off, and me and Kathryn were trying to stay back and
trying to get it if she tried to pass into the post, or if she shot it just
get a rebound.  
  
Q. For any of the players, can you give us a sense of just how difficult it
is for what Hannah Huffman did to come in 14 minutes cold and defend on maybe
the biggest play of the season? Just those of us ‑‑ obviously you guys may not
have been in that situation, but you certainly can relate to what you have to
do mentally to sort of perform there?  
JEWELL LOYD: When you have a player like Hannah Huffman who is so passionate
and motivated, she was ready. She was like: Okay, I got it. And we had belief
in her. We knew she was going to help us. Whatever she needed to do, whether
get a steal or deflection, that's what she was going to do. Hannah, that's
what she does for us.  
  
Q. Madison, this was like your only two points. Ever hit a bigger basket in
your life?  
MADISON CABLE: Somebody already asked me that. Thinking about it, I don't
think so. So I guess it's a good time to get my two points for the game.  
  
Q. You've been on the doorstep before here for the chance to win the title.
Does a night like that make you think we're going to close the deal this
time?  
MADISON CABLE: You have to stay motivated. We're going to win, we're going to
have fun, but we're motivated.  
And we're enjoying this and we enjoy this night and live it up for sure and
get refocused tomorrow.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Will you talk about your front court play with Turner and Reimer
tonight?  
COACH MCGRAW: I thought Bri and Taya really played well, especially in the
first half. They were eight for 11 we talked about at halftime, we needed to
get them the ball more. I thought we had more opportunities to do that and
weren't quite as successful.  
We came out with a plan to go inside. Then Jewell got hot, and we kind of
changed the plan a little bit and went to Jewell a little bit more.  
They battled. They battled. We didn't get as many rebounds as we wanted to,
but I thought they played hard.  
  
Q. Muffet, can you take us through the last possession defensively, what
your thinking was and philosophy was for that?  
COACH MCGRAW: Well, we had the timeout, so we were able to talk about what was
going to happen. We thought that Mitchell would get the ball and there would
probably be a ball screen involved.  
We talked about how important it was going to be. Because we were still in the
triangle and 2 at that point. We talked about how important it was going to be
for the person to come out and hedge on the ball screen. And I thought that
was probably as good a hedge as we've had. But when I looked down the bench,
Michaela Mabrey, not as well known for her defense.  
So we wanted to get a better defender in, and Hannah Huffman is somebody that
played earlier in the game, guarded Mitchell, did a great job on her, and so
we wanted to give her that opportunity.  
  
Q. Walk us through the final play going without a timeout and your final
offensive possession.  
COACH MCGRAW: What we work on we're going to rebound and go. And if we have
something we'll obviously take it. If we don't have something we'll take the
timeout there. I thought Jewell had kind of a clear path. We set the high ball
screen for her and it was a great shot. And Maddie came out of nowhere to get
the rebound.  
  
Q. You know they're going to get their points inside, they're going to try
to get their points inside, but they only had a couple 3 ‑pointers and a
couple of mid‑range jumpers, can you just say how much your defensive game
plan factored into that?  
COACH MCGRAW: I'm not sure if you can say they have a weakness, but we thought
that pick your poison, we were going to let them take jumpers. Sessions hit
the 3 in the first half but we weren't going to deviate from the game plan.  
We were giving up pretty much everybody except for Mitchell and Roy, when she
came in the game. So we tried to pack it in on the post, which they still did
a really great job of scoring against us.  
But we went triangle and 2, and on box and 1 we went 1‑2‑2\. Played a couple
of possessions of man to man, played a little 2‑3, throwing everything but the
kitchen sink at them trying to figure out a way to stop them.  
  
Q. You haven't had much from your bench this season, or even tonight. But to
have the game winning shot and a key play on defense come from subs in the
last minute, just want to ask about the confidence you had in those two in
those moments?  
COACH MCGRAW: Our bench has been terrific all year long. I thought Madison
Cable was the best 6 man in the league. She didn't win the award. But she was
so key in so many games for us. Plays a lot minutes for us.  
Kathryn Westbeld comes in and gives us great minutes in the post. And Hannah
Huffman, starting with the ACC season, has really come along and done a lot of
great things for us defensively.  
Her job is not to score but to bring energy, rebounds, set screens and take
charges and play defense. So I have a lot of confidence in all of those
players. And Hannah I think, the biggest play of the game, to put her in, I
think I told her I trust you and I have confidence in you.  
  
Q. On day one of practice it's always the goal, but did you see this group
with the changeover get into a national final?  
COACH MCGRAW: I did not. I remember thinking that and telling the team we lost
40percent of our offense, 40percent of our rebounds and 40percent of our
assists. We really were a very different team, very young team. We did not
have‑‑ we didn't know who the leader was going to be.  
We really struggled early on with communication, with a lot of little things.
And I thought the staff tried to keep it simple. We tried not to overwhelm
them with things but freshmen are going to be overwhelmed anyways.  
So I would say for us to be at this point now is really I think we
overachieved to get here.  
  
Q. She obviously fouled out with a couple of minutes to go. But when Brianna
Turner was on the court at times she was the best player on the court. How
much of a glimpse did people who watched her tonight get in terms of what she
can become over the next couple of years?  
COACH MCGRAW: Yeah, she has amazing talent. She just wants to learn. She's a
hard worker at practice. She can run the floor. That's one of her greatest.
She can block shots and rebound, and she can finish around the basket.  
I thought for her first Final Four, played extremely well defensively and
offensively. And I know if you asked her she'd probably say she didn't play
very well, but I'm so happy with her potential and where she's going to be.  
  
Q. You talked about their depth and how much that might cause trouble for
you. When Wilson came off the bench and Cables came off the bench and they
started coming back, were you worried that you might not have enough in the
tank in the second half when they came off the bench again in the second
half?  
COACH MCGRAW: Their bench is really good. Probably they could start any of the
eight people that they play a lot. And that was our big worry. We wanted to
start out the game with kind of packing it in and seeing how that looked
first.  
And then when they came in with Wilson, we tried to stay on her left hand. We
weren't overly successful with it. I thought we probably would have changed
the game plan looking back on it, maybe deny a little bit more. But she's a
tremendous talent.  
  
Q. The cameras are on you at the end of the game, I don't know, you did a
little bit of a dance. Your face appeared like maybe you were even surprised
at how the last 14seconds or maybe even the last minute played out. Can you
just take us through what you were thinking during that last possession?  
COACH MCGRAW: I was surprised how the last minute 13 played out. When Lindsay
fouled out, I thought we might be in a little bit of trouble.  
We told Jewell, you'll have to run the point and you'll have to take over the
ball, we're going to have to do it on defense. We're going to have to rebound.
When they took the lead, I wasn't sure how things were going to end up for us
because you never know if we're going to be able to have that resilience that
we needed at that point without our point guard.  
So I was just amazed. I think Maddie makes a great play and then we get a
great defensive stop. So yeah, I was pretty happy after that one.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S FINAL

### [Brenda Frese](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15652)

### [Brene Moseley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28406)

  
_TAMPA, FLORIDA_  
  

UConn - 81  
Maryland - 58

  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us on the dais is Maryland head coach Brenda Frese,
student‑athletes Lexie Brown, Brene Moseley, and Laurin Mincy.  
COACH FRESE: I'm proud of our fight, and like I told the team in the locker
room, when you look at a season and go 34‑3 and you look at two of our three
losses are coming from teams that are playing for the National Championship
game, that's a heck of a season.  
And obviously the score doesn't indicate in terms of the fight, and we've got
to be able to do a better job of closing the gap, but I thought we did a
tremendous job in the first half trying to put some things together,
especially in the adversity of the calls made. We just kept fighting and we
kept battling.  
And I thought the runs in the second half obviously hurt us and were really
tough.  
But couldn't be more proud obviously of Laurin Mincy and the legacy she's
left, for her to give everything to this young team, and I know this
experience and continuing to play UConn and playing Notre Dame will continue
to make us better.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Lexie, in the past, when other teams have gotten runs on you, you've been
able to come back. What was the difference today not being able to respond in
the second half?  
LEXIE BROWN: I'm not really sure. I just think we continued to get deflated as
they went on their runs. And the thing about UConn, it's not one person
contributing to that run. Seeings how our team, we would try to key in on one
person and then somebody else would score and we'd try to key on that person
and the next person would score. They do a great job of sharing the ball.  
  
Q. Laurin, what are your emotions right now, and how difficult going out the
way you did this game?  
LAURIN MINCY: It's really disappointing. Obviously we wanted to come in here
and shock the world and get this win. But I'm proud of how my team competed
this game and all season and I can't wait to see what's ahead for them.  
  
Q. Lexie, Coach was talking about Laurin's legacy. To you, what does that
mean?  
LEXIE BROWN: I just see her as a player who is extremely resilient and a great
leader. She had a lot of adversity during her career here. A lot of people
could have rolled over and said: You know what? My knees, I'm not going to be
the player I used to be.  
But Mincy, she worked extremely hard to get back this season, to see her back
to who she was before her knee injuries and see how hard she worked and pushed
us every day. I think that's the legacy she's going to leave with us.  
  
Q. Looking back on your career, what are you going to be most proud of?  
LAURIN MINCY: Just the family I made here. These are my little sisters. And
whenever they need anything, they can call me. So it's a family atmosphere,
all the support from the coaches I've had over the years.  
  
Q. Brene, late in the second half you guys started driving the lane and
drawing some fouls. But in the early part of the game you seemed a little
hesitant to attack Connecticut that way. What was going on that was different
late in the game or was it just your mindset?  
BRENE MOSELEY: I think our mindset changed. I think we just wanted to be able
to attack in whatever they were giving us. They were playing pretty well. We
wanted to be able to get inside. We were doing pretty well, so we wanted to go
inside. That's basically where our mindset was on that.  
  
Q. Brene, you played with Laurin longer than anyone. What has she meant to
you and what has she meant to the program?  
BRENE MOSELEY: I'm speechless when I talk about Laurin. Everything she's
contributed along the years. When she first started, I was right beside her.
And we created a bond then. So tonight was tough just because it's the last
game with her, so it hurts my heart. But I know she's going to go on to bigger
and better things and we're going to continue keep doing what we're doing here
at Maryland.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Frese.  
  
Q. Brenda, at what point did you know that it didn't look good for you
tonight? And what led you to think that?  
COACH FRESE: Maybe after the first two foul calls on Brionna Jones. No, I
mean, seriously, I thought it was the second half. They came out, and their
aggressiveness defensively, they were really physical. Obviously they really
clamped us down from the field and we were having a difficult time being able
to score.  
  
Q. Nice season for you guys. I'd like to talk a little bit about how tough
it was because you shut one person down, someone else steps up. Morgan Tucker,
obviously a good player, but you were doing a good job on KML, and she steps
up. How tough were they to play against defensively? Because they have so many
weapons you can't just shut one down.  
COACH FRESE: Obviously Tuck was a big‑time X factor for them tonight. You look
at the stat line of Kaleena and she hits 13 but she gets seven assists and
goes into facilitator and they get everybody else going.  
So, it is‑‑ obviously you've got to be able to have five that can match them
on both ends of the floor, both defensively as well as offensively.  
  
Q. I just wanted to get back to Morgan. It's tough enough to prepare for
UConn. Did Morgan give them something that you might not have expected, how do
you prepare for her?  
COACH FRESE: I mean, I was just thinking she was one of their 3s that wasn't
an All‑American, right, had an All‑American night.  
It is. Obviously we planned, obviously, in terms of their ability to be able
to score. But she's such a difficult matchup. She took us inside. She took us
out. She was able to score. She recognized when Brea was in foul trouble. She
drove her. Showed a really high IQ.  
  
Q. You had said yesterday that you thought it would be really good for the
game for you guys to beat them. I guess I'm wondering why that is and whether
you think it's bad for the game if this is the same title and game from last
year?  
COACH FRESE: Obviously to be able to grow our game we have to start having
parity. And I honestly‑‑ you look at the men's side and you can't predict from
year in, year out.  
And I think that brings a level of excitement. Brings a level of enthusiasm.
We're getting there. When I look at players out there that are kind of
starting to go to a lot of programs, just like our kids, A'ja Wilson going to
South Carolina, starting to have that type of depth in our talent pool.  
When you look at our game in the NCAA Tournament and you look at Dayton
getting as far as they did, you're starting to see some parity that our game
desperately needs.  
  
Q. When you reflect on Laurin's career, what has she meant to you and what
has she meant to the program?  
COACH FRESE: Gosh, I couldn't be more proud of Laurin. When you talk about to
watch her this season grow into what she became for us, a leader by example, a
leader vocally, but you look at the fact that she's a fighter. I mean, I
thought all the adversity that she went through in her five years, to be able
to lead this team to new heights, to a season that nobody expected is
something that I'm going to cherish forever in terms of her legacy.  
  
Q. Was it difficult to see her finish her career that way today? And she
didn't play a lot in the second half. Was it a difficult decision for you not
to play her much in the second half?  
COACH FRESE: It was a tough night. She was very anxious. I thought nerves got
the best of her. When you look at six turnovers by Laurin Mincy, that's not a
stat line that you see this season.  
So it was, it was tough. I mean, because I could feel where she was in the
game and it was hurting the team but she's carried the team throughout this
entire season.  
So a tough night for her but at the same time the growth for our team is we
have to be able to carry on without her now as she graduates.  
  
Q. Two straight Final Fours but having not quite reached the National
Championship, what do you need to take the next step and get back there?  
COACH FRESE: The next progression, it's where obviously Notre Dame has gotten
themselves to and it's the next step for us. Obviously the consistency factor
for us was key in terms of being able to get back‑to‑back, but there's that
one more percent in terms of where we need to go.  
But I'm excited when you talk about our future and graduating one senior, to
be able to have the sophomore class come back, I'm really, really excited
about this future.  
  
Q. Maryland had one of the best seasons in school history. Yet UConn wins
pretty handily. Does Notre Dame stand a chance in the championship game, and
if so what do they have to do in order to win?  
COACH FRESE: I'm trying to remember that first game with Notre Dame, if Turner
played. So obviously I think that's a different element.  
But I think when you talk about the National Championship game, both teams are
going to be ready to compete and two phenomenal coaches that are going to be
ready to play. I think it will be a really competitive game.  
  
Q. It's one thing, when you're looking at parity, you're 1 seed for a
reason. But UConn consistently beats the best teams in the country by
substantial margins. What is it about them that makes them that just more
better players than everybody gets or what?  
COACH FRESE: It's a blend of everything. Obviously Geno is the best of the
best. He's a phenomenal coach. I think as you talk about our talent pool, you
know, I liken it to Kentucky men except for the fact that UConn's able to get
every year a top 10 player, they don't lose them to the pros.  
When you're able to build that kind of roster and add the coaching and with
what you're doing, to insert that into your lineup every year, it's huge, when
you're able to build a roster like that.  
So our game is coming. There isn't that depth of the talent pool yet to be
able to kind of spread that amongst the different programs. But it's
definitely coming.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_TAMPA, FLORIDA_  
  

UConn - 81  
Maryland - 58

  
THE MODERATOR: On the dais from Connecticut is head coach Geno Auriemma and
student‑athletes Morgan Tuck and Breanna Stewart. We'll open with a statement
from Coach Auriemma and then questions for the student‑athletes.  
COACH AURIEMMA: I mean, obviously we played really well for long stretches at
a time, and we went into the game knowing that Maryland was going to be a
difficult matchup for our guards; that their guards were going to be a big
part of what they were trying to do.  
And I felt for the most part we handled it pretty well. We've got the kind of
team when we go on runs and things start breaking our way, we take advantage
of those situations, and we did so again tonight.  
And we felt going into the game we had a little bit of an advantage with these
two, with Morgan and Stewy, and we tried to really take advantage of that. And
obviously they were great. I can't say enough about them. Tuck, anyway, she
played both ends of the floor.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Morgan, nice game tonight. On a night where they did a pretty good job
bottling up Kaleena, can you talk about how well you played, 24 and 9, 10 for
16 from the floor. Out there taking over.  
MORGAN TUCK: I think it was a credit to my teammates. They gave me the ball
where I'm best at. That's around the basket or driving to the basket. So I
think I played well because my teammates played well as well.  
  
Q. Morgan, you weren't able to play here last year because of the injury,
obviously. What did it mean to you tonight to play in this setting and to do
so well?  
MORGAN TUCK: It means a lot, just to be out there and actually contributing
and making an impact. That's why I came here. And to be really doing it, it's
a great feeling.  
  
Q. This is also for Morgan. You made two 3s early in the first half and you
basically were about 26, 28percent on the season. Do you think that
contributed to opening up some lanes for you going to the basket?  
MORGAN TUCK: Yeah, I think so. I know I have to hit some outside shots unless
they guard me and they can't double Stewy and Kaleena. So when I'm open, just
try to knock it down to make it easier on them.  
  
Q. Breanna, the game against Notre Dame was a long time ago in December.
What do you remember about that game? What stood out for you most about that
win, the December win?  
BREANNA STEWART: I think what I most remember is got to a point where we were
down 10 in the game. And it still felt like we were in control and we were
able to come back and Morgan played great in that game. So did Kiah Stokes.
She had a lot of rebounds. I'm not sure how many.  
But we really were the aggressors, and we came in there and we wanted that
game more.  
  
Q. What's it mean for you guys to have gone through this road to get to this
point and now be one win away from winning another National Championship?  
BREANNA STEWART: It means a lot. This is exactly where we want to be right
now. We want to be playing Tuesday night. That's the last game of the season,
and we gotta make sure that there's still work to do. We have practice
tomorrow. We've got to focus on those, because we don't want to just play in
the National Championship game, we want to win the game.  
  
Q. Breanna, talk about Morgan tonight and how much it means seeing her excel
after what happened last year.  
BREANNA STEWART: To see how Morgan played tonight, it's just a great feeling,
especially as you said she sat out all last season because of her injuries and
that kind of thing. And she kind of slid under the radar, even though we all
knew what she could do. And she just really came out tonight to show everyone
that she's one of the best players in the country. And I'm glad she's on our
team.  
  
Q. Morgan, how important was it for you guys to come out in the first couple
minutes in the second half and hit them with that quick run to extend your
lead?  
MORGAN TUCK: I think it was pretty important just to get a run going. And I
think it's always important to start the half coming out of the timeout with a
basket. It helps get our momentum going.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. You've raved about Morgan all year long. You have three All ‑Americans. I
don't know how many you can get, but certainly give us one more example of why
she should be the fourth All‑American.   
COACH AURIEMMA: I understand, obviously, there's a lot of really good players
in the country, and I understand that you can only‑‑ you can only reward our
team so much for what we did. And the three that they've picked to be
All‑American, I thought deserved it.  
I thought all three of them had tremendous years. And I think because we have
Stewy, Morgan gets overlooked a little bit. And we talked about it after the
awards came out. And she was okay with it. She was okay with it.  
On our team, if people had an opportunity to come to watch our practices, they
would think that there's a lot of practices during the course of the season
where if you came in there you would think Tuck was the national Player of the
Year. That's how good she is every day in practice. And not having played all
of last year, obviously she wasn't in the conversation at the beginning of the
season of who the top players in the country are.  
But a lot of kids have made First Team All‑American that wish they were
playing Tuesday night. So it all works out.  
  
Q. You played Notre Dame, I mean, an inconceivable amount of times since
2009. How would you evaluate what it's like to play against them? Do you enjoy
it? Does it become too much? What do you make of the fact you've played an
opponent so much?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, they were in our league and clearly we were the two best
teams in our league. And when you're in that situation, you're setting
yourself up to play at least three times if you're the two best teams. And
then because they're so good, they end up here all those years that we were
here. And I think it's a credit and it says a lot about them and what they've
been able to do.  
They're a lot like us. And I think that's why they have had success against
us. That they have a lot of the same qualities that we have as a team and as a
program.  
So we give them problems like other teams in the country don't and they give
us problems like other teams in the country don't. I mean, Notre Dame beat us
a bunch of times there after not beating us at all for a long period of time.
Then they beat us a bunch of times. And everybody felt there was something
wrong with us and sometimes at Connecticut when you lose it's what's wrong
with you, not what's so good about the other guys.  
Then they went to another league and won every game there by 100. So everybody
found out in that league, too, how good they really are.  
So Tuesday night is not going to be any fun, believe me. I'm glad we're
playing in that game, but it's not going to be any fun. They're really hard to
play against.  
  
Q. You went to Kiah Stokes, you went big against them. Talk about how you
thought that may have changed a little bit of the way you guys were able to
play against their front line?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, we were trying to figure out what gave us the best
opportunity to guard them. And we knew we were going to have a problem man to
man. So we made a decision to go zone, and that's Kiah. So when Kiah comes in,
we can play a little bit of zone, we can change our man to man a little bit,
make it look a little different than it looks otherwise. And she gives us a
big presence in the middle.  
I mean, we're not very big. So having Kiah in there, you know, it just frees
up Stewy and Tuck to move out in the perimeter more where I thought that their
guys would have a hard time guarding because they were clogging up the lane
pretty much.  
It's almost like they made two decisions, Maryland did, we're going to guard K
pretty hard and keep everybody else in the lane and try to bottle all those
guys up.  
So I said this all along, when Kiah is good, she's really, really good. And
today she was really good.  
  
Q. In the years past, you've talked disparagingly about other coaches, you
say UConn is so dominant because they get the best players, deprecating their
own players. If it's not the players, one would think you're defaulting to
coaches, but I've never heard you speak that way about any other coach in the
country. So what exactly is it that enables you to consistently year after
year beat the best teams in the country by substantial margins?  
COACH AURIEMMA: That is true that there is that perception out there that‑‑
believe me, it's not a wrong perception that we get really good players. And
in a lot of cases we do get the best players. Stewy was the best player coming
out of high school.  
So we do get‑‑ but we don't get all of them. We just get some. And then
there's probably 10 or 12 other teams in the country that they get some. And
then when you add them all up over four years, they have seven guys that were
All‑American and so do we.  
And that's the beauty of women's basketball in one sense is that when you get
to the Final Four, it's like on the men's side this year, the four best teams
made it to the Final Four. That doesn't always happen. But in women's
basketball that happens a lot, because people stay for four years and they
work, they get better every year. And so we know what we have to do if we want
to win a National Championship. We have to beat the best teams.  
So we practice in a way that we prepare to beat the best teams. And our kids
really buy into that. They love the winning part. They love the way we do it.
I don't think we have a secret formula. I don't think we have a magic potion.  
I just think that we do certain things that I know other coaches don't do. We
do certain things that I know other programs don't do. And we reap the
benefits of it.  
I don't think I work any harder than any other coach. I don't put in more
hours than anybody else. I don't watch more film than anybody else.  
My staff, we're really good at what we do. But we're not so much better than
everybody else that nobody can beat us. I'm not comfortable with me saying
that.  
  
Q. 9 ‑0 in the title game. What do you attribute your success to in this
game?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Trying not to listen to people talk about what the record is.
Because if you play in enough of these games, you're going to lose at some
point. We've played in a lot of these. I mean, we've played in nine of them.
So that's a lot. And we won all nine of them.  
I hope we play in nine more while I'm at Connecticut and the thought we're
going to go 18‑0 in these games, if that happens, ludicrous. Ludicrous.  
So we're going in on Tuesday. It's one game. One night for the season, really.
So one game, one night, and the other nine aren't going to have any bearing on
it. That's not going to mean anything, nothing. At least not for me. I'm
nauseous already thinking about Tuesday's game.  
  
Q. You said in Albany you were impressed with what Muffet did this year.
Just talk for a second, they probably weren't predicted to be back here with
what they lost last year to graduation, just how impressive that they are back
in the title game for a second straight year.  
COACH AURIEMMA: I think that's what I said: They're a lot like us. And we lost
Stefanie and Bria, we lost two All‑Americans. And it was just assumed that
well you're going to be back there.  
They lost two All‑Americans, and they're back. Because I think at Notre Dame
and at Connecticut, we don't try to have great teams. Our goal, and I don't
think their goal is any different, Notre Dame, they're not interested in
having a great team. Their program now kind of sustains great teams year in
and year out. They're not dependent as much as some other schools maybe on
graduation, recruiting.  
There's always enough players already in those programs that when somebody
graduates they just throw somebody in that spot. No matter how good that other
person was, you just move somebody in that spot and because of the coaches
that they created there, those people are able to thrive and survive and play
great because that's what the expectation level is.  
Some other place you lose two All‑Americans to graduation, the guys coming in
go, oh, we can never be that good. So they're not. But I think in places like
hopefully Connecticut and Notre Dame the expectation is I don't care what you
look like or where you were last year, when I put you in that spot, you're
going to play like an All‑American.  
And that's a heck of a compliment for any program. And they're right now I
think obviously I'm biased, I think we're the best, but you'd be hard pressed
to find anybody better than that.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_TAMPA, FLORIDA_  
  
DAWN STALEY: We're just excited to be here, participating in our first Final
Four, and we look forward to the challenge of playing Notre Dame tomorrow
night.  
  
Q. Alaina, give us a statement on the game tomorrow night.  
ALAINA COATES: Well, just excited to be here and we're really looking forward
to playing Notre Dame. They're a great team, and we're just ready to go out
there and get to playing.  
  
Q. Alaina, can you talk about just the mindset of coming in off the bench in
terms of what that's like? Do you like to read defenses? What are you thinking
in those first few minutes before you're coming into games?  
ALAINA COATES: Just coming off the bench and everything, I'm just making sure
I'm paying attention to how we're playing people and just reading how they're
playing, especially at my position, since I do come off behind El, just seeing
how they handle her and her physicality because physical wise we're kind of
the same and just seeing how they adjust to that and just coming off the bench
I'm in that mindset of I want to be a spark, I want to be able to come out and
contribute and I just want to come out and give it good energy and make sure
that I help contribute to my team.  
  
Q. How has the Final Four either been similar or different than what you
expected, at least so far as we're here on Saturday?  
ALEIGHSA WELCH: You know, we've never been in this position, so we didn't
really know what to expect. I think the hospitality has been great, just kind
of the excitement and the vibe around it for this being our first time, you
know, it's exciting for us, so you kind of just‑‑ you've got to take it in,
but with everything that's going on, just find a way to draw that line from
the excitement of what's going on outside of basketball to focusing on
basketball because I think the one thing none of us expected was how easy it
can be to get lost kind of in everything that's going on outside of what your
main goal is here, and that's to come in and win two games. It's been an
exciting factor for the first timers, but we know we've got to focus and get
to business because we do play tomorrow night.  
  
Q. Coaches a lot of times talk about what you can learn from a loss being
greater than what you learn when you're winning a lot of games. Can you talk
about what you learned about yourselves in that loss to UConn that you've
carried over that's made you better to this point?  
ELEM IBIAM: I think we just learned in that loss just to play as a team. It
was kind of early in the season, so we've definitely grown as a team, and I
think all the teams have grown. I think we've just learned just to stay
together even when we're down or we're not playing as well as we normally
play, just to stay together, keep our heads up and really stay locked in to
what our coaches are saying.  
  
Q. Dawn, have you mapped out your plans for how you deal with Jewell Loyd?  
DAWN STALEY: I mean, we do have a game plan in. I think what you have to do
with the type of player like Jewell Loyd, you have to make her work. We can't
allow her to just get easy buckets, everything that she gets she has to work
for, and I think our players are up for the challenge of just trying to stay
in front of her. She's a very good player that can create her own shot in a
lot of different ways. So we have to be as patient and disciplined as Notre
Dame is on offense on our defense.  
  
Q. Dawn, can you talk a little bit about with the starting lineup in terms
of when you haven't really changed that very much, having Alaina still come
off the bench, having Asia come off the bench? What's been the mindset of why
that combination has worked best for you guys?  
DAWN STALEY: Well, I just felt at the beginning of the season, we did try to
change it up the first game of the season, and it was more based on just
reward. I thought we put probably the best five players on the floor for our
basketball team, and sometimes the best five players don't have the same type
of chemistry that you need to be successful, so we made a change to go back to
a lineup that was more comfortable, that had some chemistry, that they played
together all season long, a year prior to coming into this year, and we
thought it would be a great opportunity for Asia and Alaina to see the game a
little bit, and also in the back of our minds, they come in the game and we're
a totally different basketball team. So it puts a lot of pressure on our
opponents to prepare for two different teams, and if you're preparing more so
how you're going to play us, you're preparing less with the things that you
need to do to attack us.  
  
Q. Aleighsa talked about how easy it is to get lost in all the stuff here
going on outside of basketball. You have three years of Final Four experience
as a player. None of these girls have ever been here. How do you make sure
that they're ready, that they're focused on what they need to do?  
DAWN STALEY: I think there is a fine line of enjoying the moment but also
focusing on the task at hand. When we have to do mandatory media stuff, we
give it that energy. When it's time for us to go on the court and work out, we
demand that they be focused and we demand that they understand what the game
plan is, and if they don't have it out there on the court, then we've got to
do more film sessions. That's the way you have to balance it.  
There's a different element, as well, when you have the element of family
members being here, and I think most of their family members are getting in
some time today, so you'll let them enjoy a little bit of time with their
families, but there comes a point where they have to stay in character. We
need to stay in character and treat it like a road game.  
  
Q. How important is it for the future of women's basketball that this team
doesn't let Connecticut keep winning national championships?  
DAWN STALEY: I don't know how important it is. I think it's important that
teams like our program, who I think we've done it the right way, we're
patient, we're worked our tails off to get talent in our program because when
it boils down to it, you need talent to dethrone a team or a dynasty like
UConn. But I think it's a great story that we're here.  
We're not here off of luck. Our team worked to get in this position, and it
just goes to show some of those other programs, if you continue to work and
you continue to recruit and you continue to do things the right way, I think
the basketball gods will put you in this position.  
We're not here to hand Notre Dame a win. We're not here to hand Maryland or
UConn or whoever we'll face in The Finals, if we're able to get by Notre Dame,
we're here to win a national championship. That's our mindset. It's probably
everybody's mindset that's participating in the Final Four, but UConn beats
you mentally and physically if you're not prepared to play them.  
  
Q. Dawn, great players don't always make for successful coaches. Why has it
worked for you?  
DAWN STALEY: I think probably because I'm a point guard, and point guards are
a position of service. You're always serving other people, and it's easy to
make that transition. When you're a shooting guard or a post player, you see
the game a little bit differently. You see it from an aggressive, I need the
ball in my hands, shoot the ball, and it takes time. When you get players like
yourself, it's easy to coach them, but when you're a point guard, you see how
it all works and how it all should flow. You have a different pulse of the
game. And to make that transition I think is a little bit easier for point
guards than other positions. But not impossible.  
  
Q. I know coaches don't like to go more than four or five games out when
you're scouting somebody that you know you have to play, but when did you
start looking at Notre Dame, and from your standpoint, what do you see in
Notre Dame that you like about what they do on the floor?  
DAWN STALEY: I think we've probably watched Notre Dame all season long because
our aspirations were to get to this position, and we knew that they were going
to be in the mix. We've watched them, not necessarily from a writing down
their sets or anything, but just getting a feel for how they like to operate
and the things that they do well, and then what I like about them is they play
basketball with all five players. Everybody has a role, and everybody plays
their role, and everybody can make an impact, especially from an offensive
standpoint, where you can't lay off of anybody. Everybody has to be guarded,
and the beautiful thing about Notre Dame is the person with the ball is not
only the person that needs to be guarded. They make you guard five players on
the floor, and when you're able to utilize the people that don't have the
ball, it looks pretty special and beautiful.  
  
Q. When you have two players like Tiffany and Jewell who likely will spend
some time guarding each other, do they often times neutralize each other and
the game comes down to what the other four players do?  
DAWN STALEY: I think in some instances when you have two great players
competing at a high level and very similar in talent and skill set, they do
have a tendency to offset each other. But I don't think this time around‑‑
they're going to have to make plays. Tiff is going to have to make plays for
us, Jewell is going to have to make plays for Notre Dame for both of us to be
successful.  
I'd just like over the course of 40 minutes, I like the depth that we bring
into the game, so Tiff is having an off night, we feel good about being able
to generate points from some other sources.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about your relationship with John Chaney and
what he's meant to your coaching career?  
DAWN STALEY: You know, Coach Chaney, when I first got into coaching, he was my
only impression on a daily basis. A lot of times our male counterpart at
different universities, they're not as open to someone like Coach Chaney. He
would come into our practices, he would allow us to come into his practices
and learn, and what I saw from Coach Chaney is he preaches quality. There's
not a whole lot of quantity in the amount of reps that his guys got. He would
lecture for an hour, and he expected perfection. When they were able to go out
there on the court and execute, if they didn't execute in that moment, there
was another hour lecture coming after that. But he is a perfectionist. He put
his team in positions to win basketball games that no one else thought they
should have been in. For that reason he'll always be one of the best mentors
that I've ever had. Obviously he did not get to the point of participating in
the Final Four, but certainly I dedicate our time being at the Final Four to
him and all the other players that have affected my life as a coach.  
  
Q. Dawn, we have some players here, Breanna Stewart being one, players that
are 6 ‑3 or bigger who have the guard skills and run the court. How has that
changed women's basketball in the last even 10 years that you have these type
of players that create such a match‑up difficulty?  
DAWN STALEY: Well, I think it puts just‑‑ in terms of the whole big scheme of
women's basketball, we've seen the Europeans do this for many, many years.
It's becoming more prevalent in our American basketball system, and I think a
lot has to do with probably‑‑ has to do with seeing the WNBA and seeing their
dreams being lived out in front of them, so they're trying different things.
A'ja Wilson, she's got incredible guard skills. Breanna Stewart, incredible
skill set. Brianna Turner, they're all just long, lanky, and they have the
ability to score in a lot of different ways, so I think it's just opened our
game up to be able to play on a bigger scale. You'll probably see it more in
international play where we match up a little bit better now that our post
players aren't just on the block, back to the basket players.  
  
Q. A'ja played relatively few minutes in the regionals. I think it was 10
and 14. Was there any reason for that?  
DAWN STALEY: Yes. Foul trouble. Foul trouble. But I think it's great
experience for her. I think she's due for a really good game. She's just got
to find a way to not get herself in foul trouble to where we have to limit her
minutes.  
  
Q. You were talking a little bit earlier about the chemistry of the
combinations on the court. When Alaina and A'ja are in, both still really
young players, but how have they ‑‑ what's their chemistry like between the
two of them, and how do you think both of them have grown in this year?  
DAWN STALEY: Well, Alaina and A'ja, they played AAU basketball together, so
they had instant chemistry, but playing at this level, it's a little bit
different, the demands of what needs to be executed out there on the floor. I
think it's helped Lain, Lain being Alaina, I think it's helped her become more
of a leader, and our staff often laughs and chuckles because Alaina is out
there just directing and telling A'ja what she needs to do, and A'ja is like a
little pup. She's listening, she's like, okay, and she does exactly what
Alaina tells her to do because some of the stuff that Alaina is telling her is
the exact same things she learned from Elem the year before and Lisa the year
before. It's helping her to add some tools to her toolbox that are intangible,
and that will go a long way, especially with Lain just being as young as she
is.  
  
Q. Talking to people who know you, they say you're a basketball junkie, you
love watching games, have a lot of TVs in your house and you watch film all
the time. From an Xs and Os standpoint game planning, what most impresses you
about what UConn does, forgetting about Geno's psychology or how he runs his
program, but in terms of true Xs and Os and what you see on the court, what
does UConn do year after year that really impresses you?  
DAWN STALEY: Well, it's probably along the same lines as Notre Dame. They make
you play all five players. There isn't anybody that you can double‑team
without them making you pay for it. What they are extremely good at, they're
great passers. They make other people better. Every five players on the floor
make other people better, and a lot of times a team only has one or two, one
or two players that can actually make someone better. You know, it is a
beautiful thing to see how well they work together. I often think about how
did these players come into this system, because it just seems like they have
a skill set of passing the basketball, when I know Geno probably thinks one or
two of his players aren't great passers, but somehow they hide their
weaknesses, and they do a really good job year in and year out having each
player on the floor develop how to pass the basketball.  
  
Q. When you got to Temple as a new coach and you got to South Carolina, both
programs were really nowhere at the time. Can you compare the evaluations that
you looked at when you had to build both situations?  
DAWN STALEY: You know, Temple, I mean, both programs I knew nothing about
besides they were probably the doormats of their conferences. What you had to
do was change the culture. You had to get your players to stop thinking about
where they're going to spend spring break besides in the gym prepping for
postseason play. I was fortunate that our Temple players bought into that
right away, right away. Instantly we hit the ground running, and it was pretty
much a success story, and then when you move to a place like South Carolina
where it was very similar, but the players didn't catch on. They really didn't
catch on to doing the things that they needed to do to change the culture and
love basketball in the way that they probably should love basketball.  
Now, I'll be the first to say, if you don't love basketball, we're probably
not the coaching staff for you, because we ask you to do things out of the
love of the game, and when you love it, you're able to accomplish things like
we've been able to accomplish. But I will say this: Those players in year one
at South Carolina, they understand it a lot more. They understand what we
asked them to do a lot more because they stayed around our program. They've
been a very good support system for us, and they'll be in town sometime this
weekend to enjoy the fruits of their labor.  
  
Q. Do you have the inside track if Tiffany is going to get the award named
after you?  
DAWN STALEY: I do, actually. I have the inside track, but I can't let it out
at this moment. But Tiffany is‑‑ if she's up for the Wooden Award, if she's an
All‑American, if she's up for Naismith Player of the Year, I'm quite sure we
got it right in having her one of the finalists for the Dawn Staley Award, and
for her, it probably means a little bit more to get the Dawn Staley Award than
some of those other awards because she looked up to me as a youngster. I'll
tease her about that, too. And I'm just kidding. To win the Naismith Award, to
win the Wooden Award would be a great tribute to her hard work, and not only
her hard work but her ability to lift our program to where it is, because
there aren't going to be very many finalists for any of those awards if their
team isn't one of the top teams in the country.  
  
Q. I think even people who don't follow women's basketball closely, they
know of Geno, they hear of the things he says and they're aware of his place
in the game. For people that might be curious who don't know a lot about him
who would ask you, what's this guy all about? What's he bring to the game, and
what impresses you about him? How would you answer that?  
DAWN STALEY: You know, I think Geno is a champion. I think he knows how to‑‑
he knows what buttons to push. I think as far as his team and other people, I
think he's calculating. I think he knows exactly how to get a rise out of
people, and if you don't know him very well, you'll get yourself out of whack.
But if you know him, you'll understand him.  
When it comes to winning and knowing basketball, he's very genius‑like. To be
able to do what he's done year in and year out, the players that he's coached,
and to be able to win as much as he's won, I think he's deserving of all the
attention that he gets, and I hope to one day join in that national
championship banner raising that he's done for UConn.  
  
Q. Morgan talked about a good game against you, 17 points, six or seven
rebounds. Can you talk about what a healthy Morgan Tuck has done for this team
to make them better?  
DAWN STALEY: Well, I think Morgan is probably the brute that they need. She's
their emotional leader. She's an incredible athlete. She can score with the
best of them. She just gives them great balance. When a player of her caliber
is healthy, she's really a hard match‑up for anybody in the country,
especially with all the talent that she's surrounded by.  
  
Q. You've been around the game long enough to see many of Geno's press
conferences and many of the comments he gives that people comment on. How
comfortable are you answering questions that are away from women's basketball,
just on a philosophical comfort level?  
DAWN STALEY: For me, I'm the type of person that stays in my lane because I
don't want anybody in my lane. I only answer questions that have a direct
impact on me or our program.

_TAMPA, FLORIDA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Maryland head coach Brenda Frese,
student‑athletes Laurin Mincy and Shatori Walker‑Kimbrough and Lexie Brown.
We'll start with an opening statement from Coach Frese.  
COACH FRESE: Thrilled, obviously, to be in Tampa. Place has extra special
meaning for my husband and I. We were married in Clearwater about 10 years ago
in August. So tremendous fun to be able to come back and take our team.  
Obviously we're really thrilled to be one of the last four teams standing.
When you talk about the preseason, I think the other three teams were probably
predicted to be here. And for us to be able to come back‑to‑back Final Fours
when no one expected to see us up here is something that I'm really proud of
with this team.  
You talk about losing five seniors, three‑time All‑American in Alyssa Thomas
and new conference and a lot of question marks coming in. I'm proud of the
growth of this young team this season, led by one senior with Laurin Mincy,
three sophomores and their improvement every day.  
It's a team that didn't let others define them and set the bar. It was really
up to them in terms of holding each other accountable and setting their own
bar. So I think it's fun when you talk about it. I think we're a really hard
scout, only team down here that has no All‑Americans, and I think that's what
makes us so dangerous is because we're a team.  
Obviously we have great respect for Connecticut and everything they've
accomplished. To be able to sustain it at a really high level is really hard
to be able to do. But, however, as we're here, we're not going to concede
anything. We're competitors, too.  
And I think that when you talk about playing Connecticut, they're a really
hard team to face, but at the same time for us it's the best way to be able to
close the gap.  
We want to play them as many times as we can. I liken it to when I first got
hired at Maryland, we got to play Duke, a team that drilled us when I first
got hired and then four short years later, actually to this day in 2006, we
were beating Duke in the National Championship game.  
So for us a big thing is understanding in terms of how to play a team and how
to be able to close that gap. So we're looking forward to tomorrow. It's
Easter Sunday. So we're hoping to be able to find a lot of baskets.  
(Laughter).  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Laurin, tough act to follow that comment by Coach about the baskets. When
did you guys start believing this team could be back here? Last year you get
back here with Alyssa and the goal ‑‑ but when did the group think making it
to the Final Four was something that was an attainable goal for you guys?  
LAURIN MINCY: I think in the summer when everyone committed to come here and
work out in the summer. Usually that's an option. But everyone decided to come
back. The workouts we had and just to see how together we were during the
preseason, I knew we were special. And then to go into the Big Ten Conference
where we were not knowing who we were going to face and then to go through
that undefeated, I knew we had a great chance to get back to the Final Four.  
  
Q. Lexie, back court battle expected for tomorrow. What do you expect to see
from Moriah against you?  
LEXIE BROWN: I'm expecting a lot of ball pressure. She's one of the elite
defenders in college. But I mean I think I'll be able to handle it. She's a
lot smaller than me but a lot quicker than me also. But I'm hoping we get
after it. It's going to be a lot of fun going against Moriah.  
  
Q. Lexie or any one of you up there, what do you take away from the Stanford
game, or was that for them or is that too far ago or even from what Dayton was
able to do for a half against them last week?  
LEXIE BROWN: Yeah, the Stanford game, you can't really think about that game.
Every team is different than they were back in November/December. So that
game, yeah, it was a great win for Stanford but UConn is a completely
different team than they were then.  
With the Dayton game we saw how Dayton played fearlessly for the first ten
minutes. No fear. They were taking all their own shots. They gave UConn their
best shot. So that's really the biggest thing we learned from that Dayton
game.  
  
Q. Laurin, just noticing Connecticut year after year, their opponents ‑‑ you
feel with some of them are sort of intimidated, almost beaten before they
start, and why won't that happen to this team?  
LAURIN MINCY: Yeah, I think a lot of teams get caught up in their respect of
UConn. Obviously UConn, a great team.  
When you go into a game, you have to go in confident and fearless, I like to
say, when you're playing UConn. So we're going to go in there fearless and
give them everything we have.  
  
Q. Shatori, both teams like to run. Do you think Maryland has the advantage
in the transition game?  
SHATORI WALKER‑KIMBROUGH: Yeah, I do think we have a slight advantage only
because of how deep we are on the roster. Connecticut goes seven deep. And I
think we go 12 deep.  
And I think just running them and tiring their legs out and us bringing in
fresh legs and continuing to run.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Brenda, when you look at them on tape, I'm sure a lot of stuff stands
out. But specifically what do they do really well?  
COACH FRESE: Obviously they share the basketball extremely well. Within their
offense, you know, they take great shots. And I think where they really hurt
people is in their runs. If you're not able to be able to keep up with them
from a scoring end, I think that's when the game's over.  
  
Q. Same thing I asked Laurin, when did you think this team could make it
back here, knowing what you lost, knowing what was done, when did you think
this team could be special, back in the Final Four for a second straight
year?  
COACH FRESE: I think for me it was conference play, when you talk about we
really had to grow as a team in our non‑conference plays and then when you
talk about going into our new conference and going to Nebraska, going to
Minnesota, you know, and playing in front of 10,000 fans and going in and
winning, it was big.  
And all of a sudden game by game you start winning more games, and it was
really when this team kind of set the bar for themselves in terms of their
expectations that they had.  
  
Q. You have Lexie and Aja, both have dads that played in the NBA. What's it
like coaching members that have family members in basketball? Is it more
difficult coaching them than players that do not?  
COACH FRESE: It's kind of a really neat story when you talk about that their
families were both with the Boston Celtics at the same time. They were on road
trips together. They obviously don't remember it. But neat for the families.  
It's been anything but difficult. It's been incredible. I think, because you
talk about these two girls have worldly experiences, I mean, when you talk
about the number of games, press conferences, environment that they've been in
since being an infant, I think they walk in just with a whole other element.  
Obviously Lexie is our point guard, is poised beyond her years. And I think a
big reason of that is the arenas she grew up in. So it's been really a neat
feature. Obviously we didn't seek it out. It kind of evolved in terms of both
players coming to Maryland.  
But it's been a really cool experience to be able to have both of them.  
  
Q. Obviously Connecticut's dominance sort of overshadows everything, even a
year when you've got four No. 1s in the Final Four. When you look at the non
‑Connecticut portion of tomorrow's crowd and even the country, do you think
they will root for you? And is beating a juggernaut a good thing for this
sport, if it happens?  
COACH FRESE: Yeah, I mean, aren't we tired of it? I think everybody's rooting
for us. I think we're ready for some new stories. And our sport needs it, to
be quite honest. But at the same point it's up to us as coaches and programs
to be able to develop our teams and our programs to that point.  
And I know that there are a lot of people out there that are cheering and want
to see Maryland be able to beat UConn. And I know for us and for our sport it
would be a great thing to be able to have the teams out there. But at the same
point it all goes in runs. Tennessee in past years was a team we talked about.
Then we had a blend of other teams.  
So, again, it's our job as coaches and teams to be able to get ourselves to a
position to be able to beat them.  
  
Q. Talk about the cell phone experiment, the fans, what effect has it had
and do you recommend it to other programs to try?  
COACH FRESE: Well, it really came about, I forget the year, three years ago,
when we played Texas A&M in the Sweet 16 and went on to play in the Elite
Eight.  
And our players then had their cell phones and everything blew up after the
Sweet 16 and going into the Elite Eight. And Brene Moseley came in shared with
us as a staff how she was not able to manage it, that it was a lot of
distractions, a lot of text messages. And from that we really talked about it
as a staff and took it to our team last year and talked about wanting to go
into the Sweet 16 game to turn their phones in and leave them off and with us
until we finished our season or continued on after the Elite game, the Elite
Eight game.  
It's been huge. Our players bought in last year, then again this year when we
brought it up and they were all on board. And we have a team rule just night
before when we're on road games but just to keep it during this duration, I
think helps them to realize they can minimize the distractions that are out
there.  
  
Q. I remember you said last year when you made it back how special it was
you appreciated how tough it is to get back to the Final Four. Now you're back
here for the second straight year. Is it more fulfilling that this program has
been here two straight years as opposed to the time in between?  
COACH FRESE: Yeah, I'm really proud of our consistency, because it is really,
really hard to get here. And especially with a team that no one expected to be
here. And when you talk about our youth, you know, to be able to accomplish
what they did, pretty much we were written off after Alyssa graduated and our
five seniors.  
So no question, I'm really proud of that fact. But it is a different mentality
coming back with this team. Last year's team was kind of that was their goal
and they were happy to be here. It's not the goal of this year's team. They've
set really high goals for themselves.  
And although we're going to always enjoy the moment, we're never going to take
it for granted. We're always going to be humble in this moment because it is
truly an honor to be here. But at the same point we do have really high goals
for ourselves.  
  
Q. The Stanford win against UConn, can you use that as a blueprint in any
way, or was that so long ago it doesn't matter?  
COACH FRESE: I mean, there's always something that you can learn from every
team. And I think Tara is one of the best when you talk about out there
basketball minds and what she was able to do.  
Obviously it was early in the season and every team grows within that season.
But, yeah, no question, they beat UConn. And so you saw the confidence that
they played with, took them into even overtime. Obviously we watched that game
but they just did a phenomenal job in terms of having their team ready to
play.  
They played with a ton of confidence. And I thought they were really
confident, really aggressive going at UConn.  
  
Q. Along the same lines as your philosophy with cell phones, how do you view
social media during the season for your players?  
COACH FRESE: We try to let them navigate through it. But also some boundaries.
I mean, during the season we have a midnight curfew in terms of being on any
of it. So we want them to shut it down so they can get their sleep during the
season. Obviously day of games or if we're on the road we take the cell
phones.  
So we try to kind of give them that balance and that blend. If something is
tweeted or retweeted or something that doesn't represent our program, we'll
communicate it should be taken down and communicate the examples.  
But our girls have done a really nice job I think over the course of time.
It's really something hard to navigate, like I can't imagine if I would have
had all that when I was in college, because I think it's a lot that you're
asking young people to have to be really professional with.  
  
Q. You mentioned the runs that UConn goes on a little bit in your opening. I
think they went on an 18 ‑4 run against Texas in the Sweet 16 and we saw them
in the second half against Dayton come out firing and just separate
themselves. How do you prevent that from happening to keep yourself in the
game?  
COACH FRESE: Call a timeout. Maybe ask for a few more. You know, I mean, I
think you really have to have a pulse on the game. You can't take bad shots in
those runs.  
They're going to score. You've got to be able to go right back at them. You
can't let their run take you down. You've got to be able to stay really strong
within that and be able to keep your poise and your composure.  
  
Q. How much do you think your winning a championship in'06 buys you with the
players that are on your roster today and then beyond that, recruits, because
there are not many people over the last ‑‑ not many coaches I would say over
the last 10 years who can walk into somebody's home and say I've been to the
place you want to be?  
COACH FRESE: Yeah, obviously it's something you're always going to be able to
utilize in recruiting because there haven't been that many teams that have
been able to win championships.  
And I think for us most currently, though, is having the ability to talk about
back‑to‑back Final Fours because I'm not sure how many recruits remember'06
compared to the last two years. So I just think when you're able to sustain it
at a high level, be able to‑‑ now as I'm‑‑ what am I, finishing my 13th year
at Maryland, that consistency level I think is really important to recruits.  
  
Q. This idea that guard by wins championships in March, and the guard fight
this season, a lot different than last season. Do you think that's sort of
what separates this team from last year's Final Four team?  
COACH FRESE: You know, I mean every team's built differently. But I love the
fact that when we're going to see a lot of pressure, and you talk about the
defense that we've had to face when you talk about coming through Duke and
Tennessee and that defensive pressure and what we're going to see tomorrow
night, it is critical to your success. And to be able to see ‑‑ in my opinion
I feel like we do have one of the best back courts in the country. And when
you talk about what these three have been able to do together, you know,
they've been a huge part to our success this season.  
  
Q. If you've watched enough tape on UConn, you've seen different ways to
guard Breanna Stewart. Some teams double her. Some teams don't. She's
obviously, given her length and abilities, a very hard check. Have you thought
philosophically what you want to do in terms of how to defend her, whether
it's doubling, zone or something else?  
COACH FRESE: Yeah. I mean, obviously when you watch as much film as we have,
you are able to see a lot of different things. I can't really tell you what
we're going to do. But I mean obviously she's the most difficult matchup on
the court when you talk about her length and her ability to post you up or her
ability to step out and be able to shoot the 3, her ability to kick to
Kaleena.  
They have a lot of‑‑ what, they have three All‑Americans. So when you talk
about the weapons that they have on the court and then you finish with the
Player of the Year with Stewart, she's a really extremely difficult matchup.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_TAMPA, FLORIDA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us now from UConn head coach Geno Auriemma;
student‑athletes, Moriah Jefferson, Kaleena Mosqueda‑Lewis and Breanna
Stewart. We'll open with a statement from Coach Auriemma.  
COACH AURIEMMA: I don't know how many ways we can say this during the course
of the couple of days that we're here. When you get to this point in the
season, there's a lot of things that we have to do yesterday, today. And I'm
sure they're all fun things to do and I'm sure that everybody gets a kick out
of those in some way.  
But really what everybody wants to do right now is just play. Everybody just
wants game time to come and there's no more to prepare for, there's no more
film to watch, there's no more practices to go to. Right now it's just about
playing the game.  
And we know what the task at hand is. We know how good a team Maryland is. We
know what we have to do.  
And we're anxious to get started.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Kaleena, could you tell me what difference a healthy Morgan Tuck has made
to this team, what a key component she's been?  
KALEENA MOSQUEDA‑LEWIS: Yeah, definitely having Morgan healthy for us for the
whole season has definitely made a difference for our team. Just because she's
been able to be so dynamic for us out there and be able to be a consistent
person for us on the court at all times.  
Definitely someone we can constantly look to for leadership and someone who
kind of keeps us calm and makes sure everything's under control out there.  
  
Q. Breanna Stewart, coming on the stage with an ankle brace or boot, is that
a pre ‑existing injury, nagging injury?  
BREANNA STEWART: The boot is nothing. It's the inflammation of the sesamoid
bone. And it's fine as of today.  
  
Q. Breanna, third time here, Coach says you want to play games. Is that the
mantra, not this other stuff, and ready to get on the court and do what you
need to do?  
BREANNA STEWART: Yeah, I think this past week we've been looking towards
getting here, and now that we're finally here in Tampa, there's a lot of other
distractions to kind of take you away from playing basketball. But we came
here to play basketball, and that's what we want to do and it was nice to get
on the court today.  
  
Q. Moriah, what challenges do Maryland's guards possess for you
specifically?  
MORIAH JEFFERSON: Lexie Brown is a great shooter. I have to do my best to try
to contain her and keep her from driving to the lane. The other guards are
good also. They're really aggressive guards, and we have to make sure that
they can't penetrate on us when they're trying to get to the basket and kick
it off to the big guys.  
  
Q. Breanna, do you think over the course of your career you've learned to
deal better with teams throwing defenses, being very physical with you during
games, do you think you're better at dealing with that than you were maybe a
year ago?  
BREANNA STEWART: Definitely. I think especially transitioning from freshman to
sophomore year and even sophomore year to now, getting stronger was one of my
big focal points. And I know that everything's going to be physical with me.
I'm expecting that every single game.  
So it's gotten to a point where I'm used to it, and if it doesn't happen, I'm
sometimes surprised.  
  
Q. Question for Breanna. Breanna, just in general, do you guys enjoy being
the team that everybody kind of wants to knock off the throne, the team that
everybody's pointing to all year?  
BREANNA STEWART: I don't really think we think about it like that. We know
that everyone's‑‑ everyone wants to beat us, yeah, and it comes with the
territory. We come to a program where we set the standard really high, and our
goal is to get to the Final Four and to win championships.  
And we know that we always have a target on our backs.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. I'd like to ask about Morgan's role and, first of all ‑‑ that's a
complicated surgery she had last year. Were you at all fearful she might never
get back or never get back to the level where she wouldn't be able to play
again at the level that you saw in high school? Did you ever have a fear she'd
never get back? And talk about what she's meant to you this year.   
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah, you know, Morgan's freshman year at Connecticut, the
first two weeks of practice, we still had Stefanie Dolson and Stewy,
obviously, came in at the same time. And during those first couple of weeks, I
mean, it was pretty evident that at some point pretty soon Morgan was going to
be one of the best players in the country.  
And she was coming off a knee surgery she had. I think people forget, when she
got hurt she was Illinois Player of the Year as a freshman. I mean, that's not
any state. That's a state where they play a lot of pretty good high school
girls basketball.  
And the injury that she developed started to bother her and sophomore year
it's something that she thought we could manage. And when she elected to have
the surgery, it was two things: One, it was, man, I don't know if we can win
the National Championship without her, last year. And, two, our doctors and
everyone told us, you know, there's a 50/50 chance that this will work; she
could come back 100percent or come back just as bad or if not worse than she
is right now.  
So Morgan and her parents wanted to make that chance. And obviously we
obliged. But I knew what we had there, and I knew that at some point, if we
could get her just playing and not worrying about her knee, that there are
very few players in America that can do what she does.  
If she didn't play on the same team with Stewy, I think people would get a
different view. And they help each other a lot, obviously. Those two
complement each other so well.  
But I have to say that every big game that Morgan's played in‑‑ we lost a
Stanford game because Morgan didn't play much and fouled out. I was
experimenting with our team.  
That went real well, huh? And we knew once we got her in the starting lineup
that she got a lot of minutes and she hadn't played all last year that we were
going to be a different team. And she is the biggest difference in our team.  
  
Q. Someone told me that they admire about her she can play the 3, 4, 5,
defend the 3, 4, 5. Is that basically right?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I think we're very fortunate that we can put her anywhere we
want to put her and she's very, very effective. And she's been able to adapt
her game to fit whatever need that we have that game. So whatever we need that
day, that's what she's capable of doing. Not many players‑‑ and having her and
Stewy up there really, I hope, poses a lot of problems for a lot of teams.  
  
Q. When you look at Maryland in years past, typically similar on the front
court, with Alyssa Thomas, Tianna Hawkins and, Alicia DeVaughn, now with the
guards producing at a high level, does that change at all how you prepare to
get ready for them?  
COACH AURIEMMA: They're obviously a much different team than the Maryland team
we played the last couple of years. I think when you have a team where you
have one player that is as dominant and as great a player as Alyssa Thomas
was, you tend to expect her to do so much for your team, that sometimes you
don't get to see what the other players can do.  
And now that Alyssa is not there, I mean, a lot of these guys that are playing
huge roles for Maryland, they didn't even start last year. So now they come
off and everybody's like: Where did these guys come from? They were always
pretty good. But it's just now they're playing leading roles, and they are
much more difficult to defend than they were last year.  
Everybody probably thinks they don't have the inside game that they used to
have, but at this time of the year, I don't care how many big guys you have,
your guards are going to win your games in March.  
You have to have great guards who play great. And their guards play great the
whole tournament, and that's the biggest worry that we have tomorrow.  
  
Q. What is it about your players that allows them to thrive in the role of
the favorite so often?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Probably being in that role a lot has as much to do with it as
anything else. They come to Connecticut with that expectation in mind, and
they either embrace that role and survive and actually thrive, as you said, in
that role of having to be the favorite and having to be on your game every
night because everybody'snational championship is when they play you during
the regular season, as you guys have seen that cover our team.  
People beat us, they storm the court, they carry their coach off the court,
we've seen it all. And they thrive on it and they embrace it because they want
it. They want to be in that role. And we just kind of keep feeding into it as
coaches and we keep pushing it forward and we try not to shy away from it.
There's no shying away from it.  
I mean, it is what it is. And you either embrace it and thrive in it or you
wilt and you don't play.  
  
Q. The loss in November, you got some immediate mileage out of that I'm sure
with your team in November. Do you still get mileage out of it in April?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I don't know. You know, I don't know‑‑ you can only hold onto
things for so long. We try not to hold onto things for that long. I might
bring it up once in a while, but it hasn't come up in a long time now. But I
wish we would lose more. I really do.  
I wish we would lose on a regular basis like everybody else does so that when
we don't play well or the other team plays great and we get beat, it becomes
kind of part of the college landscape at Connecticut. Hey, you know, it's all
right, they'll bounce back, they'll be fine.  
I think those things help you. And it did help us. I just don't want that or
any other loss at Connecticut to be that's the reason why we're going to be
good or that's the reason why kids get better is because we played a team that
played really, really well. And I keep reminding my players, not using
Stanford in particular, but keep reminding my players all the time that when
you play, the team that plays the best that night is going to win if both
teams are equally talented.  
And that game just reinforced that, as did the Dayton game.  
  
Q. When you look at what Brenda Frese has done building up the Maryland
program during the time she's been there, do you consider her one of the best
in your profession?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah, I mean, you don't get to win as much as day one in both
the ACC and now in the Big Ten and win a National Championship and make
multiple appearances in the Final Four without being really, really good.  
The Maryland program has a long history of great success. Chris Weller was one
of the icons and one of the mainstays of college women's basketball, and
Maryland was one of the best programs in America. When I was an assistant,
they were as good as anybody in the country.  
And I think Brenda went there and kind of rekindled that and then took it to
where it is now, where I don't think anybody is surprised that Maryland's
here. I don't think they sneak up on anybody anymore.  
Her and her staff and their players, they keep winning. And it's not a
one‑time thing anymore. They just expect to win now. And so does everybody
else expect them to win.  
  
Q. Lexie Brown is one of Maryland's obviously top dynamic scorers but also
the daughter of Dee Brown, former NBA player. As a coach, what are the unique
characteristics of a player that has family ties to the game, and what's it
like coaching against them? Is it any different than players that don't have
any connection?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I think it goes both ways. I think you're starting to see more
daughters of NBA players playing college basketball. It goes both ways. Some
benefit from being in that environment, growing up in that environment, from
what I've seen. They learn how to compete. They understand what winning and
losing is. They understand what preparing is. They understand what the
expectation is. They have to live with the name that they grew up with. They
have to separate themselves from their father's notoriety and carve out their
own identity.  
So it's not easy being the son or the daughter of somebody like that. And I
think she's handled it great. And he's probably helped her handle it great. I
met him a couple times, and he seems like a regular dad.  
Now the flip side of that, some of those guys are out of their mind. And their
daughters are out of their mind, because the expectation level is unrealistic.
And the expectation level of the parents is unrealistic. And you always cross
your fingers and hope that those kids can be really good on their own merit
rather than live off their father's names. And I gotta say she's one of the
ones that's been able to do it.  
  
Q. Breanna has ‑‑  
COACH AURIEMMA: I'm excited to watch the games tonight. I'm excited to watch
the games tonight.  
  
Q. Breanna has shown a really unique ability to perform her best when the
spotlight is its brightest. Why do you think that is? And is that something
you saw in her when you recruited her, or is that ‑‑ I don't know‑‑ I imagine
it can't be taught, but why does she possess that unique characteristic of
playing well when it matters most?  
COACH AURIEMMA: You just don't know the answers to that question. I don't know
the answer to that question. And I don't know that anyone does. I don't know
that Stewy does. When you're recruiting somebody, you really try to
distinguish like why are they dominant. Are they dominant because physically
they're just so much better than everybody else, and that was the case with
Stewy obviously. She's in eighth, ninth grade and she's just dominant in her
age group.  
One of the things that I thought was telling was that in all the U.S.A.
Basketball experience that she's had, I think she's won more gold medals than
anyone else in the history of U.S.A. Basketball, by this age, is that she
always played up. She always played above her age group. So she's always the
youngest player playing with older kids. And, yet, she was always on the
all‑tournament team or MVP or led the team in scoring or led the team in
rebounding.  
So that kind of gave you an idea that this kid thrives in a pressure
environment. But she's still just coming out of high school. She's still just
a kid. So you don't know how that's going to translate into college.  
And sometimes you recruit a kid and you think this kid's going to be it and
they're not. And sometimes you get pleasantly surprised. Which Stewy kind of
knew she had it and then all she needed was a stage to prove it. And she's
done it, man. I've coached some great ones you all know that. I can name them
but I don't need to. And she's as good as anybody I've ever coached when the
big moments come.  
  
Q. Because of all of your accomplishments over the years, when your program
is portrayed it's often portrayed as this unbeatable machine, almost like you
cut them and they don't bleed. Is taking the pressure off your players
something that you have to actively participate in, or do you have players
that know the reality and don't pay attention to such things?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I think every player, every person in this room has to deal
with some kind of pressure at some point. And you can't avoid it and you can't
ignore it and you can't pretend that it's not there and you have to figure out
a way to use that pressure to make you better.  
There's not a lot of difference between‑‑ like you saw those ten kids get
WBCBL All‑American out there. There's not that much difference between those
ten kids as actual 18‑, 19‑, 20‑year‑old kids. There's not that much
difference.  
If you were to sit down with all of them, there's a lot of similarities
between those kids. What happens, I think, is the pressure that you're under
every day forces you to adapt and then you become somewhat immune to it after
a period of time.  
But that doesn't change the fact that you're just a 19‑, 20‑year‑old playing a
game, and it doesn't mean that tomorrow night that pressure can't overwhelm
you. It's still there.  
The kids that play on our team are not unlike any of the other kids playing in
this Final Four. I think just during the year and during their careers they're
under a lot more pressure than the other kids on the other teams here, and
they learn to use it to their advantage.  
And I don't really try to do anything to diffuse the pressure, other than when
March comes around, I change to accommodate the situation, and I try to help
them even more.  
October to March, I really don't care what happens to them. I don't care how
hard it is, how much pressure they're under, how much they struggle, what
people say about that.  
The more misery we can inflict upon these guys from October to March, the
better. When March comes around, we just take a deep breath and say this is
our time.  
  
Q. You said you'll be watching the men's game tonight. What kind of advice
and what kind of experience can you give to Kentucky and Coach Calipari going
into their 48 ‑0 hopefully season during this weekend?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Throw the ball to your big guy. Which one? Any of the 10.
Don't worry about it. (Laughter) I got to know him pretty well when he was
coaching at UMass. That guy, you talk about a guy who has it all figured out,
that guy right now has got stuff going in college basketball that no one ever
has done.  
And he's an unbelievable recruiter. He's an unbelievable coach. He's an
unbelievable‑‑ just able to thrive in that environment that he creates, and
he's in his element right now. He's in his element right now. And he gets
overlooked for what kind of coach he is, how good he is and how good his teams
play. So coaching against a Philly guy tonight and guys like Bo Ryan, they
don't get intimidated by guys' names or reputations. So I'm anxious to see the
game.  
But as far as any advice for Cal, you know, I don't know that there's anything
I could possibly say that he doesn't already know or doesn't already have. I
can't think of anything. I mean, I can but I can't say it in public.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## April 4, 2015

  

### [Lindsay Allen](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28835)

### [Jewell Loyd](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26561)

### [Muffet McGraw](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14071)

  
_TAMPA, FLORIDA_  
  
Q. Jewell, South Carolina has obviously been looking at how to defend you.
Have you been looking at how they might try to defend you, and who are the
best defenders on that team?  
JEWELL LOYD: Yeah, we worked on how we're playing, we worked on a lot of other
different strategies, as well. We know Tiffany Mitchell is one of their better
defenders and she might be guarding me, I'm not sure. But just working on a
lot of things.  
  
Q. Jewell, how similar or different are you and Tiffany as players? You get
a lot of comparisons between the two of you.  
JEWELL LOYD: Yeah, I think we both have the same mindset of attacking. We're
patient, pretty good athletes. People compare us pretty similar like, but at
the same time we're kind of different, as well.  
  
Q. Could you just talk about the experience of having been here before and
how you think that may factor in in terms of a team that's never been to the
Final Four before?  
JEWELL LOYD: I think that really counts for a lot being in the Final Four,
because there's so much stuff you do off the court and there's different
distractions. But I think overall it's just going to be a lot of fun for all
the teams that are here.  
  
Q. Lindsay and Jewell, address what you have seen of the South Carolina
team, if they remind you of anybody that you've played before the season, what
kind of match ‑up or difficulties do you see in playing this team?   
JEWELL LOYD: I think they remind me a lot of Tennessee, also being an SEC
school. They're very physical, they have great posts and they have a really
physical defense.  
LINDSAY ALLEN: Yeah, I definitely agree with that. They're definitely
physical. They follow the game plan really well and they play hard. They're
fighters.  
  
Q. Lindsay, you were pretty much lights out the last two games. Did you wish
that you could have been playing Wednesday and Thursday, too, and what kind of
got you on that roll?  
LINDSAY ALLEN: I think just our game plan those two games. The posts set
really great screens for us and we got some free‑throw line jumpers that
really worked on in practice, so just having that confidence and having your
teammates really trusting you and instilling that confidence in you.  
  
Q. Some say that just having Final Four experience counts for a lot. Do you
think that will play an advantage since this is South Carolina's first trip?  
JEWELL LOYD: I just think that experience really helps. We understand
possession basketball, and both teams are here to try to win, so it's going to
be a competitive game, and that's what you want in women's basketball.  
  
Q. Jewell, if you and Tiffany are matched up against one another, does the
competitor in you almost kind of want that?  
JEWELL LOYD: Well, you want good basketball. You want good competition all the
way around so you want the challenge, and it's awesome. We talked about that
on the court, as well, and we were excited to play each other.  
  
Q. Growing up did you guys ever expect to be here?  
JEWELL LOYD: Growing up it was always a dream of mine playing for the Final
Four and playing on the biggest stage against some of the best players who
ever played the game. Yeah, that was really a goal of mine growing up.  
LINDSAY ALLEN: Yeah, definitely. It's something you dream about growing up as
a kid, just playing under the big lights and playing with great teammates and
great coaches, so it's been awesome.  
  
Q. What are some of the biggest challenges you face as a basketball
player?  
JEWELL LOYD: I think probably just time management, understanding that you
still are a student‑athlete, so student comes first, so just understanding how
to manage your time.  
LINDSAY ALLEN: Yeah, I would say balancing school and basketball. Obviously
you have to do both, and it's hard to balance that at times, but you have to
get it done.  
  
Q. Muffet, how do you see Tiffany or some of USC's other defenders matching
up with Jewell?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Well, they've got a lot of choices. I think that's the strength
of their team is they have so many great guards with terrific defensive
ability in terms of their just athletic ability. I think they could probably
keep a fresh body on her throughout the game without really losing a lot, even
when they go to the bench. I think they've got some really strong defenders.  
  
Q. I have two very unrelated questions. One, after a spectacular season,
Jewell struggled a little bit in the tournament. What have you said to her
about hanging in there and not trying to force it because she was doing a
little bit of that? And the other question is talk about what Morgan Tuck has
added to Connecticut?  
MUFFET McGRAW: I would say in terms of Jewell, that when you look at her
numbers I would have been thrilled if anybody else on our team had those
numbers. I think that she has been so spectacular all year long that we expect
a superstar every single game, and I think the beauty of us being here and our
team, what got us here, is the rest of the team. I think that what Jewell does
when she's on the floor, she draws so much attention from the other team, and
their whole defense is designed to stop her. So it allows the rest of the team
to step up, and the thing that allows that the most is I think is Jewell,
because she passes the ball so much she's so happy when the other teammates
score, and I think that she's that kind of team member that really kind of
empowers the rest of the team to, hey, step up, I believe in you, you can step
up and help us win, also. I think she's very comfortable having other people
contribute, but I think she is also ready for a big game.  
And as far as Morgan Tuck, I think that it's a shame that the media decides
who's going to be the best players at the beginning of the year because I
thought from our game at least in December, she was the best player on their
team in that game, so probably their second‑best player. I don't think she's
gotten near the attention that she deserves. I think she's had a fantastic
year, and she is a big reason for their success, and for some reason she's not
getting any attention from the media.  
  
Q. How important is it for women's basketball that someone other than
Connecticut win this weekend and in championships down the road?  
MUFFET McGRAW: I thought this was a great year for women's basketball in terms
of the parity of the tournament. We had a number of upsets, we had a lot of
close games throughout the tournament into the regionals. You saw North
Carolina and Florida State almost beating South Carolina to get here. We had a
really tough game with Baylor to get here. Maryland had a tough game with
Tennessee to get here. I don't think it was‑‑ even though all four No.1 seeds
are here and only for the third time in the history of the tournament, I think
that there's a lot of parity, and it's getting better every year. I think
we've got the best four teams here now, and I think what everybody is hoping
for are good games, at least competitive games.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the concerns you might have for South Carolina and its
front court and what kind of challenge you think that's going to give to your
front court?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Well, I have a lot of concerns about South Carolina. They're
such a good team and their depth is just probably the best in the game.
Actually I think they have the most depth of any team here. They have great
post players on the bench and in the starting lineup. You can't think about
we'll have to get them in foul trouble or maybe we can do this or that because
the people they're bringing in or as good or better than the ones that are
starting. I think they present a lot of trouble for us at both ends of the
floor. Defensively you've got Coates who's a great shot blocker. She's just
got such a big body. We really haven't seen a post player with her size and
ability all season long, so I think it's going to be a little different for us
to see the strength of their posts in this game.  
  
Q. Elaborating on that parity question, with a lot of the same programs at
the top, how hard is it for a school like South Carolina to establish a Final
Four ‑caliber program?   
MUFFET McGRAW: Well, I think you're starting with a great coach, and that does
make things a little bit easier. She's got a tremendous reputation in the game
and she does a great job, so I think that helps. But I think it's difficult. I
think the thing that helps you is when you have great in‑state talent. That is
probably the thing that can really get you going because when you have local
players who want to stay close to home to play and have their families watch
them, it makes it easier to recruit them. I think they were fortunate that
there was so much talent in the state of South Carolina. And then when you
start to win, that attracts more good players. I think good players want to
play with good players, so I think it's really been flourishing for Dawn.  
  
Q. Tiffany Mitchell gets so much attention for her offense. What have you
seen from her on film in terms of a defender, especially how well she's able
to defend late in games?  
MUFFET McGRAW: It's funny, we were talking, she and Jewell are so similar in
that way that they both guard the other team's best player, and we ask so much
of Jewell and I'm sure of Tiffany, as well. You've got to perform at the
offensive end but then you've got to shut down somebody, and of course you'd
better rebound and do some other things in between. I think to have the best
player be the best defender, it just says a lot for Tiffany and her mindset. I
think a lot of really good players just want to score, and they don't have as
much interest at the other end, so I think it's great to see these two young
ladies really take pride in their defense.  
  
Q. Whereabouts at the end of the season did you start to feel like, okay,
now we're getting our feet underneath us as far as rebounding and we can
rebound with other people?  
MUFFET McGRAW: I think we were really challenged throughout the season in the
ACC, which is just really prepares us so well for the tournament because we're
seeing so many great teams, yet Florida State who was only out‑rebounded once
all season long and that was when we did it in the ACC Tournament. I think
rebounding we faced so many teams throughout the year that this is a great
rebounding team, they're hardly ever out‑rebounded so we've really got to do
our job, and I think we finally started to take pride in it. It took a while,
I think probably late in the season, probably end of February, before we
really started to take some pride in the box‑out and work a little bit harder
on the boards.  
  
Q. Just wondering what the impact Natalie Achonwa has had on the program
this year, the contributions she's been able to make.  
MUFFET McGRAW: It's been great having Ace around to just help counsel some of
the players, to have her on the bench, to talk to us a little bit from the
players' point of view. We'll talk about some things we're going to do and
she'll give some input as to whether that's a good or a bad idea or something
that they would embrace. It's been good for me to have a little bit of a
sounding board which is very similar to when she was a senior. We talked about
a lot of things then, too. It's funny to watch her. She incredibly organized
in running things, which is not a surprise because of her leadership ability.
But it's been great. It's been great for her to have this experience of being
on the bench and being around practice. It's kept her going through the injury
because she's just been rehabbing and working hard on that.  
It's been, I think, a great experience for both of us.  
  
Q. What have you learned about Taya Reimer this year?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Taya has been probably the difference in our season I would
say. Somewhere around the middle of January, she turned into a completely
different person, and she has brought an energy and an aggressiveness and a
confidence that we really needed. I think that our posts were‑‑ I said in the
beginning of the year I didn't think they were tough enough, and she's the
difference. She's the one that really brought out the toughness in the others.
She's been a mentor for Kathryn and Bri. She's just added so much experience
as just a sophomore, but I think she has really turned the corner, changed her
game, and I think that from that point on, I think she's had an all‑American
type of season. We're just so happy that she has kind of found a way to lead
this team.  
  
Q. I apologize if you answered this already, but just talk about Natalie
Achonwa growth, what she's done for you, her growth as a person over the last
year for you?  
MUFFET McGRAW: You know, as a player, Natalie was the most mature player I've
ever had from the time she was coming out of high school. She was always
somebody that was incredibly organized and knew what was coming months down
the road, and then as a player the same kind of leadership with the team, took
care of them, everybody was always in the right spots. They were on the bus at
the right time. They knew where they were supposed to be because of her
leadership and her organization, so those skills in the DOBO job have been
tremendous for us. She has organized all the itineraries, she keeps everybody
in line. She's on top of everything, and plus being a former player I think
can really help the players. She can counsel them on some things ‑‑ if we're
hitting a rough patch and she needs to go in and talk over some things with
them, I think she's a really good listening ear for them to be able to vent
some things. And she's just been great on the bench. She's got great ideas.
Initially she didn't say too much and then finally got comfortable and gave
some input in what we were doing on the court. I think it's been great, really
great for us, and I think great for her, as well.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## April 1, 2015

  

### [Dawn Staley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15625)

  
_TAMPA, FLORIDA_  
  
COACH STALEY: Hi. We're just really excited about participating in our first
Final Four in our program's history. Our players are pretty excited about it,
but we're also going to approach this as a business trip. I can remember
participating in my first Final Four in, I believe, 1990, and reflecting on
that, I was really just happy to be there.  
All the hoopla before you actually play the game plays a role in having the
energy to finish the job. So we'll be conscious of that throughout our stay in
Tampa. And also just instill in our players that we came to win games, and our
focus has to be on that.  
  
Q. Hi, Dawn. I know beyond the hoopla ‑‑ and there may be more hoopla now
than there was even when you played. Beyond the hoopla, what it is about a
first Final Four experience that you're going to have to talk through with
your team.   
COACH STALEY: Well, just I think the biggest is the hoopla, the excitement.
Our kids have never been on this stage before. I think only Tiffany Mitchell
last year was around all the excitement and the hoopla of a Final Four, but to
have our entire program‑‑ and not just our players. It's probably our staff,
our managers, every single person is going to be in an element that they
haven't been before.  
So it almost‑‑ you get a little star struck by it, but at the same time, our
kids have been a team that has been focused all season long, and our focus has
been to get to the Final Four. But our main focus is to win a National
Championship. You don't want to shortchange this opportunity by being clouded
by something other than the basketball game.  
  
Q. I did want to ask you about playing in the Final Four specifically in
'91, when you came so close to winning and you guys lost by three in overtime.
How much have you thought about that game over these past few years or maybe
this week? Just how much do you think about that since it happened?  
COACH STALEY: I don't think about it much, meaning since we punched our ticket
to the Final Four‑‑ I joke around with one of my former teammates who played
on that team, Tonya Cardoza, and every now and then, I tell her, ask her, why
did she go for the steal?  
We talked about Debbie called a time‑out. We listened to Debbie and the
time‑out, and then we came back on the floor. As players, we had our own
little time‑out, our own little meeting after the meeting, and I just
specifically remember telling Tonya, "Don't go for the steal," and she ended
up going for the steal, and I ended up having to foul Dena Head, who was a 50
percent free‑throw shooter, and she hit both of them and kind of tied the game
up. So we joke around about that.  
What I'm reflecting on now is the first time that I was able to participate in
the Final Four because it's very similar to what our players are about to
embark on, and I just don't want them‑‑ I want them to enjoy it because
there's a fine line between enjoying it and enjoying it too much to where you
won't focus.  
It can be overwhelming. I'm looking at the schedule, and there's not a whole
lot of time that's dedicated towards practice and having our players focused
on the game. So we've got to do a really good job at keeping them focused and
keeping them in the moment, but also knowing that our ultimate goal is to win
a National Championship.  
  
Q. As a quick followup to that, Dawn, you've been in Thompson Boling Arena
several times. You've seen that '91 National Championship banner hanging up
there. Has there ever been a time you looked up there and shook your head and
thought, Boy, I was this close to having it at Virginia?  
COACH STALEY: Not really. It's so long ago, but when you bring it up, there
are ill feelings because we were right there. We had the game in our hands.
Unfortunately, it wasn't in the cards. We're going to play it out that way.  
I think this time around will probably be a little bit more gratifying because
we're two decades removed from that, but I think for it to happen for us in
South Carolina, I think it would be pretty special because it's at a time in
which nobody really anticipated our program to be where it is today.  
To be able to compete for a National Championship is something that I
envisioned for our players, for their parents, for our university, for all of
Gamecock nation, and we got an opportunity to see it through.  
  
Q. Dawn, the fact that virtually all the players on the other three teams
have been through this before, is that a disadvantage? Or does that take the
pressure off your group?  
COACH STALEY: I mean, you can look at it either way. They're probably looking
at us like we're going to be running around, not knowing what to expect and
not knowing what to do and getting full off of the excitement. You will if you
haven't experienced it. I've experienced it, so I kind of know when it's time
to draw the line.  
And then you can also look at it like we're in a position that we haven't been
in probably besides once this year, and that's playing the underdog position.
That's something our program has been probably for, with the exception of this
season ‑‑ we've played that role before. So it will be familiar territory when
it comes to playing that role.  
  
Q. The first question is how important is your leadership, the girls that
are leading your team going into this, the team's first Final Four? And then
I'll let you answer it, and I'll ask you a question about Notre Dame.  
COACH STALEY: I think it's extremely important, but at the same time, we need
to continue to stress staying in character. With all the excitement of going
to the Final Four, we need to stay in character. We need to continue to focus.
And our leaders, which they're in unfamiliar territory. It's easy to focus at
home, and it's easy to focus on the road when there are less distractions.  
This is all teams. All teams that are coming, they have a lot of
distractions‑‑ the hoopla, their relatives, their parents are going to be
there in the same hotel. So there's going to be a lot. I think it's really
important that we focus‑‑ we enjoy, but we focus on the task at hand, and that
is probably making some of our relatives upset because we won't‑‑ we're going
to treat it as a road game where we don't have a whole lot of time to share
and enjoy with our loved ones because we have April 8th to share all these
wonderful times.  
So we're looking forward to it, and hopefully, it ends the way we want it to
end.  
  
Q. And going into that answer you just gave me, what is ‑‑ in your eyes,
what is the character of your team? What is the South Carolina basketball
team?   
COACH STALEY: We're a really focused basketball team. We're resilient. We are
a team that I consider a very disciplined basketball team. But we're not
mistake free. We do make mistakes, and we do have some lapses, but we're able
to overcome those lapses by working hard and playing to our strengths. And our
strengths are being able to play inside out, to be able to utilize our depth
throughout a 40‑minute basketball game.  
  
Q. And then my question about Notre Dame, how much have you seen of them
this year when you haven't been working on with your team and its next game?
And give me a brief look at what you ‑‑ you know, their strengths as you see
them.   
COACH STALEY: Notre Dame is a very calculating basketball team, very patient.
They know where their shots are coming from. From a defensive standpoint, they
make you make plays while they are in between you and the basket. So they want
shots over you instead of around you. I mean, the trick is being able to keep
them off balance enough to get the shots that you want to get from an
offensive standpoint.  
  
Q. Hi, Coach. I was just wondering, can I have your thoughts on how your
freshman you play a lot, such as Bianca Cuevas and A'ja Wilson, have evolved
and perhaps bettered themselves from when training camp started to this point
now?  
COACH STALEY: I think they've progressed nicely. And I often think about, if
we had to just throw them in the fire, how much of that progression would have
put them in a better position of having more opportunity to play,
unfortunately. But fortunately, we have some older players that have been
around the block that are teaching them.  
And sometimes the lessons that they're learning now by getting less reps will
benefit them in the long haul because they have to think now. They have to be
able to think and understand the game and slow the game down a little bit so
they can get a better understanding of how you excel at this level every
single day.  
  
Q. As a followup to that, even though they don't start, Cuevas and Wilson,
that is, do you think going into the season they knew they were going to have
to play a considerably sized role for this team to go as far as you all have
gone to this point?  
COACH STALEY: I think both of them are pretty intelligent, talented players,
and obviously, we brought them here with the hopes of having them play an
integral part of our success, and they have. I think sometimes we think
integral and impact is being out there starting and scoring a certain amount
of points.  
But as you saw over the weekend, there were times in which I felt really good
about putting Bianca in a game in which we were down by ten, and you saw how
she thrives in that situation.  
A'ja Wilson, she's in the end of the game when we play Duke, when we're in the
Bahamas, when we're playing Syracuse, when we were down.  
So these are experiences that they have and that they cherish because they
haven't played a whole lot of minutes. So when they've had some success, they
bottle it up, and they find a way to allow those instances to help them.  
  
Q. Hi, Dawn. I have two questions for you. The first thing is you talked
about keeping your team focused and sort of trying to avoid getting
overwhelmed by the situation. I'm curious for you as a coach, I know you're
focused on planning, but I'm wondering if you've allowed yourself to
appreciate that three of the four coaches in the Final Four this year have
strong Philadelphia ties, and if so, is that special for you at all?  
COACH STALEY: Absolutely. Philly people always have so much love when you do
well, and Geno has been doing this for‑‑ Geno and Muffet have both been doing
it for a long time. I'm pretty much the new kid on the block when it comes to
being at Final Fours with the basketball team. So extremely happy that
Philadelphia is getting the due that it deserves because a lot of times our
sports teams always‑‑ well, not always. Our sports teams end up breaking our
hearts.  
  
Q. True, true. My second question is you're one of the most accomplished
people in the game, but I'm curious about your early days in Philly, maybe at
Dobbins or wherever. What accomplishment from back then are you most proud of
or stands out most in your mind?  
COACH STALEY: I guess just growing up‑‑ I read the article today in The
Inquirer by Mike Jensen, and I forgot about some of those days which my
brothers touched on. I did. I had a really‑‑ I'm most proud of being able to
cut the bottom of a milk crate out, nail it to a piece of wood, and put it on
that electrical pole. And I used to really‑‑ I perfected a bank shot off of a
wooden basket in a crate.  
So I know I've accomplished a lot of things in my life and my basketball
career, but that's truly hard. I won a lot of horse games on the streets of
Philly learning how to perfect the bank shot under those circumstances. So
proud moments.  
  
Q. Hi, Coach. My question for you is being a point guard, being that leader,
that coach on the court, is that what made it so easy for you to become a head
coach?  
COACH STALEY: I think being a point guard and being in a position to serve
others makes it almost a natural move to be able to be a coach. I think some
of the other‑‑ the patience of a point guard. I think the biggest transition
was probably I wasn't one that talked a whole lot. I saw things. There isn't a
whole lot of fat to when I'm speaking. I just speak just to the point.  
Sometimes speaking to the point, players don't always get it. So you almost
have to figure out‑‑ and this is a point guard thing. You have to figure out
how players process information. You've got to figure out what buttons to
push. Those characteristics of being a point guard make it a lot easier to
make the transition into coaching.  
  
Q. As a follow ‑up to that, you're going against a former point guard in
Muffet. I don't know, what do you think that chess match will be? Have you
looked up to her over the years with all her accomplishments, going to five
consecutive Final Fours now? What do you think about that matchup?   
COACH STALEY: I have a great deal of respect for what Muffet has been able to
do year in and year out for a very long time. I think her style of coaching is
incredible because she's able to get the best out of her players year in and
year out. She runs a system in which everybody seems to be able to be
successful in her system, and that's what you want as a player and as a coach.  
When everybody feels like they can make an impact on a game and they're
involved, I think it benefits everybody.  
  
Q. Dawn, I've been talking the last couple days with Tammi Reiss and Debbie
Ryan, and they're talking about how happy they are that you're in the Final
Four and what this means to even people you played with back in Virginia, your
former coaches. Can you maybe talk a little about how you've kept all these
relationships with your ‑‑ if you will, the UVA family of friends and the
Temple former players and stuff, and how maybe you're sort of carrying some of
that in, the good wishes of all those folks going into the Final Four.   
COACH STALEY: Basketball has been my life for a very long time. When
basketball is so much a part of your life, it's the people that make it really
important, that you meet, that you join hands with. Every single team that
I've been involved in, I've tried to be a really good teammate, tried to pass
on my competitiveness, and I've tried to use some of what they do best and use
it to benefit me.  
Debbie Ryan, Tammi Reiss, Audra Smith, ‑all of those players that I played
with at Virginia, and we came up short in winning a National Championship‑‑
those experiences fuel me to this day. I know I've accomplished a lot‑‑ the
gold medals, being a part of Olympic teams, just being a part of USA
Basketball. But the one thing that's always escaped me was the National
Championship.  
And I don't know if it's because it wasn't in the cards. Maybe it wasn't in
the cards. Maybe there's something bigger that will affect a lot more people
than my Virginia days.  
But to be able to look back on my career‑‑ I talked to Coach Chaney a few days
ago, and he's one that I look at. I drove 12 hours from Philadelphia to
Atlanta, and I believe he played Michigan State in the Elite Eight. He fell
short of going to a Final Four, a legendary coach like Coach Chaney.  
I take with me to the Final Four all of those people that have played an
integral role in my career and in my life because it's something that not very
many coaches‑‑ they coach their whole lives and won't get an opportunity to
experience going to the Final Four. So I take all of those people who helped
me along the way and who also experienced that awful feeling of not‑‑ you
know, that void of not winning a National Championship.  
So hopefully, the cards are in our favor this year, and hopefully I'll be able
to hoist the trophy for all of those people that have played an integral role
in my life.  
  
Q. Debbie says she always knew that you had a coach in you. She wasn't sure
exactly at what point, because you were such a great player, that you would
transfer over to coaching. But I'm wondering, even back then when you were at
UVA, did you know eventually coaching was going to be what you got into?  
COACH STALEY: I absolutely did not want to be a coach a day in my life, not
one ounce in me wanted to be a coach, and I don't know why. I have coaches who
were friends before I became a coach, and the only thing they talked about was
their team, and I just thought there is‑‑ although I love this game. It is my
livelihood. It is my passion. But it didn't create balance as a coach.  
Little did I know, once I became a coach, I understood. It's almost like‑‑ and
I don't mean to say this and lessen of what a mother who's giving birth to
their first child, but it almost equates. Because I don't have any children,
so basketball has given me all the emotions. Every freshman that comes in our
program, or when I was at Temple University, it's almost like birthing them.
They become your child, and you live that, and you're able to shape their
lives on a daily basis and leave part of you in them so they can have the
tools to be successful.  
So I don't know why I shied away from that, but I'm glad that‑‑ and bless his
heart, rest in peace, that Dave O'Brien saw something in me to give me that
opportunity to have these emotional relationships with all of my players.  
  
Q. Dawn, two quick things for you. First of all, congratulations on a
wonderful season. Second of all, talking about transition from being a player
to being a coach, could you compare the satisfaction, Dawn, the fulfillment
you find in coaching to what you found as a player? Is it harder for you as a
coach? Do you feel like you have less control, less ability to influence the
outcome of the game?  
COACH STALEY: It's much harder as a coach. Part of the reason is because you
have to deal with all the trials and tribulations of having a team execute and
perform at a high level, and sometimes you have no control over that. You
could try, but with young people, you have to have a feel for what they're
feeling, and you almost have to figure out what it is. You're constantly
thinking, you're constantly trying to figure out the best way to handle
different situations.  
As a player, you practice, you get excited about the anticipation of playing,
but then you don't have to worry about stuff that comes up. As a coach, you
take all of that every single day, and you never know‑‑ no day is the same. No
day is the same because we have 15 players on our roster that we have to make
sure that they're eating properly, going to study hall, going to class, coming
to practice with a great mindset. Some of them have bad days. Some things just
happen.  
So it's more about just the preparation of getting them to understand, to
prioritize and to manage their time in a way that young people probably don't
want to do, but once they get it, they find out that they're able to do a lot
more with that time once they manage it properly.  
So it's much harder as a coach, but it's more gratifying because you know what
it took to get those players there, and they know, in turn, what you did to
get them there. When I say "Coach," I mean our entire coaching staff because
it takes a village to raise a child and to raise a champion.  
  
Q. Dawn, I just wanted to ask you real quickly, when you took the job, I was
wondering if you had a timetable, a timeframe with what you thought you could
turn this thing around and make this successful? And outside of talented
players, what are two or three key things that have happened that have helped
fuel the success of this program?  
COACH STALEY: I never really put a timetable on things. I think for me and my
outlook on just success, success has a certain feel, it has a certain sound,
and it has a certain look. So when all of those things are in place, you're
going to be successful. But that takes time, but it also is exhausting because
you've got to figure out how you get‑‑ how you move 15 young people to feel,
sound, and look like the success that it should be.  
Then it takes talent. It takes talent. It takes great people, and it takes a
commitment, a commitment of discipline. So once we got those things in place,
our program started to move in the right direction. We didn't always have
that. Seven years ago, we didn't have that.  
But obviously, I feel like I had to learn some things as a coach that I needed
to learn in order for me to grow and for our program to grow in the way that
it's grown.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## April 1, 2015

  

### [Muffet McGraw](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14071)

  
_TAMPA, FLORIDA_  
  
COACH McGRAW: We're thrilled to be going back to our fifth consecutive Final
Four. I think of all of those five, out of all of those five, this team has
improved the most. I think this is the youngest team we've ever taken. Not a
senior in the starting lineup. For them to get it together and just keep
getting better, it's been really fun to watch.  
It's been a great group to work with. They are just relentless, and they never
quit. We've been down in a lot of games, and they just keep stepping up. We've
had so many different people. I think that's also another difference from
year's past. We relied on our All‑Americans in years past, and I feel like
this year everybody that's in the game can contribute.  
  
Q. Talk about some of the comments you made after the game the other night,
it sounded like you were almost a little surprised that this team made it this
far. I know this is a goal every year, but has this team surprised you?  
COACH McGRAW: Yes, it is our goal every year. But when you lose two
first‑round draft picks, three starters and a ton of experience, I don't think
you go into the season thinking this is our National Championship team.  
So we had the goal of getting back to the Final Four, but for us to achieve
that goal, I think we really, really had a lot of work to do, and this team
has definitely surprised me in that.  
  
Q.Do you think this team can go into the Final Four with a little different
attitude? Two years ago there was kind of a we've got to win it for Skylar.
Last year, we have to win it for Michaela and Natalie. This year, you know, I
know you want to win, but there is not the pressure of we've got to do it. Is
there just kind of a looser feel to it?  
COACH McGRAW: I think there is a looser feel. I think we're enjoying it a
little bit more. I think that maybe not having the pressure to try to win it
for somebody and just play our game and have fun, I think maybe that's going
to make us a little bit better and hopefully we'll enjoy it.  
  
Q. How much has Lindsay Allen become more of a scoring option changed the
efficiency or impact of this team?  
COACH McGRAW: Coming into the season, we talked to Lindsay and told her she's
going to have to score a little bit more. Last year she really had to get the
ball off the floor and have a 2 to 1 assist to turnover ratio. That's all we
asked of her. This year she's got to score more and be more vocal, and she's
been able to do that. That's a tough transition for some point guards, like
Lindsay who is a pass first point guard. So coming in with a scorer's
mentality and still trying to run the team and get the ball to other people
really it was a seamless transition for her.  
She's looking to score more and doing more in transition, and she's been
really successful. I think it's helped our offense tremendously.  
  
Q. There are always moments in the year when things can go a different way
and teams start losing and sometimes losing you continue losing. Was there a
moment this year where you thought that the team had reached any kind of
crossroads, and obviously it went the right way? Having not seen you guys in
person this year, and I'm sure there are others on the call who could say the
same thing, but was there either a practice or time in the season where you
felt it could go another way but it didn't?  
COACH McGRAW: Yeah, I thought the DePaul game way back in December. I think we
were down six with a minute to go and somehow won the game, and I think that
coming off the Connecticut loss, I think that was our next game. So for us to
win that game I think gave us so much confidence. I felt we really responded
well to that. Then the loss to Miami, I thought that was a tipping point. We
could have gone either way at that point too. We played about as poorly as we
could possibly play. Worst game of the year. Shot about 25% from the field and
didn't defend, and so many things went wrong in that game. So I think to come
back from that debacle and win out the rest of the year, I think that shows
that we did get a lot tougher.  
  
Q. Two questions for you: First of all, this being a young team as it is,
are you and your coaching staff trying to concentrate on not making it so
difficult for them making the moment more fun? In what ways are you trying to
do that? Then I've got another question for you after that.  
COACH McGRAW: We're definitely trying to have fun. Let them enjoy themselves.
I think they play so much better when they're loose, which is hard for me
because I've got to be a lot more patient and a lot more forgiving for what's
going on the floor at the time. I think we're trying to make it less
complicated. I don't think we're trying to do too many different things, too
many new things. We're trying to do what we've done all year and been
successful with, and hopefully that makes it easier for them.  
  
Q. The second question is you've played UCONN. You've played Maryland. You
know a little bit about them. You haven't played SouthCarolina. In that
regard, do you have to make it ‑‑ do you have to cram to the try to find out
as much as you can, or are you more concerned about having your team ready and
playing its game going into the game against SouthCarolina?   
COACH McGRAW: I think it's a little bit of both. I get immersed in the
scouting reports, and we've certainly done a lot of homework on SouthCarolina,
and there is so much to do that at times we think maybe it's time to step back
and just work on us and try to do what we need to do. So we are trying to
simplify it, but they're such a good team and they have so many strengths that
it's difficult to simplify that scouting report.  
  
Q. If I can just follow that up really quickly. During the course of the
season you didn't plan this, but UCONN played SouthCarolina. Did you take a
little time off from watching your team and preparing for its next team to
watch that game and did you put it on the back burner knowing that you might
run up against SouthCarolina?  
COACH McGRAW: Yeah, we did watch that game and we've tried to watch a few more
during their tournaments throughout the conference tournaments. That's when we
really started watching a lot of different teams to see who we might play.  
  
Q. First you talked about having your girls relax a little bit and sort of
enjoy things. I'm curious, I know you're in preparations and the goal is to
survive and advance for a shot at another title. But I'm curious if you've
allowed yourself to appreciate that three of the four coaches in the Final
Four this year have really strong ties to Philadelphia, and if so, is that
special for you at all?  
COACH McGRAW: It is. We were thinking maybe a cheesesteak for the winner. I
think that it's great. We always thought that so much began in Philadelphia on
the men's and women's side, even in the Big Five way back. To have three of
us, and we all still speak the language, I think we're all pretty much the
same and tell it like it is. I can really appreciate that. Yeah, it is kind of
fun. It's a shame that the Final Four is not in Philly.  
  
Q. Obviously, you're one of the most accomplished coaches in the field
today, but I'm curious about your early days growing up in Philly, and what
athletic accomplishments back then either at Saint Joseph's playing or Saint
Anne playing are you most proud of today?  
COACH McGRAW: Well, my senior year at Saint Joseph's we made it to the
national tournament in of the NAIW, so basically the Sweet Sixteen. The top 16
teams went to Minnesota to play. I think we finished third or fourth in the
country, and that was a great accomplishment because the program had just won
when I was a freshman.  
Fortunately, they didn't even have reel to reel tapes going at that time. I
don't think we kept stats, so I can kind of embellish my accomplishments from
then because they were not much to speak of.  
  
Q. This is SouthCarolina's first Final Four. What do you think your team
knows about this experience? Or what do you speculate that a team knows about
the Final Four experience because they've done it before and somebody that
hasn't doesn't know yet, and how does that play into the game?  
COACH McGRAW: Well, I think it helps to know what to expect, especially with
all of the things that you have to do outside of your own practice and playing
the games. There is so much more. It's very time consuming and it's a little
draining mentally I think sometimes too. But when it's your first one, you're
so excited to be there and do all of it that it's actually sometimes probably
easier for the first timers because everything's different, everything's fun,
everything's new. You really look forward to getting involved in everything
that you have to do.  
  
Q. Coach, do you have any initial thoughts on SouthCarolina and how you
might match up against their size?  
COACH McGRAW: Yeah, I don't think we match up very well. They are so strong in
the post and their depth. You can't even think about getting them into foul
trouble or what if they play with a smaller lineup because they have so many
people they can bring off the bench. Then they've got Tiffany Mitchell who
obviously first team All‑American, one of the best guards in the country, and
they've got big shooters. They have great team speed. They play really hard
defensively and pressure so well.  
Again, they don't have to worry about foul trouble because they have so many
people on the bench. They can really go out and pressure as long as they're in
the game. I think they're a really difficult match‑up for us.  
I think we've obviously played NorthCarolina and Florida State, two of the
teams that they've played. So we have a little bit of a look at how they match
up against teams we're familiar with. But I'm not sure that really helps us in
the scouting report.  
  
Q. A follow ‑up on the previous question about SouthCarolina going to the
Final Four for the first time. When you went for the first time is there an
awe factor that you have to get over to settle down and think about playing
basketball?  
COACH McGRAW: You know, there was. There was for us, but it was so long ago.
Things were so much different then. I think if you just look to five years ago
when we went for the first time in a while, we were just so thrilled about
everything that happened. We loved having the police escort. We thought it was
great having all the interviews with ESPN and just going around town and
seeing all the people. I mean, everything was kind of fun.  
I think now it's a little more businesslike, so I think that's why I think
it's important to have fun and enjoy it. I think they'll really have a great
time.  
  
Q. Following up on that, how do you go about making it more fun? Do you plan
to do anything specifically different?  
COACH McGRAW: I think a lot of it is me. I think a lot of it is I'm pretty
business like. I think my approach will trickle down to them. So I think that
I can make it more fun just by enjoying the moment myself.  
  
Q. On Lindsay Allen, when she switches from being a distributor to being a
scorer, is that something she feels naturally or do you talk to her at a
timeout? How does that come about?  
COACH McGRAW: She's really good at taking what the defense gives her. So I
think for her she's had games where she's had big numbers like she did this
weekend, and she's had games where she doesn't take a lot of shots because we
don't need her too because other people are scoring and we're trying to get to
the phone us. But I think she listens to what our plan is. Are we trying to
work the inside? Are we trying to work the pick‑and‑roll? What are we looking
for? What do we think our strengths will be in this game? So she just attacks
it that way. And then in transition I think she's always looking for what's
available.  
  
Q. So it wasn't necessarily part of the game plan? It was just the way the
game developed?  
COACH McGRAW: Yeah, I think a lot of it is how the game developed.  
  
Q. The second one was on Taya Reimer. How was she different from last year?
She obviously came off the bench in the last game, but how is she a different
player?  
COACH McGRAW: I think she's maybe our most consistent player. I think if you
looked at her stats through the ACC schedule and through the tournament, she's
going to get us 8 to 10 points and 8 to 10 rebounds a game, and we can pretty
much count on that. And I think that consistency is one of the strengths that
she's had. I think she also brings a lot of physical play around the basket in
terms of both offensively and defensively. I think she's really smart. She's
kind of stepped up as a leader in the post as a sophomore helping Kathryn and
Brianna. So she's taken on a little bit of a leadership and mentoring role.  
  
Q. This Final Four is made up of four top seeds only the third time in
tournament history, yet there is still a procession out there that is sort of
UCONN and then the rest of the field. Can you address just the overall
strength of the four teams and is that a little demeaning to the other three
teams that are there?  
COACH McGRAW: I think this is one of the best tournaments that we've had in
terms of parity. I feel like there were so many great games throughout the
tournament. There were upsets. There were great games that the No. 1 seeds
advanced, but we all had games where maybe three of us had games where we were
in a really good game in a rally good battle. I think that's great for TV.
Definitely we're heading in a great direction as the men. We had almost the
same number of upsets on the first day that the men had, maybe even the same
number. Even though the top seeds advance, which is unusual, and only look
twice in the past ten years, but it seems as though there is definitely more
parity and more excitement about the tournament.  
But to have all four teams advance, I think Connecticut has the most
championship, and I think the media does cover them quite well, so everybody
knows where they stand. They have the No. 1 team in the country and the No. 1
overall seed.  
  
Q. Just wonder if you could talk a little bit. You mentioned this being your
fifth consecutive Final Four and how you come with a business-like approach.
How much energy do you spend feeding the beast of those expectations now that
you've really been able to build an elite program and had this kind of
sustained success?  
COACH McGRAW: I don't think a lot. I think we go into the Final Four with an
attitude of we're going to do what we do. We're going to work hard. We have an
attitude that we think we can win. At the end, we have four of the best teams
in the country. We've had some really close games. We've lost some
heartbreakers. We've had some success in the semifinals. But I don't think we
go in thinking we've got to win this one. We're just going in and playing our
game.  
  
Q. As a quick follow up, how about even during when you're out recruiting or
at the beginning of the season, is there any kind of thought process that
you've had? We've been there, and/or is it again, no, not really?  
COACH McGRAW: Obviously, we've done something special. I don't know how many
teams have been to seven Final Fours. I think just a handful that have been
there five times in a row. We are one of the elite programs in the country,
and I think everybody knows that.  
  
Q. But you don't feel pressure or expectations in a good way? It's something
good for us to motivate you and your staff and your team to continue that each
year?  
COACH McGRAW: No, I really don't. I think probably if we were the overall No.
1 seed maybe we'd feel more pressure like we haven't been able to get it done,
but no.  
  
Q. Coach, I wondered if I could go back in time with you. I think it was
your second year at Notre Dame when Dawn Staley came into the college game as
a player. I would imagine you were probably fairly familiar with her as a high
school player in the Philadelphia fill area. I don't believe Notre Dame ever
played Virginia while dawn was there, but I'm sure you probably watched her.
What were your thoughts of her in terms of how she impacted the college game
while she was a player?  
COACH McGRAW: What a great player. Just her determination and the things she
was able to do for that team to be able to take them to three Final Fours I
think she went to. Just changed the game, changed Virginia's program, just
such a competitor. Being from Philly, I really appreciated that, and I loved
watching her play and was so proud of her when she went on to the Olympics
representing Philly and then to get into coaching now I think is just such a
great thing. She is one of the great young coaches in our game.  
  
Q. You obviously have such a great relationship with the South Bend
community and how that relationship with a head coach in a community how that
helps the women's basketball program, and if you were looking at what Dawn's
been building at SouthCarolina and has built, do you see that as one of the
important things in women's basketball for a head coach to have that kind of
connection and community with the community that she's coaching in?  
COACH McGRAW: Yes, I think it's critical to your success. She has done a great
job getting the community involved. You see that reflected in the attendance
figures. She's willing to get out in the community and be visible. I'm sure
her team is doing the same thing. I think you need to. That is part of the
women's game.  
We have a relationship with our fans that is, I think, a little different than
the men's game. We enjoy being out in the community. We enjoy taking part in
different types of community activities and trying to give back a little bit
for what the fans have done for us. And I think the fans feel a connection
with our players and feel like they know them.  
  
Q. You're two years in at Notre Dame at that point, did you have a chance to
actively recruit Dawn at all? Did you have any conversations with her?  
COACH McGRAW: No, we did not. I don't really remember honestly how it all
started or where it was in the process. I'm sure we saw her play. But I really
don't remember.  
  
Q. Muffet, this is your fifth consecutive appearance in the Final Four.
That's something I think only three other programs have accomplished. Those of
us who talked to you let's say five or six or seven years ago, you talked
about getting to a place where Notre Dame is at the Final Four every year, and
they're thought externally as one of the three or top 5 programs in the
country. I know it's hard to answer this, but do you think externally now your
program is where you wanted it to be five or six years ago where there is a
thought that every year Notre Dame, like Connecticut is a true threat to get
to the Final Four?  
COACH McGRAW: Yeah, I think so. I would say I probably wanted that 15 years
ago, and it's finally happening. I think you just learn a lot through this,
through the experiences of it, and for what my staff has been able to do
recruiting‑wise, and the more you get there, the better players want to come
and play on your team. It's a little bit of a chicken and egg. What comes
first? I think we got there and started to get really good players once Skylar
got here.  
I think we're where we want to be, and staying here is hard. I think that
people don't realize how hard it is because we've gotten there five years in a
row. They start to expect it a little bit, but it takes a lot of work to get
here.  
  
Q. I mean, you may not be able to answer this because it's not the easiest
question to answer, but have you found, at least in the last couple of years,
that it's easier or harder to stay at this level versus building the program
to get to the level?  
COACH McGRAW: Well, I would say it's easier to stay here because you kind of
know the recipe a little bit better. I don't know that we haven't won it
again, so that's still a pretty tough challenge. But I do think it's easier
because the team knows what to expect, and they know what we want.  
  
Q. Being a former point guard, do you think that led to you being a coach,
and made an easier transition to you being on the court and being a leader on
the team? Second part of that question is do you see a type of chess match
between you and Dawn both being from a point guard to now being head
coaches?  
COACH McGRAW: I definitely think playing the point helps you and prepares you
for coaching. You have to be the coach on the floor, and you have to know
everything about every position. So I think there are a lot of point guards
that are in coaching, and we're all very competitive.  
I never see any game as kind of a head‑to‑head chess match, which with the
other coach I think it's more about what the team is going to do. It will be
fun, I think, to face off with another point guard.  
  
Q. You've had such great production in the NCAA tournament from the
supporting cast, whether it's been Lindsay or Michaela with the bevy of three
there. At times it seems Jewell pressed. How do you balance having such a star
figure like Jewell balanced with what the supporting cast has been able to
contribute without maybe slowing down her game also?  
COACH McGRAW: I think that having Jewell helps everybody on our team step up.
I think that she is such a great player, and when she is so excited for
Michaela making threes and making passes to Brianna and Taya so they can
score. They feed off of her confidence. I think she's the one that's really
responsible for the way the rest of the team steps up because they feel so
empowered by her and she's not trying to do it all, and she's so happy with
everybody and just with winning. I think they see that attitude and that
really gives them more confidence.  
  
Q. If you could talk a little about Brianna's progress this year? Obviously
the strength aspect is a work in progress, especially as a freshman, but when
you match up with SouthCarolina's size and depth up front, her role there
against the Gamecocks?  
COACH McGRAW: Well, Brianna's our leading rebounder. She's been a leading shot
blocker and does a lot defensively just with her presence inside because of
what she's able to do. But to match‑up with SouthCarolina, they've got a lot
more bulk than I think she does. They're a little bit bigger. I think it's
going to be interesting. They have a little more experience. They have one
freshman I think, but the others have a little more experience.  
She's had such a great year. She's gotten better. She's so coachable. Wants to
learn, wants to get better. She always wants to know what she can do
differently and how she can attack things differently. She watches a lot of
film. I'm so pleased with her progress. She's really overachieved for us this
year, and we're excited about her future.  
  
Q. I just wanted to ask you really quickly. There is a story playing out in
Indiana right now regarding the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, and I know
the NCAA as an organization has come out and expressed some concerns. I was
just wondering what your feelings are on the Bill as well as the fact that the
Women's Final Four will be in Indianapolis next year?  
COACH McGRAW: The University has come out with a statement regarding that. We,
as a Catholic institution, we are a community that welcome and value everyone.
We are against unjust discrimination whenever and wherever it occurs.
Personally, I, of course, agree with that statement.  
But I think we'll have to look and see next year. I think it's something we
need to look into in terms of whether or not to have the Final Four there.  
  
Q. I have an X's and O's question about South Carolina's post size. That is
a team that has both defensively and offensively caused issues for opponents,
just given how big they are up front. When you look at them, how do you want
to attack them up front on both ends specifically?  
COACH McGRAW: I don't want to give you the whole scouting report (laughing).
But we're still practicing with plan C right now. We've eliminated A and B.
We've got a lot of different ideas of what we want to try to do. We've got to
try absolutely everything. And if you saw the beginning of our Baylor game, we
played six different defenses before half time. We're going to throw
everything we can at them and see how the match‑ups look. We are a man‑to‑man
team, and that is our primary defense.  
Offensively we're just going to run our stuff the same as we do every other
game. I don't think we'll do anything different offensively. But defensively
is where we'll really be challenged.  
  
Q. Just one thing you had a pretty rough free ‑throw shooting game, I
believe, against Baylor. Was that just anomaly for that game or did you and
the coaching staff, did you read anything more into that?   
COACH McGRAW: You know, I think it was anomaly for us for the season, really.
We're about a 71%, 72% free‑throw shooting team. We're 100% the game before
against Stanford. I think a couple things played into that. I think, one, that
game to go to the Final Four is a pretty big game. Every shot there is a lot
riding on that, especially down the stretch.  
I think we were probably a little tired. Obviously, Lindsay and Jewell played
a lot of minutes, though they shot it a little bit better. I think a lot of
things played into it, and we're not ready too much into it.  
  
Q. So often the discussion this year has been in terms of Player of the Year
whether it's Jewell Loyd or Brianna, obviously both would be incredibly
worthy. They're both going to be WNBA players. From Jewell's end, have you
ever heard her, and even if it's good natured, think in terms of wanting to be
known as the best player in the country over Brianna or over anybody else? Is
that an important or are Player of the Year honors important to her?  
COACH McGRAW: I think every good player wants to be the best. I don't think
there is any question she would like to be the Player of the Year. I think
she's earned it. Certainly the way she's played, and being the ESPN Player of
the Year I think is a great first step and being First Team All‑American.
These are things that matter.  
When you put the time in and devote that kind of commitment to getting better,
I think you want to be rewarded for that. I think if you said do you want to
win that or win the National Championship, there is no question she'd want to
win the National Championship. But for her, and really for all of us here,
we'd love to see her be Player of the Year.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## April 1, 2015

  

### [Brenda Frese](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15652)

  
_TAMPA, FLORIDA_  
  
COACH FRESE: Obviously it's great to be one of the last four teams standing
and couldn't be more proud of what this team has accomplished up to this date.
If anyone's seen us play, I mean, you can obviously tell it's taken a total
team effort for us to be able to get to this point.  
But I'm really proud of our consistency factor, when you talk about
back‑to‑back Final Fours, for us to be coming to Tampa, so many things that
take place behind the scenes to be able to accomplish such a feat. So we are
really looking forward to getting down to Tampa, and for our preparation in
terms of getting ready for UCONN.  
  
Q. Just from the work you've done and what you've seen, what's the
blueprint, what will it take to beat UCONN?  
COACH FRESE: It's going to take a collective team effort. Obviously in that
Stanford game, they did a tremendous job collectively as a team. But I think
you have to‑‑ you know, defensively, they are a great scoring team, and you've
got to be able to try to take some things away. And then I think you have to
have your own team that's got to be able to keep pace in terms of being able
to score the basketball.  
  
Q. When you go to the Final Four for the first time, is there an awe factor
you have to deal with before you play basketball, and how were you able to
deal with it so effectively in 2006?  
COACH FRESE: No question, I think you're kind of blind‑sided by how many
obligations you haves as a coach and with your team. So there's a lot of
things that kind of take your energy away from preparation in terms of getting
ready.  
I think for us in 2006, one thing we were really fortunate, we were playing
common opponents, when you talk about North Carolina and Duke, so scout
specific. I mean, it was teams that we knew and were already prepared for.  
I think when you have different teams that maybe you've never played before,
it makes it a much harder element.  
  
Q. And when you're going into something like this for the first time, as
opposed to going in multiple times, is the pressure kind of off to a degree?  
COACH FRESE: To a degree. I think it probably matters what your mind‑set is. I
know when we went in, our goal wasn't just to get to a Final Four. I think if
you're happy to make it to a Final Four your mind‑set might be different
versus going in and knowing that you're going to win the whole thing.  
So I think different approaches matter in terms of everything that you have to
balance when you get there.  
  
Q. You guys obviously scored 58 in your win over Tennessee. UCONN in just
about 50 percent shooting from the field, they scored 91 in their win. What
are you going to change about your game offensively or defensively to compete
with such a high ‑scoring offense?   
COACH FRESE: I think we've been fortunate that we have been an up‑tempo type
of team and we have to get back to our transition. The Tennessee game lended
more to a halfcourt, physical defensive style of play, where I think both
Maryland and UCONN really like to get out and like to push the tempo.  
So you've got to be able to score the basketball with Connecticut. You've got
to be able to make your own runs and try to get stops on the defensive end.  
  
Q. You talked about how now coming into the season, you talked about a young
team in your conference; do you think playing against such a legendary program
in UCONN has really solidified your place?  
COACH FRESE: We hope that people are able to see on a national scale now our
consistency factor. I think what this team has been able to accomplish this
season, going undefeated in conference, winning the Big Ten Tournament and now
making it to back‑to‑back Final Fours, I would think there would be a
consistency factor that continues to show up.  
  
Q. You won a national title in 2006. This is your fourth year in, and some
of the other coaches are talking about it being so long until they got to that
point. How did that change your coaching style from then on after winning the
national title and knowing you're one of the youngest to ever do that?  
COACH FRESE: I think first and foremost in leading up to that, it was the
talent pool. We had a rich talent pool in our game when you talk about that
cycle of players that went to a lot of different programs.  
After winning the National Championship, I felt like we were able to recruit
probably a smaller, elite level, pool of players. So I think when you're able
to do that, that allows you to kind of put those pieces together to help gel
to hopefully allow you to be able to have success on a consistent basis.  
  
Q. After the early success, is it what you expected and did it change your
view of where you wanted to go with your coaching career?  
COACH FRESE: I always knew when I took the Maryland job that I felt like it
could be a national power type of program. In my wildest dreams, I didn't
think we would win a National Championship in four years.  
Definitely the timetable was sped up in terms of how it unfolded and how it
took place. We were just really fortunate that we had so many great, elite
players in our backyard and in our region that we were able to be able to sell
our vision to.  
So that piece for us is a huge part in terms of becoming who we are today.  
  
Q. We all know Lexie didn't have the first half ‑‑ (inaudible)‑‑ but then
she ended up scoring 15. How do you get her going or is that just her
independent mind‑set? Did you say anything at halftime to get her going in the
second half?   
COACH FRESE: It's definitely, for Lexie, her confidence level. She needs to
have a big assist or a big shot in terms of, you know, feeling the ball going
through the net.  
So that shot before halftime just kind of helped her settle in I think, settle
down in terms of the stage and the moment and obviously she played with an
extreme level of confidence in the second half.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you and we look forward to having you in Tampa Bay this
weekend.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## April 1, 2015

  

### [Geno Auriemma](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14072)

  
_TAMPA, FLORIDA_  
  
RICK NIXON: Good afternoon, welcome to everybody to today's Women'S Final Four
head coaches media teleconference. For the next several minutes you will have
the opportunity to visit with UConn Head Coach Geno Auriemma. UConn will be
playing in its record 8th straight Women's Final Four in 2015. They will be
playing for an unprecedented 10th National Championship coming up. First game
will be this coming Sunday against Maryland. The second game of the
doubleheader of the National Semifinals with play April 5th here in Tampa Bay.  
With that I'd like to turn it over to Geno for a quick opening statement.  
HEAD COACH GENO AURIEMMA: Thank you, Rick. I appreciate the opportunity.
Obviously anytime you're in the Final Four it's a special time of the year.
Anytime your team gets to play for something as important as the National
Championship, it's the ultimate in a player's college career, I think.  
So we're really fortunate and really happy and excited. It doesn't matter how
many times you find yourself in this situation, the feeling is always the
same.  
The other thing that's the same is the best teams in the country usually find
their way to the Final Four, and that's no different this year. I think the
four best teams in the country are in the Final Four. It should be an
unbelievable weekend of basketball and I'm looking forward to getting down
there and getting started.  
  
Q. Kiah Stokes, what did you learn about Kiah during her four years? For you
what are the satisfactions and frustrations of seeing her progress over the
four years?  
HEAD COACH GENO AURIEMMA: Well, it's been an interesting four years, to say
the least. Very rarely do you get to coach somebody that has more blocked
shots and shot attempts during her four years. That's kind of unusual. But
there's been a lot of games where Kiah has been the difference in the game.
I'm sure that there's a part of her, there's a part of us, that, wow, it could
have been unbelievable had we figured out a way to get even more minutes, more
production.  
But having said that, I don't know that there's a lot of centers in the
country that got a lot more done than she did, that she came into college
with. You look at some of these kids that graduated the same year she did and
you look at what they've done and you look at what she's done, and she's had a
great career. And I think most people look back and they wish I could have
done this, wish I could have done that. But just like in the game against
Texas, and probably in the game against Maryland coming up, she's going to be
a huge part of what we want to do this weekend.  
  
Q. Earlier in the year you were talking about looking for leaders, when did
you find them and who are they?  
HEAD COACH GENO AURIEMMA: Well, you know, sometimes it's easy, you know,
leaders just kind of throw themselves into those leadership positions. And
sometimes they just emerge out of necessity. We had a huge personality on our
team last year in Stefanie Dolson, and we had a four‑year leader in Bria
Hartley, who‑‑ those guys just dominated the team in so many ways.  
So replacing them and stepping into that void was not going to be easy. And in
the beginning everyone just kind of felt like someone else would do it. And as
the season progressed in late November, December, whatever, our juniors kind
of took the reins. Kaleena, I think, came out of her‑‑ she's a real in
introvert.  
So I think that the four starters all in their own way that were here last
year and the year before, we don't have a single leader, one person that we
look to. Right now on the floor Moriah Jefferson has been that. But Stewie has
taken over in her own way, something that is more subtle. And in just looking
at the way our team operates right now I would say those four have equally
shared the load.  
  
Q. Your first eight or nine years when you guys weren't successful in
winning a National Championship, what kind of things did you sell to get
players there to buy into your program, a program that hadn't been very good
before you got there?  
HEAD COACH GENO AURIEMMA: Well, in the beginning it was an opportunity to be a
part of something. The kids‑‑ their other choices weren't necessarily great
choices in terms of they weren't the kind of players that were going to help
you win a National Championship initially. They weren't the kind of players
that were turning down National Championship type programs to come to play at
the University of Connecticut.  
So the kids that we got were the ones that wanted to be on the ground floor of
something, wanted to play a lot. And believed in what we were trying to do. We
didn't have much to offer in terms of facilities or recognition, so it was
Chris Dailey and I going around and trying to sell them on what we wanted to
build.  
We even tried on some official visits to take them to Yale, to take them
around that campus and tell them it was UConn, but I think Chris Dailey shot
it down, but that would have been my way of recruiting players.  
But it took an while and we finally got to the Final Four in 1991. It was only
six years after we got here, five or six years after we got here. And then
things kind of started to open up after that.  
  
Q. I know there's a lot that goes into recruiting, but when did you know
that you could build on what you guys had already put together?  
HEAD COACH GENO AURIEMMA: Well, I thought in '91, we went to the Final Four in
'91, and we didn't have one player coming out of high school that was on the
top 100 on anybody's recruiting list. Those kids reminded me of the team we
just played.  
But in 1995 I think winning that National Championship in 1995, we started
getting kids from outside the northeast, in '96, '97, 98. That's when we
realized that we could get involved with the best players in the country.
People knew who you were. We had created a little bit of a brand. The way the
'95 season unfolded, the mystique around that team, I think it was after that
that we realized that we could be pretty special.  
  
Q. I know you've addressed this in the past, but your program has been so
dominant, especially in the last couple of years, the majority of the game
haven't really been that competitive. I know it's been good for you and the
program. Overall has it been good or bad for the popularity of women's
basketball?  
HEAD COACH GENO AURIEMMA: Has it been good or bad for the popularity? Well, I
would like to think that what we've done over the course of the last ten years
or so has been really good for the popularity of the game.  
I think the attention that comes from being really good and having a certain
standard that we set and a certain level of recognition, I think it has been
good in that sense. I think coaches around the country and their athletic
directors can say, hey, look, look what happened up in a small place like
Storrs, Connecticut, look what they've been able to do, why can't we do the
same thing. South Carolina, wasn't today what South Carolina was ten years
ago. Neither was Notre Dame, before 2000. Just in the last ten years looks
what's happened. So you see Dayton playing in the tournament. You see Gonzaga
playing. You look around and a lot has happened in the last ten years. Is it
good? I think it's good.  
You look at the four teams in men's basketball, a lot of shockers there, huh,
in the Final Four, you know. I think everybody is stunned at the four teams
that are in the Final Four in the men's round. Those guys hardly ever get to
the Final Four.  
So the good teams are going to be good all the time because they have the
culture of winning. And it's up to everybody else to catch up. And I think the
catching up is happening. We're not invincible. We're not unbeatable. I just
think that we've been on an amazing run and it's going to end. Somebody is
going to knock us off; maybe this weekend, who knows? And we'll have to start
all over at some point to build it back up.  
But I hope it's good. All the naysayers are going to say it's bad. And I'm
sure half the people in women's basketball want us to lose, maybe more than
half. And some maybe are just tired of it. Nothing we can do with that, not
one thing we can do about that. My players work just as hard if not harder
than anybody else.  
We're not going down there thinking that we're so good that it doesn't matter.
Any team that's down there this weekend can win the National Championship, we
don't buy into this nonsense that we're the only team that can win this thing
any more than I'm sure the rest of the country thinks Kentucky can't lose in
the Men's Final Four. That's not the case at all. Things happen in the Final
Four that you just don't expect.  
  
Q. Two questions for you, Geno. First off, you lost to Stanford on November
17th. And I wanted to know what stands out for you the most about November
18th, November 19th, November 20th, the days immediately after that loss?  
HEAD COACH GENO AURIEMMA: One of the things that stood out was we didn't
really have the same reaction that I'm used to having when we've lost in the
past. Usually you lose a game and everybody is upset, everybody can't wait to
get back on the court. Everybody is edgy. That didn't happen with this team.
It's almost like they've won so much, some of these kids have won so much and
won two national championships and they've forgotten what losing was like. And
even when they got reminders, oh, that's a fluke.  
So it was up to us as the coaching staff to remind them that, hey, you know,
this isn't last year. And we're not unbeatable. It took a while but we were
not a very mature group, we really didn't know how to respond. And we've grown
up. We've matured a lot since that November weekend, absolutely we've matured
a lot.  
  
Q. Is there something specific to that maturity, growing, or is that just
the course of what happens during a season from November to March?  
HEAD COACH GENO AURIEMMA: I think if you have winners on your team, if you
have people that are competitors, they start to find their level and they
start to‑‑ whenever there's any kind of a void people tend to step in and fill
that void. I don't think there's anything I can put my fingers on, it's just‑‑
we have a lot of players that have never been in that situation before. Moriah
Jefferson never had to run a team. She wasn't responsible for all the things
she's responsible for now. Kaleena Lewis, if we couldn't find her at the end
of games, it didn't matter, because other guys were going to step up. Morgan
Tuck didn't play last year. Kia Nurse was playing in high school in Canada. So
we have a lot of players that are in way different situations than they were
in the past. And it took some time for them to grow into those roles.  
But I think in the Dayton game the other night I think we saw a little bit of
that maturity come out, especially after the devastating circumstances of
being down one at halftime, especially after all that adversity that we had to
endure, the audacity of that team to be up one against us (laughter.) You
should not believe how our people responded to that.  
But I think that was a big help for our guys to understand that's what most
people go through during the season. And we're no different than most people.
We just sometimes make it look like we are, but we're not that much different.  
  
Q. Geno, two questions for you. First, I know you're focused in on the task
at hand but I'm curious if you've allowed yourself to appreciate that three of
the four coaches in this year's Final Four have really strong ties to the
Philadelphia area, and if so is it special at all to you?  
HEAD COACH GENO AURIEMMA: It obviously has not been lost on me. And we're all
connected in certain ways. I was assistant at St. Joe's and when I left Jim
foster hired Muffet to take my place. And obviously I have Dawn on my staff
now with the U.S. National Team.  
There's I think a lot of respect there among the three of us. And I think
we're all proud of where we come from and how we learned the game and the way
we carry ourselves, and what we expect from our teams and the way we view the
game. I think we're all obviously a product of where we grew up. And Dawn from
right inside the city and Muffet and I from the outskirts. But we all have
similar traits. And I think it's evident when you match our teams play. And
I'm really excited. I'm excited for both of them and this is Dawn's first one
as a coach. And I'm really thrilled. I wish I was a bystander and could sit
there and root for all three of us.  
  
Q. My second question is, obviously you're one of the most accomplished
coaches in the game, I'm curious about coming up in the Philadelphia area,
what accomplishments from back then stand out to you, are you most proud of?
Does anything stand out to you?  
HEAD COACH GENO AURIEMMA: Well, it's probably one of the reasons why I had to
leave. I didn't have very many accomplishments when I was down there. I think
one of the accomplishments that I had was I left. Not very many people leave
the Philadelphia area, obviously. It's got such a hold on you when you grow up
there. It's one of the most unique places in America to grow up because you
just feel so compelled to be there and to be a part of it and never leave.  
But I was happy that‑‑ I'm proud to think that I grew up in an era where being
on a really good team was important, that being a great teammate was
important. And I was fortunate to do that, regardless of whether it was the
Kennewick or Montgo or any other an place I've been, to be able to coach and
play and be around great people that valued being on good teams and valued
being a great teammate.  
The most fun I ever had in the Philadelphia area was I got to be in the
batter's box in the American Legion game and play against Jon Matlack, before
I knew who he was, and I didn't strike out. That was the best part of my
growing up in the Philadelphia area.  
  
Q. Where was that?  
HEAD COACH GENO AURIEMMA: We played in a tournament in‑‑ in Westchester. I
think he's from that area. We played in a tournament in Westchester. And we
got in a van and drove down there. I thought I needed a passport to go to
Westchester back then. I think I was 15 or 16 and I'd never been out of the
area. We had a great pitcher, Joe Geisley, who was a great pitcher, we had a
good team and we thought we were hot shit. And we're like, who the hell is
this guy? And then we find out after the fact, the following summer he's
pitching for the Mets.  
  
Q. You know being the star at UConn for now over a decade is something, not
just what the player does on court, but she's a figure nationally, she's a
figure in the community. And everybody kind of develops their own personality,
you know, going all the way back to Rebecca and Sue and Diana, Maya, what's
that been like, that process, for Breanna, and how have you sort of watched
her grow not just for her whole personality?  
HEAD COACH GENO AURIEMMA: Well, I could be mistaken, but I think Breanna had
so much more success at such a younger age than any of the ones you mentioned
that starting 8th and 9th grade and being USA basketball, and I think she's
won more gold medals than anyone her age right now at this stage of their
career, than anyone. I just think she's‑‑ and she's done something in college
that no one's ever done, being MVP of two Final Fours, her freshman and
sophomore year.  
It's been a little different for her. I think the expectations on her were
greater. When my an came here as a freshman, things were a little bit
different for her. When Diana got here as a freshman, she didn't even start.
We had a great team, and Sue, the same thing. And you look back on all those
guys, still they came here under different circumstances, the height of the
whole social media and the expectations. And she's got to be Breanna Stewart
every night. Here's a kid that averages 18 points a game, and a dozen rebounds
and four assists and three blocks or whatever the numbers are. And everybody
goes, ah, she didn't have a great year. The expectations for anybody else that
would do anything resembling what Stewie did, would be looked upon as God's
gift to basketball. But it's been different for her. It's really, really been
different for her. And she doesn't really have that edge that Dee had. Nobody
has that. But that some of the great ones have had, the way they carried
themselves. She's much more laid back, and much more easy going. And that edge
comes out at the NCAA women's time. But her four‑year‑‑ three, almost‑‑ has
been quite different than all those other players. But no less impactful,
that's for sure.  
  
Q. If I can ask you a completely different question, back in '91, and I
realize this is going a ways back, you played Dawn's Virginia team, Dawn
Staley, when she was at point guard or guard at Virginia. I just wonder what
your thoughts were going into that semifinal in terms of facing her back in
'91 and I guess how you rated her as a college player then. Was she somebody
that you expected would go on to the coaching ranks based on how she played?  
HEAD COACH GENO AURIEMMA: You know, going into that Final Four I thought we
had a really, really good team. I thought that we were the most difficult team
to play against in the country because of the way we played, what we took
advantage of and all five of our starters, we played without a center, and all
the teams that we were going to play, they relied a lot on their inside game
and we didn't.  
When we were getting ready to play Virginia, we thought they would have a
difficult match‑up with us, and we thought we would have a difficult match‑up,
we knew we couldn't guard them, but we also knew they couldn't guard us,
either.  
But then we go down there, and we kind of got caught up in the festivities of
the Final Four and not really preparing for the game as well as we would have
liked, looking back.  
But obviously Virginia was the star studded team, Dawn was a national figure
and so were the Burge twins, and Tanya Cardoza, and they just had a lot of
great, great players. And they maybe had the best team in the country that
year. But it was a four‑point game with a minute to go and they had the best
starter guards in the country. They did. And we went toe‑to‑toe with them.  
And obviously Dawn went on to be a great player in the Olympics and a great
player in the WNBA. You just never know if those guys want to be coaches. When
you're that good as a player, you have so many doors open to you that you just
don't know whether they think that coaching is in their future. But obviously
she's taken everything she's learned and become a hell of a coach. I'm not
surprised that she's there this weekend.  
  
Q. Jeff Walz, Louisville, said recently, when he sat in on one of your
practices he was kind of amazed by just how much the kids policed themselves
and demanded of themselves. Ideally is that the way it is at this point in the
season at Connecticut, where your kids are studying the ball by yourself and
there's not a lot of needling or yelling required?  
HEAD COACH GENO AURIEMMA: I think it depends on the group that you have, but,
you know, we have‑‑ hopefully we have some upperclassmen who understand if you
do these things and if you do it this way good things will happen. We have a
culture of that here that we created. And it took some time. But by the time
you get to be a junior and a senior at Connecticut, there isn't much I can say
to you that I haven't said a thousand times. There's not much more I can do to
motivate you. It's got to come from inside you. I'm not out there on the
court. I'm not in the middle of every play, of every scenario, I'm not in the
locker room when you guys are there. I'm not in the back of the bus. I'm not
in the hotels when you guys are there together.  
So there's got to be a sense from the upperclassmen of this is what we do at
Connecticut, this is how we do it, and it's going to be done like this all the
time.  
If I still have to do that when a kid is a senior or junior, there's a pretty
good chance they're not going to play a big role in that program. The practice
where Jeff was at we had‑‑ I think was one of the best teams we've ever had,
and we had all great upperclassmen, and some teams just lend themselves to
that. Other teams, you've got to stay on them all the time. Like this
particular team right now, you've got to be really careful with this team.
You're too hard on them, they're, why are you doing that. If you go easy on
them and go, okay, guys, it's on you. Like, hey, you know, a birthday party.  
So this team you've got to zig and zag a little bit with, and so far we've
guessed right. I hope we can keep guessing right.  
  
Q. I think many people would consider this year's Player of the Year, if you
want to call it a race or whatever you want to call it between Jewell Loyd of
Notre Dame and Breanna. And I for Breanna's purposes, are things like that
important to her, even if she's not as edgy or Diana and some of the other
players that you've had, how much does she look at that kind of individual
stuff in terms of letting it be known externally that she's the best player in
college basketball?  
HEAD COACH GENO AURIEMMA: I think it's really important to her, I really do. I
think it's important to Jewell Loyd. I think kids that have the opportunity to
be the National Player of the Year, I think it's important to them. If they
say, it doesn't matter, I just want my team to win. That's not true. They want
their team to win and they want to be National Player of the Year. That to me
is what great competitors do. And I think if somebody said to me, Jewell, that
kid is really good. And she's really, really good.  
And Stewie is the same way, I think she wants to be the National Player of the
Year. She wants everybody to think she's the best player in the country. I
don't think she would sacrifice for that winning, and I don't think Jewell
Loyd, either.  
But I say to the kids, when people vote on awards, you've got to take had that
with a grain of salt. You don't know why somebody is voting against you. You
don't know why somebody is voting for you. We talk about that all the time.
When people are voting, and when people vote they have biases. If my coaching
staff voted we'd vote for Breanna. And if Notre Dame's coaching staff voted,
they would vote for Jewell and they'd both be right.  
  
Q. One more on Breanna. Because she has an opportunity to be around some of
the best players in the world, I should say the best players in the world,
forgetting about play on the court, did you notice that she picked up anything
mentally in terms of attitude after having been around and practicing with
players who really are at the highest level of being competitive, that it's
not just women's basketball, but in sports?  
HEAD COACH GENO AURIEMMA: I think a little. I think she was too young to
understand really what was going on. I think she was just caught in the
moment. Like, hey, I'm on a national team and I just finished my sophomore
year in college, I must be really good, I must be really cool. And I kept
trying to tell her, no, you're not. You're not anything like these guys. And I
want you to pay attention to the guys that prepare a certain way. I don't want
you to pay attention to all these guys, because not all of them prepare the
same way. I want you to pay attention, who prepares the best? Who gets ready?
Who's there every day? Who comes to work everyday the same way? Who can you
count on? I want you to pay attention to that, not pay attention to I'm with
the pros. I'm with the best players in the world, all that, because every time
she steps on the floor she got her ass beat. And that was good.  
But, you know, when you're as young as Stewie was, when that happens to you,
sometimes that knocks you for a loop, because all of a sudden you realize,
man, I'm not nearly as good as I thought I was.  
So I think it was good for Stewie to be in that environment. And I also think
maybe not so good. So when we got back, we had some work to do. She struggled
a little bit. And obviously she's where we want her to be right now. But I
think you've got to be careful when you put young kids in the middle of all
those great pros. It can work both ways, and I think in this case it was a
little bit of both. It helped her a little bit and it hurt her little bit.  
  
Q. (Inaudible.) How difficult is it been to bring in players like Stewart,
there is has to be the right type of personality to be able to play together
for four years?  
HEAD COACH GENO AURIEMMA: Yeah, we're not perfect. We don't hit a home run on
every recruiting trip. We bring kids in here and sometimes it just doesn't
work out. We're not that different than any other school. People say,
Connecticut, kid transferred from Connecticut, yeah, kids transfer from every
school, you know why, because coaches make mistakes, and kids make mistakes.
So you try really, really hard to not‑‑ in the case of Sue, Asjha Swin,
Tamika, we had a home run there, we had a Grand Slam there. Four great
personalities, four great teammates and three Olympian.  
With this three that we've got new Stewie, Tuck and Moriah, same thing, three
great kids, great personalities, great teammates, phenomenon on natural
players, who don't step on each others toes, who respect each other. And are
willing to share and sacrifice some things for the bigger good. And not
everybody wants to do that. And the roll of the dice, you take the chance, and
you hope it works. And with these three it certainly did.  
  
Q. I was just wondering your thoughts on the new RFRA law in Indiana,
especially with the Final Four set to be there next year?  
HEAD COACH GENO AURIEMMA: You know, I'm not completely familiar with the fine
print on what it is exactly that they're trying to do. And I heard this
morning on the news that somebody is backtracking on what it means and what it
doesn't mean and how to rewrite it and how to make it so that everybody
understands it better, and what you can do and what you can't do.  
And I'm probably not the best person to ask. I'm a basketball coach. I get to
coach a lot of different types of people, different backgrounds, different
raises, different religions, different orientations, whatever it is, and to me
that's personal. And I try to stay out of their personal life unless they want
me in it.  
But I've got to tell you, I've always been fascinated by people who care so
much about what other people are and what they do in their personal lives.
Like how small minded do you have to be to care that much about what other
people are doing? Life is hard enough as it is, trying to live your own life.
What do you care what other people are doing, as long as it doesn't affect
you. And if it's true, and hiding behind this religious crap, that's the most
cowardly thing I've ever heard it.  
So I don't know all the details but what I've heard and what people have told
me, it's just‑‑ it's 2015. I'm sure those people are nice people out there.
I'm sure they don't want the Final Four to be canceled. I'm sure they don't
want all this bad publicity that they're getting. Nobody wants that.  
So some on, some to your senses, here. Just go on with your life and let
everybody else go on with theirs. That's my approach with my team and I don't
understand anybody who's got a different approach.  
  
Q. You've read a lot about the state of the men's college game this year,
that the game is not as fluid, efficient, exciting, well played as it has been
in years past. There's many reasons people would surmise that from more
freshman, sophomores playing than juniors and seniors. I know you are
obviously an authority on the women's game and your team. But you're a
basketball coach and a basketball fan, so you see a lot of men's college
basketball. What has been your thought about where you see the state of the
men's game is right now?  
HEAD COACH GENO AURIEMMA: It's funny, you asked me that, I just had a
conversation with Phil Martelli yesterday and I think he's the president on
the ABC board of directors or whatever.  
And we had this conversation and we talked a lot about where the game is and
what the future of the game is. And obviously it's immensely popular. You look
at the interest paid on the NCAA tournament. I don't know that it's as
immensely popular during the regular season as it used to be, but obviously
the tournament is just at another world when it comes to that.  
Having said that, I think the game is a joke. It really is. I don't coach it.
I don't play it, so I don't understand all the ins and outs of it. But as a
spectator, forget that I'm a coach, as a spectator, watching it, it's a joke.
There's only like ten teams, you know, out of 25, that actually play the kind
of game of basketball that you'd like to watch. Every coach will tell you that
there's 90 million reasons for it.  
And the bottom line is that nobody can score, and they'll tell you it's
because of great defense, great scouting, a lot of team work, nonsense,
nonsense. College men's basketball is so far behind the times it's
unbelievable. I mean women's basketball is behind the times. Men's basketball
is even further behind the times. Every other major sport in the world has
taken steps to help people be better on the offensive end of the floor.
They've moved in the fences in baseball, they lowered the mound. They made the
strike zone so you need a straw to put through it. And in the NFL you touch a
guy it's a penalty. You hit the quarterback, you're out for life. You know, in
the NBA, you touch somebody in the perimeter, you whack guys like they used to
do when scores were 90 to 75, they changed the rules.  
This is entertainment we're talking about. People have to decide, do I want to
play 25 bucks, 30 bucks to go see a college scrum where everybody misses six
out of every ten shots they take, or do I want to go to a movie? We're
fighting for the entertainment dollar, here, and I have to tell you it's not
entertainment from a fan's standpoint.  
So that's just‑‑ I'm talking as a fan, not as Geno, Auriemma, the basketball
coach.  
RICK NIXON: Thanks to everybody for being on the call with us. Geno, good luck
to you and we'll see you this weekend in Tampa.  
HEAD COACH GENO AURIEMMA: Thank you.  
RICK NIXON: Thanks toll all.

_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

South Carolina  80  
Florida State - 74

  
COACH STALEY: I'd like to just say Florida State really gave us a tough match.
They were there to the very end. They were opponents in which we felt like
matched up pretty well against us and they took us to the wire. Fortunately
for us, we got players like Tiffany Mitchell and Alaina Coates that made plays
for us down the stretch and got us this incredible win.  
  
Q. What was that moment like when the final buzzer sounded what was going
through your head?  
TIFFANY MITCHELL: Just full of excitement pretty much. It's just great to
finally take this program to a Final Four. It's really fun to be able to enjoy
this moment with our team.  
ALAINA COATES: I couldn't really think. I was just running back trying to find
somebody to pick up. Just a lot of excitement and just really glad we were
able to come up with the win.  
  
Q. Tiffany, again, especially after yesterday, you kind of took over late.
Is that something you felt you had to do? Did Dawn tell you to take the
ball?  
TIFFANY MITCHELL: I just think me and Coach Staley have a nonverbal
communication. I just look at her and she looks at me and I'm just like, all
right, it's time. That's kind of what happened. Just made plays for my team
when I needed to.  
  
Q. Alaina, you were named the Most Outstanding Player of the Greensboro
Regional. Do you feel like you're playing the best basketball of your college
career over the course of these past few tweaks?  
ALAINA COATES: I feel like I'm playing better basketball. There's always room
for improvement. I know during the regular season it didn't turn out as great
for me as I wanted it to, so I just want to be able to do more for my team and
for myself coming into the postseason.  
  
Q. There were a couple of older players out on the floor, Courtney Newton
and Markeshia Grant, how much did it mean to you to help see the players that
helped build this be here for this moment and for you to give that to them?  
TIFFANY MITCHELL: It means a lot that they still support us even though they
have graduated years before. It just means a lot how they come back and cheer
us on even though they graduated.  
  
Q. Big three ‑pointer with about a minute left. You had only made one to
that point; any hesitation that that was the shot at that time? Take us
through it.   
TIFFANY MITCHELL: I mean, we just ran the same play pretty much three times in
a row. And I knew the first two times I went to the basket, they were playing
off me, and I just had enough space and I shot it.  
  
Q. You talked about finally making it. What do you think has tipped it to
get you to the Final Four for the first time after last year, not getting
there? Is it experience? Is it new players? What's the difference?  
TIFFANY MITCHELL: Yeah, I think it's a little bit of both. We have enough
experience on this team and just to mix in some of our youth, I think that
helps us just because we are so deep. I think last year, we didn't have enough
to get us over that Sweet16 hump and this year, I think we are so much deeper.
That's what helped us in these past few games.  
  
Q. For either of you, when things weren't going your way, was there a moment
where you felt the momentum change?  
TIFFANY MITCHELL: I just knew we were always in the game. We've played behind
plenty of times, so we never doubted for a second that we were going to lose
this game, and that's the mentality you need playing against such a great team
in Florida State.  
  
Q. You've played in two straight down ‑to‑the‑wire games. What is it about
your team, this team this year, that you're able to kind of stay poised and
end up coming out on the winning end?   
TIFFANY MITCHELL: For me or Alaina? Both of us? Can you repeat the question?  
  
Q. What is it about this year's team that you can come out on top?  
TIFFANY MITCHELL: Ahhh‑‑  
COACH STALEY: Welcome to my world (laughter).  
TIFFANY MITCHELL: Like I said, we just had enough‑‑ we knew we had enough this
whole tournament. I think our bench is a lot better than Florida State's and
it showed today.  
ALAINA COATES: Just to piggyback off what she said, yeah, we all just knew
that once we hit the floor, that we had to go out there and make an impact.  
  
Q. Alaina, you said the regular season maybe didn't go as well as you wanted
it to. What does it mean to you person will I to win most outstanding
player?  
ALAINA COATES: It just means a lot knowing that my hard work paid off; knowing
that I was able to go out there and contribute to what my team was doing in a
big way like that. It means a lot.  
  
Q. Tiffany and Alaina, wanted to hear from both of you about the fans. I
think there were more fans here today than yesterday, and I don't know how
much you hear them on the court. I know they were loud the other day, but what
did it mean to both of you individually?  
TIFFANY MITCHELL: It just means a lot just knowing that our fans will travel
and support us anywhere we're at. They definitely created home‑court advantage
for us and it seemed like a regular home game. It was really loud. It was
probably louder than Colonial, than it usually is as Colonial. I think it
played a huge part on our comeback when we were losing and us getting over
that hump and finally taking that lead.  
ALAINA COATES: Just kind of piggybacking, our fans play a big role in what we
do. We feed off their energy. They pick us up when we're down. They keep us up
when we're ahead. They are the ones that they support us no matter what. They
will follow us pretty much anywhere. It's a great feeling, we just go out and
do what we do for them.  
  
Q. For both of you, throughout this tournament, have you looked at some of
the other teams that you can potentially play, Notre Dame or Baylor on Sunday,
and UCONN is in the other bracket. Have you started to look at potential
opponents?  
ALAINA COATES: I mean, the games, we watched them but we were too focused on
handling what we needed to handle in Greensboro first.  
TIFFANY MITCHELL: Pretty much just taking it one day at a time. We are looking
at our next opponent. We are not looking too far ahead. Like today we were
focused on FSU, and now we are going to be focused on whoever wins out of
Baylor and Notre Dame.  
  
Q. Alaina, what's it like when you're up on the ladder cutting down that
net? Is that a surreal moment?  
ALAINA COATES: Yeah, it feels good. I remember last night watching Kentucky's
men do it and thinking that could be us tomorrow, tomorrow afternoon. To
actually be in this moment and experience this means a lot.  
TIFFANY MITCHELL: Just how the game went and just having to fight and get down
to the final buzzer and things like that, just knowing that we had to fight
really hard and we came up with a win; it just made it a really great feeling.  
  
Q. Either player or both, looking ahead, not so much who you're playing, but
if you look back to your game against Connecticut, did you learn something in
that sort of environment that's going to help you in Tampa, and how do you
stay poised when you're the new guys on the block down there? All the other
teams are going to have a lot more experience in this environment than you.  
TIFFANY MITCHELL: I think that's going to play into our advantage being that
we are the new kids on the block in the Final Four. I think that puts more
pressure on them. We are just going out there and we are playing, so I think
that puts more pressure to say you've been there already. Just go out there
with a level head and compete.  
I think the Connecticut game did help us because there's another level of
basketball out there and we are starting to realize that, and we are playing
pretty about basketball right now.  
  
Q. What was going through your mind when that final buzzer sounded?  
COACH STALEY: I wanted it over, as quickly as possible. I just wanted to
embrace our coaches because they have worked so hard. This is something that
we have wanted to do as a staff for a very long time, probably long before we
got to South Carolina. And to be able to enjoy this moment with them, it's
pretty special. They work hard. They put us in a position to achieve this type
of success, and we wanted to just enjoy the moment.  
  
Q. Seven years ago, you win ten games; did you think that this would be
possible? Did you still have this goal in mind?  
COACH STALEY: The goal is always in mind, whether or not we have the pieces in
place to accomplish those goals are a different story. I think with each year,
you gain a little confidence because we play in the best conference in the
country, and our conference prepares us for games like this where they go down
to the wire, where they are physical and where you're able to maneuver and try
to out‑fox whatever our opponents will give us.  
But it's always been in mind. It's just we've got some pieces that will allow
us to compete at this level and go into the Final Four and have a legitimate
shot at winning.  
  
Q. A few weeks ago it seemed like Bianca was maybe struggling a little bit
with confidence; how did she overcome that to have her biggest?  
COACH STALEY: Bianca is a competitor: Whether she is flying around the court,
whether she's having great games or not‑so‑great games, she's a competitor.
You want in those situations‑‑ I felt like we would have an advantage with her
on the floor, just her quickness, her ability to put Florida State back on
their heels. You know, that's why we went with her pretty early.  
In the second half when it was getting down to the wire, we felt like we
wanted our experience down there. But she doesn't lack confidence, at all, no
matter what situation she's in, and I think she's at a point where she's
understanding the process a little bit better. She's aware of her surroundings
and what she needs to work on to improve.  
But still, even if she doesn't play a minute; if she plays 12 minutes, you
know she's always going to be a threat on the floor.  
  
Q. You called Tiffany Mitchell Superwoman on Friday, and with the game tied
67 ‑67 she scored the next seven points. Was there any doubt in your mind that
she would be the player to step it up down the stretch?  
COACH STALEY: Well, I had no doubt. We are probably‑‑ this is a monumental win
for us; we'll probably rename that play because we ran it a few times down the
stretch. We ran it on Friday night. We'll rename that Mitch in on honor of
her, because she hit big buckets for her. I had no doubt, no doubt where the
ball was going, even though Alaina Coates was having a pretty good second
half. But Tiffany Mitchell is the person we want the ball in her hands when we
need a basket.  
  
Q. What was the name of that play beforehand?  
COACH STALEY: We got more games to play (laughter).  
  
Q. Are you able to let this sink in? You've been through is this as a
player. Is it all relatable?  
COACH STALEY: It's much different as a coach than a player. Because as a
coach, you reflect on all the former players; you reflect on all the bad
seasons; you reflect on the good seasons; you reflect on what basketball
really means to you. And for me, it's all I had. It's been my passion, my
livelihood and I think as a coaching staff, we came to South Carolina because
we felt like we can get here at South Carolina with the conference, just when
we got to South Carolina, the players that were local. And with the coaching
staff that, you know, has coached or played at the very highest level.  
So it's a great moment because it is shared by so many people across so many
teams. I think back to my coaching at Temple University, this is the dream
that we sold them on; come to Temple and you'll win a National Championship.  
Now it's come to South Carolina; you'll win a National Championship. You'll go
to Final Fours. It makes it all make sense. Now we have some credibility to
what we're saying and what we're selling, our program, our university.  
  
Q. I've heard some people say this was a statement game. What was the
statement your team made tonight and what factor was the fans?  
COACH STALEY: This game is always a tough hurdle, because it's coming down to
the wire, you're playing against some of the country's best opponents, and you
know, you don't know a whole lot about them. You try to crunch up a whole
season in two nights of work, getting a scouting report together.  
It is; it puts South Carolina on the map. Now I think the regular season that
we had, the success that we've had in our conference; but when you hurdle over
being a regional champion and going to the Final Four, it puts your name in
history.  
So it's a history‑making game for us, but‑‑ and I said this before. Any
National Championship team, any champion in any sport, they have fans. They
have people who come watch them play and cheer them on and they find a way to
create a home‑court advantage no matter where they are, and our fans have done
that for us all season long.  
It does my heart good to know that when you walk out there, all the chants you
hear is Gamecocks, and it's a beautiful thing. Really, I couldn't write a
better script for our season, for the community, and how they embraced our
basketball team. It's a beautiful thing that I'll always cherish, especially
being in the State of South Carolina.  
  
Q. Is there a step that you have to take from being a great team to being a
champion team? If so, is this team ready to take that step down in Tampa, or
do you not know yet?  
COACH STALEY: Well, I'll tell you this: We are not just going to show up and
just be happy to be there. This particular regional final game isn't the
destination game for what we set out to do this season.  
So, you know, I think this was a statement game because we are going to ‑‑ we
punched our ticket into the Final Four, and now it's time to maybe check off
some things that we've wanted to do, which is win the National Championship.  
How we get over that is we show up on Sunday‑‑ I don't know, Sunday night or
Sunday afternoon, ready to play whoever wins the Notre Dame and Baylor game.  
  
Q. What were your thoughts on your team's performance for about the first 15
minutes of the first half and how were you able to overcome the early
turnovers and miscues?  
COACH STALEY: For us, I think we have taken opponents's punch in the first ten
to 15 minutes of probably each game that we've played. So it was no different.
I think sometimes our players, they want to make an impact. They want to make
an impact so bad that sometimes it's not the right decision.  
We just wanted our players poised and calm and not get ahead of the game. Just
take each possession as it is and try to figure out what's the best shot to
take out there, what's the best defensive assignment to execute.  
But I just felt we were in a good place, even though we were down. It was
familiar territory, so we didn't panic. We just had to let the game settle in.  
  
Q. Speaking of stepping up in the moment, Alaina Coates, talk about her
performance on the week end.  
COACH STALEY: She was fantastic. Alaina, you know, just it clicked for her. It
clicked for her in postseason play where I think she just realized how
talented she is, and when she puts her mind to doing something, it works for
her. I think there wasn't any doubt that she could be the best player on the
floor when she puts her mind to it. And she definitely was a key component of
us getting to this point.  
  
Q. Tiffany Mitchell played every minute, 21 points, six rebounds, five
assists. What's it like for you to watch her?  
COACH STALEY: It's become pretty common. We're going to go to Tiffany Mitchell
for as long as she can run up and down the floor. She is a well‑conditioned
athlete. She could probably play another game and have the same type of
performance.  
It was really hard for us to take her off the floor for what she means to us
on both sides of the ball. She defended like no other. She chased Conwright
around all night long, and then when it was time, when the game was on the
line and we put her on Romero, and I thought that was probably a great call.
And I think Coach Boyer thought that was a pretty good matchup down the
stretch and I think it was a difference maker.  
  
Q. A week ago, Alaina said she thought she simmered down her sophomore
compared to her freshman year. Do you think she's being a little harsh on
herself with that statement?  
COACH STALEY: Not at all. I think what we have to understand, as freshmen,
especially being a student athlete, it is the biggest transition of your life:
Socially things change; academically things change; athletically things
change.  
When you take her out of her normal environment, these things are crashing
together at once and then we're asking her to perform on a nightly basis to
help us win a National Championship with all the other things that she has to
deal with, it's hard.  
And things, as you get older, your sophomore year, things just start clearing
up for you. You have your junior year, senior year. It should be just putting
on an old shoe and you should be helping other people deal with that. So
things are clearing up for her from a basketball standpoint, and you're seeing
the benefits of her seeing it a little bit differently.

_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

South Carolina  80  
Florida State - 74

  
COACH SEMRAU: What a great basketball game. It's hard to lead for 28 minutes
and trail for three and lose it. Credit South Carolina and their toughness.
Tiffany Mitchell, I felt like we did a good job with their post kids and I
thought Tiffany found her shots and made some big plays down the stretch.  
Did what we needed to do: We out‑rebounded them. I felt like getting ten more
shots, out‑rebounding them, you know, it was difficult to play without our
kids on the floor, and that was the difference. We didn't play without
fouling, and really, I felt like that was the biggest difference in the game.  
So for our kids to battle the way they did with a crowd like this, wish we had
been in Jacksonville or Tampa, but certainly you have to credit South Carolina
and their play all year long and their crowd here today I thought was
fantastic.  
  
Q. How hard is it to settle into any kind of rhythm when you're constantly
going in and out due to foul trouble?  
BRITTANY BROWN: I don't know, it was really hard, feeling that you wanted to
be out there with your teammates and make a difference, but I thought we did
fine, even though we were in foul trouble because we have a deep bench and
everybody was producing on our team regardless of who was in foul trouble or
not. You miss those people being out on the floor but I think our team did
what we need to do.  
  
Q. Have you guys faced a crowd ‑‑ have you been in an environment like that
this year where the crowd was so loud and so large?   
ADUT BULGAK: Yes, we have, every single home game in Tallahassee. We were out
there ‑‑ it was a garnet crowd, and the only thing was they was confused which
team they were cheering for (laughter).  
  
Q. I think you went one basket over eight minutes or thereabouts in the
second half and it was just getting tough to get a shot to knock one in. What
was South Carolina doing or you guys not doing on offense that kind of made
things grind to a halt on offense?  
ADUT BULGAK: I think they did a great job of defending us and knowing their
personnel. But you can't base your next shot on what happened on the last
shot. So we just had to keep pushing through and eventually a basket would
fall, and it did.  
  
Q. At the end of the game, the one sequence where you played defense, South
Carolina was only up by two and seemed to miss the rebound. Can you talk about
that sequence and how pivotal that was at the end of the game?  
ADUT BULGAK: That was probably the worse moment of my life, like just the ball
was right there at the tip of my fingers and I should have got it. I mean,
especially‑‑ proud of our game on rebounds, but like I said, the previous play
can't‑‑ that play can't be determined by the previous play. We brought the
ball back down and we ended up hitting a big shot. Just got to carry on.  
  
Q. I know it's going to take some time to be able to reflect but when you're
able to hang with a team that was No.1 in the country for as long as you did,
are you able to at least take some sense of accomplishment in that and what
you guys were able to accomplish to get to this point?  
BRITTANY BROWN: I'm really proud of how our team did this year. Of course we
fell short of our goals but we made history, and it was just fun. It's one of
my favorite years playing basketball besides high school. I love these girls,
I love the coaching staff, from GA's to scout ‑‑ scout boys. I will just say,
I will remember this forever. It was a great moment.  
  
Q. Just going back to the foul trouble, how did that affect what you were
trying to do, your bench play, everything, how did the fouls really impact
this game?  
COACH SEMRAU: I couldn't figure it out, honestly, Jordan. We just played a
game where neither team went into the bonus until ten minutes in the game two
days ago. I was just stunned. I think our kids were stunned.  
When you're playing‑‑ it was so tough playing without Maegan. When she plays
30‑plus minutes a game and she played six the first half, gets her fourth
quickly, third and fourth; I know I'm rambling‑‑ I can't quantify it. I just
want to credit the other kids. I mean, to be in the foul trouble we were with
her and Adut; Adut played seven minutes in the first half; and to have this
kind of game, I'm proud of them. I just wish‑‑ I wish we had had that rhythm
that we didn't have.  
  
Q. The last time you were in the Elite 8, you faced a juggernaut and it
wasn't pretty, wasn't a great game for you guys. Does this show what this
program that you were a minute way from going to the Final Four against a very
good team?  
COACH SEMRAU: Yeah, no question. I mean, the calibre of players, just they
want to be great, and they were great in a lot of ways this year.  
I think to play that many minutes leading, what you mentioned was the No.1
team in the country at one point, they weren't afraid. They had so much
courage. They stepped into, you know, a packed house, I think it was one time
we played like this and that was at Notre Dame and they played great. I don't
think it matters whether this team was on the road or at home. They just
battle and I'm proud of them for that.  
  
Q. Your thoughts on Leticia's effort tonight, seemed like she was battling
through and the hand was affecting her.  
COACH SEMRAU: Yeah, I think it did. And Maegan gives her a lot of relief, and
I felt like without Maegan on the floor, we didn't have somebody else that's
real comfortable handling the ball in that situation. I mean, Kena did a great
job when she was in. I didn't feel like I could play them together for
defensive reasons. But yeah, she's a warrior. She's a battler.  
I think the most important thing for us is understanding when we lose two
players, we have to use this momentum, especially back in Tallahassee to build
a fan base like South Carolina has. That's certainly something that's
extremely important in women's basketball that happens and I hope that the
City of Tallahassee will jump on this bandwagon and bring something special
next season to Florida State.  
  
Q. You had mentioned on the first day you were here, you guys have a
different go ‑to player every game and you didn't know who it was. Tonight you
had a lot of players that statistically were kind of balanced but you just
didn't seem to find the one.   
COACH SEMRAU: Yeah.  
  
Q. Was that somewhat not being in rhythm? Was it a matter of nobody quite
could step up and make a shot or two and take charge?  
COACH SEMRAU: Yeah, I think that's what it was. I felt like‑‑ and again, it
was just so difficult to substitute, and thinking about, I hated going
offense, defense that early with Maegan that early in the second half; that I
kept thinking the game could go to overtime. And we had two kids foul out, and
that's ‑‑ we don't have kids foul out. I just was trying to protect that, keep
it close, and I think that hurt in some ways that she couldn't play the whole
time.  
  
Q. Can you appreciate now how good a basketball game that was and the fact
that I think at one point they had 15 or 16 shots in the first half
trailing?  
COACH SEMRAU: Yeah, unbelievable, low turnovers by both teams, high assists.
Just the way that we battled and rebounded the ball against a team that is an
excellent rebounding team; I think they are tenth in the country. No, that was
a fantastic basketball game. I think it was good for women's basketball. The
crowd was fantastic, and we're moving forward.  
  
Q. Yesterday we talked about them in the post and how good they are and
obviously tonight with their points in the paint, is it what you expected, or
what was going on down there?  
COACH SEMRAU: Yeah, it was what I expected and I thought our post did a
tremendous job. They knew the scout very quickly. They adjusted. I mean, it's
a war to try to get around, stay in front, guards get to help side, make sure
you get back out to shooters; in every way, they adjusted. Welch wanted to go
left and they didn't let her go left. I thought we had a tremendous game plan
and almost pulled it off.  
Thanks so much. Thanks to the City of Greensboro for making this an excellent
event.

_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  
Q. Asia, it seemed like you might be hesitant to shoot from outside last
night, were you trying to space out those possessions or did you just want to
get a cleaner look?  
ASIA DOZIER: Our initial game plan was to go inside because that's what we've
been doing all season and that's what's been successful for us.  
Coach always says if you have an open shot early in the shot clock more than
likely you'll have that same shot under ten. That's when the shots are
expected and that's when we had the best rebounding positions. So I just wait
patiently and it usually works out for the best.  
  
Q. Aleighsa and Tiffany, you have worked so hard to go to the Sweet16 and
now that you're finally here, how do you balance the excitement of being in
this point and with the focus of having to win one more game?  
ALEIGHSA WELCH: I think you have to maintain your focus because this isn't the
point in our season that we want to be and as far as to say, okay, we got over
the Sweet16 hump, we're satisfied. We still have bigger and better goals for
ourselves. But we took in the win last night while we still could but when it
came down to it, we are still focused and we have another game tomorrow.  
TIFFANY MITCHELL: I agree.  
  
Q. Talk about, you've made a lot of big shots in your career, but the shot
last night, can you just talk about, when it was all over, did you watch it
again and just some of your thoughts on making that shot, and also how much
you've grown as a player; that you want the ball in your hands in those
situations all the time.  
TIFFANY MITCHELL: Well, yeah, people sent the video to me after the game, so I
kind of got to see it. Coach Staley just drew up a play to try to get the ball
into my hands and Aleighsa set me a screen on the baseline, and I kind of just
read it from there, and my defender, and saw an open lane, so I took it.  
I think that the confidence just comes from Coach Staley and my teammates
pretty much want me to take that shot, and the confident from them just rubs
off on me and I feel comfortable taking that shot.  
  
Q. Aleighsa, how much did it mean to you last night when you were not
playing one of your better games to are have your teammates pick you up?  
ALEIGHSA WELCH: It definitely meant a lot. Like I said, it's my senior year
and I definitely didn't have the game that I wanted but we had a lot of
different people who stepped up, and one of the main people did who was a
fellow senior of mine, which was Olivia Gaines.  
So it just meant a lot that‑‑ and I think it just shows the depth of our team
because like I said, I didn't have the game I wanted but we had a lot of
different people who in the biggest moments of the game shined the brightest
of the entire season. It meant a lot that my teammates were able to pick me up
with the game I was having.  
  
Q. Aleighsa, to follow up with that, since you didn't have one of your
better games last night, how determined are you to come out tomorrow and make
sure that your season doesn't end?  
ALEIGHSA WELCH: The determination factor is always there, but last night's
game isn't going to be in the back of my mind as far as when we play tomorrow.
You've just got to let it go. We are still able to play tomorrow so that's the
most important part. You attack the game with the game plan that we set up and
you do what you have to do to get a win.  
But I'm not really the type of person to harp on a bad game. You've just got
to let it go and you've got to continue to play because we're in a situation
where we do have the opportunity to still be able to play.  
  
Q. Aleighsa and Alaina, Florida State's front line is pretty big; how much
of a challenge will it be to try to keep them contained like you did against
Mavunga last night?  
ALEIGHSA WELCH: You know, they do have a big front line, and it presents a
different challenge than probably what we've seen all season except with the
exception of Duke.  
I think the biggest thing is their rebounding. They are a really good
rebounding team. So trying to contain that aspect of it and limit them to one
shot on the offensive end. But you've got to do your work early. You've got to
make them work for everything and you can't give them anything easy. But we've
just got to make sure we do what we're supposed to do heading into the game.  
ALAINA COATES: Piggybacking off what Aleighsa said, it's going to be key, we
just make sure we do our jobs defensively and offensively.  
  
Q. Alaina, can you talk about where you are now as a sophomore, as opposed
to a freshman? It's always a big learning curve for a post player because
you're a big target. Can you talk about how you've progressed as a player with
fitness, with your moves, with your mentality as a sophomore?  
ALAINA COATES: Last year was as a freshman, I didn't really trust in my moves
as much as I do now. I was a little impatient. I just wanted to get a shot up
and just getting on the court.  
And now, I'm really just looking at things and seeing which shot is best for
me, should I pass it out, should I not, just keeping a low head and making
sure I stay in the game and don't get frustrated.  
  
Q. Tiffany, neither South Carolina nor Florida State has never been to the
Final Four; does that make it feel more real or wide open that there is going
to be a first ‑timer going regard of who wins tomorrow?   
TIFFANY MITCHELL: I guess but our ultimate goal is win the National
Championship so that's what we are going to try to do tomorrow‑‑ or get to the
Final Four tomorrow.  
  
Q. Aleighsa, obviously the goal is to win; what would it mean to you coming
from where you started with this program four years ago to make it in the
first Final Four in program history?  
ALEIGHSA WELCH: It would definitely be a big deal. That's something that I
wanted coming in when I made my decision to come here.  
So to kind of be staring it right in the face, I guess you could say with our
game tomorrow; it would be something that I could just, once again say it was
something I was able to accomplish in my career here in South Carolina.
Because even when Coach Staley first recruited me it was a goal I wanted to
achieve with my team at some point in my career.  
Of course we do have a bigger goal at hand but you savor the moment and
something like that would definitely be something that's just big for me and
something that I'll be able to take for myself years after I graduate.  
  
Q. Khadijah, people always talk about the depth on this team but could you
address specifically the depth at guard? Last night is a great example with
Tina coming in and the minutes she played and Olivia. Can you sort of talk
about like how all season that's been the case; that you guys have kicked each
other up offensively and defensively at the guard position?  
KHADIJAH SESSIONS: We have a lot of guards, a lot of guards are capable of
doing different things, bringing different things to the table. And last
night, as you said, Tina Roy and Olivia Gaines stepped up big and contributed
big for us on the defensive and offensive end.  
It's just the best thing that, you know, sometimes it might not be your game
and somebody on the bench can come up and pick you up. That's what's so
special about this team, and we've been doing it all season.  
Talking about bench production; we're one of the best in the country, if not
the best, coming off the bench and we take pride in our bench coming in and
stepping in for the players that's not doing what they can that game. We have
a tremendous bench, tremendous depth in the guard and post position, so
definitely a great thing about us.  
  
Q. Their front line is really big, really tall and they like to get up on
the glass. How much of a challenge will it be to try to keep them off the
rebounds?  
COACH STALEY: It's a huge challenge. It's something that they do extremely
well. It's going to be probably the No.1 key to the basketball game. We just
have to be disciplined. Those hours that we spent pre‑season, the drills that
we do every day in practice, the boxing out, and being deliberate and making
sure that we don't give people extra possessions is going to be key for this
particular game.  
So hopefully our players will do that and execute that tomorrow.  
  
Q. You've talked about focus all season. After an emotional game last night,
getting over a hump they have been wanting to get over for so long and a team
they have been want to go get over for so long, do you have to stress that
more or is it so ingrained now that they know it instinctively?  
COACH STALEY: Our team has been a creature of habit. We've been able to focus
on the task at hand and we've been able to turn the page and focus in on the
next task. I think we'll stay in character when it comes to that. Obviously
it's a great win for our program. It's a great milestone. But it's not our
destination game. It's not what we intended to do this season. It's along the
way but it's not, you know‑‑ it's part of what we wanted to do.  
  
Q. Similar thing, I asked Alaina about her progress this year, both in the
minutes that she can play and just how she's learned to be a big ‑time post
player.   
COACH STALEY: You know, Alaina, we sometimes forget that she's just a
sophomore because it seems like she's been in our program for so long. I think
sometimes the game is played extremely fast from a post‑player's eyes and it
needs to just slow down, and you need experience to understand it. You also
have to have the knowledge as a coach to get to your players. You can say
things but sometimes things can go over their head.  
So you have to figure out‑‑ you know, we have to figure out how she takes in
information and how she's seeing things. What we've done is Coach Taylor, we
just try to familiarize where she is on the floor. She has to understand where
she is on the floor and we give her certain moves to where she is on the
floor. And if she's off the block a little bit, she knows what to do. I'm not
going to say what she's going to do if she's in the paint, two feet in the
paint, she knows what to do.  
And she's not a selfish player at all. She's probably one of our better
passers, and I think A'ja Wilson has been the recipient of her passing. So we
look forward; we want her to have a tremendous postseason so she can feel that
confidence going into summer workouts. She's committed to staying all summer
long. So we are just looking for her to continue to grow and be a dominant
post; be the best post player in the country next year.  
  
Q. You're familiar with Shakayla Thomas; how can they impact the game and
how close was she to being a player for you?  
COACH STALEY: Shakayla will probably have to answer that question. We
recruited her extremely hard. We felt like the same things that she does for
Florida State; she is an incredible athlete. She can rebound in traffic. She
can get down the floor fairly quickly. She's got great basketball instincts
and IQ and she has an incredible will to win. She poses somewhat of a matchup
problem for us.  
Hopefully we can just use our experience against her. She'll be going up
against some someone like a senior, Aleighsa Welch, which hopefully we can use
our experience against her youth and her athleticism.  
  
Q. Based on past experienced with Aleighsa, what type of performance are you
expecting from her tomorrow with her coming off a bad game?  
COACH STALEY: I mean, she's about winning. She's not about her own stats.
Because obviously we've got a team full of players, and you know, for her to
play like she did, she's not one that always fills the stat sheet. I think we
have to credit her for some of the intangibles that she brings to the game.  
So statistically, it wasn't, you know, where she normally is, but you have to
account for the intangibles. She had a tough defensive assignment where she
had to clog up the paint for us while the penetration; so I think we probably
wore her down a little bit to where she wasn't able to perform as she normally
does on the offensive end.  
But she'll be Aleighsa. She'll be Aleighsa tomorrow. She'll communicate.
She'll be our emotional leader, and along the lines, I think she'll be more of
an impact coming off; she'll have more of an impact offensively.  
  
Q. How do you balance pounding the ball inside with your guards taking open
shots when they get them, and were you happy with that ratio last night?  
COACH STALEY: I wasn't happy with it in the beginning of the game. I think we
have to be truly calculating at the beginning of the game and we have to let
our opponents know exactly what we are trying to do and make them defend that.
Because for our perimeter players, you know, the more times that we get the
ball inside, is going to lead to more open shots for them if we are
successful.  
The shots that we took early against North Carolina, are the same shots that
we can get at the end of a shot clock, and you keep North Carolina or an
opponent on defense for a little bit longer, especially when it becomes a
possession game. North Carolina wants a lot of possessions so if we are
shooting quickly, you play into their hands and they got off to an 8‑0 run
because of our quick shot.  
So we just have to be a little bit more patient and a little bit more
disciplined, and when we are, it puts us in great rebounding position. And
also puts our players in the position where they are taking practice shots,
not contesting shots, not rush shots. Calculating, expected shots so we can
put ourselves in a position to rebound and to get back in transition if we
can't come up with an offensive rebound.  
  
Q. What do you expect from Florida State: Will they zone you like everybody
else or because of their size will they matchup with you man ‑to‑man?  
COACH STALEY: We've seen 95 percent man. I think at this stage of the game
you're going to do what you've done all season long so I anticipate them
playing us man. They match up with us on the perimeter and in the post, I
don't see why they wouldn't play us as they have played all season long.  
  
Q. You had nine busloads of fans yesterday. Any word on how many busloads
you expect to make the trip tomorrow?  
COACH STALEY: As far as I know at the moment, nine, we'll probably be
returning, but I'm sure‑‑ I have to check my Twitter account to see if anybody
else is coming up or if we've got any more bus companies commit to bringing
our fans to Greensboro.  
But it was quite remarkable to see a caravan of buses coming to see us play
and the excitement that was outside of this arena before they were allowed to
come in the game, and then when they came in the game, and most of Gamecock
Nation was the lower bowl, and it truly got loud in there last night and gave
us the energy to get the win. I'm hoping we can double the attendance for
Sunday.

_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  
Q. Question for Maegan, yesterday was really the first game where you went
down completely to the wire after stomping through the first two rounds of the
tournament. As one of the senior leaders, how do you keep this team grounded
even when the game is going down to a one ‑point game?   
MAEGAN CONWRIGHT: One thing we really focus season is unit and something we've
been working on all year, and we haven't hit our peak in it yet. And I feel
like we did a really great job yesterday of staying together when things are
going down and not separating, and just communicating with each other.  
  
Q. Adut, for a while, came dangerously close to being the first team to out
‑rebound you since Notre Dame. What were you doing in the paint to make sure
that didn't happen and to keep the rebounding numbers as solid as they always
are?   
ADUT BULGAK: The coaches, I could hear them from the bench yelling, "Get
around the players." So we had more of our guards start boxing out and
crashing harder, and so that made it easier and opened the lanes for our post
to also get in the action of rebounding.  
  
Q. Adut and Ivey, obviously South Carolina is known for the depth and size
that they have inside. You guys have faced similar kind of tough teams. I
wonder if you can talk about what it's like going against South Carolina in
terms of having people they can rotate in on the interior.  
ADUT BULGAK: Well, first of all, we're‑‑ can you repeat the question?  
  
Q. South Carolina's size, they have got a lot of size and they have a lot of
people that they can rotate in on the inside. Can you talk about going against
that?  
ADUT BULGAK: Well, with their size I think we are going to look to our guards
to hassle the post when the ball gets in but I think our posts can also handle
that. We have played against players that were bigger than us this year, and I
think we're going to do a good job of just stick to go what we know and
playing good defense; and also with their rotations, just like us, we have a
deep bench but I think our match‑ups will be fine.  
  
Q. Has yesterday's 21 ‑point performance sunk in for you and how do you put
that in the back of your mind and get ready for South Carolina?   
LETICIA ROMERO: Well, we got the win. We forget about last night. Now we have
another game. I think what we have to think about, get ready for South
Carolina, it's going to be a tough game and just be ready. There's nothing
else that we will think about.  
  
Q. Maegan, to go through a close game and be tested as much as you guys
were, does it give you a sense of confidence knowing that you can survive a
battle like that going into what is probably going to be a pretty tough game
tomorrow?  
MAEGAN CONWRIGHT: Most definitely, it's always confidence when you're stepping
up and getting a tough win. Arizona State was a great team and their pressure
was phenomenal, so for us to get through that and stay together only makes us
improve on what we can do and how we will play towards South Carolina.  
  
Q. Brittany, you're a guard who is averaging maybe about two to three
offensive rebounds per game, against a team like South Carolina, how important
is it to have guards that can also rebound the ball in case the ball gets away
from the post players?  
BRITTANY BROWN: It's very important. Something that we always have been
stressing throughout this whole year that we've done so well is defending and
rebounding.  
Regardless of who our opponent is, that's what we want to do in every game
that we play, and just like you said, it's going to be huge because of how big
they are with their posts. We know how hard that our posts are going to work
inside, and for our guards to contribute a little bit of that, that takes some
pressure off of them.  
  
Q. For Maegan, how much have you gotten a chance to see Tiffany Mitchell for
South Carolina in terms of she's been the SEC Player of the Year the last two
years, but she's really improved in terms of shot selection and different
things. Wonder your thoughts on going against her tomorrow.  
MAEGAN CONWRIGHT: Yeah, it was funny because some of my teammates asked if I
ever played against her and I couldn't remember. But when she was a freshman,
I was a junior and I think that's when I got hurt so I never got to play
against her.  
So to see her and watch her, I still watch my teammates at Kentucky, and she's
a great player and I can't wait to play against her.  
  
Q. Adut, the fact that you guys have out ‑rebounded almost everybody you've
played this year, is that just a statistic or something you take particular
pride in? Are you checking the stats sheet after every game to make sure
you've upheld that? What does it mean for you guys?  
ADUT BULGAK: I'd say all of the above, actually, in some aspects. Like to us,
rebounding is very contagious for our team. I've had games where I'll have a
double‑double, and then Brittany will come around and then she'll have a
double‑double. It's like when somebody is rebounding well, you see the team is
rebounding well, it just trickles down and everybody wants to be a part of it.  
So it's become a big identity for our team, and yeah, we check ‑‑ we'll like
check the stat sheet to make sure that we have out‑rebounded everybody just
because it's such a main focus of our game.  
  
Q. A year ago at this time, a difficult time for you, and here you are one
game away from the Final Four. Can you even put that in perspective of what
this 12 months has been like for you?  
LETICIA ROMERO: Well, it's just a blessing to be able to play this year. I
never thought I was going to be able to play. And with this team, I have told
them so many times that at the beginning of the season, whenever we start
having games and I was on the bench, I wish I could have played because how
much fun you see they have on the court, and that is translated into success.
That is I think the key for us to be where we are right now.  
  
Q. Kentucky is one of the one teams to beat South Carolina this year. Is
there anybody up there that you can maybe reach out to for a last ‑minute
pointer or two?   
MAEGAN CONWRIGHT: Yeah, I can, but our coaches have done such a great job of
looking at what we need to work on towards winning versus South Carolina and
some similar things that we will take from Kentucky. We watched film this
morning, and it was really cool to see them beat South Carolina and we are
looking to do the same.  
  
Q. This is just the second time Florida State has made it this far. One or
the other team, either Florida State or South Carolina is going to be a first
‑timer in the Final Four. What does that mean to you to be a part of that in
the one season you're able to play here?   
MAEGAN CONWRIGHT: It's such a blessing, you know, leaving Kentucky and not
knowing where I was going to go and then Coach Sue taking a chance with me,
with a lot of coaches that didn't; as far as me turning my ACL, they didn't
know what I was going to bring to the table.  
To be able to come here and do this for Coach Sue, I couldn't be any happier
to be able to be in this position to get to the Final Four. And to be in a
region where nobody has done it before; so up for grabs, it just gives us the
rest of us confidence that we can do it and we are not going to back down.  
  
Q. You've been in this situation before, getting ready to go up against the
number one seed in the region to go to the Final Four. Is there any
familiarity compared to 2010 when you were matched up against UCONN?  
COACH SEMRAU: I think people think of the Final Four as a destiny, and I
don't‑‑ this team doesn't see that. This is a game and this is‑‑ so I really
look at it very similar that it's a great team that we are getting ready to
face. And if we put too much emphasis on the destination, then we are not
going to be prepared for the next thing. And I think it's really important
that we keep our mind on our business.  
  
Q. Could you talk about a little bit of the difficulty that South Carolina
presents in terms of their size and their depth on their bench?  
COACH SEMRAU: I could talk a long time about the difficulty that they present.
Talk about size; talk about speed; strength; depth; their ability to defend;
to feel; their guard play is tremendous. They are such a well‑rounded team,
and obviously very deserving of a No.1 seed.  
So there's a lot of things I could talk about. They are a great, great
basketball team.  
  
Q. Kind of like what I asked Maegan, as a coach, are you happy to see that
you had to go through a test like you did last night before going up against a
team of South Carolina's calibre, as opposed to if last night had gone similar
to the first two games?  
COACH SEMRAU: I'm happy now. Last night was a battle, and I mean, it's
definitely‑‑ I think any time that you battle and face adversity, you get
stronger. Fortunately we were able to be a point ahead when the buzzer went
off and so I think absolutely, it strengthens us as a team.  
  
Q. I think Coach Hatchell mentioned last night that South Carolina's role
players ‑‑ just one after the other in the game. Can you think of a team
that's comparable depth‑wise that you've played this year? I know you've seen
some good teams in the ACC but anything at all that is comparable to it?   
COACH SEMRAU: I wouldn't call their bench players role players. I think that
everybody plays an extremely important role.  
I would liken them in size to Duke in our conference. There's great size. So
we have seen that throughout conference play. But yeah, I think it's probably
the only one I can think of right off the top of my head.  
  
Q. Can you put in perspective with Leti, she sort of just hit the ground
running and I know she played a lot overseas with the junior team and then the
national team. But still, the fact that she has made the adjustment really so
quickly with this group, can you kind of put that in perspective?  
COACH SEMRAU: I was shaking my head when you asked her that question, because
I haven't even thought that, you know, what, 12 months ago, that she was going
through the process of transfer; and for her to be in this situation just
shows the maturity and resiliency that she has.  
She's got a tremendous family. They stayed up Spain time last night watching
it on ESPN. They are flying here to see her one way or another this week, and
I tell you, she's remarkable.  
  
Q. A couple times, you've asked her to let the ball fly a little more and
shoot a little more; was last night the game you've been waiting for from her
this season?  
COACH SEMRAU: It came down to, shots weren't coming easy for anyone. And even
the ball reversal and getting the ball into operational areas wasn't easy.  
And so Leti knew that it was a role that she needed to take in order for us to
win, and that's when she is at her best scoring‑wise is when she knows she's
needed. She loves to get other people involved, and I think that's really the
heart of a true point guard. I think it just shows what she's capable of last
night.  
  
Q. Obviously nobody on your roster was in the Elite 8 the last time you were
here, but for you personally as a coach, was there anything of that experience
‑‑ taught you anything that you can glean that you can apply to tomorrow?  
COACH SEMRAU: What's so cool is we had so many alumni come back to our first
and second rounds who were in that Elite 8 game and were in Sweet16s, and they
spoke a lot to our players about that time. The thing they talked about was
family, and the thing they talked about was the people. And I think that's
what it's about.  
Regardless, throughout the course of time, I think that that's what basketball
really is all about. It's great to win, but the people you do it with are more
important.  
  
Q. You went against Jewell Loyd, ACC Player of the Year, three times this
year. Tiffany Mitchell is the two ‑time SEC Player of the Year. Can you see
some comparisons and how does facing Jewell maybe help in terms of preparing
for Tiffany?  
COACH SEMRAU: Yeah, I think they are two different players, but two excellent
players. You even mentioned shot selection, and I think both of them have an
incredible knack for knowing what their team needs when. Both are extremely
efficient when they shoot the ball.  
I think that the post game for Tiffany depth‑wise ask size‑wise, maybe gives
her the ability to do a little less offensively or maybe puts a little less
pressure on her than Jewell has. And both of them are great defenders, as
well.  
  
Q. South Carolina coach is predicting nine busloads of fans coming up to see
them ‑‑  
COACH SEMRAU: Cool.  
  
Q. ‑‑ this could be Florida State's first truly hostile environment in this
tournament. How do you prepare your team for that?   
COACH SEMRAU: They will be wearing garnet, I think. It's great. The more
people, the better for our team. I think it's fantastic what South Carolina
has done with their fan base. They are not too far away from here, so the fact
that they are going to jump on buses; I know that if we were in Jacksonville,
the same thing would be happening for Tallahassee, so I think it's fantastic.  
  
Q. Both teams take so much pride in rebounding. How much physical do you
expect tomorrow's game to be?  
COACH SEMRAU: Probably as physical as it was last night. We felt like last
night was extremely physical. And we don't mind that. I think that is all
about work and both teams love to work. That's a stat I think that shows when
teams have a lot of effort and work, that's what stands out.

GREENSBORO](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+REGIONALS+SEMIFINALS+%26+FINALS%3A+GREENSBORO)

  

## March 27, 2015

  

### [Charli Turner Thorne](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24830)

  
_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

FLORIDA STATE  66  
ARIZONA STATE - 65

  
COACH TURNER THORNE: Just like to thank the NCAA and Leslie and Sybil and the
Selection Committee for everything, we know how hard you guys work to put this
tournament on and we really appreciate it, and the people of Greensboro thank
you so much for your hospitality.  
I just want to say this has been one of my most fun seasons ever in coaching,
because this team is so tough, and so fun to coach, and no drama and no
selfishness. We needed to play a little better basketball today.
Uncharacteristic turnovers for us. Kind of hard to advance to the Elite 8 with
that kind of possessions.  
If we hung around on the boards, we'd be okay, but we never anticipated the
turnovers. So just want to‑‑ hats off to Florida State, who does an amazing
job. They have a great team, and you know, we wish them the best.  
  
Q. Could you walk me through the ‑‑ you got the ball to Peace, did it slip
out of her hands or what happened there?   
COACH TURNER THORNE: We have a four‑second play, where we up‑screen. And she
actually had Kelsey open down the court. She's a first‑year player. I'm not
even exactly sure she knew what she was looking for. We didn't have a
time‑out.  
Probably would of rather had Lewy (ph) get the ball first in her hands. But
you know, she went with it aggressively which is also part of what we would
like her to do, and you know what, she looked at the clock and then she slowed
up and allowed them to poke the ball out. And obviously, probably don't want
to do that in that situation. Probably just keep going and get the shot to the
rim.  
But you know, we practiced for end‑of‑game situations usually pretty good, and
when we had our break after our Pac‑12 tournament, we really went through
these situations again and tried to get sharp. That was some really tough
calls on Promise; the fact that our one senior wasn't in the game down the
stretch really hurt us, so we had a first‑year player and we didn't quite
execute the play.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about Romero and her impact on game?  
COACH TURNER THORNE: Yeah, she had a great game. We definitely‑‑ if Promise
wasn't in foul trouble; when somebody gets hot against us, we put Promise on
them, Nigerian nightmare, and they don't have a good game. She got some tough
calls and she was in foul trouble the entire game. We actually put her on her
for a little bit in the second half and then she still just had three.  
But disappointing because she was hurting us, and we weren't doing a good job.
Lewy (ph) and Peace weren't doing a good job guarding her, so I think Promise
could have gotten over those screens and gotten her space and not allowed her
to create so much. We wanted to play her right hand. We didn't want to leave
her wide open driving left. We just didn't play‑‑ she did a great job. She's a
very talented player and she really stepped up, and would have liked to have
had our best defender on her but didn't work out.  
  
Q. The run they went on at the end of the first half, you've been in those
kind of deficits before but how much was that a factor in terms of trying to
come back from being down by 11?  
COACH TURNER THORNE: Well, it was really disappointing because we just sort of
gave them the ball. Again, very uncharacteristic of us and lack of discipline.
It's a young team and first time in this situation and I think we didn't have
as much poise‑‑ the poise that we normally have. The turnovers were‑‑ you
can't set up your defense, right.  
I mean, it was just‑‑ we felt fine at halftime because we knew we gave it to
them; that their halfcourt defense held them to probably 15 points in the
first half and we just needed to start taking care of the ball. That happened.
We tied it up. We had the game that we wanted and we just needed to, again,
credit Florida State. We needed to get our stops down the stretch, and Katie
got hot, which was great. We were confident going to Sophie. We just had‑‑
even just off that free throw rebound, to give up a layup, that was just
something that‑‑ yeah, disappointing for our defensive mentality.  
THE MODERATOR: Katie Hempen had an excellent game. Can you talk about her
performance?  
COACH TURNER THORNE: Well, Katie's been‑‑ she's obviously one of our best
shooters, and she's always clutch down the stretch. I thought she absolutely
put us in a position to win the game, like she does‑‑ like she has on many
occasions this year. We just need a better end‑of‑the‑game defense.

_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

FLORIDA STATE  66  
ARIZONA STATE - 65

  
COACH SEMRAU: Credit Arizona State. Their defense was tough as nails, and we
knew it because going to be. We knew it was going to be a physical game.
Credit our kids for hanging in at the end. I'm really happy we got some
separations to end the half. I know they are a second‑half team and they had a
great second half.  
  
Q. By my count, down the stretch, three times they got it to a single
‑possession game, and each time you hit a shot in response to that. Can you
explain what it is about you that you rose to that occasion?   
LETICIA ROMERO: Well, when it comes to those kind of moments, and at end of
the game, just don't think. You just want to help your team to win the game,
you know. And you know, all those games that we have had, it has always been
somebody different.  
Today was me shooting the last shot, and I'm sure tomorrow we're going to have
a lot of response (ph), I don't know, just having a team like this, you just
play, and it's just easy.  
  
Q. The last time you guys were in this building, it obviously was not very
friendly to you. You lost to Notre Dame. But describe what it's like to come
back here to an arena that's familiar, a city that's familiar in ACC
territory; do you feel like that contributed to your success?  
STUDENT‑ATHLETE: I mean, last time we came here, we lost to Notre Dame, but
you learn a lot from losses. Coming in now, we learned a lot. Notre Dame is a
team that wins championships, and you know, we are trying to learn how get
through winning games and we want to learn how to win championships.  
Now we know what not to do and we feel better prepared coming in now, because
them stepping up like that, and us being in a region where nobody in this
region has got to the Final Four in such a long time, it's up for grabs. We're
preparing to just, you know, go out and do‑‑ learn from our loss last time and
be better this time.  
  
Q. For Maegan, could you walk through what happened the last four seconds of
the game?  
MAEGAN CONWRIGHT: It's so funny, because my team makes fun of me because I do
this defensive move a lot, and I mean, I didn't really think‑‑ I know that I
was recruited for defense and defense is my strong suit. So when I was looking
at her, and I felt like I could go get the steal, so I just did. I don't know,
I wasn't even thinking.  
COACH SEMRAU: It was awesome being back here in Greensboro. It's been a home
away from home for Florida State, for the ACC, to see all the familiar faces,
it was awesome.  
  
Q. For Maegan, just the resolve she showed to make that play at the end of
the game, especially after a tough sequence, for a fifth ‑year senior to make
that, how neat was that for you to see?   
COACH SEMRAU: I think it was her teammates. At that time‑out, her teammates
just rallied around her after she had missed that shot. I think that's the
thing that gave her the kind of confidence that she needed to make that play.

_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

SOUTH CAROLINA  67  
NORTH CAROLINA - 65

  
THE MODERATOR: Just an opening statement, please.  
COACH HATCHELL: Well, you're looking at three warriors up here. I'm so proud
of my team and these kids for the way that they hung together, the way they
fought. The team chemistry and camaraderie that these kids have, it's what
it's all about. You don't have to, I guess, move to the Elite 8 to be
champions, and these kids are champions, because there's a lot of people that
didn't even give us a chance.  
I read some articles saying that South Carolina, just go ahead and take today
off because it was in the bag, and stuff like that. But you know, these kids
fought hard. It could have easily‑‑ we could have made that shot at the end or
shot this, that, the shot in the corner that went in the corner that bounced
around and went in for them, different things like that happen. But if anybody
knows, I know life's not fair. Things happen.  
But you have to be warriors and overcome them. I told them just because it was
a trip to the Elite 8 or Final Four was delayed‑‑ it wasn't denied; it was
delayed. So we've got a great group coming in next year, a couple McDonald's
All‑Americans, and the best player in Canada. And we've got a great group
returning. It's amazing how they have improved over the year and the
adjustments that we have to make whenever Xylina went out and some different
things like that.  
I'm so proud of these kids for how they competed and how they fought but more
than anything else, the chemistry that they have as a team. It is something
really, really special and a lot of teams nowadays don't have that. But these
kids had it, and you could feel it, and that's why I wanted to win so much for
them. But I'm so proud of them.  
South Carolina has a great team. They are absolutely loaded with players. They
just keep putting them in and a lot of those kids sitting over there would be
starting at a lot of other places, but they just keep putting them in, keep
putting them in. They are a great team but I thought we were a great team
tonight, too. We wish them well and I'm sure we'll probably see each other
again down the road.  
But I thought my kids were well prepared and they played their hearts out and
I couldn't be any more proud of them.  
  
Q. Is this about as physical a game as you've played in college as far as
the teams going at each other, and how do you think you handled it?  
STEPHANIE MAVUNGA: Not at all. I think that we played so much more physical
teams. I think that the refs kind of let us play a lot. But then again, there
were some really sketchy (ph) calls in there. I feel like sometimes they were
trying to make up for a lot of calls and I've never been one to blame anything
on refs. But I feel as if sometimes we had a lot of makeup calls. But I think
that we both played hard but I don't say it's the most physical game or
anything.  
Some battles with Dukes, some battles with Louisville and Notre Dame, we've
had some really tough games, with just a lot of people; Miami, a bunch of
people that I think are tougher than they are. But I think that we did a good
job of handling it.  
I think that we shot away from Carolina basketball a few plays which would
have made up for that, and I feel like every possession counted today. And you
know, one more possession, it's a different ballgame, it's a different team
cheering. And so, that's how I feel about that.  
  
Q. How much did this game mean to you personally and how do you think your
team's effort was tonight overall?  
LATIFAH COLEMAN: Personally it meant a lot. Possibly it could be my last game
and it was. I felt like my team fought hard. We all fought hard. Just didn't
go our way.  
  
Q. You guys were up I guess three with like two minutes left and just seemed
like a rebound away or a basket away from maybe being able to put more
pressure on them. What was the difference in maybe not being able to get that
one more play, get that one more stop?  
STEPHANIE MAVUNGA: What was the difference? I guess, I think with a minute 30
seconds left, I think if we would have secured that rebound, then it's a whole
different ballgame. They would have had to foul us.  
But then I think there were some turnovers down the stretch that were really
key. Some for myself; I think every one of my three turnovers were actually
really key. I just feel as if whoever scored from that point was the one that
was going to win but it was going to be about who wanted it more.  
And I don't necessarily think that they wanted it more than we did, but like I
said, like taking one play off, it really matters and maybe we weren't as set
up as we should have been. I mean, that shot that went up from the corner that
bounced up and down and any which way it could have and went in, you don't see
that every day. I mean, the game was going any which way.  
An extra possession, like I said, would have changed the whole ballgame. And
of course we had the shot at the end by Jamie Cherry; of course, I personally
I feel as if she got fouled, but of course the referee is not going to call
that in such a tight game and let it be decided by free throws.  
  
Q. The first couple minutes, you had six quick points. What did they change
defensively to shut you down the rest of the game?  
STEPHANIE MAVUNGA: Oh, double and triple teams. I think that they quickly
figured out that if they were going to get any single coverage, it was going
to be ‑‑ it was going to be a long game for them.  
And I really feel as if whenever I saw the single coverage, like I said last
time, when it's single coverage, that's sort of exactly what it is I like to
do. I feel as if my coaches and my teammates have done a good job of telling
me that I can go with anybody in the state as long as it's single coverage,
then I'm going to score the ball. And I think that they have a lot of faith in
me to do that and I think that they have really been instilling confidence in
me.  
And so when the double and triple teams came, that was a whole different look.
I mean, it's harder to score with three people or two people than it is one,
and so I think that they changed that quickly, and they really figured it out.
They came out and I think that‑‑ I did a good job of finding some of my
teammate at times, of course, but then again, I had some turnovers, I had some
turnovers out of the double, triple team, but it is what it is.  
  
Q. Were you surprised how ‑‑ (inaudible)?  
ALLISHA GRAY: No, we weren't surprised at all, because, you know, we are an
aggressive team. When the lane is open like we are used to, we just drive all
the time. So, no, we weren't surprised at all.  
LATIFAH COLEMAN: We run a lot of movement and motion stuff so we could attack
the basket and it worked for us.  
  
Q. What do you think of your team's overall accomplishments in your senior
year?  
LATIFAH COLEMAN: Like Coach Hatchell said, a lot of people didn't think we
would be where we were today. I'm just very proud to be a part of this team
and I'm blessed for the experience. I feel like we had a good year.  
  
Q. For each of you, you guys were up three going into that Final minute.
What was your reaction to seeing that ball bounce around and go in to tie the
game?  
STEPHANIE MAVUNGA: My reaction, of course, I'm like, okay, we're still in the
game. There's still a minute left the clock. But then again, like I said,
should shot doesn't happen every single day. I mean, it's not every day that
everyone gets a shot that's going to bounce around and come in.  
I mean, like I said we still had a minute on the clock and it wasn't over.
Then we still had a defensive stop to make, we still had points to score. So
looking up and seeing the shot go in, I'm like, okay, we need to score, get a
stop, score, get a stop.  
ALLISHA GRAY: I agree with Steph, what she said. Even though she made the
shot, we still was in the game.  
LATIFAH COLEMAN: My reaction was next play, like what do you do next; it's not
over yet.  
  
Q. How would you compare this to last year's Sweet16 matchup?  
STEPHANIE MAVUNGA: I still think that we're a great team. I still think that
we're the better team. I just feel as if, like I said, if there was just one
possession here or there and it would have been a different team celebrating.  
I think that last year we did a good job of keying in towards the last minutes
and really focusing in and playing Carolina basketball: You know, playing
hard, playing smart, playing together, and really just focusing in and not
taking plays off and not really panicking and being frantic.  
I think that today, we did the same things. I just think we didn't really key
in every single possession like we should have. Like I said, a turnover less,
a rebound more, a free throw more, and we would have‑‑ we would have been the
team celebrating tonight.  
  
Q. Seemed like you guys were a play, a rebound, a shot away from getting
strong control down the stretch. Why do you think it wasn't something you
could quite get ahold of?  
COACH HATCHELL: Well, you know, several things happened. I had a view on the
side whenever they called Latifah out‑of‑bounds, she got knocked
out‑of‑bounds, but they got the ball back, that was crucial. You know, the
ball going in like that; just a rebound here or there; Stephanie fouling out
that last minute and some seconds. You know, we ran a couple things.  
Jessica is a really good shooter. We actually were running some things to get
some of those shots or to actually get the drives, too, because we were
getting‑‑ we were able to turn the corner and take it in there pretty good but
their big girls had been blocking shots and all that.  
So actually one time I had four guards in there, I had four shooters in there.
But anyway, could have gone our way easily, a shot here or there; or the ball
bounced around and not gone in. I thought one time we got the rebound started
out, and all of a sudden the whistling blows and there's a foul called on us.  
So there's several things like that. But, hey, I've been doing this a long
time. That's a part of it.  
But I know y'all are asking questions, but I want to say this because I was
sitting here thinking while the girls were talking. I think this game says a
lot for the ACC Women's Basketball, because, you know, we were, what, fifth
seed coming into our tournament. We had a chance to win this game. I just
don't think people realize how great ACC Women's Basketball is. We had eight
teams that made the Tournament, and we really have some unbelievable teams in
this conference.  
So I think, I'm hoping this game made a statement to a lot of people that the
ACC deserves more respect than it's getting, because it's great, it really is
great. I see Matt in the back, great job, Greensboro Coliseum people,
incredible job, thank you so much.  
  
Q. You were talking about the ACC. Just in general, seemed like a great
atmosphere tonight. Can you talk about that?  
COACH HATCHELL: Oh, yeah, sure, it was. I tell people all the time; our
tournament, nobody in the country anywhere close to the tournament we have
here, because Greensboro does a tremendous job and the ACC Conference is here.
Almost every game is like this and they just do a tremendous job.  
But I thought our conference prepared us; the competition that we had in our
conference this year prepared us so well for this game because almost every
game in our conference is like this.  
So hopefully our conference earned some respect because like I said, we didn't
play that much better. We've been playing like this all year, but we've got
some doggone good teams in our league.  
  
Q. What did South Carolina do to hinder the ball movement?  
COACH HATCHELL: Well, we had a lot of drives. So there wasn't a whole lot of
passing because we were able to drive to the basket. So we didn't have to pass
it off for people to shoot because we were able to take it to the basket, so I
think that's a lot of it.  
Now, did we make all those? No. Did their size make a difference at times?
Probably so. But we turned a corner every time we wanted to.  
  
Q. You accomplished a lot during the year and played right to the wire with
one of the teams that was top two or three all year. Is it going to be hard to
look back and wonder after zeal even a's injury what could have been with this
group?  
COACH HATCHELL: Well, you know, I mean, after she was out, you know, I thought
about it, but we don't talk about it that much. I just tried to put her into a
role of leadership with these younger kids, talking to them and encouraging
them and everything like that.  
I think being her and everything will motivate her tremendously. Her presence
tonight made a difference without a doubt, without a doubt. I thought N'Dea
and Danielle did a good job but they don't have the bulk that Xylina has. And,
you talk about fired up to play South Carolina; I mean, she was begging the
doctors the other night in the locker room to let her play, but she's not
ready yet. You know, she would have made a difference probably but I'm not
going to make any excuses.  
But those other kids, they stepped up and did a great job. I'm so proud of
them because a lot of people didn't think we would be able to do what we've
done but just shows when you work hard and you've got a bunch of great kids ‑‑
and chemistry is incredible on this team. That's so important to winning, just
the environment and atmosphere and chemistry and all that, and these kids have
got it. So that's what makes it hard to lose because they wanted to keep
playing.  
I felt like if we could get by this, then the next game, we know how tough
Florida State is but we beat Florida State in the regular season. So we have a
pretty good game plan. My coaches did a great job with the game plan for this
game and they put some tremendous scouting reports together. Because we've
been the underdog in several games that we pulled out this year, and so got to
give a shout‑out to my coaching staff. They just do a tremendous job.  
But, hey, we'll start working and get ready for next year and hopefully make
another run.  
  
Q. What did you tell your team in that last time ‑out with four seconds or
so after they made the layup and what was the exact game plan for that final
shot?   
COACH HATCHELL: Yeah, well, that was going to get it in Jamie's hands and
actually we didn't have any bigs in there but we told Brittany to set her a
screen because if Jamie has any daylight, she can make that.  
Usually you have like one dribble for every second, and so we were going to go
for the win, not the tie. I wanted to go for a three. We weren't going for the
tie. So I was wanting Jaime‑‑ and she did that‑‑ she's done that two or three
times this year but we didn't get the screen set for her there. She hesitated
because I think she was trying to draw the foul, but they are not going to
call a foul unless you throw them up in the bleachers on a situation like
that. But I think she hesitated to try to draw the ball, but it didn't happen
like that. But Jamie is very good at that. She's, like I said, done it several
times this year. You know, you gamble; sometimes it works, sometimes it
doesn't.

_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

SOUTH CAROLINA  67  
NORTH CAROLINA - 65

  
COACH STALEY: We're just truly excited to still be in the NCAA Tournament and
moving to the Elite 8. It was a great game by both teams. We do take our hat
off to North Carolina. I know it's a shame that someone had to lose a game but
we're glad it's not us. We got great contributions, especially from the three
players that are sitting next to me to my left. We're just excited about
continuing to be able to play.  
  
Q. Olivia, have you ever shot a three ‑pointer that kind of nicked the
backboard, hit the rim and still went in? And Tiffany what was your mind‑set
on the final drive?   
OLIVIA GAINES: Three, well, I never shot a three ‑‑ well, I never shot a three
that was for that moment, but I was just ready when my number was called like
always and I just knocked it down.  
TIFFANY MITCHELL: I think Coach Staley drew up a play kind to just run the
clock down and to take the last shot. I think I kind of shot too early because
they still had another possession. I just think we made the well (ph) in last
possession. Ijust saw how the defense was playing and just drove it to the
basket.  
  
Q. This was a game with a lot of lead changes and runs. How tough was this
one emotionally throughout the game for you guys?  
TIFFANY MITCHELL: I don't think it was ‑‑ I mean, it was kind of emotional,
but we just stayed the course and kept our head. We knew North Carolina was
going to give us their best punch and we knew they had runs in them. We just
had to answer them and keep our head.  
ALAINA COATES: I just think that to piggyback off of Tiffany, we kept a level
head and made sure we executed and did what we needed to do.  
OLIVIA GAINES: I just think we executed the game plan and we came out to win.  
  
Q. You seemed to have a really special drive tonight, 18 points, ten
rebounds but you were ten of ten from the free throw line; is that the thing
you were most proud of?  
ALAINA COATES: I do take pride in free throws. We are a team that's trying to
do better with that, and just being that I was able to go a 100 percent from
the line; that's a good feeling just knowing that I was able to stay in my
rhythm and knock down the shots. They ended up working out for our team and
when we needed them.  
  
Q. What does it mean to finally get over that hurdle and be one of the final
eight teams standing?  
TIFFANY MITCHELL: It means a lot just because North Carolina ended our season
last year. We talked about not repeating history in that manner and them
beating us again and just making history and just making it to the Elite 8,
which we did this time.  
  
Q. You were saying you tried to stay the course and focus on what you were
doing, but was it hard not to get a little bit tense or nervous considering it
was 90 seconds and you're down three and very close?  
TIFFANY MITCHELL: Just a little just because of how the game was going back
and forth, but Coach Staley calmed us down and I think we just executed when
we needed to.  
  
Q. Were you trying to pick up a foul with that shot? And do you think that
was the ‑‑  
OLIVIA GAINES: Yes, it may have been one of biggest shots of my career. And I
wasn't trying to pick up the foul. Somehow she fouled me but we just got the
points and (inaudible‑coughing) was set.  
  
Q. Were there nerves at the start? With that racket at the beginning of the
game, can you talk about what it took to get you guys going?  
TIFFANY MITCHELL: I mean, North Carolina came out pretty aggressive. I think
we came out slow. She just told us to kind of take a deep breath and let the
game settle down some and then we were going to be good, and I think that's
what happened. We got in a rhythm and it was good from there on.  
  
Q. Seemed like you were maybe aggressive and I think you had a calf injury.
How did that affect you?  
ALAINA COATES: It didn't affect me. It was a cramp, after training, I massaged
it and I was good to go. It wasn't hurting or anything like that. Just kind of
was a little lull in the game, but besides that it was fine.  
  
Q. You guys held Mavunga to 12 from the field and Gray to three; how big of
an emphasis did you put on ‑‑ obviously you were double‑teaming, but how big
of an emphasis did you put on limiting those players?   
TIFFANY MITCHELL: We made a huge emphasis on trying to take those two out of
the game. North Carolina, a lot of stuff runs through those two players, so we
knew we they were going to get a lot of touches. So we knew if we could limit
their touches, North Carolina was going to have a hard time putting points on
the board.  
ALAINA COATES: We just put a lot of emphasis on them, especially with Mavunga
and the game she had against Ohio State. We knew if we let her keep going, she
was going to keep going and we had to nip that in the bud real quick.  
Same thing with Gray. We know they have got their key players and it's hard
for the rest of the team to revolve around difficulty. So we just made sure we
made it hard for them to be able to do such a thing.  
OLIVIA GAINES: What she said. We just tried to eliminate Mavunga's touches and
keep Gray off the three‑point line, and I think we did a good job of that.  
  
Q. For most teams playing in a game just 45 minutes away from the opponent's
campus, you might thinkthat might be a road atmosphere, but didn't seem to be
the case. Did you notice how much fan support you had tonight and what did you
think about that?  
TIFFANY MITCHELL: We knew coming in we were going to have a lot of fan
support. It's not that far from Columbia, so we knew they were taking buses
and bringing probably, what, six bus loads of fans‑‑ nine? Nine bus loads. So
we knew it was going to be a lot of fans and we were going to see a lot of
garnet in the stands, just going to try to give us as much home‑court
advantage as possible, even though North Carolina was so close to home.  
ALAINA COATES: Just piggybacking off what Tiffany said, we were pretty much
aware of how many busloads of people we had. We just wasn't expecting, you
know, that great of a number, you know, nine busloads. You don't really know.  
But we just really appreciate Gamecock Nation and just the fact that they have
our backs and they followed us all the way out here to Greensboro.  
OLIVIA GAINES: Fan support means a lot. They always have our back and I'm glad
they came tonight.  
  
Q. Piggybacking off of that, to get the win over North Carolina in North
Carolina ‑‑  
TIFFANY MITCHELL: It means a lot. They ended our season last year, so being
that it's a huge win that we get to go on to the Elite 8, and I think it's
even better and a program win for us, being that we lost the past few times we
played them.  
  
Q. During the time ‑out before the winning basket, can you talk about what
you wanted to get in that play? And was Olivia in the play for defensive
purposes? Was the clock running out or did she take it on her own?   
COACH STALEY: In that time‑out, we knew we had one time‑out left. So we made
it very apparent that, you know, we had that just in case they denied us the
ball. What we wanted to accomplish was a play that we had run a lot at the end
of the game, and it's a play that we run our ball screen into a screen for our
shooter or our post entry.  
We wanted the ball in Tiffany Mitchell's hands, and we thought Tina Roy did a
great job of just running our basketball team so she was the one that was
going to initiate it. We tried to get her to delay it to where we took the
last shot, and Tiffany probably went a little bit sooner than we wanted her
to; but if anybody get a basket, we'll take the basket and rely on our
defense.  
And then Olivia was in the game for energy. Obviously she does a really good
job at defending, but she also does a great job of just spotting up and being
ready to shoot the ball and she doesn't second guess it.  
Thankfully as we were walking in, I didn't know if she heard me when she was
in front of our bench before she took that three. I just told her to be ready
to shoot the ball. Being ready to shoot the ball for O means shoot the ball.
She shot the ball. (Laughter).  
It was getting down there, probably around ten seconds, so it was time for us
to take a smooth shot within the flow of things. But our first look was to get
the ball inside.  
  
Q. Tina Roy had a lot of big buckets.  
COACH STALEY: She was huge. I thought she ran our team extremely well. It's
something that she has done for us for many years, and I thought she did not
take as many shots as I would have liked her to take because she got in the
flow of, you know, being the point guard and running our team. For us, she's
one that can stretch the defense out and I just thought she should have been a
little bit more aggressive, like she was in the second half.  
But thankfully she made some shots when we needed to make the shots, and
that's what you want. You want to call on the senior in those situations, and
you know they have been through a lot in our program, and I was happy she just
came through and always stayed ready.  
  
Q. Can you just speak to your confidence in Tiffany in a situation like that
and the way she could execute and make it look effortless in the process?  
COACH STALEY: Any time that the game is on the line, Tiffany Mitchell will be
around the ball. If she doesn't have the ball in her hands, if she's not a
decoy of some sort, she is going to be involved in the play. We knew that. She
can create her own shot at any time, so we drew up the play to put the ball in
her hands and for her to, you know, put the "S" on her chest and be our
Superwoman.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the contribution that Alaina made tonight to help you
get to the Elite 8 and how nerve ‑wracking were those Final minutes for you
personally?   
COACH STALEY: You know, she's been big for us all season long, and we
understand, any time she has big games for us, we usually win the basketball
game. And we wanted to make a concerted effort to get her the ball, because I
believe she made a matchup‑‑ she gave us a matchup advantage against North
Carolina.  
You know, the end of the game, it is nerve‑wracking because you don't want
your season to end. But I thought our team was really resilient. I thought
there was a certain calm over the game where we weren't‑‑ we were poised and
we didn't feel that the moment, in a way that we got too high emotionally. I
thought we just stuck with things. When you're able to stick with things and
stay poised, you're able to see a lot of options out there on the floor and
things don't get cloudy.  
  
Q. Talk about the atmosphere and how amazing that was from your vantage
point.  
COACH STALEY: Gamecock Nation has truly been a blessing for our program.
Gamecock Club does a tremendous job any time that we're at home or on the
road. They figure out a way to bring more people into the games. You know, we
don't win this game if we didn't have our fans creating that home‑court
advantage, giving us the extra energy that we needed to finish the game,
allowing us to feel the presence of their energy. We can't thank them enough
and we just hope that they show up in droves on Sunday afternoon.  
  
Q. Obviously it's big because of how the season ended last year; but do you
think you can play anybody as physical as North Carolina down the road?  
COACH STALEY: Our potential opponents, Arizona State and Florida State, I
think they can play very similar, both of them. And I think for us, it's good
that we saw the physicality of this type of game and we were able to have some
success. Probably a little bit too close for my comfort. But at this point of
the season, you just want to survive and advance, and that's what our team put
ourselves in a position to do.  
  
Q. Free throw shooting, ten of ten at the line, to have a post player as big
and physical as she is, but as focused and talented enough to convert at the
free throw line as well, how much of a luxury is that?  
COACH STALEY: That's a huge luxury. I was looking at our stats earlier today
and I saw that she was shooting 70 percent. She's probably got a big boost
from shooting ten for ten tonight. But she's got a soft touch. We've been
trying to get her to shoot those outside shots, those high post shots all
season long.  
Obviously she's very good at it and she's able to get a little nerve to shoot
it during the game, I think she can be someone that can shut the floor out and
protect what she's able to do in the paint.  
  
Q. You played Olivia Gaines a lot in this tournament, how special is it for
her to hit that shot after earning this time?  
COACH STALEY: Again, I'm truly happy for Olivia. Olivia has been a player in
our program that deserves to play more; that deserves to get a lot more
minutes than we have been able to give her.  
But it's a true testament to the type of person she is to be able to
sacrifice; to be able to sit and wait until your number is called and have the
nerve, the energy and the execution to make plays every single time that we
call on her number.  
You know, I don't think she gets credit enough. She does get credit when she's
able to make plays for us, but I think the credit comes in her ability to be
ready; to when she's not‑‑ when her number's not called and she's just waiting
and she's cheering and in sports, you don't have that very often when you have
players who are as good as everybody but doesn't get as many reps as they
deserve.  
Obviously Olivia deserves a lot of credit for what she was able to help us do
tonight.  
  
Q. Her teammates say Mitchell is a gym rat and how hard she works by
herself. Can you talk about that and how she's improved?  
COACH STALEY: Tiffany Mitchell is a two‑time SEC Player of the Year, one that
she got in her sophomore year, which is unheard of, playing in our league. But
when you see what she's been able to do from year one until year three, the
work that she's put in; I think in her first year, she was just attacking the
basket. She very rarely shot threes or pull‑ups.  
Then she started working on‑‑ she changed her shot between her freshman and
sophomore year to where she got under it a little bit more. She got in the gym
and worked before and after practice and in the off‑season.  
If there is a blueprint for becoming an All‑American, I think she sets the
stage for having the outline for how you become great at your sport. And it is
sacrifice; it is figuring that‑‑ she was at least a 3.8 student, so she does
her work so she can get in the gym and work. When you're as balanced and
driven as someone like Tiffany Mitchell, you're going to be successful.

_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  
Q. Probably not much has changed since yesterday, but what did you see from
film on North Carolina, what did they do different from last time you faced
them and what do you think you'll have to watch out for?  
COACH STALEY: They played the same style of play that they have played for
years, and you know, they get up‑and‑down the floor. They like to play in
transition, they like to speed the game up and they like a lot of possessions.  
For us, I think we just need to be calculating in our approach to the game,
which is run when we have the opportunity and when we don't, we've got to play
halfcourt basketball and pound the ball inside.  
  
Q. Sylvia has been successful pulling players out of the State of South
Carolina. When you were first building this program, how much did you find
yourself going against her trying to win recruiting battles and do you feel
you made a niche for South Carolina and prevented some of those kids from
leaving the state?  
COACH STALEY: When we first came to South Carolina, our staff, we tried to
just corner the market and figure out, you know, the thought process and why
players left or stayed in South Carolina and how we could‑‑ how can we change
that.  
And I think we pound the pavements; we just made sure that we had every
significant person and prospects lives (ph); we tried to make inroads with
every single person. And because of that, that effort, I thought we've done a
tremendous job of keeping our local players at home.  
Some of them, they get away. They have a couple of South Carolina players on
North Carolina's roster. But we are fairly happy with the tradeoff. They got
two and we got maybe eight or nine.  
So it's just a constant battle. But it's one that we've got to keep doing our
job because if we don't, they could easily go out of state.  
  
Q. Was it difficult to turn that tide when you first got here, and how much
of a presence was North Carolina in recruiting women's basketball?  
COACH STALEY: As I look back on it, they got every high‑profile player in the
State of South Carolina over the past few years before we got here.  
I mean, it is difficult. It is difficult I think when ‑‑ Coach Hatchell does a
lot of recruiting. She coached at Francis Marion, so she's had in inroads in
our state.  
But I think when you change the complexion of the program at South Carolina
where we are, and you know, we can be in their backyards; we can invite them
to our games. So when we are that much a part of making sure that we are
constantly pumping South Carolina, come to practices, come to games, come on a
visit, when we are able to have that much access, we find a way to make them
saying no to us very difficult.  
  
Q. When you look at their roster, who really presents a big matchup problem
for you guys?  
COACH STALEY: I think you look at two players that they can score at will.
You've got Stephanie Mavunga and Allisha Gray. Those are two players that have
done extremely well in the ACC just in their league. And when you're able to
play at a high level in a league like the ACC, I think it puts you in a
position to have success across the country because it's a really tough week.
So they could pose some match‑up problems for us.  
  
Q. Greensboro is suppose to be a neutral site and you're a No.1 seed. Does
it feel like that playing north Carolina in their home state in an area where
they have a lot of supporters?  
COACH STALEY: At this juncture, wherever we play‑‑ and we are fortunate to
only have to take a bus ride to Greensboro. So it feels very much like it's
home to us, and hopefully with the close proximity to Columbia, we'll have a
lot of our fans there.  
So whenever we're feeling like you're on someone else's home court, I think
our fans could make us feel very much at home.  
  
Q. Since you already have played against North Carolina, do you feel like
you have an advantage playing against them now?  
COACH STALEY: It's always a tough‑‑ North Carolina is always a tough opponent.
But when you look at our two games that we played against them last year, and
our team this year, we are just a little bit different. We are a little bit
older. I think we understand playing at this level a little bit better because
we have that experience.  
I don't think the game plan changes from how we approached it. I think it's
time for our players just to make plays when the game is on the line, and we
weren't able to do that in the previous two games. So hopefully that changes
this time around.  
  
Q. How many buses have you brought up ‑‑ will you be bringing up tomorrow?
  
COACH STALEY: As of right now, we have nine.  
  
Q. Khadijah, this is kind of the game that made you stay in Colombia all
summer, the opponent that you've been waiting all year. How are you feeling
going into this game and are you worried about maybe nerves taking over the
focus?  
KHADIJAH SESSIONS: No, not at all. I've been waiting for this game, waiting
for revenge, just been‑‑ the time is now. Just ready for it. Just ready for me
and my teammates to go out and prove what we should have proved last year.  
  
Q. Aleighsa, you have a teammate on the other team, former high school
teammates on the other team and I don't think you guys played against each
other in an NCAA Tournament game last year. Do you feel what it's going to be
like going up against her with these kind of stakes on the line?  
ALEIGHSA WELCH: You know, it's always exciting, you know, when I get an
opportunity to play against India. We have some great high school memories
together, but at the end of the day, it's still your opponent and for me, I'm
four years removed from my high school days. So the friendship part kind of
gets put aside until after the game.  
But it will be exciting but at the same time like I said it's still an
opponent?  
  
Q. Have you kept up with her at all? She's played a little bit more of a
role for them as the season has gone on.  
ALEIGHSA WELCH: Yeah, I have I noticed she was getting a lot more playing
team, especially since Xy (ph) went down. I'm happy for her and the
opportunity she's been able to get to really prove herself. But, you know,
this ‑‑ you love them from a distance, especially with the stakes that are on
the line now.  
  
Q. Khadijah, you played against Olivia in practice all the type. What
defensive player is she and how good is she on defense?  
KHADIJAH SESSIONS: She's probably one of the best defenders on the country.
She presser you; she gets up in you. She makes everything difficult. She's
very quick. She makes sure she's prepared and ready for players like Coleman.
Really aggressive, good kid. Yeah, pretty much that's Olivia.  
  
Q. Khadijah, last yearthey impacted the zone ‑‑ shooting outside, do you
think they will do the same this year?  
KHADIJAH SESSIONS: Most definitely. I think they will try the same game plan
playing off of me. But we've seen it all season. We know how to work around
it, get around it. I've been working on my shot. Been working on trying to
make different ways for my teammates to score.  
So we've been seeing it all season and it's going to be nothing different.
Just got to stay in attack mode and run the offense.  
  
Q. Aleighsa, in your four years, have you better learned year ‑to‑year how
to make sure that your legs are fresh late in the season, and was it a
learning thing, particularly early, just how long the season can be?   
ALEIGHSA WELCH: I think definitely, especially coming into my freshman year,
you didn't really know what to expect and you didn't really know how much the
griped of the season took a toll on your body. But as you get older, you do
learn how to take care of your body, especially when you want to play deep
into March and into April.  
We are in, what, 30‑plus games in and playing multiple games a week. So it is
physical but a lot of it is mental. The biggest thing is that I learned is
everybody is physically tired at this point of the season. It's about the
mental preparation coming into the game and giving yourself the upper hand
that way.  
  
Q. For all three of you guys, how have you changed and how has your team
changed since you saw North Carolina in the tournament, and looking at film,
how have they changed?  
ALEIGHSA WELCH: I think we're a more dynamic team. I think we are deeper than
what we were last year. Everybody worked on things that they needed to work
on. North Carolina, I think they are more of a fast‑paced team than when we
played them last year, and they have a different team from what we played last
year, as well.  
I just think roster‑wise and playing‑wise, we're different, both teams are
different than what we were.  
TIFFANY DAVIS: Just to go off what she said, we are a deeper team. I think
last year we were kind of one‑dimensional and it was really easy to play us.
This year I think we have a lot more to threaten North Carolina than what we
did last year. Like she said, North Carolina is a fast‑paced team, so one of
our advantages is controling tempo in this game. We can't really ‑‑ we are not
going to get in a back‑and‑forth track race with them. Just going to try to
play our game that we've been doing all season.  
KHADIJAH SESSIONS: Yeah, I agree with them, too. (Laughter) They said it all,
they did.  
  
Q. Were you guys excited at all that North Carolina was in your region that
you could end up facing them in Greensboro?  
ALEIGHSA WELCH: It was a little excitement knowing that our season ended last
year because of them. I think it's more fun now that we get to play them and
we've been kind of waiting on this game since last year.  
  
Q. Tiffany and Khadijah, you mentioned not getting into a track meet. How
important is controlling the ball and not giving them easy turnovers?  
TIFFANY DAVIS: It's really important. We know they will pressure the ball and
try to make us play faster than what we need to do. So controlling the tempo
is going to be really key. I know if we have it in transition, we'll push it
out but we are not going to go back and forth and take quick shots which we
probably want to do.  
KHADIJAH SESSIONS: Just have to make sure we execute our game plan. When they
are in their halfcourt, know where we're going with the ball. Just making
smart plays, making easy plays and don't do nothing we haven't been doing all
season.

_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  
Q. Winning close games in the NCAA Tournament, how much does that develop
you for winning more close games, as opposed to winning close games in the
regular season, what's the difference there?  
COACH HATCHELL: Well, it makes a big difference. It makes a difference in the
way that your season is over or you're still playing. But I'm hoping that
mentality‑wise, it just toughens you up and helps you grow and get better and
better, because a lot of people didn't think we would be here. But I think it
gives you confidence and just it's part of the growing process that our team
has definitely gone through.  
  
Q. You weren't at the game last year in the Sweet16 last year, but judged on
what you saw from last year's team to this team, does your game plan change in
terms of how you want to attack them?  
COACH HATCHELL: First of all, I still have some dents in the furniture in my
den from watching the game on TV and jumping around and throwing things and
all that. But South Carolina is an excellent team. I mean, they‑‑ Dawn and her
staff have done a really great job rebuilding that program. And gosh, I mean,
they have got kids sitting on their bench that would start at most DivisionI
schools.  
So they really have depth. I think they are talented at every position but
they have so much depth. I mean, none of their players really average that
many points; I'm sure they could. But they are so balanced and with all the
kids playing and everything like that.  
So I just think the depth and then their size, there's no doubt that A'ja
Wilson has added a lot to their team. But they are experienced. Yeah, I don't
see any weaknesses really.  
  
Q. The players from South Carolina earlier said last year they are a one
‑dimensional team and they have added more and it's made them tougher to beat.
What have you seen on film from them as far as that goes?   
COACH HATCHELL: I'm not sure what they meant by one‑dimensional because I
thought they were pretty balanced last year because they had the size inside
and then the guards, the shooters and everything. But they are, they are very
balanced and everybody talks about their inside game but they are pretty good
on the outside, too.  
Like I said, I don't really see any weaknesses. Our kids have to really step
up and play to a really, really high level. And I guess last year they were
probably favored. They were the No.1 or No.2 seed or whatever‑‑ No.1 seed.
Anything can happen. I've watched them all year, and they just destroyed about
everybody they played, and they are just pretty tough.  
But them being one‑dimensional, I don't know. I'm trying to figure out why
they would say that because I thought they were pretty doggone good last year.  
  
Q. All the players said that revenge was a big motivating factor for them
having UNC end their season last year. Are you guys aware of that and on guard
against any additional motivation ‑‑  
COACH HATCHELL: What was the first thing you said?  
  
Q. The players said that this game, there was the revenge factor, UNC having
ending their season last year. Are you guys kind of aware of that and ready
for the emotional ‑‑  
COACH HATCHELL: Well, I guess if we were in that situation, we would feel the
same way. But you know, it's a new year, different teams. We are definitely a
different team than we were last year. I guess if we were in that situation,
we would probably say the same thing, what coaches use for motivation and all.
I can understand that because we would probably be the same way.  
Again, it's different year and a whole different platform. I'm sure they will
be very, very motivated to play us because of how it ended last year.  
  
Q. You've always been so successful at recruiting players out of South
Carolina; is that a challenge now with Dawn in Colombia?  
COACH HATCHELL: Well, you have to understand my background, because I've got
probably more houses and real state in South Carolina than I do in North
Carolina, and my husband is from down there. I won two national championships
at Francis Marion with all South Carolina players. My camp staff in the summer
is‑‑ probably half my camp staff is South Carolina high school coaches. I have
a tremendous background and relationship down there with a lot of people; you
know, I'm South Carolina sports Hall of Fame.  
I've always just referred to the Carolinas, because I do claim South Carolina
a lot. I've always just said the Carolinas because I couldn't be at North
Carolina for 29 years and have had the success that I have had if it wasn't
for what happened to me the first seven years in South Carolina, and I don't
want to ever forget those people because they are so important to me, and like
I said, my husband's from Florence.  
So I have tremendous connections and all with South Carolina. And the South
Carolina kids, I won two championships with all South Carolina kids, so for me
the high school coaches there are my very, very good friends. And success at
anything is about relationships with anything and I have tremendous
relationships with very many people in the State of South Carolina. And we've
had some really good players. I have two of my assistant coaches are from
South Carolina: Andrew Calder, and Ivory Latta is from McConnells, South
Carolina.  
But there's no doubt that Dawn and her staff have really rebuilt that program.
We've always gone head‑to‑head not just with South Carolina but a lot of
people but because there's been a lot of good players out of there. I noticed
in my 40 years of coaching that things go in cycles like this.  
So there have been some years that South Carolina is just loaded with great
players and then there was some years that it was pretty thin, and then all of
a sudden there's great players again. And they have done a really good job
keeping a lot of those players there.  
Of course we have Xylina on our team who is not playing and we have really had
to adjust to her being out; and Latifah, our starting point guard, is from
South Carolina; our starting forward player is from Goose Creek, N'Dea Bryant.  
I just recruit kids that I think fit me, you know, that are good kids and‑‑
the relationships, a lot of times it's with their high school coaches
everything. But recruiting has always been tough, but like I said, Dawn and
them has done a great job of keeping the local kids home.  
I mean, you look at the roster, I was in the room back there a while ago and I
was looking at their roster and all of a sudden, I went down the list, and I
thought, man, half their team comes to my camps. Really, at least five or six
on the roster that came to my basketball camps. But a lot of that's the
relationships that I had with our high school coaches and everything like
that.  
But that's a good thing. It really is good. Recruiting is always tough. Your
basic question was about, is it tougher‑‑ well, okay, it is. But recruiting is
always tough because if it's not South Carolina in there, it's Tennessee or
Connecticut. You know, we thought we had a great shot at getting Kalana Greene
out of there and Geno comes in and takes her out. And I never thought a kid
from that part of South Carolina would end up in Connecticut, but she did, had
a great year there.  
When you've got great players, you're going to have all the top schools there,
but there's no doubt Dawn and her staff have done a good job.  
  
Q. Talking about McDaniel being out ‑‑ is she anywhere near being close to
playing a couple months from now when the season is over?  
COACH HATCHELL: We were hoping she was going to be where she could play but
she's not. We're going to try to get a year of eligibility back for her
because she's right on the borderline with the time period. It wouldn't make a
difference if she was out there the whole year. Really proud of my team for
adjusting. First three or four weeks that she was out, we were trying a little
bit of everything.  
We lost a couple games during that time that we probably should not have lost
but we were trying to adjust to her being gone. But now we have adjusted. I
think N'Dea Bryant from Goose Creek, South Carolina has done a good job.
Danielle has stepped up in there. Sometimes we put Allisha Gray at the fore
position. So we tried a lot of different things but our kids have adjusted and
I really am proud of the way probably the last three or four weeks, how we
have played.  
But there's no doubt that Xylina would help if she was in there but she will
not play. She's not going to be ready for probably another six weeks or so.
But hopefully we'll be able to get another year back for her. And she wants to
play so badly in this game.  
I mean, the other night after the game in the locker room, she was begging the
doctors, begging them to let her play in this game but they said she's not
ready.  
  
Q. Is your team probably more versatile than it may have been if she had
been out there the whole year?  
COACH HATCHELL: That's a good question. There's no doubt that those kids have
gotten better confidence‑wise, everything. Those players filling in there have
definitely improved and gotten better, our team has a little different look
and all.  
So that's a positive for all them. But we definitely miss her being in there,
how tough she is. She's just so physical and tough and the mentality that she
has. She plays like her dad. We definitely miss that.  
  
Q. Is there a difference between coaching against Coach Staley as a player
and her as a coach, because she still seems to carry that same dynamic
personality?  
COACH HATCHELL: Well, when Dawn was playing at Virginia is when I was just
getting started at North Carolina, oh, Lordy, those were some nightmare games
for me because we weren't very good, you know, and Dawn was I guess maybe the
best player in the country at that time, I don't know. But those Virginia
teams were Final Four teams, even though they never won a National
Championship, but they were Final Four teams. She was pretty dynamic as a
player.  
Of course I know Dawn well. We were in the '13 class for the Naismith, she as
a player, me as a coach, so I know Dawn well. I'm sure she carries that
personality into her style of coaching, as well.  
  
Q. You mentioned N'Dea Bryant. How have you seen her progress as a player,
as more has been asked as the season has gone on?  
COACH HATCHELL: Her confidence level, no doubt‑‑ she has a really, really good
jumpshot from like 10, 12, 15 feet. She can just knock them down and knock
them down and knock them down. The one thing I want her to do is go to the
basket more, be more aggressive, taking the ball to the hoop and getting on
the foul line.  
But she has really, really nice sweet jumpshot and she can make threes but
that 12‑, 15‑foot jumper, as people‑‑ lots of teams have tried to double
Stephanie, and N'Dea has had that shot. She does, and then also Danielle, as
well, has that shot. But N'Dea has a really nice shot. She really has. And
she's just gotten better overall. I think a lot of it is her confidence. Great
kid. Great kid.  
Can I say one thing? First I want to say a great big thank you to Greensboro
because no one does it better. We've had our ACC Tournament here for years and
it's great to be back. We were here a couple weeks ago. But these folks do a
fantastic job, and I've been coaching a long time, and trust me, I and
everybody else, we appreciate the commitment that they have made to NCAA
women's basketball.  
Again I just want to do a shout out to the Greensboro Sports Council, the ACC
and everybody involved, because they just do a tremendous job.  
  
Q.How much does playing South Carolina in the NCAA Tournament game mean to
you?  
LATIFAH COLEMAN: It means a lot. It started as a rivalry between the Carolinas
and it's always a fun game to play in. A lot of talk back home about the whole
going to North Carolina and not going to South Carolina thing, so it's always
a pretty good game for me.  
  
Q. What do you remember about playing South Carolina last year obviously
during the regular season and then in the Sweet16?  
THE MODERATOR: Let's start with Allisha.  
ALLISHA GRAY: It was definitely a very intense game, very fast paced.  
STEPHANIE MAVUNGA: I remember both of them were very competitive games. It was
a game of runs, both games. They got their runs on us and we got our runs on
them. It was just really competitive, and it was just two fun games and two
great teams competing against each other and we just happened to win both of
them.  
LATIFAH COLEMAN: Yeah, exactly like they said, it was a very competitive and
very fun game to play in.  
  
Q. What have you noticed they have changed in their team and also have you
changed in the last year?  
THE MODERATOR: Same order.  
ALLISHA GRAY: From what I've seen, they are a better team than what we were
last year but so are we. Wait, what was the‑‑ oh, we definitely‑‑ yeah, we
definitely became a better team. We are definitely more aggressive.  
STEPHANIE MAVUNGA: I think that we have just matured on the court. We are
really blending and we are really‑‑ just we are faster, too. Everything is
just flowing. Though we have lost two players, one to injury, one to a
transfer, I think that we are still strong.  
And I think that a lot of people don't realize that it affected us to begin
with not having Xylina around whenever she got injured. But I think that now
we are really coming together and now we really settled down and really know
each other's games now and we look like we have played together for much
longer than we really have.  
And if South Carolina, they have gotten a lot better. I think they are a
little more post‑oriented than they were last year, and they have gotten
quicker, as well. They just look like they are really flowing out there. They
really know the tendencies of one another and they just really look like a
real team, like a real unit, and I think that that's kind of scary, as well.  
LATIFAH COLEMAN: And I can't really follow that up. Pretty much said
everything.  
  
Q. You said you're a better team than last year and I agree with you after
watching both of you play a lot of games yet you lost an All ‑American player
early and you've been able to compensate for that. Why do you think y'all have
been able to make yourselves a deeper team and also more of a versatile
team?  
ALLISHA GRAY: This year we definitely played with a chip on our shoulder
because from the start we've been doubted. Many people didn't think we would
make it this far from the beginning of the season, and we just came together
as a team to show and prove people wrong that we are a better team than what
we were last year.  
STEPHANIE MAVUNGA: I agree with that and also I think that now we are much
more of a team and we don't really look to one or two individuals to just
really show up every single day, and I feel like maybe one player is going to
have a bad game every now and then or such.  
But I feel like on any given day any given player can step up on our team and
that's really big for us. It's not always one consistent leading scorer; it's
not always one consistent leading rebounder, steals, whatever. We have someone
that leads in every category in different ways and different games, and I
think that's really big because we look for five people on the court at once,
not just one or two players now. We really play as a team, as a unit and we
are all together, rather than broken apart, and I think that really shows.  
  
Q. Considering this is almost like a home game, do you think y'all have an
advantage for this game ‑‑  
ALLISHA GRAY: Not necessarily. I just think that being North Carolina is neat
just because people don't really have to drive as far as maybe they would have
had to as other teams playing in places in the Sweet16.  
But South Carolina has brought a lot of fans to their games this year, so I
think that it's going to be pretty even in terms of fans that they are
bringing to the game as we are. So I think there's going to be a lot of red
and there's going to be a lot of blue, too.  
  
Q. Stephanie, you mentioned South Carolina's more post ‑oriented this year.
Already in the Tournament you faced a lot of height and physicality and a
really fast post player in Ohio State. What specific challenges do this team's
post players bring?   
STEPHANIE MAVUNGA: They have more height than Ohio State this. I think they
have more height than just one person, whereas Heart for Ohio State was their
tallest player and maybe their fore player wasn't as tall.  
With South Carolina, their starting post is tall, their bench players are tall
and they all really come in there and just really pose a challenge in the
post. But they are really poised and they really know exactly how to guard a
post player. And so it's going to be a nice challenge but then again we'll
just see how it goes.  
  
Q. Talk about the fans ‑‑ the rims and the shooting background and the floor
and things like that, having played in here so many times, should have be a
big advantage? Is it usually?   
LATIFAH COLEMAN: It is an advantage like being used to the gym. I don't think
they have ever had to play here so it should be just kind of an edge for us,
just coming off the ACC Tournament here, so it should be kind of an edge.  
  
Q. For any of the players, when you played Stanford this year, do you have
any feelings ‑‑ from your season last year that those feelings may be the type
of feelings that the South Carolina players had‑‑ can you remember back to
that?   
STEPHANIE MAVUNGA: You always really come out with a different attitude when
you're playing someone who has previously beaten you, especially when it's a
season‑ending loss.  
When we played Stanford earlier this year, of course we really wanted to beat
them to sort of give us a type of revenge for them beating us the year before.
But then again, it's not the same Stanford team. It's never the exact same
team that you're playing, because Stanford lost some players and they are a
whole different basketball team when we played them down in Hawai'i than when
we played them at Stanford last year.  
So of course it always feels good to beat Stanford because it's still the
Stanford program. It's not the same exact team or same situation; otherwise
you would have rather beat them in the Elite 8 and in a tournament game.  
But here, I think that South Carolina has the same exact situation, four seed,
one seed; Sweet16 game against the same exact team. So that game is really set
up like the same exact way that the one last year was set up. Of course I feel
as if they really want to beat us, and in a press conference I heard the
different quotes and some of them saying that this is exactly what they
wanted.  
I think it's going to be a really good game. It's going to be a tough game, of
course, and they are going to be out to get us and they are going to play with
a chip on their shoulder just because we ended their season last year and that
brings a lot of pain from that experience last year.

_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  
Q. Something the Arizona State coach said was the good teams are the
simplest to prepare for; it's not that they do a lot of things but they do a
few things extremely well. Do you agree with that statement?  
COACH SEMRAU: Do I agree with the statement that good teams‑‑  
  
Q. Are the simplest to prepare for?  
COACH SEMRAU: Are the simplest to prepare for. Not all good teams. I think we
are relatively simple to prepare for in the types of things that we do, and we
do try to do a few things extremely well. That's our philosophy and it's been
good to us.  
  
Q. Speaking of the things that you do do well, is rebounding probably the
biggest strength of the Florida State team so far and how has it served you
throughout the tournament?  
COACH SEMRAU: Obviously it's the best thing that we do. We are very keyed in
on that.  
I think, Jordan, when you talk about being easy to prepare for, we don't run a
lot of multiple jump defenses; so what if they do, this we are going to run
this; what if they do this, we are going to run this.  
We try to be really, really good at our man‑to‑man defense and I think that
that enables us to know where things are coming and enables us to rebound the
ball very well. And a year ago, we were really easy to prepare for because we
were all dumb. For us it's really just about personnel and who we have.  
  
Q. Does this Arizona State team look similar to the one you played in 2009,
just stylistically?  
COACH SEMRAU: I don't remember 2009. I remember the outcome but I don't
remember the team, the team style as much. But I know Charlie, I know she's an
excellent coach. I know that they are very fundamental. They are physical.
They are tough. They play great defense. They rebound the ball extremely well.
They take care of the ball.  
I mean, not many teams in the country right now can say they have more assists
than turnovers. She's had a great balance of players. She has strength, she
has speed, she has size. I think they are a great basketball team:  
  
Q. Leti Romero, most coaches know that ‑‑ she is one of the first people
they name when they talk about preparing for this team. Talk about what a lift
she's been since she became eligible in December.   
COACH SEMRAU: One of the things we talk about a lot is the American basketball
game: There's a lot of attack; there's a lot of desire to go one‑on‑one,
because that's what you see on television in the NBA and I think that's how we
are brought up.  
In the European game, I think there's much more of a,
let‑the‑game‑come‑to‑you‑type attitude. If you want somebody in Spain to like
not be to crazy‑faced, tranquila, tranquila, and I think sometimes that's what
Leti plays like, tranquilamente. Just checking it out, seeing what everything,
how the game plays out, what comes to her. So she is a special kid and I think
she's a great balance for our team.  
  
Q. Can that mind ‑set almost serve as a calming influence at times on the
floor if it's needed?   
COACH SEMRAU: I don't think so much just a calming influence; I think it's a
great balance for the way that you run your offense. Yeah, I don't‑‑ calming
influence maybe for a coach but I think, too, for her team, they know she has
control and she's waiting for the best moments.  
  
Q. Arizona had a tough game last Sunday. Do you see anything you can take
advantage of or weaknesses in their game?  
COACH SEMRAU: I think we are so different than UALR ‑‑ U‑A‑L‑R, good, can roll
that one off my tongue. But Little Rock is just a motion team. They set a lot
of screens away from the ball. They are very similar to Florida Gulf Coast who
we played last Sunday. I think there's a lot of differences, so not sure we'll
take away a whole lot from that.  
  
Q. Welcome back to Greensboro. Last time you were here, pretty good run.
Have you taken notice of maybe the irony that you could knock through the
barrier and get through?  
COACH SEMRAU: I'll be taking a look at that, absolutely. But I think more
importantly is just the comfort level that we'll have being in Greensboro,
having played three games in the last month on this floor is truly something
special as my team comes back.  
  
Q. Your team plays defense that Arizona State plays ‑‑ how can that manifest
itself in this game in terms of a defensive‑minded game‑‑  
COACH SEMRAU: Say that one more time.  
  
Q. Just the defense that both teams play.  
COACH SEMRAU: I think it's going to be‑‑ it's going to be hard to score on
both sides of the ball. I think for both teams it's going to be hard to score.  
And you know, just the pride that both teams take in their defense, I think
can be really exciting for the fans to much with a. You know, even though
sometimes you think, defense, defense, that's not fun for the fans. But I
think it's going to be a really exciting game.  
  
Q. Curious your thoughts on the influence of the Spanish players and kind of
the influx over the last couple years, obviously you've had a few, and just
kind of what that maybe meant to the sport and to your program in
particular.  
COACH SEMRAU: You know, I think one thing I always felt was important in
coaching was that you blended individual players into a team; that I didn't
want somebody that was just like a Adut Bulgak or just like Brittany Brown. I
wanted someone to complement them.  
We used to look at that in the States. When you look at someone in the Midwest
played a different game than someone in Florida, and so we would work to try
to complement those players.  
Now, to say that we can go worldwide, that is even more exciting. For us
having Leonor Rodríguez a couple years ago, she changed us, and she was a
difference‑maker.  
So I knew I loved that style of basketball. So then to have Leticia, and then
yet another Spanish player looking for next fall, it's really, to me, I've
loved that. I love having Ama Degbeon, someone from Germany. I love having a
Adut Bulgak, who is from Canada. Just a different mind‑set coming together, it
just sharpens everybody on the team.  
  
Q. Did you have to develop a strategy for recruiting in Europe? Is it
different?  
COACH SEMRAU: It is different. We didn't have a strategy originally. Some of
these things just came to us, as our players went over seas and noticed
players and then just mentioned them to us. That's how it started with Leo;
Brooke Wyckoff played with Leonor Rodríguez. Those things are I think
happening all over the country.  
Look at the number of European players that are coming to play in the States.
You are seeing that as the world gets smaller, the basketball influence is
getting bigger.  
  
Q. You just talked about the defensive mind ‑set of the game, but on
offense, if it is becoming a defensive struggle who on your team do you look
to to provide that offensive lift when you have four or five players
averagingdouble digits?  
COACH SEMRAU: Jordan, you know the answer to that. For us it's somebody
different every night and that's the cool thing. I can't tell you who it's
going to be tomorrow night.  
And we, from the beginning, were saying, who is that go to be; who is that
go‑to, go‑to, go‑to. There still is not one, but there is one; we just don't
know who it will be. Does that make sense?  
  
Q. The similarity to Arizona State, too, they have that kind of balance. But
I wanted to ask you specifically about Katie Hempen, their three ‑point
shooter, just kind of what you've seen in her.   
COACH SEMRAU: I love her game. And I was familiar with Amanda Levens when I
was at Wisconsin. I had a player who played at Belvedere when I was at
Northern Illinois. Amanda came to camp. We tried to recruit Amanda. Loved her
as a player. And she reminds me a little bit of Amanda Levens and I know she
came with Amanda. So I'm very familiar with that. I love her game. I love her
style of play. You know, she's a special kid.  
  
Q. Your name comes up a lot when coaches are talking about their game plan
for Florida State. Is that extra pressure on you knowing that coaches are
looking specifically to shut you down when they are playing Florida State?  
LETICIA ROMERO: Not at all because I know I have‑‑ I know my team has depth
and they can't focus on one player or two. They are going to have to focus on
everybody, because if they focus on me, Adut, Shakayala, Maegan, Brittany, I
mean, it's impossible to just down one player, if you are going to stop our
team.  
  
Q. Being a freshman how do you feel about being in the tournament for the
first time?  
SHAKAYLA THOMAS: I feel like one of those great feelings ‑‑ considering I've
got a great team behind me, they are leading me in every direction to show me
what it will be like. Like they are setting me up to win, yeah.  
  
Q. Do you feel like especially since the ACC Tournament and the last few
games in the NCAA Tournament your game has come on even stronger over the last
couple weeks?  
SHAKAYLA THOMAS: I actually do. I mean, like in practice, I've been working
hard trying to get better, banging with the big post, the actual post. I mean,
like, it's just great. Like I'm just really working harder.  
Q. Do you feel like that's come on as a result of the experience that you've
gained and just having so many games under your belt now?  
SHAKAYLA THOMAS: Yeah, I think so, and it feels like I know I have to bring
something to the able so I don't want to just have the same game every time
and show people something new.  
  
Q. And for Adut, you hear lots of teams this time of year say that don't
look at when you look at freshmen as freshmen anymore. When you look at
Shakayla, do you still see a freshman or do you not any longer?  
ADUT BULGAK: In some aspects, like little tiny mistakes. But other than that,
she's really taken on her role and the responsibility that we've handed to
her. And on the basketball court, I don't really see her as a freshman just
because of how she's developing. She's maturing on the court.  
  
Q. Do you know Quinn Dornstauder, at all?  
ADUT BULGAK: Yeah we played together on the Canadian Developmental National
team this summer where we won the Jones Cup tournament in Taiwan. I got to
play with her.  
  
Q. Is it an advantage either way or does it work out even since you both
know each other?  
ADUT BULGAK: Both. I guess I know a little bit of her personnel but then again
we've been playing DivisionI college basketball for, what, six, seven months
now without playing on the same team. So I'm pretty sure she's developed in
areas I don't know about, just like I've developed my game so it will be a
little surprise.  
  
Q. And for all of you, I guess your coach, she think it's going to be
difficult to score because of the way you both play defense. Can you talk
about how you think the defensive side of this game is going to go?  
  
LETICIA ROMERO: Well, I think for us, they are going to press us a lot. I
mean, just in the film that we have seen about them; that they like to deny
the ball; they like to press harder, and I think that's going to be
challenging for us.  
And the way we defend, it's pretty much the same. We picked up the ball really
early and we really put a lot of work in defense and rebounding. We don't let
other teams‑‑ we try to keep other teams from rebounding the ball in offense.
So I think it's going to be definitely a defensive game, like we are going to
see a lot of defense in the game.  
ADUT BULGAK: I think the key is to control the pace. Like we need to set the
tone first, and like Leti said, they will be pressing us, so I guess the most
important thing in the game is to take care of the basketball.  
And watching film, they did a great job of squaring up for their players and
boxing them out, so we are going to have to find ways to get around their
box‑outs and pursue the ball on rebounds.  
SHAKAYLA THOMAS: Yeah, I agree with Adut on setting the tone. We are a
fast‑paced team and we like to play fast but I feel like they are going to try
to slow us down to get us on their levels to set plays and make moves and
stuff. It's up to us to just go out there and play.  
  
Q. You guys watched the game against Arkansas, Little Rock, what did you see
during that game? You obviously are a very resilient team able to come back
from 16 points down; your thoughts on that game and what can you carry that
game into this one?  
LETICIA ROMERO: I mean, that mentality that we were talking about, that we
think we have, too, that mentality that no matter what happens, no matter what
the game is at that point, we want it so bad that we are going to work for it.  
And no matter if we are losing ‑‑ and they have the same thing. They were
losing by a pretty big difference and they came back. So I think that's going
to be‑‑ like our game is going to be pretty tight and we both are similar
teams in that way. So it's going to be interesting.  
ADUT BULGAK: We can't be complacent. Obviously no lead is big enough. So we're
going to have to play the entire 40 minutes and not like look past any little
thing they do. So we've just got to stay consistent the whole game.  
SHAKAYLA THOMAS: We can't be satisfied with what place we're in right now. I
mean, this is up for grabs. Anybody can win. So I feel like we should just
keep our hands up and keep playing the whole game.  
  
Q. You said you've been in a bit of a rebounding slump, you had 13 against
Florida Gulf Coast; is that a jumping point to move forward for the rest of
the tournament?  
ADUT BULGAK: I guess it's just a reminder of, hey, you've still got it. I
wouldn't say it's a big confidence booster, but it definitely is a reminder of
my identity on the basketball court, so, yeah.

_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  
Q. Sue said she thinks it's going to be really hard for either team to
score. Can you talk about the similarities of the teams on defense and sort of
the even ‑balanced scoring on offense?   
COACH TURNER THORNE: Yes, I agree with that. Watching quite a bit of film at
this point. I mean, they have five people in double figures; they average 75
points a game; they are a great offensive rebounding team.  
But actually, their defense stood out. They hold teams. They play great team
defense. They do a great job of limiting you to one shot. Little different
than us in terms of the style but very similar in the results.  
So I think both of us want to push the tempo, get transition. So I think
transition defense and limiting‑‑ the team that takes away the transition game
and limits the other team to one shot the best is going to have the advantage
for sure.  
  
Q. How are you preparing different from the last game that you had?  
COACH TURNER THORNE: Well, I feel like the last game was good for us. I think
having a game like this where your offense, you are missing shots that you
normally make and you struggle, and you really have to flex your toughness
muscle and find a way to win. In all my years in deep runs in the tournament,
that's helped us. Last time we actually came to Greensboro in 2007, we were
the third seed ‑‑ we were in L.A. and we struggled to win both of our games.
We just didn't score well.  
And then we came here and won it fairly easily in our first game. I think
those close games can really help you. Obviously we are a good team and we
know how to stay with things, and our defense can usually keep us in any game.  
Very different game to prepare for. At the same time, we also need to do what
we do. We need to rebound better. We need to have a better transition defense.
I think we could be better in just about every area from the last game except
for our toughness. And even in the first half, I don't think we were very
tough and very together like we usually are as a team.  
So I think the fun thing for us right now‑‑ you know, we were at home, I think
we all felt a little bit of pressure. We had the top seed and we only have one
senior. We're a younger team and we kind of expected to win. Our
administration made an incredible move to allow us to host because we were
supposed to host Pac‑12 gymnastics that weekend. I don't know, I think our
team was just really tight.  
Now we are across the country, nobody's picked us to win. Sometimes, in my
experience, that's not a bad thing.  
  
Q. You talk about coming across the country. Your team is from much further
away than any of the other schools. Do you consider that a disadvantage,
especially since Florida State just played here in the ACC Tournament?  
COACH TURNER THORNE: We're certainly not at an advantage, you know, when you
look at these three teams, and I'm sure that they will draw well. Their fans
will travel well. Although, we have got some pretty loyal fans; we have got
some Midwest people that are not afraid to drive. But yeah, I think a little
bit of an advantage.  
At the same time, it's a regional. It's a neutral site. It's the NCAA
Tournament. We're used to getting shipped out. Every deep run we've had, we've
been shipped out. We've been in Greensboro and we've been in Trenton and we've
played well. We've played teams that have been in their regions.  
And this team, our Sun Devil team has been a great road team. We play in the
Pac‑12 Conference. We are used to tough environments, big crowds. Won't be
anything that we haven't senior dealt with, so we are excited.  
  
Q. They are No. 3 in the country in rebounding. Can you talk about why they
are such a good rebounding team and maybe if there are some of their players
that individually stand out to you?  
COACH TURNER THORNE: Well, they are relentless and they use all their
athleticism. They are relentless. They work. They obviously value it and they
understand the importance of it. They have got really‑‑ from the guard spot,
Brown is an incredible rebounder. She reminds me of Jamie Weisner; averaging
almost basically three offensive rebounds a game.  
And then all of their posts are fantastic rebounders, and so they are kind
of‑‑ I called Thomas Rodman in the film session today, because she is sitting
on that weak side block getting position before the shot even goes up. So Sue
has done an amazing job. They understand. You look at Florida State's stats,
and they are the stats of the teams that you usually see in the Final Four:
Plus 12, plus 13 on the boards, and their field goal percentage is fantastic.
They just do a lot of things really well, and the biggest thing is rebounding.  
  
Q. A freshman like Shakayla Thomas, how much does she stand out to you?
She's leading the team in scoring throughout this tournament right now and
she's coming off the bench. How much does they stand out to you as a coach?  
COACH TURNER THORNE: She stands out. I mean, wow, she is talented. I had heard
about her but now I've actually watched her quite a bit, and she's‑‑ it's hard
to believe when you watch her, she's just a freshman. Because she plays‑‑ not
only is she talented in scoring the basketball and she's rebounding the
basketball. But just her energy and her intensity while she plays and
sometimes you don't see that in a first‑year player. Very impressive.  
  
Q. How about Romero, what do you think she's brought to them in terms of her
style of play?  
COACH TURNER THORNE: Yeah, Romero is a great leader for them. I watched
Florida State only one time before we knew we were going to play them and that
was against Washington in Cancún where Washington in our conference beat them,
and they didn't even look like the same team.  
And you know, sometimes it's an early game and I don't think they played well.
But I think Romero has done a fantastic job coming in and just running that
team. She's an aggressive scoring point guard, very savvy. Making great
decisions, obviously a great find, get, whatever you want to say; they have
had a number of transfers.  
And I think she's a huge‑difference maker for that team. And I think she plays
beyond her years. I don't know if that's her international experience, but she
doesn't seem like a sophomore out there, that's for sure.  
  
Q. What do you know about Florida State and from what you've watched so far
can you compare them with anybody you've seen?  
PROMISE AMUKAMARA: I notice‑‑ well, we all notice that they are a great
rebounding team. So we are going to have to really control the boards in this
game. I'm not really sure the comparison. They are a different team‑‑  
KATIE HEMPEN: Yeah, I'm not for sure either.  
SOPHIE BRUNNER: I would say probably a mixture of Stanford and Oregon State,
just how hard they play and rebound and just how good they are.  
  
Q. Will there seem to be quite a few similarities between the type of
defense they have and also the balanced scoring; do you see that when you
watch them on film?  
PROMISE AMUKAMARA: Yeah, I think they all‑‑ like there's no one you cannot
guard. They are all scorers.  
And what was the other question? Oh, yeah, they are a great defensive team.
Like I said, they do a really good job of rebounding and stuff. We really need
to do well in our game, rebound, as well.  
KATIE HEMPEN: Just like what Prom said, rebounding is key. But in comparison,
they love to run the floor. They love to hit 1‑4, 1‑2‑4\. They like to go
inside to their post. They can kick it out to the three.  
In comparison so us, we do the same thing. We look in transition; we like to
shoot the three. Everybody on our team can score, and Florida State can't back
down off any of our guards or in our post because everybody is a threat, which
is nice.  
Even our bench players are a huge threat and Florida State's bench is also a
good threat for them. So I think it is going to be fun. We are both really
tough teams going head‑to‑head.  
SOPHIE BRUNNER: Yeah, in comparison to them, I think second shots are crucial
to both of us, so that's a big key, and we're both going to have to box out
for it to be a good game.  
And just taking away their tendencies on defense, I think is going to be huge
for us, and running them and just being ready to attack them on offense.  
  
Q. I know you're 15 points away from 1,000 points for your career, but
you've also been honored numerous times for your defense. Talk about your
pride in being a well ‑rounded player and what do you think is the strongest
part of your game?   
PROMISE AMUKAMARA: I think the strongest part of my game is just being able to
lock down on defense. And then offensively, I think just getting to the basket
and beating my player.  
  
Q. What feelings do you have about reaching this level? You watched this
tournament growing up and this is where you want to get to, and now you're
playing in the Sweet16. Can you just talk about the emotions you're feeling at
this stage?  
SOPHIE BRUNNER: For me just being a sophomore, it's just a great feeling
knowing that all of our hard work has paid off. We've been working at this
from even last April from when we lost in the first round.  
So I think it's just a really big feeling of excitement, but also knowing that
we still have a lot of hard work ahead of us to get done and that we are not
just coming to play for the Sweet16. We are coming to play for the Elite 8 and
go on from that. We are just excited as a group and just filled with joy.  
KATIE HEMPEN: For me personally, I think it's a blessing. The blessing comes
from just being with my teammates, and it's awesome having teammates that work
as hard as you and really work to be a better person off and on the court.  
And playing in the Sweet16 is every kid's dream, every kid's like basketball
dream, anyway. And going to the Elite 8 after this is another dream. Like what
Sophie said, we are here to play for the win. We are not here just to play for
a Sweet16.  
PROMISE AMUKAMARA: Like Katie said, it's been a blessing. Personally for my
senior year, I've never been this far the whole four years‑been at ASU, and so
I'm really excited‑‑ I'm just excited.  
  
Q. For promise, how do you feel being the only senior on the team? Do you
feel there's more pressure each day and that each game could be your last
game?  
PROMISE AMUKAMARA: Not really pressure. Just put it in perspective that I need
to work hard every play because, you know, it could be my last game. So just
taking it play by play and just going 100 percent.  
  
Q. This is for all the players, if you can address this. Just wondering if
any of you have been to the Greensboro area before? Are you familiar with it,
and how do you feel about travel so far, is that a disadvantage or is there
some excitement?  
PROMISE AMUKAMARA: This is my first team being here and it's amazing out here.
It's very pretty.  
I think it's‑‑ I think it's an advantage, actually, because we get to focus
and really be locked into these games, and just not have any distractions
while we're away.  
KATIE HEMPEN: Same thing as Prom. I look at it as an advantage, too. We become
more focused and I think our connectedness and togetherness really shows when
we are away.  
And for the traveling part, coming from Illinois, this is just another ride
home that we come for Christmas or Thanksgiving for Sophie and I. I don't
think traveling really bugs us. Our coaches and our trainers do a great job of
keeping us healthy and making sure we have the right food in our system and
making sure we are hydrated. I don't think there's a disadvantage in traveling
this far.  
SOPHIE BRUNNER: Yeah, going off what they said, I agree with that they say.
And to add to it, I think it's just fun. We get to be more connected and with
each other and on the same page. We are not worried about what someone is
doing or anything like that. We know where we are all at, and I think it's
just a big advantage.  
And we get to play closer to home, so we'll have people that come support us
and we have a good following with that, so I think that will be fun, too.  
  
Q. You have a couple common opponents, Washington, Miami; is there anything
you can draw off those at all, and also for Sophie, the other night, I don't
know if I've ever seen you quite so excited. Wondering what you were feeling
at the end of coming back from getting that victory.  
SOPHIE BRUNNER: Yeah, to answer your question about the game, I was just
really excited knowing that we came‑‑ we were down 16 at one point and we came
back, and I knew, you could just feel the momentum.  
Yeah, I don't really get excited like that but it wasn't really excitement for
me per se. It might look like that but I was just excited about our team; like
I knew at that point that we were going to come back and win it, just like
with the momentum and excitement and how together we were playing.  
So that's just how excited I was, and just knowing that we overcame that lead
that they had.  
KATIE HEMPEN: I guess the fact that there's a couple teams that we've both
played, it kind of shows how they played against Washington or Washington
played against them, and Miami, same thing.  
I don't know if you guys remember, but Miami was very athletic and Miami is
very quick. And so just to see the pace and how they controlled it was an
advantage to us to see, you know, because we like to transition a lot, just to
see how they handled transition and how they handled quickness is helpful to
our advantage.  
And Washington has some great shooters and some great posts, so I think the
fact of how they handled their great shooters and their great posts helps us
in seeing what works for us and what doesn't.  
  
Q. From your experience in the last game, are you more focused on this game
after the last home game?  
PROMISE AMUKAMARA: I think we're more focused in on this game because of we
weren't‑‑ we didn't really key on the points that we were supposed to key on
during that game, and so it kind of showed up. So I think this game, we are
really locked in on what we need to get done.  
KATIE HEMPEN: And then towards your comment, I want to say that we weren't
focused our last game. Just like what Promise said. We just need to be able to
shut down their tendencies a little bit more. I think this game, being away‑‑
I mean, we are always focused more on away trips because it's easier to stay
focused. There's not many distractions. Our coaches do a great job of keeping
us down‑to‑earth and making sure that we hear the right things.  
SOPHIE BRUNNER: Yeah, going off what they said, I think just being now the
underdog in the tournament, I think that will go to our advantage because we
have been used to that throughout the whole year.  
So yeah, I don't think we took Arkansas lightly. I just don't think we were as
focused as we needed to be and we need to key in on key players, so we are
going to make that adjustment this next game and have more success.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  

Notre Dame  77  
Baylor - 68

  
MUFFET McGRAW: That was amazing. I think that was one of the best games in
terms of our persistence, our relentless approach. We got down early and we
just never quit, and we kept coming back, kept coming at them, did what we had
to do. I thought Lindsay Allen was just the best point guard in the country
today, just an amazing game, tournament MVP. What a great job by this young
team that we thought maybe was a year away, and now here we are back in our
fifth straight Final Four.  
  
Q. Jewell, talk a little bit about the performance by Lindsay and how close
the two of you are on the court and off.  
JEWELL LOYD: Well, she's like my twin, really, and she's unstoppable. I think
people have really underestimated her, and for us she's been awesome all year,
it's been awesome to see how talented she is. She's great, and she's my big
sis. I'm older, she's my big sis. I look up to her on the court and off the
court. She's very humble. She's the MVP.  
  
Q. Jewell, for you and Lindsay, I know you guys are excited about tonight,
and if you could describe how excited you are just to have this and get back
again, but also I guess looking forward, how much maybe last year drives you
going back to the Final Four and how much you still feel like you have left
out there.  
JEWELL LOYD: I am enjoying the moment right now with this team and this
program. We were just so excited to get this job done right now. We're a big
family, we're all still kids and we're loving it. Michaela also in the game
was great, so we're just enjoying the moment.  
LINDSAY ALLEN: Yeah, like Jewell said we're excited to be in this moment. When
we're looking back, we're just excited to be making it to another Final Four.  
  
Q. Brianna is not here, but did any of the three of you see what happened
with the flagrant foul in the first half, and can you talk about the momentum
shift that happened after that?  
MADISON CABLE: I didn't see it.  
JEWELL LOYD: Yep, it happens in basketball, but we were focused and ready to
play team defense and team basketball.  
LINDSAY ALLEN: I didn't see it. I can't comment, sorry.  
  
Q. Lindsay, have you ever played two better games back to back do you think
in your career?  
LINDSAY ALLEN: Not that I remember, no. Today was‑‑ this weekend was just a
really great weekend. Our posts set really good screens for us in both games
and the guards got really great free‑throw line jumpers in both games, so this
was a really good shooting weekend overall.  
  
Q. Madison, with about six minutes left in the second half you had a huge
block after a Baylor transition play. What did you see on that play and do you
think that turned a little bit of momentum for you?  
MADISON CABLE: Yeah, I was probably one of the people supposed to be back not
letting them get down in transition, so I ran back and jumped in and got lucky
and got the ball. I think it was good for us that they didn't score there.  
  
Q. Could you speak to adjustments that were made at halftime because you
were trailing on the boards and so forth, and you completely out ‑boarded them
on the offensive and defensive glass significantly in the second half. Can you
talk about what you did to accomplish that?   
LINDSAY ALLEN: I think we changed a little bit of our defense on the ball
screens. It gave the posts a better chance to get the rebound because they
could actually stay with their man on defense. So we just focused on boxing
out and getting rebounds and being tougher inside I would say.  
JEWELL LOYD: Yeah, definitely. I think after I got knocked out, everyone just
got tougher. Everyone was like, we're playing hard, fighting to the end, and
that's what we did. Everyone settled in and we executed our game plan. We
listened to Coach, and she knows what's best.  
MADISON CABLE: Yeah, they're a big, physical team, and we talked about at
halftime that if we don't win the rebounding boards or at least get close
we're not going to win the game, so we came out and we battled.  
  
Q. Jewell, what occurred at the end of the first half that you ended up on
the floor?  
JEWELL LOYD: I mean, it was just a screen against a wall, I don't know. It's
part of basketball, part of sports.  
  
Q. Jewell, is there almost an expectation at this point for you guys? It
seems like there wouldn't be a Final Four without you. At this point is this
almost what you guys expect every season going in?  
JEWELL LOYD: Well, our whole program expects to win. Our program breeds
champions on the court and off the court. For us we're very competitive, and
for us we just want to win.  
  
Q. Lindsay, there at the end when you guys were celebrating you go up the
ladder and they're chanting MVP and you're taking your piece of the net.
Describe what that moment is like and really the whole celebration.  
LINDSAY ALLEN: It's just a great moment just for our team overall to make it
to another Final Four. We fought so hard in this game and we knew coming in it
wouldn't be easy because Baylor is a really good team. We rebounded really
well down the stretch and we were just really excited to win, no matter who
was going to be MVP or who scored the most points.  
  
Q. Madison, talk about the offensive rebounding that the team did in the
second half, and you came up with a big rebound. There were a couple big
offensive rebounds for the team.  
MADISON CABLE: Yeah, kind of like we already said, they're a big, physical
team. We talked about at halftime that we really want to get on the boards if
we want to compete, so we did that, and I think I just kind of crashed.
Sometimes the balls get knocked around, so I tried to get in there and grab
one, and that's what happened on that one offensive rebound.  
  
Q. Have any of you heard whether on Twitter or Facebook or directly, perhaps
even an old ‑fashioned phone call from any of the Notre Dame alum about the
success that you've had this season, particularly in the tournament?   
LINDSAY ALLEN: No, we haven't heard yet but we normally do emails after the
season when we're finished playing with a lot of alums, especially women alums
emailing us and telling us how proud of us they are, so we'll see after the
season.  
JEWELL LOYD: Former players will always give a text after a game or something
like that, or like on Twitter or if we're walking around on campus someone
will come to us and stuff like that. But we're still pretty close to the alums
that were here.  
  
Q. Jewell, was this about as physical of a game as you've had to play?  
JEWELL LOYD: As far as one of the top five probably. Yeah, it was really
physical, and we knew that coming in. You're playing for more than‑‑ you're
playing for your team, you're playing for a chance to go to a Final Four, so
you play with a lot of passion, and that's what the game is going to be like.  
  
Q. How big of a play was Madison Cable's play in the second half for you
tonight?  
MUFFET McGRAW: You know, I thought she had two huge plays, the block on Nina
Davis in transition which was just a huge stop that we had to have at that
point, and then she hit the three at the other end. I thought those two were
really key for us down the stretch.  
  
Q. On that transition play, I thought I was going to be roadkill, so you
might thank Madison for not having run me over. Could you please speak to the
adjustments that you made at halftime, and how did the game itself shape up in
comparison to your scout?  
MUFFET McGRAW: I thought we used the last play in the half as a momentum ‑‑
let's say a motivational point. We talked about guarding the ball screen,
which we did not do effectively at the beginning of the game. Our first plan
was not effective. We went to the zone. That was not effective. We guarded the
screen a different way. That was semi‑effective. We came out in the second
half and we tried to stay with the posts instead of hedging, and I thought
that was much more effective. The guards had a little more trouble getting
around it. We went to the triangle and two. I don't remember what time it was.
Maybe around the 10‑minute mark or so, from 10 to 6 we played a lot of
triangle and two during that stretch, and I think that was very effective. I
thought it took them out of rhythm. They took a few possessions to get
comfortable in it, so we stayed in it. We went back and forth with man, and
then we completely switched all the ball screens late in the game, probably
two‑and‑a‑half minutes and under.  
  
Q. Muffet, I know there's probably more time for reflection between seasons
and after seasons, but does it get more and more satisfying as these Final
Four appearances keep racking up?  
MUFFET McGRAW: You know, it really does. I'll tell you, this one was the
hardest. We had to work the hardest to get to this one. I thought we lost so
much from last year, and we've lost really good players throughout the years,
but last year's experience and not having any senior starters, you know, you
just didn't know how the season was going to unfold. We had so many tough
games. I think we played the toughest schedule in the country, so we learned a
lot throughout it. I thought they came into practice every day ready to learn,
but I still felt we were going to take some lumps at some point, so when we
kept on winning, it just really built our confidence, and I guess in
retrospect, it was better for a young team to build the confidence of winning
rather than to have a learning lesson of losing a game maybe at the end of the
year. I thought the Miami game was kind of a tipping point for us, and ever
since that game I think we've been on a pretty good run. But this one is
incredibly satisfying to see what this team was able to do together.  
  
Q. You've got a lot of contributions, not all of them even show up in the
stat sheet from your bench. At the same time you were able to really limit the
perimeter shooting that was a big three ‑point shooting team but they get that
contribution on a regular basis between Wallace and Prince, really held that
down. Was that part of the game plan and were you doing that specifically?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Well, I was disappointed early on when they made a lot of shots
that we really were hoping we were going to guard them and not let anybody get
a hot hand, that we would kind of key on Davis, try to slow Johnson down a
little bit, but they were the focal points, but we didn't want anybody else to
get hot, and they did. They came out firing. That's who was doing most of the
scoring early were the other players. I thought we adjusted fairly well to
that by getting out on them. But trying to double‑team Davis, that's a
monumental task. She's a great player. She is phenomenal. She is so hard to
guard. She's quick up and down the floor, scores in so many different ways,
really a challenge for us defensively. I don't know if I answered your
question because I've forgotten it.  
So for us being able to rest some people with Hannah Huffman coming in, with
Madison Cable coming in, with Kathryn Westbeld coming in, it gave our starters
a quick rest, and I think they did some good things while they were in the
game, too.  
  
Q. I know next week is next week and you'll get there soon enough, but right
now if you could just describe the comfort level, confidence level that you
have with this group, taking them in.  
MUFFET McGRAW: Well, as a coach, I always see what we can do better, and this
time I'm planning on celebrating it a little bit more because they need that.
They need to understand how special this is, and I will enjoy watching the
freshmen enjoy it because for them it's the first time, and it's going to be a
really special one. I think for the whole team, they had a goal at the
beginning of the season, they got most of the way there. They're not going
into this just happy to be there. We have been there a number of times and not
been able to finish. Each year we feel like maybe this will be our year. But I
think definitely celebrating this whole week of what we accomplished all year
long because only one team is going to win.  
  
Q. Talk a little bit about the development of your young team, but
particularly the development of Lindsay Allen as a player. Do you feel like
this weekend a new star was born in women's college basketball?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Yeah, I think the best point guard in college basketball, but
I've been saying that throughout the year. She really showed it throughout the
night tonight. Last year she was able to come in and simply run the team
without having to be vocal. She had experienced players all around her. She
helped her, they got her comfortable, she took us all the way to the national
championship game by not making mistakes, by not trying to do too much. This
year we asked her to do more. We asked her to score more. We asked her to be
more involved in the offense, to be more vocal, to be the true leader of the
team. And that was a challenge for her, because with a young team there was an
awful lot of talking needed and she's not a very vocal person. So I think to
see her develop, she worked incredibly hard this summer. She came back the
most improved player off the summer. She really looked great when she came
back, looked to score more, I thought was doing so many really good things,
and I think got more attention from the defense with all the players that
graduated. So she was going against better players and playing better.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the defensive mindset of your team, the adjustments
you made and the role defense played in turning the game around after they got
ahead by nine?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Yeah, I thought we kind of held our patience. I thought we were
okay. I thought we looked a little panicky on the court for the first probably
six or eight minutes, and then I thought we calmed down, we played our game.
That's what we kept talking about in the huddle, do what we talked about, do
what we've been doing all year, and defensively we've gotten so much better
holding teams under 70 I think for a long time now, so that was a big goal for
us, and we were able to accomplish it I think because we started to play more
team defense. When Madison comes in she's going to rotate over and take a
charge, and that's the kind of thing‑‑ the blocks and those kind of plays I
think get everybody really fired up defensively.  
  
Q. You said that you didn't put Michaela back in after the game because she
was feeling dizzy. Do you know what happened and if she'll be fine for next
weekend?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Yeah, she's going to be fine. She started and played a couple
minutes and then said she felt light‑headed and one of the assistants said
she's done for the day, not feeling well. I think she's going to be fine,
probably didn't eat enough before the game. I think she's going to be fine.
She sure looked good in the first half.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  

Notre Dame  77  
Baylor - 68

  
Q. Sune, do you think that perhaps you were a marked woman tonight in some
ways because of the flagrant on Friday? Did that affect your game?  
SUNE AGBUKE: You know, I didn't really understand what I could do different,
and it happened, and I don't know, it rattled me for a minute. But I was just
trying to play and trying to get to where I was going. I don't do things‑‑ I
don't throw elbows. I just felt like the rest of the game, the refs kept
telling me don't give us something to look at, don't give us something to look
at, like I was doing it on purpose, and I wasn't.  
  
Q. Nya, you were right in there, right down to the last minute. Talk about
not being able to finish.  
NIYA JOHNSON: That's just on us, not finishing. That's part of focus, and I
thought they beat us with offensive rebounding, so that's something we have to
work on.  
  
Q. Nina, just expanding on what Nya just talked about, the offensive
rebounds they were able to have, I think it was only 16 ‑12 in second chances
but did you feel like that took away chances for to you score?   
NINA DAVIS: Definitely. We knew coming into the game we knew that was
something we couldn't let happen. We couldn't let them get offensive rebounds
and we kind of let that happen in critical moments at the end. They had two or
three critical rebounds at critical moments at the end, and that cost us the
game in the long run.  
  
Q. Late in the game, three starters were playing with four fouls apiece on
your team. Could you talk about how that might have impacted the rebounding on
both ends of the floor?  
NIYA JOHNSON: I don't know, like four fouls you have to play smart at the end
of the day. I guess we tried to stay off of them. They was calling it pretty
tight at the end, and I don't know, it was just difficult playing with four
fouls.  
NINA DAVIS: I cannot even say it really affected us, we all had four fouls,
but you just can't let the fouls stop you. Like Nya said, you have to play
smart but you have to keep battling, and it was a critical moment and we kept
battling, but we just fell short.  
SUNE AGBUKE: Yeah, I have to go with Nina. That's the game, playing with four
fouls for all of us. You've got to keep playing hard, and that's what we tried
to do.  
  
Q. Sune, just talk about this team in general. You guys were picked second
in the conference. You guys roll off a 20 ‑plus game win streak, incredible
run to the Elite 8. Kind of sum up this journey with a team so young. It looks
promising from here to the next couple years.   
SUNE AGBUKE: I've just learned so much about life from this team. We weren't
always the biggest, we weren't always the fastest, we weren't the most
talented, but we battled every day. You know, and we were always‑‑ we always
could learn lessons. We lost two games in a row late in the season, but we
were able to bounce back. That's what we were all about. We just continued to
get better all year from every loss and from every win. We just kept
improving, and there's just not another group of girls that I'd want to go to
war with, and I'm excited for them because next year they'll make it better,
and the year after that they'll only get better, and that's just Baylor for
you, and that's just the kind of program that Coach Mulkey has built here,
that this year we made it to an Elite 8 and we're disappointed because we
couldn't make it further, but next year, man, they're going to be so great.  
  
Q. Nina, in the second half did they do anything different defensively or do
you feel like some of the shots that you were getting weren't falling?  
NINA DAVIS: It was just a game. I was going about it the same way, some shots
went in, some shots rolled out. It happens.  
  
Q. Nina and Nya, obviously outsiders coming into the season didn't
necessarily expect you guys to get this far. I know Coach has talked about the
next couple years are going to be incredible with you guys. Given the fact
that the expectations outside of the program weren't this high, how much do
you think this is going to springboard you guys, making it this far and giving
Notre Dame a run for their money?  
NINA DAVIS: I think right now we really can't see it because we're in a lot of
pain because we fell short and we thought we had a great opportunity to get to
the Final Four, but we had a great season. It was a great journey, and I
wouldn't trade anything in the world for this team or anybody. This is going
to give us a lot of confidence. We have a great class coming in and we pretty
much bring everybody back except for Sune so this is going to give us a lot of
confidence once we get over this right here, and we're going to be all right.  
NIYA JOHNSON: I think it's just motivation and just will make us work harder
in the off‑season and just put in work.  
  
Q. Sune, you talked about having learned a lot from this team. What would
you say that you've learned that you might apply to your career as a lawyer as
you go forward, and what will be your best memory of your time at the
program?  
SUNE AGBUKE: What I've learned that I can apply to my career? We have‑‑ I
think everyone on the team has a great personality and we find ways to laugh
like at times when maybe we shouldn't laugh. So I think that lightheartedness
that sometimes we can use in moments that like we're broken like this and our
hearts are broken but we can go back in the locker room and someone can say
something and we can all kind of crack a smile, and I think that's something
I'll really take with me about not taking everything too seriously. What was
the next question?  
  
Q. What will be your best memory?  
SUNE AGBUKE: I think just getting on everybody's nerves.  
  
Q. I don't want to get you in trouble, but would you comment at all on the
considerable disparity in the number of trips to the foul line, particularly
in light of the fact that you guys were so clean during the standpoint of
collecting personal fouls in the first three rounds of this tournament? And
also, on the difference that that made in rebounding and the momentum of the
game.  
KIM MULKEY: Well, I'll answer it this way so that I don't get in trouble. I
think there were three things that really were critical in the difference in
the game. I thought when you have two teams of equal ability and they're
playing their hearts out and it's back and forth and it's back and forth, in
critical moments, the team that does something‑‑ make a play, usually wins,
and I thought Notre Dame got several offensive rebounds, long rebounds that
gave them another opportunity, and if you look at the stat sheet, it may not
jump out at you because it's really pretty similar, but it's when they got
those offensive boards.  
I thought role players for Notre Dame just absolutely killed us. When you can
hold Jewell Loyd to five for 18 and 13 points, you can't let Mabrey go five
for five, you can't let Cable hit a three, or four for four, but they were
five for five between the two of them, so that's, what, 15 points right there.
And then the third thing is we didn't get to the foul line enough. We got
there nine times and they got there 24, and I thought those were the three
things that stood out to me.  
  
Q. Did you feel like maybe you missed a chance in the first half? You're up
nine with a chance to extend it, and then they kind of got right back in it?  
KIM MULKEY: Well, you have the flagrant, so you had things that are‑‑ I can't
control that over on the sideline, and Sune is just not a dirty player. I just
find it funny that in two games she got a flagrant 1. Those mistakes do hurt
you, but we stayed in the game. We stayed in the game. We were in the game up
until the last minute of the game, but when you look at the last three or four
minutes of the game, I just thought those long rebounds when we'd make
defensive stops, and it was a four‑point, six‑point game, we just couldn't get
them, and then we stepped back, and you look at the big picture, you take away
the role players' points for Notre Dame, you take away some of those free
throws, it might have been a different game.  
I know that we're young, but guys, Notre Dame is young, too. So they'll have a
good team back, as well.  
  
Q. Coach, like a lot of players have mentioned, your team has a very bright
future. They're a young team. What are you looking forward to taking from this
experience?  
KIM MULKEY: Oh, I think we've got to get better defensively still. I think
that we have got to understand the importance and the value of just one play,
one rebound, and that comes with time. That comes with time. You've got a
player, and I just mentioned Jewell Loyd, we hold her five of 18, but the
truth is Jewell Loyd makes all those players get those points, and we don't
have that player, so we've got to get it from a bunch of different places.
We'll get better.  
  
Q. When you have players, some of your best players get into foul trouble,
especially late in the game, I imagine that's a very delicate balance between
playing hard and also being cautious to stay in the game. What do you tell
your players in those moments?  
KIM MULKEY: I don't know that I really tell them anything. I don't really talk
to them about don't foul or anything like that. I think I'm just coaching in
the moment on what we need to run, what we're doing defensively. If I feel
like they need to come out of the game, I'll sub in offense, defense, but that
never went through my mind because when they got in foul trouble, it was
really late in the game.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
MUFFET McGRAW: Well, we're excited that we're still dancing and have a chance
to enjoy some of this beautiful Oklahoma City weather today.  
  
Q. Lindsay, can you describe again the game last night and how you got into
the flow and what it was like for you going through this, the way you were
carrying the team in the first half?  
LINDSAY ALLEN: Yeah, in our game plan we really focused on getting those
free‑throw line jumpers, because we knew the way Stanford was playing us, we
were able to get those shots. We worked on that in practice and then
shoot‑around and then the posts really set really good screens us guards to
get those shots and kind of just read the defense a little bit.  
  
Q. Jewell, does last season give you guys any extra confidence, the game
last season against them give you any extra confidence going into tomorrow, or
does that even play a role?  
JEWELL LOYD: Last year is last year. Every year is different. We're a
different team. We have the same mindset, so we're focused and we're ready to
play.  
  
Q. Brianna and Taya, what concerns y'all the most about Nina Davis, a very
unique player, and what will you have to do to keep her under control?  
BRIANNA TURNER: She's super athletic so we're definitely going box her out and
keep her off the boards. She's going to be super aggressive. We know she's
going to play hard, so we're going to have to work with her the whole entire
game and don't give up or don't take plays off.  
TAYA REIMER: Yeah, I think exactly what she said, and for us as posts I think
our biggest focus is going to be rebounding for this game.  
  
Q. Taya, Stanford players said that energy was the difference last night.
Can you talk about the conditioning program and how you guys feel energy gives
you an advantage?  
TAYA REIMER: Yeah, well, our strength and conditioning coach, Craig Cheek,
does a great job, definitely pushing us and getting us ready for making runs
like this, and it's a long season, so he definitely helps us out with that. I
think that we just get energy from each other, too, and just‑‑ I mean
obviously when Lindsay Allen is making incredible plays and we're all just
really playing off of each other that gives us a lot of energy, and I think
that definitely helped.  
  
Q. Michaela, since this is your birthday today, give us a scouting report on
what you see of this Baylor team this year and what you remember from last
year, and how are they different?  
MICHAELA MABREY: Well, they share the ball really well. They know each other
inside and out, and I think their point guard does a really good job of
finding everybody, getting in gaps and finding everyone. They're extremely
athletic, and they bring a lot of energy to the game. We just have to keep
playing the way we've been playing and executing really well on offense and
defense.  
  
Q. Michaela and Jewell, since you are the veterans of the group, can you
tell me a little bit about the tradition of painting the fingernails green and
why you guys like it and why it's a cool tradition?  
JEWELL LOYD: Well, it's just something that we've always done. For us we
walked in and it was paint the nails day, and that's what we do. What's the
name of the polish that we use? We use all different polish, it just has to be
green. I like having my nails done.  
  
Q. Michaela, can you talk about what it means to have Kayla McBride with
you? Is she helping coach? Is she just a fan, encouraging, just what that does
for her to be part of the travel party?  
MICHAELA MABREY: Just having Kayla here, it means a lot to all of us. She's
been in the position that we are right now, and I think just having her here
and her giving us little advice here and there, I think just really maybe
calms us down or whatever she's saying I think just helps us in any way. I
love having her here.  
  
Q. Could you reflect back on last year, the game against Baylor,
specifically when ‑‑ and this is for all of you, specifically when Natalie got
hurt and what you remember about that moment?   
LINDSAY ALLEN: From what I remember last year we were on a really big run at
that time and we were just getting going a little bit, and our home crowd was
really loud for us and we were feeding off of their energy, and Natalie goes
down and it kind of sucks the air out of the room a little bit but she gets up
and gives us that inspiring speech and we know it's an extra deal for her,
make it to the Final Four.  
JEWELL LOYD: Yeah, I definitely agree with that. It was really passionate.
That's when we came together and said let's get it done. Let's play with some
heart. That's exactly what we did. Natalie stood up and walked up the court,
and it's like, all right, someone is going to step up. You know right away, so
we just played together.  
MICHAELA MABREY: I agree with what Lindsay and Jewell said. I think we were
going on a run at that point in time, and I think when Ace went down it kind
of sucked the air out of everything. But I think with her coming up, and I
think our fans really helped us, and I think they just kind of motivated us to
just finish the game and move on to the Final Four.  
TAYA REIMER: I mean, exactly what they said. It was definitely motivation, and
all of us wanted to finish that game out and come out with a W for her.
Obviously it being her senior season it was devastating for her and for all of
us because she was a huge part of our team, but we definitely just got some
motivation from it.  
BRIANNA TURNER: I was at my house watching on TV.  
  
Q. Jewell, can you talk about the guard match ‑up and particularly what you
see from Niya Johnson since you would have seen her last year?   
JEWELL LOYD: She's a really great point guard. She reads the ball really well.
She's very accurate, and the match‑up between her and Lindsay is going to be
awesome. Obviously I'm biased because this is my point guard here, but yeah,
she's a really good point guard. She's done a really good job for them.  
  
Q. Lindsay, Niya had 16 assists and no turnovers yesterday. First of all,
has Coach said anything to you about that stat, and that kind of stat, that
jumps out at you, doesn't it?  
LINDSAY ALLEN: No, Coach hasn't said anything to me about that, but I'm a
little jealous of it. Obviously, 16 assists and zero turnovers is pretty
impressive. She's just a great point guard for them. She knows how to get them
going. She knows where to get her players the ball and she's done a really
great job for them this year.  
  
Q. Stanford talked about energy was the difference last night. Can you talk
about the conditioning, the team effort that goes into getting your team
energy to outlast opponents?  
MUFFET McGRAW: We have such a great support staff in every way. Strength and
conditioning, training room, nutrition, it all goes into it. We travel with a
nutritionist, obviously travel with a trainer all the time, and our strength
and conditioning coach, Craig Cheek does a fantastic job. We've got the new
GPS system that we wear on our backs that tells us how hard we're working, do
we need to maybe take a day off. That has been really helpful to have some
statistical information. It's easy to look at them and know whether they're
tired or not. But I think we're in great shape, especially Jewell and Lindsay.
They can go all day. They've been in phenomenal shape all year long. They do a
great job in the weight room. They're prepared for this kind of game. And I
thought what hurt Stanford was when Lili Thompson got hurt in the first half
and went out, they didn't have another guard to put in, so I thought they got
a little tired in the second half because they had to play so much in the
first half.  
  
Q. Do you feel like you have to be better this time around than last year to
beat a Baylor team that is clearly excited about a rematch, and if so, how do
you feel like you're better?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Yeah, I think we're both very different teams, and both are
playing really well without the stars that graduated last year. I think they
are playing like we played the year that Skylar graduated. We came back the
next year, a lot of people thought we'd be down, and it's the same for them. I
think they've gotten really good contributions from a lot of different people,
so they're much more team oriented in that you can't focus on one person. In
some ways, a lot harder to guard and I think they've been incredibly
successful. Kim has done a terrific job this year. I think Coach of the Year
is certainly in that kind of game where you're rebuilding. You don't know
exactly what you have, so I think she's really done a terrific job.  
We've done a little rebuilding ourselves. I think we're a very different team
than we were last year and you see that in the lack of experience at times,
but a player like Jewell Loyd really can do a lot of things and cover up a lot
of the mistakes that we're making.  
  
Q. As an outsider looking in, how do you describe Nina Davis's game? It's so
unique and what do you have to do to keep her under control?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Well, unique is a perfect word to describe Nina Davis and her
game. She can take it off the rim and get to the basket at the other end as
quick as any guard in the country. She's got great speed. She is a great
rebounder. She is relentless. I think that's the thing about her that I
really, really like. She never quits. If she misses it she's going to go back
and get it. She plays at a high‑motor speed. She's really a tough match‑up for
the post, and that's what you talk about, who's going to guard her. We've been
in this situation a few times this year, but nobody with quite the athleticism
at that spot that she is, so she's a very difficult match‑up I think for
anyone.  
  
Q. You guys are 6 ‑0 all team in Elite 8. I'm wondering what it is about
this situation that works so well for you guys.   
MUFFET McGRAW: I think we go through the year and play every game the same
way, home or away, big game, regular game. It doesn't matter, we have the same
approach. We're not a team that is a fiery, motivational, inspirational, talk
before the game kind of‑‑ I don't have that personality. You know, we're
pretty steady. We take every game the same way, so when we get to this point
we're trying to treat it like another game. We take it in two games. The first
weekend was a two‑game series. This weekend we want to go 2‑0\. So I think we
just look at it and try to make it as businesslike as we can.  
  
Q. Obviously last year the game in South Bend, how much of a difference, if
any, do you think the fact playing on a neutral court and the fan distribution
might be a little bit more evenly spread?  
MUFFET McGRAW: I don't know if it's going to be even. I think last year
playing on our home court was a tremendous advantage, and I think I'm really
glad that the NCAA went away from playing on home courts, even though the
crowds were tremendous and the atmosphere was electric on our side. It really
is an unfair advantage.  
Now we're playing in Baylor's backyard so they have a chance to get us back a
little bit. Not too far from their campus, so I'm sure they'll have a lot of
fans out here, and I'm sure for them, they have a little bit of revenge on
their minds.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the development of your two post players and kind of
what you've seen from them as the season has progressed?  
MUFFET McGRAW: I think the reason that we've been successful this year is
because of the improvement of our posts. I think Taya Reimer is the
most‑improved player on our team. I think Brianna Turner, a fabulous freshman
but still needed some work coming in, and Kathryn Westbeld, our other post
player, the three of them have improved throughout the season. Carol Owens,
our post coach, I think is the best post coach in the country. The way they
fit into our offense, they've gotten comfortable. I think it's tough for
freshman to come in and be comfortable at any point. I think it's probably
taken them until February to really feel that ability that our offense is a
lot of just take what they give you, and that's difficult for freshmen. I
think they've really come a long way in terms of learning when they should
drive it, when they should shoot it, when they should pass it.  
  
Q. After the Connecticut game, of course you didn't have Bri in that game,
but after the Connecticut game you mentioned that you kind of wondered about
the toughness of your team. When did you finally realize that they had ‑‑ were
getting to that point where you liked to play tough, and indeed do you think
they've reached that level that you want them to play at?  
MUFFET McGRAW: I think they've definitely reached that level and then some. I
think we've seen that in a lot of games in the ACC. We saw that in our DePaul
game up in Chicago, which was shortly after the first loss of the season. So I
think they really showed a lot of resilience. But particularly in the posts. I
think our guards are pretty tough. They've been tough all year long, but I
think the post was where we were questioning it, and they definitely have come
along and come a long way.  
  
Q. You get a spark from Madison Cable coming off the bench, and Hannah now
provides that same kind of spark for you last night. Can you talk a little bit
what they mean to your program?  
MUFFET McGRAW: You know, I think it's really important that you have a great
player coming off the bench. I think it's a difficult decision who you're
going to start and sometimes you don't start your best five, sometimes you
start a really good chemistry group but you come in with somebody that can do
a lot of different things. I think the person coming off the bench has to have
the versatility to help you at both ends of the floor, and that's what Madison
Cable has been able to do for us all year long. She's had some great offensive
nights, but she's always steady defensively and she can rebound. So she can
come in and make a difference in the game, as can Hannah Huffman. She comes in
and provides energy. She's going to get a rebound or get a defensive stop.
She's not going to have a great stat line every game, but she's going to be a
very big contributor for us.  
  
Q. Did you sense that Hannah might have a little something extra going for
yesterday, the fact because she was playing against Stanford?  
MUFFET McGRAW: I think the minute the bracket was announced she noticed that
Stanford was in our bracket, and I think having never played against them her
four years, she has some friends on the team there, in fact a high school
teammate is on the team, so I think she was really, really excited about the
match‑up.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the point guard match ‑up and what you particularly
see from Niya Johnson?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Two great point guards, and both up for the Nancy Lieberman
Award, and in the top four in the country. I think that's going to be a really
fun match‑up for the fans to watch. Niya Johnson, the best passer in terms of
assist‑to‑turnover ratio and assists in the country, averaging eight assists a
game. She is just so good with the ball. She's got a great handle and she can
really see the floor. She makes great decisions. She gets her players the ball
exactly where they need it. She does so many things that don't show up on the
stat sheet, either. She gets the assist most of the time, but just to get the
ball and give it to them in such a way that they can be successful with it I
think is a really, really tremendous trait to have.  
  
Q. What was your assist ‑to‑turnover ratio as a player?   
MUFFET McGRAW: We didn't keep stats back then. I think we just had the abacus
that we were keeping score on at that point.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
Q. Niya, you were pretty candid last night looking ahead to the rematch and
talking about it. What do you remember from last year? You guys have talked
about the home court and played on their home court quite a bit. What are you
carrying into tomorrow?  
NIYA JOHNSON: Just the energy Notre Dame had. I guess they were just feeding
off their fans last year, and just adversity they went through, and just
taking us apart, our offense, by reading us and how we defend them and looking
at film from‑‑ well, looking at film today, we'll try to fix that, and it's
another great opportunity to play them again.  
  
Q. Nina, you said that it's kind of personal for you because you didn't feel
like you played that well in that game last year. How excited are you to get a
second chance at Notre Dame?  
NINA DAVIS: It's just a great opportunity just to be at this level and to be
able to play them again. We're just going to go out there and give it our all,
and whatever happens, happens, and hopefully we come out with a win.  
  
Q. Sune, just talk about being back in the Elite 8. Most teams would love to
be here once. You guys are back here again. How fortunate are you guys, and
now this time take care of business?  
SUNE AGBUKE: We're so blessed. We're blessed with the players we have on this
team, we're blessed with our coach, we're blessed to play for Baylor, and
coming here, you knew coming to this program that that's something you were
going to get to do. We're very blessed, and we're just looking forward to it,
to getting to go farther.  
  
Q. Imani, Alexis and Niya, can you talk about defending their guards,
particularly Lindsay Allen and Jewell Loyd?  
IMANI WRIGHT: They're great players. I think if we just stick to our game plan
and what we have to do, we'll do a pretty good job. Just being able to have
this opportunity again, it'll be great for us.  
ALEXIS PRINCE: Yeah, they have great guards. We just have to stick to our
defensive principles and hopefully we'll be able to slow them down.  
NIYA JOHNSON: Looking at last night's game, I noticed that Lindsay Allen was
on a roll, and you just have to stop that early and get them out of rhythm.  
  
Q. What gives you the confidence going into tomorrow that things have
changed since last year? What is it about this team that you feel better
about, maybe, than you did a year ago?  
NINA DAVIS: We're just different. We're a totally different team than we were
last year. I don't think you can compare the team we are this year to the team
we were last year. I think last year we were more focused one player. We
revolved around Odyssey Sims, and this year we have so many different weapons,
everybody steps up and it's really just confidence this year. Everybody steps
up, everybody knows their role and everybody plays their part. You can see
yesterday everybody stepped up on the big stage and everybody was able to
contribute and I think that's what makes us a better team than we were last
year, because you know which one of us to stop. You don't know who the ball is
going to go if we're in a close game at the end. That's what makes us
different from the team last year.  
  
Q. Going off of what Nina said, when you see Sune have a big game like she
did yesterday, having to step up because of the defense they were playing on
Nina, does that kind of remind you that you have to just kind of be prepared
just in case they're shutting down Niya or Nina at the same time and you guys
have to step up?  
IMANI WRIGHT: Yeah, Sune had an amazing game yesterday, and I'm excited when
everybody does well, and just having everybody be able to score and contribute
is big for us.  
ALEXIS PRINCE: Yeah, that's the type of team we are. Any given day, any player
can have a good game or go off. It doesn't matter if it starts on the
defensive end or the offensive end, and yesterday with Sune and Chris at
this's game.  
  
Q. Sune and Niya, can you talk about where the defense has evolved since the
beginning of the year, even looking back maybe at the Kentucky game, how the
defense has evolved since the beginning of the year?  
SUNE AGBUKE: Well, I think number one, we've really bought into it a lot more.
It did take a couple losses for us to really buy into that and realize that
what Coach Mulkey is teaching us every day in practice, she's been teaching us
every year, it's the way to win. And then I think the past couple weeks what's
really been helping us is our help side defense, and knowing that I'm going to
have Niya's back if she gets beat, I'm going to have Prince's back if she gets
beat, I'm going to have Imani's back and then I know Nina is going to have my
back with my man or Niya is going to have my back and we've had a lot of
success doing that, and we've really been communicating, we've been talking on
defense and being able to switch at points where we needed to do that and
knowing when we shouldn't switch. It's just really coming together for us, and
it starts with talking and communicating, and it starts with just really
buying into our defensive principles.  
NIYA JOHNSON: Coach Mulkey coaches a lot of emphasis on defense, and just
those two games that we lost, Iowa State and Oklahoma, we seen that from
watching film, we seen that our defense was horrible so we tried to fix that
in order to win ballgames and also get to a championship. Like Sune said, just
helping each other out, helping the helper, last night we did a very good job
with that, and just trying to help each other out in any way we can.  
  
Q. Kim, the girls were pretty candid last night when talking about having
another shot at Notre Dame, and I could have sworn I saw a little eye roll
from you at one point. Maybe, maybe not. I'm just curious about your thoughts,
if you embrace their desire to have another shot or if you're a little
concerned about maybe emotions being a little overspent coming in or where
you're at on that.  
KIM MULKEY: I don't remember an eye roll. I think like any competitor, you
remember who ended your season, and it's just ironic that we're in the same
situation as last year. I thought your question to Nina was outstanding, if I
can elaborate a little bit more, what makes us confident is they're not the
same Notre Dame team, either. You're playing really basically on a neutral
site. I tend to think it might be leaning a little bit toward Baylor because
hopefully we have more fans here than Notre Dame. But the teams are just
different. Notre Dame lost some great seniors. We lost an All‑American senior,
and that's what makes it a good opportunity for us to get back out on the
floor and play them again.  
  
Q. Kim, can you talk about that match ‑up inside because it seems like
that's where they lost a lot of their players was in the post area.   
KIM MULKEY: Yeah. Reimer and Turner are young, freshman and sophomore, and
they've had to fill big shoes for Notre Dame, and they've done it quite well.
It's a lot easier to fill those big shoes when you can have a Jewell Loyd
leading you out there, and I just think she's the best player in the country.
I think she's a difficult match‑up for everybody. She can just take over a
game at any time. I think that Sune will hold her own in the paint. Obviously
I think that Nina is having a great year. But I just thought Notre Dame's post
play was outstanding, and they've replaced it with outstanding talent.  
But it's a lot like us. Their team is young, too.  
  
Q. How much more difficult are they to prepare for when you see that a
Lindsay Allen can explode like that in the first half and you already have to
pay so much attention to Jewell Loyd?  
KIM MULKEY: Not any more difficult than it is for them to have to worry about
Sune Agbuke. It's just players make plays at this stage. Nobody wants their
season to end. You might throw a twist here and there defensively. You might
run one little quick hitter offensively. But the players win it now. The
players make plays, and it should be an interesting game. You have two teams
that score a lot of points. You have two teams that like transition. You have
two teams that use their bench, and you have two young teams. I hope that it
will be a good game. I hope that we certainly give them a better game than we
gave them in South Bend last year.  
  
Q. Coach, can you comment about the attendance here yesterday? Were you kind
of disappointed with the turnout for the game?  
A.I really can't give you a comment because I didn't pay attention to it. How
many did y'all bring?  
  
Q. I don't think they brought too many, yeah.  
KIM MULKEY: Yeah, well your men are in the tournament, too.  
  
Q. I think the announced attendance after the second game was 3,868 or
something like that.  
KIM MULKEY: Honestly I didn't pay attention to it.  
  
Q. Coach, it seems when I watch ‑‑ the best offense you'll have is when the
ball is moving around and everyone is touching. How big of an emphasis has
ball movement been this season?  
KIM MULKEY: Well, it's big because of what you've noticed. Our team can score
at all positions. We have players coming off the bench that can score equally
as well as those that are in the lineup starting. I just think that our
ability to not just always rely on Nina, she gets a lot of the attention, but
if you watch us play, we don't really run a whole lot of things for Nina. Nina
gets her stuff by going to the offensive boards. She gets her stuff in the
continuity of our offenses. I think we've just got to keep doing what we're
doing that got us to this point and hope that we can defend and just make a
basket or two more than they do.  
  
Q. Talk about your point guard, Niya, and the game that she had last night.
The stat that jumps out at you is 14 assists, no turnovers.  
KIM MULKEY: 16 assists, no turnovers. See you media? I have to get you
straight because you tell half the story. OK? It matters to a point guard, 16
or 14. She is unbelievable. I just thought‑‑ of course I see her every day,
and coaches always think their players are the best, and they should. But I've
seen Niya have 17 assists and no turnovers in 30 minutes of play earlier in
the year. I've seen Niya just lead a basketball team with her ability to find
the open player. She got to go against one of the better point guards last
night who a lot of people think is going to be a top draft pick, but she was
able to gauge herself against the best. I thought she did a tremendous job,
and she just is‑‑ what she would draw up as the facilitator out there, the
true point guard, makes everybody around her better. But she's also a scorer.
If I need a point, I'll tell her, you need to shoot the ball, and she'll do
it. She just thinks pass first.  
  
Q. Following that up, this might be an offbeat kind of question ‑‑  
KIM MULKEY: Not from the media. Come on now.  
  
Q. We try, you know. We like to try to get to the meat of the story. If you
were out to recruit, if you needed to get a particular player, what's the most
important player that you need to recruit for a basketball team in your eyes?
Is it a point guard, a forward?  
KIM MULKEY: It is an offbeat question. I think it depends on your team. I
think personally we have to go look for what our weaknesses are and what our
needs are. But if we're starting from scratch, I think you've got to have a
point guard and then probably after that I think you've got to go with a post
player, and then you fill in the parts around that.  
But that would just be if you're starting a program. If you're a pro franchise
and you're starting from scratch, you've got to have a ball handler. You've
got to have somebody that's the coach and quarterback on that floor. I think
it's the same way in football. You've got to start with a quarterback and then
you've probably got to go to your running backs and then your cornerbacks. I
don't know. I've played the position and I know how valuable it is.  
  
Q. You've talked about Jewell Loyd a little bit. What makes her the player
that she is and how do you go about trying to slow her down a little bit?  
KIM MULKEY: Well, nobody really slows her down. She's that good. She's
probably going to win every Player of the Year award out there. She can
offensive rebound when she needs to. She can defend the best player on the
other team if they need her to. She can elevate above most people guarding her
and score. She pushes it in transition and could play the point if she needed
to. She's just a very difficult match‑up.  
  
Q. You've said before, and we've seen it, Sune can make that shot, but she
doesn't take it a lot. Is it because she recognizes that's not her role, or is
that just what Iowa gave her?  
KIM MULKEY: Well, it's what Iowa gave her. She's never open that much. If
she's open at the foul‑line area, you've seen her, she'll shoot it. It's just
people didn't leave her open that much all year. She's not an offensive
liability, she just doesn't have to shoot it as much as the others. As big as
she is, honestly, Sune is more of a face‑the‑basket‑type of post player than
she is a back‑to‑the‑basket post player that makes great moves. She just had
openings last night and got on a roll, and when you make two or three, you
become more confident, and that rim gets bigger.  
It's good to see a senior play like that.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  

Notre Dame  81  
Stanford - 60

  
TARA VANDERVEER: I think we just lost to a really outstanding team.
Congratulate Notre Dame and Muffet. I thought our team played really well.
They had some outstanding players, and they really played a great game. I also
am really proud of our team, to work to get here, we came out I think with a
really great effort, and we just had a lot of people getting some real good
looks that didn't go down for us. I'm really proud of our seniors and the two
young women that are up here. I think they battled the whole night.  
  
Q. Bonnie, you had five threes, you pretty much kept Stanford in the game
for a while there. I was just wondering what was it like for you? Did you feel
that at some point things kind of ‑‑ you just ran out of gas as a team or
what? What was the difference in the game?   
BONNIE SAMUELSON: I think that in the first half Allen was shooting extremely
well, and in the second half I think we did a much better job on her. But I
just think that some turnovers hurt us, and I don't know, like Coach said, we
were missing some shots that we normally make but I thought we battled really
hard the whole game. Disappointing way to go out. We kind of got within five a
couple times, but it just kind of kept slipping away from us when it got to
that point.  
  
Q. Erica, talk about battling down low and how difficult, because you did a
great job on the boards.  
ERICA McCALL: They had really strong post players, so one of the keys was just
keeping them up top and not letting them get easy buckets. I think our posts
did pretty good as far as not giving them a lot of easy lay‑ups, but it was a
really physical game, and we battled out there and just didn't come out how we
wanted to.  
  
Q. Tara, did you have to change your strategy on Allen as far as coming off
screens, coming in front of the screener or behind? How were you ‑‑ I know you
had a bunch of different people playing her, but did you change your tactics
on her?   
TARA VANDERVEER: Well, I think in the beginning of the game, we had Amber on
her, and we were looking to help off of her a little bit, and so, yeah, we
helped less. She got going, and she got too many open looks. We were really
concerned about obviously Turner inside and Reimer inside, and they did really
well. But we definitely gave Allen too much space. We talked to‑‑ I talked to
Bri about tightening up on her. Amber is our real defensive stopper, and we
only have one Amber, so we kind of made the choice sometimes of who to put her
on. Sometimes she was on Loyd. But we did make some, I think, better
adjustments in the second half. But she got too many open looks in the first
half.  
  
Q. What happened to Lili in the first half?  
TARA VANDERVEER: I didn't see what happened, but I think she bruised‑‑ came
down on her knee. But she was cleared and was good to go, but she didn't seem
to be moving as well as she needed to be.  
  
Q. Coach, as good as Allen was in the first half, it looked like Loyd was
that good in the second half. Was it kind of just choose your poison?  
TARA VANDERVEER: Well, that was‑‑ I think they're really a talented team.
Jewell Loyd is probably the Player of the Year. We were just dodging some
bullets in the first half, and she picked it up in the second half. They have
weapons at every position. They have‑‑ there's no one you couldn't sag off of.
You had to guard every single one of them every minute, and if you just made a
mistake, they made you pay.  
I mean, I think we worked pretty hard, but we did not play the type of defense
that we needed to play.  
  
Q. Talk about what separates Jewell Loyd, and why is she so good?  
TARA VANDERVEER: Well, I don't think she's probably‑‑ if you talk to Muffet, I
wouldn't say this was probably her A game. It might not have even been her B
game. They isolate her. She can knock down the three. She went to the basket
really strong, I think she was 100 percent from the free‑throw line, 7 for 7.
7 for 21 I don't think was probably a great game for her, but she ends up with
six rebounds, second‑most rebounds on their team. She's a fantastic athlete,
and they take care of the ball. They had nine turnovers. They're a very tough
team to guard because at every position they're very, very talented. They're
very skilled.  
  
Q. You've always been known for having a very disciplined offense. Would it
be fair to say tonight maybe some of the individual players were trying almost
too hard individually as opposed to getting the ball to the hot hand and
really the ball movement and that sort of thing that Stanford has been known
for in other years?  
TARA VANDERVEER: Well, this year has been a really different year for us.
Without the post game that we've ordinarily had, whether it's Jayne Appel,
Brooke Smith, you can go back to Val Whiting, you saw sometimes when we had
lay‑ups, and we have to be able to‑‑ we're going to have to develop that part.
We have not been‑‑ we have not moved the ball as well as we need to, and
that's something that, again, you're running some new stuff and you have some
young players. But a lot of it, the credit belongs to Notre Dame. Their
defense was active. They forced us into turnovers. They really shot a very
good percentage, and that's a credit to them.  
But we know that our team, we got some really good looks, and people have made
shots. Lili did not shoot well tonight. Other people, Bonnie, I thought got
some good looks that knocked down, but Bri, 1 for 7, Lili, 1 for 8, Brit, 1
for 4, 0 for 3, you're not going to beat a team like this unless you knock
down shots. It was tough, but credit to them, their defense was excellent, and
we have our work to do.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  

Baylor  81  
Iowa - 66

  
LISA BLUDER: It's tough to see the season come to an end. We had a great run.
We had great seniors. Just super kids in our program. I'm so proud of the type
of kids we have in our program. They're incredible role models, they're great
students, they're wonderful to come to work with every day, and I just
appreciate them so much and appreciate my seniors. The effort that they've
given us the last four years has been nothing but amazing, and I'm so
appreciative of those young ladies. It's hard to remember the good times.
Sometimes the last one is so painful, but I'm going to try and remember all
the good ones we had this year.  
  
Q. Samantha and Melissa, as you look back on your four years in the program,
if you had one or two Kodak moments that years from now you want to share,
what would they be and why?  
MELISSA DIXON: Yeah, there's a lot over the last four years. It's obviously
been the best four years, but making it to the Sweet 16 definitely has to be
up there. It was a goal not only for this year but for the last four years,
and to finally do it, it was so special, and it's something I'm going to
remember for the rest of my life. I'm so thankful to have done it with these
people and to have been a part of this program for the last four years.  
SAMANTHA LOGIC: Yeah, probably No.1 would be Sweet 16 basketball wise. Like
she said, we wanted to get here and we've built up to it. It wasn't something
that was just tradition here, and we wanted to start a tradition now for the
future Hawks, and the current ones right now we want them to keep building on
it so badly because they deserve it just as much as we do. There's so many
things off the court that people don't even know. You're going to remember
even more than big wins, probably at Penn State last year, top‑10 team in the
country, besides beating them, like dancing in the locker rooms, the
aftereffects of that. Things like that is what you're going to miss the most,
I think.  
  
Q. Sam, obviously number ‑wise a great performance by both you and Niya
Johnson. I think the two of you combined for 30 assists and one turnover.
Assess your performance, both you and she?   
SAMANTHA LOGIC: Obviously, yeah, she's the leader of that team, great passer,
great leader on the floor, conducts that offense really well, puts her team in
a position obviously to win, and I think any day you're going to take that win
over any other stat. Just congrats to Baylor. Very good basketball team, and
they're going to make a run, I think. The next game, that'll be a fun game to
watch. But I'm just happy to go out with my team. I mean, do battle with this
team. I wouldn't pick anyone else.  
  
Q. Your fans had a 10 ‑hour drive to get here unless they flew. If they
flew, they were flying into a tornado. It still was a remarkable
representation out there. How much does that mean to you, and did you feel
that, and also the enthusiasm from the bench while you were out there on the
floor?   
SAMANTHA LOGIC: Yeah, we always do. Our fans are great. That's why I think
it's a huge part of our 18‑0 at home. We were playing in front of them.
They're so supportive of us and they have been for four years. I think you saw
just a glimpse of that today. That's a long drive and a lot of people not
even‑‑ might not even personally know someone. They just love Hawks. They just
love watching us play, and we love playing for them, but yeah, you always feel
that enthusiasm there. They're just waiting for a run for us. In the first
half, you feel it and our bench we always feel it. They are so great, they're
loud, they're enthusiastic. They want to win so bad that they really just
don't care about their own minutes. I think this whole team is so selfless in
that way. They just want to celebrate for us so badly and I think it's just so
apparent to everyone watching that how much we love playing together, even if
they're not on the floor.  
  
Q. Melissa, talk a little bit about when Doolittle went out, getting hit in
the nose. You guys went on a run and how that changes, and Samantha, talk
about the adjustment you made posting up?  
MELISSA DIXON: Yeah, we obviously felt really bad for Beth when she went down
and we all kind of came together. We're like, we want to do this for Beth. We
want to get it for Beth. I think we just kind of rallied around that and tried
to go on a run for that. We just came up a little bit short.  
SAMANTHA LOGIC: Yeah, without Beth in there, it's tough. She's one of the best
posts in the Big Ten. She's so versatile offensively and defensively, just a
huge part of our team for the last four years, and I don't think I'd take any
other post. But with her out, think we kind of spread the floor a little bit,
and just having a size advantage, I like posting up. I just looked at that a
little bit more across the board because we didn't have that presence in there
to try to make up. Not going to make up too much without her, but just try
what you can do.  
  
Q. You guys went on a really nice run at the end of the first half. I think
you scored 11 in a row to get within two. How big were those two three
‑pointers that they hit at the end of the half to open it back up to 8?   
SAMANTHA LOGIC: Yeah, that was big, going from a one‑possession game to a
three‑possession game pretty much, it was big‑time shots by them. We lost‑‑
one of them we just lost in our zone. You just can't deal with that. We can't
have that happen, obviously, and then the other one was just at the buzzer,
just kind of crazy defense, was just trying to get a steal and they just found
her at the right time. We would have had momentum going in the half and we've
just got to learn to get stops there. Might have been a different game then.  
MELISSA DIXON: Yeah, we were finally taking our run and we were finally
getting stops and were able to push it in transition. We were finally trying
to go up on them, but we just kind of collapsed on some drivers and they got
some open looks that way, and it just kind of cut our run a little bit.  
  
Q. Samantha, did that linger at all in the second half when you came out? I
think you went three minutes without scoring after halftime?  
SAMANTHA LOGIC: I don't think it did, mentally at least, because we were
getting good looks. We're really good shooters as a team. I thought we were
getting good looks, weren't rushing or anything. I thought we still were
taking good shots, they just weren't falling. Their shots were falling, some
uncharacteristic ones so you've just got to battle through that, and I thought
we did a good job trying to make a little run after we knocked some shots
down.  
  
Q. Melissa, they were obviously pretty set on face guarding you all night
and taking you out. Talk about fighting through that and trying to get open
and trying to remain a part of the offense.  
MELISSA DIXON: Yeah, it's happened before, but with our team, you know, I just
kind of have to not let it frustrate me because we have so many offensive
threats on our team, that if they are going to take my three‑point shooting
away, someone else is going to be open and we're going to have four other
great scorers who are going to have open looks, so it's just kind of taking it
and just not being frustrated and knowing that it's helping my teammates get
open.  
  
Q. I don't want to get you in trouble, but could you talk about the
disparity in foul shooting since both teams seemed to be driving the paint?  
LISA BLUDER: Yeah, we really could not get to the free‑throw line. At halftime
that was the difference. They were 9 for 9 from the free‑throw line, we didn't
shoot a single will free throw. You have to go back a ways to probably find
that. That was very unfortunate for us not to get to the free‑throw line. I
felt like even at the end of the game, free‑throw line and second‑chance
points were the biggest‑‑ our biggest problems.  
  
Q. You know obviously that Niya is going to be a big assist part of their
game, but what Sune gave them in points and rebounds, was that debilitating
for you guys?  
LISA BLUDER: I think so. Obviously she was feeling it tonight. She was well,
well, well over her average, and you really can't have that. Playing in one of
these games, you know Davis is going to get hers. We knew that. But you really
need to keep track of everybody else, and she really did very, very well
today. She hit the 15‑foot shot like it was a lay‑up today for her.  
  
Q. Talk a little bit about those two quick fouls early. Did that change
things because it was on Doolittle and Samantha?  
LISA BLUDER: When Beth got the two fouls, that's not good for us. There was a
point we just wanted to get to halftime almost because she's our leading
rebounder, she's our paint person. We're just‑‑ she does so many things for
us, she transitions so well. When she got the two fouls, that was tough. And
then I just had to make the decision to go back in with her. When they got up
11, we went back with her and obviously you could see the impact she made when
she was in the game. In the last two minutes, I felt like we had to take her
out to try not to get that third foul and again they hit those two
three‑pointers at that point. But Beth is a big part of our team. She's been
unbelievable, and I hate that she ends her career here with a broken nose
tonight. It's really unfortunate, and I feel bad for her.

## March 27, 2015

  

### [Lindsay Allen](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28835)

### [Hannah Huffman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28840)

### [Jewell Loyd](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26561)

### [Muffet McGraw](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14071)

  
_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  

Notre Dame  81  
Stanford - 60

  
MUFFET McGRAW: Well, I'm just thrilled that we're advancing to the Elite 8.
It's exciting having both the men's and women's teams in the Elite 8. Today we
did just a good job, so many different contributions. Lindsay Allen, Hannah
Huffman, great minutes off the bench and of course Jewell Loyd, what can you
say about the Player of the Year. She did everything that should could do to
help us win. Really, really pleased. Stanford is a great team. Lili Thompson's
injury in the first half I think hurt them a little bit when she came out,
hurt their depth at guard and I thought maybe a little more fatigue in the
second half without having the rotation when she came back. But just so, so
happy right now.  
I've got to get to bed, so if we could...  
  
Q. Jewell, talk a little bit about Stanford's defense in the first half and
how it allowed you to get Lindsay involved and then in the second half you
kind of took over?  
JEWELL LOYD: I think just the ball screen was really effective for us. We came
out, got great screens from the post. Lindsay is a great guard. She realizes
her shot is right there and she lit it up. It's another day in the office for
Lindsay.  
  
Q. Jewell, with about five minutes into the second half they cut the lead to
about four, and then you guys called a time ‑out. What was the huddle like at
that point and what was kind of the turnaround?   
JEWELL LOYD: Well, we knew we had to refocus ourselves. We knew that we've
been in situations like that before, so we had great leadership from Lindsay
and just everyone else was communicating, it's not over, keep fighting, keep
your heads up and get it done. It was very effective.  
  
Q. Hannah, you were really fired up out there on the court, obviously had a
big second half. What does it mean to you to be able to do it on this stage in
a role just kind of playing what was there and then having the opportunity to
score, as well?  
HANNAH HUFFMAN: Well, Sweet 16 is very exciting and I am just really happy
that I was able to help out my team. When you are feeding off that energy ‑‑
when Lindsay is playing like she is playing, when Jewell is playing like how
she's playing, it's such a fun environment. As a basketball player these are
moments that you live for, so I was just happy I was able to go out there and
help out my team.  
  
Q. Lindsay, do you recall being in a zone like that at the college level in
any way?  
LINDSAY ALLEN: I want to say the UCLA game was also like that, but our posts
did a really great job of setting screens and we were just reading the defense
really well and getting open shots for our offense.  
  
Q. Lindsay, Jewell, Hannah, talk also about the rematch right now. I know
it's right after the game, but you've got a rematch from last year going
against Baylor.  
JEWELL LOYD: I think we're just really excited to play another game. We're
focused, ready. Baylor is a great team. They're very consistent, good point
guards, good post players, and I think we have good post players and good
point guards, too, so we're really excited and we're ready to play.  
LINDSAY ALLEN: You know, we're really excited to make it to the Elite Eight
and play a great team in Baylor. Like Jewell said, they have great guard play,
a great post player in Nina Davis. They're a really athletic team and we're
looking forward to that match‑up.  
HANNAH HUFFMAN: We'll be dialed in at practice tomorrow. Coach will come up
with a great game plan and I cannot wait.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about Lindsay's maturity in recognizing that she
needed to step up and produce some offense?  
MUFFET McGRAW: You know, we came into the game working on the ball screen, and
we felt that Lindsay was going to get a lot of free‑throw jumpers. I didn't
expect she was going to get so many threes. That really surprised me. She is
somebody that's a very selective shooter, and I thought today she just felt
it, and she had the green light, and she kept shooting. And then you saw in
the second half she tried to get everybody else involved, and I think that's
the true point guard coming out in her.  
  
Q. Talk about your defense. You guys really shut Stanford down. They really
struggled a lot with their shots.  
MUFFET McGRAW: Yeah, I thought except for Samuelson. I thought she played
really well. We couldn't seem to find her standing on the three‑point line. I
thought when we started switching, and that's when Hannah came in, and I think
that's one of the best things she did for us. We went with a switching 1
through 4, and I thought that was probably the difference. We were able to
guard them a lot better off the ball screen. I think the posts were able to
loosen up inside and take anybody that came to the rim. I thought that was
probably the difference.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the impact and energy Hannah Huffman brought you
guys?  
MUFFET McGRAW: You know, Hannah has done a great job all year of bringing us
energy. She comes in, she plays as many minutes as we allow her, and she is
thankful and happy to have them. She always gives us 100 percent in practice,
and she came in today, she was a great spark, and I thought with their lineup
with the four guards that we wanted to keep her on the floor. Really, really
pleased with her numbers. Statistically, she makes some great passes, she
doesn't turn the ball over, she rebounds, she defends, she does everything we
need her to do.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Jewell? She's just getting so much attention. People
are getting really physical with her. Talk about how she handles it and how
your team reacts to needing to take some pressure off of her?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Yeah, I think that teams are going to be physical with her.
She's strong, but I thought today she made some really great plays around the
basket. I thought the three‑point play that she had was critical. She got
fouled a couple times in that stretch where they were‑‑ I think they cut it to
four and we went on a little bit of a run. I thought it was almost all her.
She did a really good job in the second half, but she is going to draw the
most attention, which is why you see Lindsay Allen making so many shots.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  

Baylor  81  
Iowa - 66

  
Q. Sune, I'm guessing the game plan wasn't to go to you for 23 points. Was
that just something that opened up or where did that come from, I guess?  
SUNE AGBUKE: They were really crowding down on Nina. I think that was their
game plan to keep her from getting the ball and I was wide open and I did a
great job and my teammates did a great job of getting me the ball, and it was
going in.  
  
Q. I was about to ask roughly the same question or what they put in your
Gatorade because we knew you were a rebounding machine, and last week a
blocking machine. Is this a career high in scoring for you?  
SUNE AGBUKE: Yeah, I haven't gotten into double digits once.  
  
Q. Sune, if you could, describe the emotions from having a game like that in
your senior season and last tournament? What does that feel like?  
SUNE AGBUKE: I think the greatest feeling you have as a player is getting to
come through for your team. Any opportunity you have to do that, you get to
come through for your team, and that's just the best feeling.  
  
Q. Niya, 16 assists tonight, no turnovers. What was clicking for you?  
NIYA JOHNSON: Really just finding the open teammate, trying to drive and
attack, make them close down on me and hit Sune in her sweet spot which is the
free‑throw line, and like I said, just finding my teammates.  
  
Q. Nina, talk a little bit about your focus coming into the game because the
zone spread things out but you looked like you were still attacking and going
to the basket?  
NINA DAVIS: We pretty much knew they would come out in a zone, but we couldn't
let it slow us down. My mindset coming into every game is to keep attacking,
whether they are in a man or a zone. I just had that mindset and I was
attacking and when they were doubling down on me I was getting the ball to
Sune and she did a great job of stepping up today.  
  
Q. Niya, you guys got off to the 8 ‑0 lead, then expanded the lead, and then
late in the first half it got down to one possession, you hit two big
three‑pointers. How big was that going into halftime and carrying that
momentum into the second half?   
NIYA JOHNSON: That was huge. I was on a run and Prince hit a big shot and I
told her good shot and she said, I don't know how that that went in, but that
was huge because they was getting complacent and also getting our excitement,
thinking they could come back and run on us the next half and play with us. I
told Prince that was a huge shot.  
  
Q. Niya, you had the 16 assists but you only needed the one to break
Odyssey's record. What does that mean to you to pass Odyssey and move into
first all ‑time for Baylor?   
NIYA JOHNSON: That's huge, being a leader in assists at Baylor and passing
Odyssey Sims, which she's a great player, I'm just thankful for getting the
opportunity, and it's a blessing.  
  
Q. Sune, was your heart beating a little fast as the officials go to the
screen after the elbow caught the gal, or what's going through your head at
that point?  
SUNE AGBUKE: It was such an accident. I really didn't mean to. I felt bad, but
I was like, is that really a flagrant because I felt like I just kind of
stepped through. I didn't mean to hit her in the face. My teammates kind of
had to calm me down because I did feel bad, but it was completely
unintentional.  
  
Q. Everybody is talking about offense. I thought the defense was phenomenal
tonight. You held one of the leading scoring teams in the nation that averages
80 a game to 66. Could you talk a little bit about the preparation and how you
did that?  
SUNE AGBUKE: We knew that they scored a lot of points a game. We scored about
the same amount in the 70s, but looking at defense statistically, it was night
and day, so that for us was going to be our focus. We knew that if they were
going to score 80 points we're not going to win. And we knew we could score
and we weren't going to have trouble with that, but we did have to limit their
threes and limit their transition buckets, and that's what we did.  
NIYA JOHNSON: I just thought that the guards did well defending their
perimeter players, especially Dixon. She was 2 for 10 from the three‑point
line, and she averages about four a game, and I just thought that Prince and
me and Imani and Kristy, as well, did very good on her, as well as Samantha
Logic, just throwing different bodies at her.  
  
Q. Niya, was it flow of the game, you go to Sune, you go to Kristy, those
are not options A and B usually. Was that just flow of the game or was that
that was open?  
NIYA JOHNSON: Most certainly. They was hot at the moment so I kept feeding
them the ball and telling them to shoot it and attack and just opened up the
offense for us.  
  
Q. Back in the Elite 8, potentially playing Notre Dame again just like last
year. Does that game carry any extra weight going into tomorrow?  
NIYA JOHNSON: Yeah, we didn't forget going to the Elite 8, them beating us at
our home place, and we still talk about that to this day. We're just going to
go out there and attack because we don't remember the wins, we just remember
the losses.  
SUNE AGBUKE: Yeah, we've talked about it, and for us it's not just thinking
about that loss last year, either, but we do have a tradition at Baylor. We're
4‑1 against them, so going in as a group, we feel like we're 0‑1, but we do
have to kind of uphold our end for Baylor and come out and make it 5‑1,
hopefully.  
NINA DAVIS: It's definitely a game that has been in the back of our minds. I
think once we was put in the Oklahoma bracket with them, that was probably the
first thing that popped in our minds. But all tournament long, we just
couldn't overlook the other teams that we had to play. Of course we was
anxious to play Notre Dame but they had to get to the game tomorrow and we had
to get to the game, too, and then when we get that, we can finally focus and
go out there to watch and see if we have a chance to beat them, have a chance
to play them.  
  
Q. Kim, Niya talked about this a little bit, but discuss the game plan for
Melissa Dixon. You guys were able to take her out pretty well. Not a lot of
teams have a three ‑point shooter like that. What was the plan of attack for
her?  
KIM MULKEY: Well, there wasn't a specific one for her. The entire team was
challenged as we have been since the day they put on a Baylor uniform to play
defense, and if you look at the NCAA statistics, I thought that jumped out at
us in that Iowa scores a lot of points. They like to push the ball. They shoot
a lot of threes. We like to push the ball. We score a lot of points, we don't
shoot as many threes. So then you go and look at points allowed, and we're at
58, and they're in the 70, 72 range. I've said from day one in every interview
I've had that defense is going to decide the game, and I just thought we were
very disciplined defensively at all positions. There was no box‑and‑one,
triangle‑two, doubling anybody. I just thought we made them use the shot
clock. They don't like to do that. They like to take a lot of quick shots in
transition and push it, and I just thought we never really gave them a lot of
easy shots.  
  
Q. I looked up, it might have been one of Sune's last shots she hit, but
obviously she had an advantage down low but she was hitting a lot of 15, 16
‑footers, and you kind of turned to the bench and had your arms up like this.
Were you amazed?   
KIM MULKEY: No, Sune‑‑ that is a very good shot for Sune. Sune can face up and
shoot that. It's just she never gets that opportunity because people don't
guard Nina the way Iowa was guarding her tonight. They just were leaving Sune
open, so that's a free throw, and so Sune is a senior, and that's not‑‑ she
doesn't shoot a lot for us because she's not given that opportunity up there.
They chose to guard us that way, and Sune will shoot it every time she's left
open.  
I'm not responsible sometimes for what I do or see or say on that sideline, so
it was probably one of those gestures like, she's a senior and doesn't want
her year to end.  
  
Q. Kristy also, just what you got from her, hit her first seven shots.  
KIM MULKEY: Well, Kristy has been doing that all year. Kristy is a kid that
plays a lot of international basketball. She's on the junior national team
from her country, and she has started many games, both at point‑‑ she can play
the off guard, and I've got basically four perimeter players, and any of the
three can have great nights, or any of the four can have great nights. I just
rotate them in and out of there.  
  
Q. You have a pretty young team, just the one senior, a couple of juniors.
Different group than what you've had so much success with. Where have you seen
the greatest growth from the beginning to where they are now in the Elite 8?  
KIM MULKEY: Defense. I think we're playing better team defense. Didn't see
some of it tonight because they were really concerned about the three ball,
but I just think from the time we started to today and really surfaced during
the conference tournament championship, I just see a team that's just really
understanding what we're trying to do. When they're on help side, when they're
on ball side, when to front, not front, and it usually takes this long when
you have this many young players. We have Prince out there. She hasn't played
in two years. You have Imani who's now starting, you have Kristy Wallace who
came to Baylor, she's a freshman, you've got Nina Davis whose role now is that
everybody focuses on her because Odyssey is gone.  
They've just kind of gone under the radar all year nationally. I don't think
regionally and locally Baylor has gone under the radar, but I just‑‑ to think
I've had the opportunity to watch Niya Johnson have 16 assists and no
turnovers and have to guard people like she did, and she did it earlier in the
year, she had 17 and no turnovers. I played the position. That's hard to do.  
  
Q. At about the five ‑minute mark remaining in the first half, that's when
Sune picked up her second foul, you took her out of the game, Iowa makes their
run. Does a game like this show you how valuable Sune is right there?  
KIM MULKEY: It doesn't show me. I've been knowing that. We're a different team
when Sune is not on the floor. Sune is on that floor because she's super
intelligent, she's big, she alters shots, she helps teammates. She anticipates
things, and yes, I was disappointed at that point. In fact, it was 3:52, I
think, to go at that media time‑out, and I inserted Khadijiah Cave, and I
talked to all of them in that time‑out. At that point I think we had a
13‑point lead and they went on a 9‑0 run, and before they ever went on their
9‑0 run, I told them, guys, this is where games are won and lost, and dang if
they didn't go on a 9‑0 run. I took K K out. I felt like she was not defending
Doolittle very well and I gave a freshman a chance, and I thought Dekeiya
Cohen did good. In fact I think she got two offensive boards down there. I
thought we ended it good with Prince getting the shot there at the end, but at
that moment, runs like that can cost you a game.  
  
Q. You commented on defense a while ago. I want you to talk about this. As
aggressive as you're playing on defense, fighting over screens, etcetera,
tonight in the first half they never shot a free throw. You were 11 out of 11,
you only had three team fouls. Early in the year that was a problem. Talk
about that a little bit.  
KIM MULKEY: I can tell you were a coach because your questions are so
basketball related and I love it. It wasn't just playing defense. One of the
ways for us to win the game was to keep them off the foul line and for us to
get to the foul line, and we absolutely did. I think they were like‑‑ well,
they were 3 for 7 from the foul line, and it wasn't the typical hand check or
trying to block shots. It was the discipline in how we guarded them. We always
had our hands up here because they can get shots off quick. When they drove
back we didn't try to come down and hack, we just made them make shots over us
and we had to do that because our help side was not going to be as good as it
usually is because we had shooters out there. So I thought the discipline that
we showed defensively kept them off of the foul line, and that was one of the
ways we felt we could win the ballgame.  
  
Q. Going back to Alexis's big shot to end the half, how big was that
momentum wise, second half you come out, shoot 50 percent, step on the gas and
never look back?  
KIM MULKEY: Well, it was big because we had lost momentum, they had gone on
that 9‑0 run and I thought about actually putting Sune back in the game
because we'd done that before and she'd been disciplined enough not to pick up
her third. In fact I think Doolittle came back in the game with two fouls and
I chose to stick with a sophomore off the bench when they went on their 9‑0
run. It was big as far as momentum. It was. And then we had the possession
coming out of halftime.  
  
Q. Niya said earlier that you guys don't remember the wins, you remember the
losses, and I wonder the last time you played a Sweet 16 game in this
building, it obviously was one of the more disappointing losses for you,
Brittney Griner's last game. Has that game been on your mind at all since
you've been here?  
KIM MULKEY: No.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
TARA VANDERVEER: My team is very excited to be here. We've had a season that
has been, I think, a great learning opportunity for us, and we're playing
against an excellent opponent in Notre Dame. I feel that our team is working
very hard, and we expect a great game.  
  
Q. Can you talk about your relationship with Coach McGraw when you two are
together? You're picking each other's brains about basketball, or is there
more to the respect and the relationship?  
TARA VANDERVEER: Well, I remember Muffet as actually a young player when we
worked Cathy Rush Basketball Camp together, and so we kind of go way back. But
it's amazing to me that in all the time we've been in the tournament and in
all the time they've been in the tournament, we've never been in the same
bracket together. So we see each other maybe sometimes on the road, we talk,
we're on different committees together, and we've seen each other at the Final
Four. But for the most part, you know, it's some Xing and Oing a little bit,
but most of it is just kind of how are you doing, how is your family doing,
that kind of thing.  
  
Q. Considering Stanford and Notre Dame's academic and athletic similarities,
are you surprised that you haven't played more than just twice in all these
years?  
TARA VANDERVEER: You know, I really am. Muffet and I actually were talking on
the phone before the bracket came out, and she's like, we've never been in the
same bracket together, and now here we are.  
But we did play‑‑ it was like a way back, home and away, and I know our
football team does, and I think that it would be a really good thing. She does
a fabulous job. They have a great program, and I think it would be a good
thing to get going. I'm saying that before we play them. I might change my
mind after.  
  
Q. I know it's a long time ago, but how much (inaudible)?  
TARA VANDERVEER: I think it's always a benefit to beating a really good team.
It helps people's confidence. You have to ‑‑ everyone, in order to beat a team
like Notre Dame, you have to do what you did against Connecticut, and it's
good for our team to know that they're capable of playing that caliber of
team.  
  
Q. How did the bus from the airport go? I understand you were pelted with
hail during the storm.  
TARA VANDERVEER: Well, we fortunately landed before the storm broke, and it
was extremely dark, and I said something to our bus driver, could this be a
tornado. And he was like, oh, no, no, and it really was quite a storm with
hail on the bus, and we were getting the tornado warnings on our phone. We
were thankful to get to the hotel.  
  
Q. And what do you see from Notre Dame when you see the tapes, especially
Loyd? What do you think of them?  
TARA VANDERVEER: You know, they are really talented at every position. Loydis
‑‑ I watched Jewell Loyd play as a young player. She's an absolute phenom.
It's more than just her, and it's more than them individually, they play
extremely well together. Again, I think Muffet does an excellent job. They
really pass the ball. Their team, if you weren't playing them, would be really
fun to watch. They pass the ball, they move the ball really well, they play
very up tempo. They're very skilled players. I think they have very high
offensive efficiency, very unselfish, they work at both ends of the floor.
Quite honestly they really don't have any weaknesses.  
  
Q. (No microphone)  
TARA VANDERVEER: Well, you know, obviously you don't like to get down, but
sometimes we`re ‑‑ our team is in a lot of ways a young team and not a‑‑ we
haven't had a set starting lineup all year. We play a lot of different people,
and sometimes it takes us a little while to kind of figure out what's working,
who's working, putting ‑‑ kind of figuring out the puzzle. And then I will say
that I think our team has really demonstrated some outstanding resiliency in
that if we're down, they don't get discouraged, they don't get frustrated,
they don't get on each other, they just keep just digging a little deeper and
playing a little harder.  
  
Q. (No microphone)  
TARA VANDERVEER: You know, this has been a little bit of what I affectionately
call a roller coaster season for us in that we have been able to beat great
teams, and we've played very well against them, really good teams, even if we
lost. Beating Connecticut with a couple of free throws we beat Texas early
when they were healthier. We have opportunities to win in, I'd say, five games
that we lost. And then we lost some games that were really disappointing, and
then we kind of got a little run going by beating Oregon State at Oregon
State, which was our PAC‑12 regular season winner. And then coming out in the
tournament, our team played really well in the PAC‑12 tournament, and I think
the tournament has given us a springboard into the NCAA Tournament of just
like, hey, this is what we need to do, and let's get it done.  
There's really a very unselfish group, but we're not sure who it's going to be
that day. Some days it's been maybe Taylor Greenfield; other days it`s been
Bri Roberson; another days it's been Erica McCall. It's been different people
stepping up in different games.  
  
Q. How do you feel about the return the NCAA made returning to pods, one;
and two, late tip ‑off times, it doesn't affect you so much, but East Coast
teams, 10:00 games are a little difficult.   
TARA VANDERVEER: You know, I think being in it this long, the first question
was about‑‑ you know, playing at the home site, I think, is probably something
that we need right now in women's basketball. We've experimented with other
things, and that seems to be a good thing and it seems to work. As far as the
game times and all the decisions that are made by the higher‑ups at the NCAA,
I'm excited to be playing, and our team will play anywhere, anytime, however
we can do it.  
I just don't even bother worrying about it, thinking about it or complaining
about it. You know, we are so thrilled to be here and so excited to be playing
and have just the tremendous opportunities that‑‑ someone else is figuring
that out, and that's not me.  
  
Q. Amber, does the fact that you played UConn and beat them give you a
little bit more confidence against another top team like Notre Dame?  
AMBER ORRANGE: It does. It shows us that we're capable of playing with anybody
in the country, but it's up to us to play to the best of our abilities, play
to that level.  
  
Q. Amber, I saw in your bio that you listed your hometown as being Houston.
Does that mean you're going to have some family in town for the event or will
you have a little bit of backing because you're closer to home?  
AMBER ORRANGE: Well, my parents and my sister will be here, and some family in
Dallas will also be here. But I think that's about it.  
  
Q. For any of you, could you talk a little bit about what your visit was
like to the Oklahoma City Memorial today?  
BONNIE SAMUELSON: It was extremely emotional. I think that the whole museum is
really amazing and the memorial is really amazing, as well. It was really cool
to kind of walk through and just see what happened that day and everybody that
was affected and the response that kind of the city and the country had to it.
I know a lot of people on our team were kind of like teary‑eyed going through,
but I think it was really kind of a great thing that we were able to do.  
LILI THOMPSON: Same, very emotional. A really well‑done memorial, and we were
very fortunate to get the chance to go and to experience that. And I think
that it just puts a lot of things in perspective, and we just wanted to be
grateful for all the opportunities we've been given and to try to take
advantage of those.  
AMBER ORRANGE: The same. It was very moving, and there were times where I was
just at a loss for words at what I was seeing and just seeing the humanity of
it, everyone who responded. It was very touching.  
  
Q. This is really for all of you. Y'all have been behind in a lot of your
games this year, and I think five times you've come back from double digit
deficits. What is it about you guys that enables you to not panic when you get
so far behind?  
BONNIE SAMUELSON: I think we kind of have the sort of season that talks a lot
about grit a lot, and it's just‑‑ all those games have really kind of prepared
us for this time of year. And I think that our team has a lot of heart and we
just never give up, kind of when we're down, we know that we have the
potential to come back and that it's kind of on us where we're at in the game.
And like Bam kind of said, we know we can play with anybody, but we know we
can lose to anybody. I think especially now all that experience has only
helped us, and we really just are looking to play hard kind of throughout the
entire game and never let it drop off.  
AMBER ORRANGE: Going off what Bonnie said, I think she used the word grit. I
like to use the word resilient to describe our team. We've been in a lot of
games where we've lost close games and we've won close games, and I think that
experience really helps us. We never really panic in those types of situation.  
LILI THOMPSON: I would say we have a lot of people on our team who have
stepped up and who can step up, and if someone is having a bad shooting night
and maybe missed a defensive match‑up, we stay with them and surround them and
give them positivity. We know they'll come back and they'll bounce back, and
we've seen that time and time again.  
  
Q. Lili, Tara was saying about Jewell Loyd that she's an absolute phenom,
and I was wondering what it's like for you when you watch her. Are you going
to be guarding her or is Amber? Who's going to be taking her?  
LILI THOMPSON: I don't know if it's supposed to be a secret, but I'll start
out on her and I'm sure we'll move around match‑ups and everybody will take a
crack at it if need be. She's obviously a phenomenal player, and she scores in
so many different ways. And I think that our job is just to make it difficult
for her and to give her a tough night, to have to go against the five of us
and our team defense and not just necessarily one person. I think that we play
really good team defense, and we get really focused on our preparation, and I
think that's something that will help us in this game.  
  
Q. In the OU game to get you guys to this point, you go into halftime down a
few points and then turn it around for the ten ‑point victory. What was the
key for you and your scoring effort to get you guys to this place?   
AMBER ORRANGE: I'm just always trying to be aggressive. Sometimes I score a
lot, sometimes maybe not as much, but if I remain aggressive, I may get on
another defender and someone else is open, so I think going with that kind of
mentality is really important for me.  
  
Q. Amber, reading through your bio, I saw that your mom was an Olympian, a
triple jumper. What kind of influence did she have on you?  
AMBER ORRANGE: She's always just supported me. She always told me you can do
anything you put your mind to. There's nothing you can't do, but you have to
work hard for it, and she's been like the greatest example in my life, and
she's my role model because of it.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
Q. Coach, seventh straight year in the Sweet 16. Talk about getting here and
like you told us before, you don't take this for granted.  
KIM MULKEY: Well, we're excited. There are a lot of‑‑ I wouldn't say a lot,
but there are significant players that play a lot of minutes in our locker
room that have never played in the Sweet 16, so they're extremely excited. The
first ones that come to mind are like Kristy Wallace and Dekeiya Cohen. This
is their first Sweet 16, their first NCAA Tournament, so they're excited, and
they should be.  
  
Q. For all of your great teams at Baylor, considering the players you've
lost, the talent you've lost, where does this team sort of rank in terms of
satisfaction, frustration, all of those sorts of things for you?  
KIM MULKEY: Well, they've done the unexpected. I didn't have‑‑ I didn't place
expectations on them because I really didn't know what was fair. There were
too many question marks. There were too many roles that were going to have to
change, so basically they have coached me into how good they can be. The
program has expectations because we've built an elite program there the last
15 years, so you always write the word championships and tradition and all
those things, but when you break it down to just how good can they be, could
they win a Big 12 championship, I don't know that any of us thought they
could. Could they have won it by as many games as they did? I don't think any
of us thought that. But those of us in that locker room obviously did. They've
had a great year. We've been very fortunate to stay away from injuries, and I
don't know how far they can go in this NCAA Tournament, but I know that I sure
like my chances because they have really done a lot this year.  
  
Q. You talked a little bit about their style the other day, Iowa's style.
How do you expect them to defend you?  
KIM MULKEY: Well, from what I've seen on film, they play man‑to‑man and they
play a 2‑3 zone. Sometimes you see a half court 2‑3 backed up to‑‑ when you
say half court, they extend it, but a little bit of 2‑2‑1, back to a 2‑3\. But
I've learned that no matter what you see on film, we've seen defenses that
some teams have never played before, so we will prepare for anything and
everything that we think we could possibly see.  
I don't know other than what I've seen on film, and that's what I just shared
with you.  
  
Q. When you're watching that film, what do you see out of Iowa's Samantha
Logic?  
KIM MULKEY: Oh, a tremendous player that makes everybody around her better.
She is a triple‑double waiting to happen every game. She's a strong player,
and then I see around her players that can score, and I see a team that likes
to run and get up and down the floor, and they're averaging, what, 79.9 points
a game? They are very confident at what they do offensively.  
  
Q. For those of us who haven't seen Nina Davis, how would you characterize
her play, and how does she stack up against some of the great players you've
had in the past?  
KIM MULKEY: First of all, if you haven't seen her play, I'm not sure I can
give you a great description. I don't know how to describe Nina. I can`t tell
you watch her good looking shot because she's got an ugly shot. I can't tell
you to watch how she blocks out because she doesn't block out. All I can tell
you is if you haven't seen her play, come to our game tomorrow, and when you
leave, you will go, wow, because she's a competitor, she guards bigger players
than her, she scores on bigger players than her. She had 17 rebounds against
UConn. So she's not just doing it against teams that are not very talented. I
can't give you a scouting report. My suggestion is for you to come see her
play and then you write what you think because she's one of the most unique
players that I've ever coached.  
  
Q. I know you're focused on tomorrow and just the game tomorrow, but since
this is one of your younger groups, do you have to say anything to them about
possibly not looking ahead to a rematch in the next game?  
KIM MULKEY: No, because I think your teams, no matter how young or how old,
are a reflection of coaching staff. We do our homework. We're very thorough
with our scouting report. We don't talk about the next opponent.  
What sometimes makes it difficult is when you start a tournament and you don't
know who you're going to play, so you kind of have to double up and do
homework on both teams, and that's what took place in the first and second
rounds. We know who our opponent is next, and that's all we have focused on,
and then tomorrow the coaches will already have done their work. After
tomorrow, Saturday, we will present the scouting report and go to work prior
to playing the opponent on Sunday should we win on Friday.  
  
Q. Kim, you've never not been in the postseason as a player or a coach or an
assistant in college. When was the first time you remembered what winning and
losing and the difference between the two was like as a kid?  
KIM MULKEY: Probably had nothing to do with basketball. It was the rejection
of not being able to play in the All‑Star Game when I was a Dixie Youth
All‑Star as a 12‑year‑old because I was a girl, and I had to stand outside of
the dugout and watch my team play. I just remembered what a horrible feeling
that was, and I didn't like the attention that was being placed upon me. And I
was trying not to cry, because you sure didn't want to cry as a girl in front
of a bunch of 12‑year‑olds, and then my dad and my mom and my family had to
make a decision. Do we fight this right now on this baseball field or do we
fight it later in the courtroom and make your team forfeit? And I remember
making the decision‑‑ my dad had confidence that he would do whatever I
wanted, and I said, oh, no, we won't penalize the team. And I stood outside
the dugout and watched us play that game.  
So I don't know that it had anything to do with winning and losing and the
impact. Just life, and somehow, sometimes, it can be out of your hands and out
of your control.  
  
Q. You strike me as a slick fielding second baseman ‑‑  
KIM MULKEY: Actually my first year of Dixie Youth, I was the first player
taken in the draft, so that meant I went to the worst team, and I played
shortstop, pitcher and catcher. Then I moved up to Pony League and played
second base and made the All‑Star team my second year.  
  
Q. I was right then, second base.  
KIM MULKEY: You got it. Same position my son plays at LSU.  
  
Q. Last week you sang for a press conference ‑‑  
KIM MULKEY: What do you want me to sing today? Name a country song and I'll
sing it for you.  
  
Q. Are you by nature a singer?  
KIM MULKEY: I can't carry a tune anywhere but the shower. I love music. I know
the words to lots and lots of songs that you guys have probably never even
heard of. I just like music. I like gospel music, I like country music, I like
modern music. Some of that music I don't care for, but I don't know, I'm a
country girl.  
  
Q. You talked about Nina's shot, you called it an ugly shot, I've heard it
called an interesting ‑looking shot. What makes it look like that, and is that
something you've wanted to correct or just leave it alone?  
KIM MULKEY: I think she had that shot when I recruited her. Why would I change
it? At this level in all sports, you don't change things in players unless
it's something that is not very effective. She gets shots off against players,
and I sit there just like you guys do, and I go, how did she just do that? No,
I don't fool with anybody's shot. She misses her share of free throws, but
when you look at games, she never costs you a game from the foul line. And
she's going to be the one you really probably want at the foul line in a tight
game because she comes through in the clutch. But no, I don't fool with her
shot.  
  
Q. 35 games into it, are you still looking for a perimeter ‑‑ that perimeter
stopper, and then also on Imani, if you look at her stats the last three or
four games, she hasn't shot the ball very much at all. Is that something ‑‑
not getting enough minutes or what?  
KIM MULKEY: Yes. Back to‑‑ I'll answer the perimeter stopper first. I think we
are getting that from several players. I think we get that from Prince because
she's 6'2" on the perimeter and has length, and then sometimes we get it from
Imani, Kristy, and Nya, so I would say it's probably a combination of all of
them. Imani thinks she's the ball sitting over on the bench by me. Kristy
Wallace has been on a tear of late and Kristy has subbed in for Imani, and
it's probably more of that than anything.  
  
Q. Did you have any weather ‑related problems getting here yesterday?   
KIM MULKEY: Actually we were scheduled to take off at 6:30, and we were on the
runway, and we were told there was a tornado, and the airport, I think, had
been closed down in Oklahoma City. So we sat on the runway, and then they
decided that we had to go back and refuel, so they took us back to the
terminal, and, fortunately, we were able, when we got back to the terminal, to
get off the plane. And so I can't remember how long we were in the terminal,
but we didn't get to our hotel until 10:00 p.m., around that time, last night.  
  
Q. Last year the Big 12 Tournament was played here. The fans traveled very
well for you guys. Four and a half hours, I guess, is the closest school
that's in proximity. What do you expect from the fans tomorrow, and I'm sure
it'll be almost a home ‑court advantage for you guys since you are so close to
Waco?  
KIM MULKEY: I don't know that you ever have a home‑court advantage when you
reach this level. I think that you would assume that we would dominate the fan
base because of proximity, and I hope that we will. You're in Big 12 country
here, and I would hope that the Oklahoma fans would support and come out no
matter if their team is playing or not, just be here. I like that the first
and second rounds were back on the Top 16 host schools' campuses. I thought it
just looks better for television. The women's game is not ready for neutral
sites, and I hope that we do our part because of proximity and people will be
here, and it will be something that looks really good on television.  
  
Q. With all the winning you've experienced as a player and a coach, here,
everywhere, do you kind of feel like maybe that carries over, the comfort
level maybe carries over to your players, with the winning and being on this
stage, just the overall comfort level?  
KIM MULKEY: I don't know if comfort is the word. I think maybe confident. I
want every player that when they walk on that floor to have an inner
confidence about them that we're prepared. Knowledge makes for confidence, and
I told you just a minute ago that we're going to do our homework as a coaching
staff, and we're going to present that knowledge to them, so the knowledge
makes them more confident when they get on that floor. I just think the
program and what we've been able to establish there for 15 years, those
expectations bring a level of confidence to those players, and they don't want
to disappoint the previous players. They don't want to disappoint the future
players. They want to hold their own, and I think when they walk out on that
court, no matter what our deficiencies are, you came to this program to
continue on and be a good program, and I think that's probably a lot of it.  
  
Q. With the Final Four in Tampa Bay this year ‑‑ Oklahoma City, kind of a
similar type of market. I think there's some aspirations to maybe have a
women's Final Four here at some point. You've been here for tons of events
here over the years. What's your impression of this as a similar site to a
Tampa or another place where a Final Four has been?  
KIM MULKEY: I've never been to Tampa. I don't go to the Final Four unless
we're playing in it because I'm a single mother, and I always wanted to be
with my children as soon as my year is over and get out in the yard and do
some things. But I've never been there to be able to compare the two cities. I
have been to Final Fours, and things that jump out at me are hotel spaces, not
just for the teams but for coaches, for the WBCA, for the media and all of
that. If you have great hotels, those tend to attract the committee to places.
If you have an emphasis and an interest in women's basketball and you can sell
those tickets, those tend to be places that attract Final Fours. I've had
success in Oklahoma City and I've had disappointment here, but the one thing
that has remained constant is that they do like and love women's basketball in
this area, and I think that has to be a big selling point for future Final
Fours and the possibility of hosting one here.  
  
Q. Niya, with the role that you play with this Baylor team, what's the right
balance you try and find between passing and looking for your own shot?  
NIYA JOHNSON: Really just knowing when to pass it and knowing when to shoot
it. You know, people know I'm a passer, so they're going to set up for me, so
that's when I try and take advantage of it by shooting the ball in the
mid‑range and just spreading our offense and making them guard me.  
  
Q. Niya, I'm curious, how comfortable does Coach Mulkey make winning, and
being on this stage, how comfortable does she make it?  
NIYA JOHNSON: She makes it very comfortable. It definitely has been a
tradition here, and coming to Baylor, you know it's a program that's used to
winning. She never let us settle for anything less, never let us not work hard
and settle for anything less. She lets us know we're here to win and not to
lose, and basically makes us comfortable and know that this is a winning
program.  
  
Q. Niya and Alexis, Coach Mulkey was just telling us that Nina's shot is
kind of an ugly ‑looking shot, and I was wondering if the two of you would
care to describe it.   
ALEXIS PRINCE: First off, I don't know how the ball goes in. But it's like she
shoots it from the top of her head with two hands. And then again, I'm like,
Nina, how the heck did that go in, what are you doing, and then sometimes
she's like, I don't know, and sometimes she'll be like, I've just got it like
that. I don't complain, but I just say, as long as it goes in, I don't
complain.  
NIYA JOHNSON: It's just awkward especially when she`s at the free‑throw line
teams usually jump in early because I don't know what she's going to shoot,
but it is kind of awkward.  
  
Q. Niya, can you talk about the challenge of facing Samantha Logic, a little
bit more of a touring point guard than you, and I talked to Kim about it, have
you stepped up as one of the perimeter defenders, kind of a stopper, that type
of role?  
NIYA JOHNSON: First off, Logic, she's a great player. I've seen the film on
her, and I see what she does. You know, I try to come out in a role‑‑ whatever
it takes for me to do, I do it in order to win a game, I try to take advantage
of that whatever Coach Mulkey wants me to do, I'm going to do it.  
  
Q. Nina, they've got nine players over six foot, long, athletic team. What
have you guys seen on film that could possibly give you guys trouble?  
NINA DAVIS: I'd definitely say that the outside game, there are a lot of
shooters. They have, I think‑‑ four out of five of their starters average
double figures. We are going to try to make them use screens more. They like
to shoot. I think everybody in their starting five can shoot threes and we're
going to make them drive and get them out of their game. I think the game is
going to come down to defense honestly, both us averaging almost 80 points a
game, so defense wins games, and that's what it's going to come down to
tomorrow.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
LISA BLUDER: Well, like everybody, we're glad to be playing here this weekend.
We know we're coming in as the underdog, but my team kind of likes that feel.
We're kind of the last ones to the party here. The other three schools are
used to being in this environment, and actually they've won a national
championship except for me, so everybody should be for the Iowa Hawkeyes, low
man on the totem pole here with the other coaches. So we'll take everybody's
support from Oklahoma City.  
  
Q. Coach, any travel problems getting here because of the weather
yesterday?  
LISA BLUDER: We had absolutely no travel problems. We landed about 2:30, we
were in our hotel‑‑ we were at dinner actually when the storm hit, so we had
tornado sirens going off and the roof started on fire of the restaurant, but
the food was good, so it was okay.  
  
Q. Coach, in 2011 your program lost Kachine Alexander, a tenacious, do
‑everything player. Sam stepped in the very next season. Talk about what she
had meant to the program and what's that been like to have two players like
that back to back?   
LISA BLUDER: Yeah, they're kind of similar players because they're both just
tenacious players, great rebounders, do everything for you type of players.
Sam Logic has been‑‑ ever since she stepped foot on our campus has been a
starter for our basketball team, has been an integral part of our success the
last four years. She is an unusual point guard because she's a do it all point
guard. She can pass, she's the third best passer in America according to
assists, she can defend anything on the floor. She's even had to defend a
center at times. She is a strong, physical player. She can rebound, she can
score.  
She's not your typical point guard. There's a statistic that I've quoted
already before, but it bears merit again, that she's the only woman player
ever in history, NCAA history, to score 1,400 points, have 800 rebounds, 800
assists and 200 steals. So in my mind, Sam Logic is just an all‑around
basketball player, not just a point guard.  
  
Q. I know you're happy to be here, but do you have to guard with this group
at all against being happy to be here, and do you have to talk to them at all
about that this week, or is it even a concern for you?  
LISA BLUDER: No, we talked about that right away at the beginning of the
season with the goal to be in the top 16. Too often you see teams set goals
and when they reach the goals, it's like, it's over now. We did not want that
to happen. We believe we can go farther, and we quickly reset our goals on
Monday and set our sights on moving on, and I have not felt a letdown
whatsoever with our players in their preparation for the week.  
  
Q. So successful at home this year, 18 ‑0\. Is there anything that you
brought with you from Carver, a good‑luck token, anything like that?  
LISA BLUDER: Well, I know a lot of players brought a piece of the net that we
cut down from Carver. We did cut down the nets in Carver because we were
celebrating our first Sweet 16 in a long time and going 18‑0 on our home
court. We have a tradition where we always ‑‑ in our locker room, we have a
sign that's a tiger hawk that every one of our players slaps on the way out of
the locker room, and we have that sign in our locker room at home that's
permanently affixed. And then we have a traveling one that we affix in every
visiting locker room that we travel to, and basically we all give it a high
five on the way out, and basically it locks us in. We're leaving everything
else behind when we hit that tiger hawk and we're giving everything we have to
the Iowa Hawkeyes right then. That's kind of a tradition we have. We talk a
lot about ‑‑ really home is about the people, and we have everybody we need
with us right here to make this a home‑court advantage.  
  
Q. Going back to Sam, what was the process over the past four seasons of
kind of getting her to look for her points more, that balance between pass
first and scoring?  
LISA BLUDER: Yeah, she did do that for‑‑ she was really more deferring to the
older kids when she first came in, because we had some really good scorers at
Iowa when she first arrived, so she was kind of an assist‑first mentality. And
I think this year was the first year that she really began looking for her
points as well as assists. I think she realized we needed to have that for us
to be successful. We've always talked about we want five people in double
figures. That's our goal. I think people start defending Melissa a little bit
harder, trying to take away Bethany, and she`s kind of like, I've got to step
up and score as well as pass the ball. So I think this year was the first year
that I think she became more an aggressive mentality offensively in the
scoring aspect.  
  
Q. Just wondering what are the things that impress you the most about
Baylor?  
LISA BLUDER: Well, I think their transition offense is extremely good. I know
they like to get out and push the ball. Their rebounding is very impressive on
both ends of the floor. Obviously their point guard, she leads the country‑‑
we think we have a pretty good point guard and she's third in the country in
assists, and with their point guard leading the country in assists, that's
pretty amazing. Obviously Davis, an incredible player, Player of the Year in
the Big 12, is only a sophomore, and she's so effective offensively, shooting
58 percent from the field. That's an incredible number. And so she's obviously
something that we have to be weary of.  
  
Q. You were talking about Nina Davis. A little bit of an unorthodox player,
have you figured her out, how she does it at that size?  
LISA BLUDER: That's pretty amazing what she's done at that size, undersized,
playing inside, posting up a lot, but she can put the ball on the floor and
attack, as well. She has a 15‑foot shot that's very nice, but most of her
scoring coming off the free‑throw line and offensive rebounds[ and post area
moves. And when you're 6'1" and kind of thin, that's pretty amazing. Have we
figured it out? Probably not, but we've seen it, and our players have seen it
on film. I don't think anybody in the Big 12 has figured it out yet, but we
definitely respect her and know she's just an incredible athlete.  
  
Q. Was hoping to get a clarification on your comment of the roof catching on
fire at dinner. What happened there?  
LISA BLUDER: Yeah, I think we were at Manny's‑‑ no, what was it? The Mantle.
We were there having dinner last night, and all of a sudden, quite a few fire
trucks pulled up in front, and my daughter got up to go to the restroom, and
she said, Mom, I just saw a fireman run through with a ladder in his hand.
That's when we figured out something was wrong. But they never got us out, and
my steak was still medium rare, so it was all okay.  
  
Q. Talk a little bit about the weather that greeted you when you got here
yesterday.  
SAMANTHA LOGIC: Well, right when we got here it was actually really nice,
especially compared to Iowa. It was, I don't know, probably 70 outside, but
then when we got to dinner, got some notifications to our phone about extreme
weather warnings and some tornados. So that was kind of different. We don't
really have that in Iowa too much. We weren`t too worried about it, though. I
think we were more ready to eat more so.  
  
Q. Sam, could you describe what you look for as greatness in a basketball
player? What attributes do you think make up a great basketball player?  
SAMANTHA LOGIC: Well, I think that the most important thing, I mean, to me is
helping your teammates be better, making the team better. You know, a lot of
people can work on their own game and a lot of people do, but when you make
your team better, I think that's just so much more important than any
individual thing that you can do.  
  
Q. Are any of you surprised to be here in the Sweet 16, or was this kind of
the plan all along, what you expected all season?  
SAMANTHA LOGIC: Well, at the beginning of the season, we kind of set more
short‑term goals first, and then kind of pre‑conference, conference goals, and
then postseason goals. But I think from the beginning of this year, we felt
like it was something that we should be at talent‑wise, experience‑wise, you
know, just having a lot of good games to put ourselves in a good position
seeding‑wise to hopefully play at home. And then we thought if we played at
home, we'd have a pretty good chance to win there because we played so well
there.  
  
Q. Melissa and Bethany, what do you know of Baylor, and how do you feel like
you need to play against them tomorrow night?  
MELISSA DIXON: Yeah, we know Baylor is a really great team. We know the key
for us is just going to be on the boards and really making sure we box out and
get some offensive rebounds, so we know that's going to be a big thing for us,
just to really work on for tomorrow's game, but we're just so excited to be
here. We're excited to play them, and we're really looking forward to
tomorrow.  
BETHANY DOOLITTLE: Yeah, like she said, I think that rebounding is one of the
most important things for us in this game. They're obviously a really good
rebounding team, and that's an area we've struggled at during the season. Just
to focus on the boards a little bit more, boxing out their good rebounders,
and stopping their transition offense because they're pretty good at that. I
think that those are kind of the two keys that we're going to focus on. We're
more than capable and I think we're just excited to get out there and show
people what we can do at this level.  
  
Q. Sam, it looks like you got your tooth fixed. When was that done and so
forth?  
SAMANTHA LOGIC: Well, I think Monday. Did we have off‑‑ I think it happened
Sunday, so yeah, Monday morning. The University did a really good job just
getting me in, got it glued back on, got some extra love on there to make sure
it stays there, so that's what we're hoping for.  
  
Q. (No microphone)  
SAMANTHA LOGIC: Well, I like watching pass‑first point guards, so getting to
play against one at that elite of a level, obviously leading the nation in
assists, like you said, it's just fun. I think that you get your teammates
more involved, like I said before, that's what I think makes a great player.
Haven't watched them too much during the year, but obviously she's been a
great passer, and so I always respect those kind of point guards just a little
bit more, just because that's how I like to play and what I like to watch.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
MUFFET McGRAW: Well, we're excited to be here and ready for a great turnout by
the Notre Dame fans in Oklahoma.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the process of how you guys got here? I know you were
delayed, but what you did during that time?  
MUFFET McGRAW: We took off from South Bend about 5:30 eastern standard time,
on our way to Oklahoma City with a plan that we might have to spend the night
in Dallas. We were on our way to Oklahoma City and then they saw Lawton
Airport was a little bit closer, so we decided to land there and bus over from
there, so the buses came and picked us up, and a little minor inconvenience.
We hung out, we ordered pizza. It was a very small airport. We were the only
ones there, and we had about 95 with the band and cheerleaders and our whole
party. We made the most of it, and our condolences to the people that were
seriously affected by the storm.  
  
Q. What have you seen from the Stanford team this year? This is the first
time they haven't had a Ogwumike sister in seven years, and I'm just wondering
how you saw that change the dynamic for them?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Well, they were both very special players. They have put their
name in the Stanford record book in a big way. Great players in the WNBA, so I
think two huge losses for them. But they've really recovered well. I think
they're a very balanced team. They're a very perimeter oriented team, and they
shoot the three extremely well. They're very disciplined, extremely
well‑coached, a very smart team.  
  
Q. You haven't played Stanford since '92 or '91 season. Why is that? Is it
just one of those scheduling quirks or have you tried or they tried to book a
game and it just didn't work out?  
MUFFET McGRAW: You know, I don't think we've really tried. In fact, I was
talking to Tara a couple weeks before the ACC Tournament, and I said, it's
kind of funny we've never met in the NCAA Tournament, and I probably spoke too
soon because it's not a team that I really want to play. I really like Tara. I
think it'll be a‑‑ it's kind of a great experience where it's nice to go to
the NCAA Tournament and play teams you haven't already played. We had to get
by DePaul which was sort of a rival for us, which was a very different kind of
game. I kind of enjoy being in the NCAA Tournament and playing teams we
haven't played in a while.  
  
Q. Have you tried?  
MUFFET McGRAW: No, we haven't. We talked about going west, but we've been
going to Southern California basically for recruiting, for recruiting players
in Southern California we try to go there, so we don't have a lot of players
from Northern California.  
  
Q. I just heard a little bit of talk that Oklahoma City might be interested
in getting a women's Final Four. I wonder what your thoughts are on the city
and if you think something like that could work here.  
MUFFET McGRAW: I think it can work anywhere that there's fans of women's
basketball, and that's what we need to cultivate. The Tulsa Shock is not too
far away and I think they`re getting a little more exposure because of that.
With the NBA team here, it`s obviously a great basketball city, and it will be
interesting to see what kind of fans turn out, and I think your answer,
probably you'll find out tomorrow night whether it would be a good idea.  
  
Q. (Inaudible.) What stands out to you about her?  
MUFFET McGRAW: I think she's still a student of the game. She loves to talk Xs
and Os. I remember one time a couple of coaches and I were just kind of
sitting around doing a little doodling on a note pad in the lobby of a hotel,
and she just kind of dropped by and said do you mind if I join you? I know
this summer she went out and talked to a lot of different coaches at all
levels because she wanted to change her offense. So she is someone I have
great respect for, what she's done for the women's game, how she's represented
the women's game with USA Basketball and with what she's done at Stanford. I
think she's a class person, does everything in the right way, and is really
good for our game.  
  
Q. You have a little bit of a relationship with somebody at Stanford, Condi
Rice. You've played some golf with her and things. I wonder if you've had any
conversations with her since this pairing showed up, and could you maybe
relate a little bit of your golfing exploits with her?  
MUFFET McGRAW: The relationship might be a little bit more than it is, but I
hope she'll be here supporting both teams. When we were both in the Final
Four, she changed her shirt, I think, after the Stanford game, put on the
Notre Dame colors because she's a graduate of Notre Dame. I would love for her
to be here. I'm not sure if she's going to be here or not. I haven't had any
correspondence with her lately. We did have an exciting round of golf where
she was able to get a hole in one, so that was a memorable day for all of us
on campus.  
  
Q. What was your first wow moment (inaudible) the way she plays?  
MUFFET McGRAW: I would say last year in the ACC Tournament, she went down the
floor in transition and got the alley‑oop and somehow managed to put it in
left‑handed on a pass that was a little hard to catch and control and at a
really important point in the game. And I think that was probably the one
moment on the sideline that I just thought, oh, my gosh, that's a SportsCenter
highlight, during the game. I think we were clapping and cheering, and it was
really an amazing play that we went afterwards to watch quite a few times.  
  
Q. A little scouting report, what you've seen of Stanford and what concerns
you might have?  
MUFFET McGRAW: You know, I think the biggest concern is how smart they are.
They're just a really disciplined team that ‑‑ they run their offense, but
they're also really good at recognizing personnel and seeing some mismatches
and weaknesses and really exploiting them. So they're not a team that you can
say they're actually going to run this when I think they're very flexible in
what they do.  
  
Q. With Notre Dame such a national brand, do you have a pocket of fans
everywhere you go pretty much?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Yeah, we do. We had a nice turnout in Greensboro at the ACC
Tournament. We have a lot of fans in that triangle area. Everywhere we've gone
this year I've been really excited about the fans that have come out in the
ACC schools. So we've had a big turnout everywhere. I know the club offered
200 tickets as soon as the bracket came out. I'm hoping that they need more
and they want to come over and give us a welcome and do whatever they can to
help us. So hopefully they'll come out in full force.  
  
Q. What's allowed you to (inaudible) as well as they have?  
MUFFET McGRAW: You know, I think when you come into a program, the expectation
level is set pretty high, and so I think everybody coming in knew that there
was going to be a lot expected of them. We talked to the freshmen early on
that they weren't going to be able to play like freshmen. We were going to
need them right away. I think the leadership that Jewell Lloyd has grown into
has really, really helped our team. And I think our point guard, Lindsay
Allen, has just done a masterful job. She seems very quiet, but when you get
close to the court you can hear her talking, and she does a really great job
of staying poised and keeping us levelheaded, and I think the post game has
really just exploded. I think our posts, all three of them, Taya, Bri, and
Kathryn, have really played well of late, and have just continued to get
better.  
  
Q. What has Hannah Huffman added to your team the last couple of years?
She's one of our Bay Area kids.  
MUFFET McGRAW: Hannah is having a terrific year for us. She is somebody that
comes off the bench in certain situations and has really played well. She
gives us energy. She is a player, the fans love her because she is such a
hustle player. She gets a lot of things that don't show up on the stat sheet.
She'll come up with some big rebounds. She is a defensive player that, when we
need a defensive stop, we'll put her in the game for that. She gives us great
energy. She helps us on the break in transition when the other team is
pressing because she handles the ball very well. She's a really good passer,
got a great assist‑to‑turnover ratio. But I would say mostly it's her defense
and just a spark that she gives us off the bench.  
  
Q. (Inaudible.) How difficult is it to prepare for a team (inaudible) that
has so many?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Yeah, it's really difficult. You just kind of cross the zone
off the list of things that you're probably going to do. We've got to figure
out how we can stop the penetration and the kick‑outs, which is very difficult
for us just having played DePaul which was a five out team. I think we came
away with a lot of things we need to do better.  
It's a difficult challenge for us. I think that defensively man‑to‑man,
containing the ball, has been somewhat of an issue for us this year, so I
think that's something that we hopefully have fixed this week.  
  
Q. Could you comment about the strength of this region? Three really strong,
traditional programs in yourselves and Baylor and Stanford compared to maybe
the other four throughout the ‑‑  
MUFFET McGRAW: Yeah, if I'm not mistaken, I think the ESPN analysts said this
was the toughest region. It didn't say it was the toughest bracket to start,
but I thought the toughest region. We're looking at Baylor, a team that's
basically, we`re playing in their backyard; Stanford, a team that's been to a
number of Final Fours, consecutive Final Fours; Iowa, a team from the Big Ten
that has had a fantastic year. I think all four teams have been ranked all
season, and it definitely is I think the most difficult region. But I said
that before the other brackets were announced, but I still feel that way.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about what you guys did (inaudible) and what
you did on the bus?  
LINDSEY ALLEN: Well, when we first landed in Lawton, we really didn't know
what was up at first. And we get off the plane and it's like really, really
windy, I remember, and then we just go inside to all the vending machines are
and just the general lobby of the airport, and so we were just playing card
games, Spades, chilling out, watching a little bit of Netflix on our computers
and all that stuff.  
JEWELL LOYD: We were just hanging, you know, we were being kids. Everyone is
laughing, dancing, we had was food delivered to the airport and we were
watching like the storm as it continued to rain, just the colors of the
clouds, stuff like that, and we were kind of just relaxing. It was a day for
us to just be kids.  
  
Q. Were you aware that Fort Sill is nearby and that's where the Buffalo
Soldiers were and it's actually where Geronimo is buried?  
JEWELL LOYD: Yeah, actually our trainer, Ann, she was telling us that as we
were playing Spades. We were actually learning a history lesson while playing
spades, so it`s the best of the both worlds.  
  
Q. You didn't know anything about what was going on when you landed in
Lawton, you thought you were in Oklahoma City?  
JEWELL LOYD: Well, we knew that we weren't in OKC. We knew that we landed
there, so we were just kind of like we'll wait for the bus, okay, just like a
normal day. And like I said before, we were just playing cards, enjoying the
moment and enjoying the time with teammates and the cheerleaders and the band,
so it was pretty fun.  
LINDSEY ALLEN: Oh, yeah, well, we were getting ready to land in OKC, the
captain just told us that the storm has really picked up and we're going to
land somewhere else. So then we waited, we flew another like four, I think
hour ‑‑ 40 minutes maybe to Lawton and landed and like Jewell said, just
chilled out a little bit and waited for our bus and the pizza to get here.  
  
Q. What do you know about Stanford? What have you seen of them? What kind of
team are they? What are you going to have to be prepared for?  
JEWELL LOYD: Well, they're very disciplined. They run a highball screen. They
drive and kick to shooters. They have two really good fast guards that are
very experienced, so we've been watching them and learning personnel,
obviously have really good shooters. They're very well‑coached. We've been
doing our preparation, and we feel pretty good going in.  
LINDSEY ALLEN: Just like Jewell said, they're a really disciplined team. They
know when they get their shots and where to get their shots, and they're going
to make you pay if you sign off them a little bit. They`ve been a little
inconsistent this year, but it`s tournament time and we know that we're going
to get their best game.  
  
Q. What did you take from the first two games of the tournament that you
played in South Bend? What did you take out of those two games as far as where
you are as a team now?  
LINDSEY ALLEN: I think we took each game individually. We just looked at the
results individually for each game, and we're just taking it one game at a
time right now, but we realize that we have to take the little things
seriously because we're going to get everyone's best game, and the intensity
really picks up around this time, so just taking it one game at a time and
focusing on us.  
JEWELL LOYD: I think as a whole we're playing with more heart and more
passion. People always said that we were really young and right now I don't
see that in us at all. We're very confident, motivated, and we're taking it‑‑
we're going along with the ride and we're having fun. That's the main thing.  
  
Q. (No microphone) how do you describe your leadership role with this team
versus what you did last year?  
JEWELL LOYD: Actually it's pretty easy when you have the team that we have and
coaches here. I didn't ask for the role, it just kind of just happened. Little
did we know we just kind of looked up, and oh, I guess it is me. But when you
have unselfish players on the team and everyone is learning from each other‑‑
I'm learning from Lindsay and Lindsay is learning from me and vice versa‑‑ it
makes it fun. It's a learning process. I like to learn. I'm a student of the
game so I'm learning from a different point of view than I was last year.  
  
Q. Game time is 9:00 here, which is 10:00 Notre Dame time. Any issues or
problems with that at all?  
JEWELL LOYD: I mean, it's game time. You've got to be able to play, whatever
the time is, wherever you play. You've still got to go out and play your game,
so you can't get caught up on the time.  
LINDSAY ALLEN: Yeah, we played late games this season. We played a few at 9:00
this year, 8:30, 8:00. So we just have to take what we have right now and just
make the best of it.
