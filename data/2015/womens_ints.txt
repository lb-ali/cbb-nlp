_UNCASVILLE, CONNECTICUT_  
  

UConn 84  
USF 70

  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us now from USF is head Coach, Jose Fernandez, along
with senior guard, Tamara Taylor, junior guard, Courtney Williams and junior
guard Shalethia Stringfield. Coach, a few comments to get us started?  
COACH FERNANDEZ: The one thing we talked about the first two times we played
them was no turnovers and points off of turnovers. We fixed that, tonight we
didn't turn the ball over. The issue was rebounding. We're fourth in the
country in defensive rebounds per game and that was uncharacteristic for us.  
I thought Connecticut did a great job on the glass. That was the difference. I
was extremely proud of our kids' effort. There were two 4‑minute segments in
that first half that really hurt us, the 12 to 8 media was not good, you know,
and they were able to extend, and you're down 23 at the half. We kept chipping
away and fighting.  
I've said it all along, you know, this team hasn't gotten the national
attention from the media all year, hasn't. But in the last seven days I think
these basketball players have proven that they can compete and play with
anybody in the country. Connecticut is very, very good. They make the most out
of every possession. They make the most out of every trip. I thought our kids
really battled and played hard.  
  
Q. Courtney, South Florida played UConn tougher than anybody this year. This
loss was their smallest of the season, their smallest conference loss on the
season. What is it about your team that enabled it to do this?  
COURTNEY WILLIAMS: I think we just play hard. I think we don't give up when
we're down. Like coach said to the media they really hurt us. But we went into
the locker room at half time and got ourselves together and said "Look we got
to get ourselves back in this game," so I think we went out and tried our best
to do that.  
  
Q. How do you think this is going to translate into the tournament, having
played them? It's not likely that you're going to play anybody certainly so
unique and has that kind of skill set. Do you think this has served your team
well?  
COURTNEY WILLIAMS: Oh, yeah, UConn is ‑‑ they don't make mistakes, and when
they do you have to capitalize on it. I'm not downplaying other teams but
they're No. 1 in the country for a reason. As long as we don't run up against
them‑‑ I mean, we going to be ready, you know? As long as we get into a
different bracket, I think we should be fine coming back to Temple for the
Final Four.  
  
Q. Tamara, can you address the lack of respect that this team gets? Do you
think the fact that you're in the conference with UConn affects that at all?
Because a team with ‑‑ I think all but a couple of your losses have come
against RPI Top‑10 opponents, if I'm not mistaken.   
TAMARA TAYLOR: Like she said, UConn is a very good team. We go out there and
play and do what we supposed to do, anybody is beatable. I think we fought
hard, we didn't give up and we just stuck to the game plan.  
We made shots, and, I mean, anybody is beatable.  
  
Q. Overall nationally, can you talk about what you think you showed the
nation?  
TAMARA TAYLOR: I made big shots when I need to do to help my team win and
that's what I got recruited for. My teammates did a good job of finding me.
And Istop, one, two, three, pull‑up ‑‑ they got bigs, I can't get to the rim,
because they are gonna block it, so I pull‑up.  
  
Q. Courtney, you came in yesterday to the press conference, knees taped up
and looked like you were limping a little bit when you walked in. Feeling all
right?  
COURTNEY WILLIAMS: I'm fine. I tweaked my ankle a little bit but we got time
before the tournament, I'll be fine.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Jose, what is your scout for these teams that are going to have to play
UConn in the next three weeks?  
COACH FERNANDEZ: Why should I help them? (Laughter.)  
  
Q. At times this season it seemed like it was the Courtney Williams show,
and this time you got a lot of people stepping up and maturity. How important
is that in the overall picture and getting five or six players contributing
offensively?  
COACH FERNANDEZ: You're absolutely correct. If you took on the our first 10
games and you touch on our nonconference schedule, do I need to one through
those? Villanova, Chattanooga was in the Top‑25, what are they now, 17 in the
AP Poll? Is that correct? Yeah, we beat Oklahoma on a neutral floor, too, by
18. Our losses were to Kentucky by 2 and Maryland on the road, with Canedo and
Weber injured. We relied on Courtney Williams a lot early. I think through the
course of a year, you evolve and develop your guys and we gotta have more
point production outside of Courtney and Alisia.  
Some of the things that Connecticut does when we play Courtney, you know, we
don't see that. But if we can get production from Laura Ferreira and Tamara
and have solid point guard play like we have for us to be successful and take
the next step we have to have better balanced, you're correct.  
  
Q. Jose, we've seen enough teams come in to play Connecticut that are
intimidated by the uniform, don't have a game plan and don't seem to be really
prepared. Obviously you have never had that problem and your kids play with
tremendous energy and drive. What is it that you instill in them that's
different that makes them know that they can compete in any game against
anybody?  
COACH FERNANDEZ: It starts in the locker room. You've got to win in the locker
room before you win on the court. I think it's a credit to their character and
the culture that we have in the program. I think sometimes a team takes a
personality of the head coach and the staff and I think I've always been a
fighter my whole life. We got a lot of fighters in that locker room that play
with energy and intensity and with a lot of desire. It's great to come in and
coach kids with passion. Those are the type of kids that we recruit.  
  
Q. Stewart scored in double figures last 19 post ‑season games, Kaleena
Mosquesa‑Lewis last 18. Can you address defending teams that have two players
like that, seems like when they need to score they score.   
COACH FERNANDEZ: Two very good players that are going to play in the WNBA.
They got five guys that shoot over 50%, so it's tough, especially how you
defend the post or double the post because then they make good decisions.  
What Connecticut does so well I think is they move the basketball and pass
really well. So your defense makes adjustments and slides and your reactions
to passes have to be very, very good. I think, you know, it's postseason time
and Stewart is playing really, really well. But I've always said, I think
Stewart is the best player in the country. I think most valuable for them is
Moriah Jefferson. She is the engine. I'm happy for our conference. I hope we
get three teams in, and we'll see you guys in the NCAA Tournament.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_UNCASVILLE, CONNECTICUT_  
  

UConn 84  
USF 70

  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Head Coach, Geno Auriemma, senior forward,
Kaleena Mosqueda‑Lewis, junior forward, Breanna Stewart, and sophmore forward,
Morgan Tuck. We will take questions for our student‑athletes first.  
Q. Morgan, how did it feel to be playing in the tournament, and what did you
feel your contribution was this year?  
MORGAN TUCK: We tried to make sure that we were boxing out and being more
aggressive than they were on rebounds.  
  
Q. Morgan, it's fair to say that no one has played you guys tougher than
them this season. What is it about them being able to stay in the
neighborhood?  
MORGAN TUCK: I think they have a mentality where they're just not going to
quit. I think sometimes when teams get down a lot they quit, but USF hasn't
done that. You know, this is the third time we've played them and each time,
you know, we took a half, they came out even more aggressive, and it doesn't
matter what the score is. They play hard the whole time.  
  
Q. Kaleena, two games in a row, East Carolina and South Florida today. You
guys came out not quite matching the other team's intensity in the second
half. Does that concern you at all, or is it you are up so much it's hard to
match the intensity?  
KALEENA MOSQUEDA‑LEWIS: Doesn't concern me, very much. We do need to focus on
coming out in the second half as aggressive and intense as we were in the
first half, but I'm not too worried about it. It's something that we're going
to work on in practice and something us as starters and upper classmen are
going to make sure we focus on going forward.  
  
Q. Kaleena, going into the NCAA Tournament, how would you assess how this
team is playing?  
KALEENA MOSQUEDA‑LEWIS: I think we're doing a great job. Everybody on the team
is playing great, Morgan is doing well inside, Stewie is playing great, and
Mariah is playing as confident as she has all season, so I'm not too worried
about it, especially when people like Gabby come in and make big contributions
for us.  
  
Q. Stewie, we know there has been a lot of physical play against you, but
watching the way they were playing against you today and the way that the lack
of calls were going, how difficult it to resist just going out and standing at
the 3 ‑point line, since you can make that shot as easily, too. You managed to
stay inside and deal with it.   
BREANNA STEWART: I think all game the coaches were telling me to keep moving,
that kind of thing. I was expecting this. It was there this whole weekend, and
it was there last weekend, and I'm expecting it in the future. You have to
play through it whether the refs are going to call it or not. You can't let
refs decide the game.  
  
Q. Stewie, how well did these three days set you guys up for what's to come
in the NCAA Tournament?  
BREANNA STEWART: I think it prepared us. Teams are going to give us their best
shot, and three games in three days is a lot, but it's fun. It's exciting to
play this many games, and I think that each game we've grown and our bench has
gotten deeper and Gabby coming off the bench and Kia coming off the bench and
others coming off the bench, they all made big contributions.  
  
Q. How important was it for this game to have a team that challenged you
going into the NCAA Tournament where you're going to face teams you are not
going to blow out by 40 points every night?  
BREANNA STEWART: I think it's really important, and it's a lesson. The way we
came out the second half is something that we don't want to do as a team, but
that's why we have week, week and a half before we have to play our next game,
so we can use that to get better.  
  
Q. Breanna, sum up the young lady to your left? What has she meant to this
tournament?  
BREANNA STEWART: You know, Kaleena does a lot and I think sometimes people
underestimate her talents and that kind of thing, and it shouldn't be that at
all. The way she came out and played this three‑game stretch, that's exactly
how she plays. When she has confidence and everything is going for her, she is
hard to stop, and as you saw tonight she got whatever she wanted.  
  
Q. Morgan, you're playing this year, you're a part of all this as a player,
student ‑athlete, how does it feel and to make the All Tournament Team in that
first year?   
MORGAN TUCK: Feels great to be out there on the court, beats last year sitting
and watching. I'm just glad to be out there with my teammates and doing
everything I can to help us win.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Geno, is that a typical Kaleena performance to you? She played forty
minutes and all the assists and rebounds she had ‑‑  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah. I was saying to one of the other coaches that one of the
important things that I thought came out of it was that she, you know, K had
23 points and only made one, three. Usually when K scores a lot of points it's
four or five three's and not as many others. I thought today she made it hard
to guard‑‑ she made herself hard to guard because she was scoring from all
over the court, not just beyond the three‑point line. And that's something she
has been working on, to her credit. She has become more than a three‑point
shooter, and tonight she certainly showed that.  
  
Q. Geno, how would you assess how this team is playing heading into the NCAA
Tournament?  
COACH AURIEMMA: You know, at this time, this time of the year, because the
NCAA Tournament is so far away, twelve days or something like that, you really
can't put a lot of stock in what happens this weekend. This weekend you're
just trying to win and hopefully building some momentum, but there is so much
time that's going to be‑‑ between here and the opening round that we did what
we needed to do to win. We played great, and we didn't play so great at times.  
So that's probably the way you would want it to be. You know, you would want
it to be where there is enough things that you want to get better at so that
you don't feel like we don't even need to practice, we're so good.  
I think we're probably right in the spot that we enjoy being at this time of
the year.  
  
Q. Geno, do you believe it benefits South Florida going into the tournament
to have played you three times, or do you think the tournament is just about
match ‑ups and whatnot? Is there a tangible benefit?   
COACH AURIEMMA: There is, for sure. They're one of the better teams that's
going to be in the tournament. They haven't gotten a lot of respect over the
years. They've allowed a couple of bad losses to kind of dictate who they are,
according to the media and the polls.  
But they're a lot better than people give them credit for. One of the things
that I was happy to see for them was that they got more people involved in
their offense today rather than just Courtney Williams. That's when they are
really hard to guard, when she is doing her thing and everybody else is
involved as well.  
That's going to help them going forward. I don't think they're going to play a
lot of teams that are way better than us. So if they get the right match‑ups,
I don't think there is any team that they're going to play that they can't
beat.  
  
Q. Geno, when it comes to Marchit's about winning championships. Do you see
a difference in your teams annually when it comes to March?  
COACH AURIEMMA: General speaking I would say yes. There is a different vibe on
our team come March. We go about things a little bit differently than we do
during the regular season. There is a certain excitement that maybe isn't
there in Februarybecause it's been a long season, but when it's time to play
in the Conference Championship or for the National Championship in the NCAA
Tournament, if you stay the same as you were during the regular season, you're
not going anywhere. You can't stay the same. You can't stay the same mentally,
emotionally, physically. You gotta change.  
There has been very few years, let's put it that way, when there hasn't been
an uptick in our team come March, and I would expect the exact same thing is
happening right now.  
The only problem is you have so many young guys that are going to play some
roles that you don't know how they're going to react. That's why it was so
important for our four starters to play great this tournament, because that's
where it's going to fall; it's going to fall on them. Those other guys can
come off the bench and give you a little bit, and Gabby gave us a lot, and
Saniya gave us a little bit. Those four guys are going to have to get it done,
and hopefully we get a little bit out of those other guys.  
  
Q. Geno, Both Carolina and South Florida came out with very strong second
halves against you, and you guys seemed to drop off intensity ‑wise. Does that
concern you at all, or is that a by‑product of being up 40 or up 20?   
COACH AURIEMMA: Anytime somebody goes into the locker room and they're down 30
or they're down 20, and they're getting blown out, and they come out and they
stay blown out, then you know what, they shouldn't have come out in the second
half at all.  
So teams like East Carolina and teams like South Florida, you like to think
they are going into the locker room and they come out with a sense of we're
going to at least compete. But I think one thing that gets lost when you cover
a lot of Connecticut games is that the other team is not allowed to play well.
I think it's a reminder today that those guys recruit guys that are
scholarship players, and every once in a while it should be okay for them to
play well, without us having to answer why we didn't play well.  
  
Q. You know, there was a point in the first half when Morgan picked up her
second foul, Kia came in and picked up two quick fouls and you put Gabby in,
and she got two quick offensive rebounds and put ‑backs. Can you talk about
what that did to set the tone for the rest of the half?   
COACH AURIEMMA: If we didn't have that, there would have been a different feel
to the game if Gabby hadn't done that. And then in the second half, she did a
really good job defensively. So going forward, there are going to be players
that we play against, I think, that for stretches, Gabby might be the only
person on the team that can guard them. Because she is big enough and quick
enough that she can do it. So it was big for her to contribute and feel
confident and feel like she did some good things and that she is able to, you
know, start the NCAA Tournament and go, "I wonder if I'm good enough to play
in the postseason." I think what she did today was really, really important;
important for her and important for us.  
  
Q. Geno, Stewie scored in double figures in every post ‑season game she
played, and Kaleena in every one except for one of her games, including 18 in
a row now. Are they just wired differently, or is that the type of kid that
you commonly recruit here?   
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, you would like to say that we recruit those kinds of
kids, because we recruit those over the years. But the other thing that is
notable, those two have a unique quality about them. They love the big
moments, they love the big games. Stewie more than K. K has grown into that,
because every year since she was here she has been kind of like the other guy,
and this year we're kinda going to her a lot, and Stewie has been the other
guy. Because K and Bria, they kind of set the tone for everybody. But when
they're called on, they always deliver; they have a knack for it. We try to
get K in as many different situations as possible today, and wherever we put
her, she came through. Stewie is Stewie.  
I think if we change Stewie's number from 30 to something else, the people
that are officiating our games wouldn't have as much trouble calling fouls. I
just think they just are allergic to saying No. 30 is going to the free‑throw
line. I don't know whether there is a conference rule on that, I'm going to
have to check with the conference office.  
  
Q. Geno, in the last 25 years how accurate have your instincts been at the
end of the Conference Tournament about whether your team has the capability to
win a national championship?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Um, you know, I'm not bragging, but I'm rarely wrong in that
scenario. After you spend five months with your team you know them pretty
well. The years that we've gone to postseason play, we knew we were the best
team in the country. It turned out to be we were the best team in the country
and we proved it. There has been a number of times where we've even gone to
the Final Four and I knew that unless something magical happened, we weren't
going to win. I just knew it.  
I don't let the players know that, but I would keep my fingers crossed
thinking, man, I hope this doesn't happen and that doesn't happen, and that
doesn't happen. And then there are years like last year, and 2010, where you
don't give it a second thought; you just know. We're going there, and we're
going to win, and that's all there is to it. So your team tells you a lot over
a period of five years. I mean, five months, this team ‑‑ this team is not
very loud. I don't know‑‑ they haven't said a lot. They're constantly just
very quiet. So I'm always kind of surprised by the things they do because I
watch them sometimes, and I don't think they can do them, and then they
surprise me.  
But I also know if our four starters play like they did this weekend and like
they did in the big games, like we played this year, we're going to be hard to
beat, really hard to beat.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach.

# [AMERICAN ATHLETIC CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=AMERICAN+ATHLETIC+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2015

  

### [Lisa Stockton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15665)

  
_UNCASVILLE, CONNECTICUT_  
  
USF - 78  
Tulane - 59  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us now are Coach Lisa Stockton and guard Danielle Blagg
and guard Courtnie Latham. Coach?  
COACH STOCKTON: Yeah, I'm really proud of our team, I thought that um all
those quick turn‑arounds and we're playin' a team like South Florida, who's
very talented. I think they executed a game plan to the tee. We put in a
different defense, we knew where we wanted to go on offense. I thought our
team did such a good job in making adjustments in a few hours‑‑ well, actually
20 minutes. I thought we battled and fought and did some good things and had
some foul trouble and ended up with an all‑guard lineup and they did a
tremendous job there. But I am proud of our effort and we did a nice job
coming here and we competed.  
  
Q. You mentioned foul trouble but Duru didn't foul out, what was the reason
for not bringing her back in?  
COACH STOCKTON: At that point we were start willing to make a run. I thought
we had done a nice job, we tied it, we were on a run and sometimes when you
got something going on‑‑ I thought Duru did a nice job, I thought we need to
do keep it rollin' and I really like having too many players and not knowing
who to play and I thought that was sometimes the problem tonight.  
  
Q. Obviously a disappointing loss after a hard ‑fought and by far the best
game of this tournament. What do you think it's done to your chances at the
NCAA's? I had you in if you won this game. What's your argument? Take your
opportunity to argue for that?   
COACH STOCKTON: This is a very good league and I think we've established
ourselves. You look at our nonconference schedule, I think we had one of the
toughest nonconference schedules and we had one of the toughest conference
scheduled if you look at that. We beat some good teams that they are saying
are in. You look at our API, our strength of schedule. We battled injuries the
last few weeks but we came back and proved that we could play with them and I
thought our kids rallied there. This is a good league and as far as being
represented if you make your case I just don't believe that a conference, the
SEC, the ACC should go over a team in our league when that team has outplayed
them all year and I think this team really has.  
  
Q. Coach, if you do go to the NCAA tournament again and you face UConn, what
would you do differently?  
COACH STOCKTON: We face UConn? I don't think that would be for a while. I've
only been in this conference for one year and I've learned you don't worry
about playing UConn until that happens. When you play UConn or a team of that
caliber you've got to play every play. That's what we tried to do last time we
played them. You got to play every position and you can't worry about‑‑ if
they're going to run, you got to play every possession, no one has been able
to stay with them, they have made that point clearly and I think our league
it's criticized real bad but when you look at what Notre Dame did today in the
ACC Tournament and what they did to Notre Dame it shows you how far ahead they
are of everyone else in the country.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

### [Heather Macy](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28432)

### [Jada Payne](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28434)

### [I'Tiana Taylor](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28433)

  
_UNCASVILLE, CONNECTICUT_  
  

UConn  106  
East Carolina  56

  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us is East Carolina Coach Heather Macy, along with Jada
Payne and I'Tiana Taylor. Coach?  
COACH MACY: Sorry to keep y'all waiting. Right? Second half, obviously played
much better, I think there is a lot of things to build on moving forward for
our basketball team.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for our players?  
  
Q. Can you talk about what was said at halftime? You guys came out and did
some sprints there on the court there before the second half began. What was
the difference?  
I'TIANA TAYLOR: That's how we start out, with a warm‑up. And I mean Coach just
told us to work harder on you know, our side of the court you know.  
  
Q. I'Tiana are they incredibly difficult to guard or did you guys feel like
you didn't have the proper defensive intensity in the first half?  
I'TIANA TAYLOR: They're a really good team and we had to stick to our game
plan, so...  
  
Q. Same question. What was the difference between the first half and the
second half and how did you guys not get down on yourselves at half time, down
62 ‑22?   
JADA PAYNE: Well, mostly our intensity in the second half, we wanted to defend
the way we needed to in the first half.  
There are a lot of things we need to improve on, so we went into the second
half with those adjustments in our mind and Coach Macy told us in order to get
to that level that we need to outwork them and outhustle them and I think we
did a much better job of that in the second half.  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for our players? Thanks, ladies, you're
free to go. Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. Coach, all year we've heard that the big thing about UConn is they never
take a play off no matter how much they're ahead or who they are playing. Is
that the message you were accepting to your team, not taking a play off?  
COACH MACY: I thought it was important for us in the second half to build as a
basketball program so we're going to coach it like it's a practice. That's how
we were coaching, close‑outs, jumping to the pass, defensive box‑outs and the
kids responded and they understood it was going to be about getting better
during that 20 minutes versus running up and down playing pick‑up and that's
what I felt like we did the first half, played a lot of pick‑up.  
  
Q. Coach, now that you've seen them a few times this year, obviously you
were aware of them beforehand. What's it going to take to close the gap
against UConn in this league? They have run through the first two years in the
American.  
COACH MACY: They're an incredible basketball team and as we all had seen the
gap is very wide. I think it's going to be a concerted effort on our part with
the players we coach, how we coach them and the mental preparation getting
ready for this basketball game.  
  
Q. Can you explain taking the manager and assistant coaches during the time
‑out and standing them up on the side of the bench, were you worried about
Connecticut looking into your huddle?   
COACH MACY: You would have to describe where they were standing, I'm not even
sure.  
  
Q. They were to your right and standing aside from each other, three of
them, Geno turned around and waved to them in the second half.  
COACH MACY: I'm not sure about that, but I guess I got some body guards, I
appreciate them. I'm going to have to assess that!  
  
Q. Coach, moving forward obviously today was a very hard ‑fought game.
Moving forward do you think East Carolina did all they can do to secure a turn
any bid?   
COACH MACY: I would think so. I think we were really hot late and we played
our best basketball in Februaryand leading up to March. I'm excited to
hopefully continue coaching this basketball team.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach.

### [Jose Fernandez](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24911)

### [Alisia Jenkins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28438)

### [Courtney Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26554)

  
_UNCASVILLE, CONNECTICUT_  
  

USF 78  
Tulane 59

  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us from USF is head Coach, Jose Fernandez, we will open
for questions while we wait for Alisia Jenkins, Courtney Williams. Coach,
comments?  
COACH FERNANDEZ: I told our kids, you know, last Monday to get an opportunity
to play for a conference championship we needed to get through two nights. I
thought yesterday we played with incredible energy in the first half and got
to rest and play a lot of guys. Tonight I wasn't pleased with our defensive
effort. I thought Lisa and Tulane's basketball team did an amazing job. They
showed on national TV why they picked up some very good quality, nonconference
wins. They're also‑‑ I've been on that wrong side of the bubble four times and
it's not fun, but I think how they played up here in three days and how they
played against us, you know, there is four, five, six teams vying for the
final three, four spots for the NCAA Tournament and they proved they are NCAA
at‑large worthy with the other teams that are being considered.  
We will be thinking about them on Selection Monday.  
  
Q. Courtney, it's a tie game, you hit three at the buzzer, and then you hit
a two and then you come down and make a defensive play. Do you think that's
who you are, your team is in a tough spot, playing for a title, you want to
step up and make those plays?  
COURTNEY WILLIAMS: Yes, sir, definitely I think I've proven that I can take
that shot, so Coach trusts me to take that shot and has confidence in me and
draws the play up for me to be able to win it.  
  
Q. Big difference between yesterday and today. What was the difference for
you?  
COURTNEY WILLIAMS: Um, I think just staying focused or trying to stay focused.  
I think Alisia got us going, because without her we definitely wouldn't have
been in the spot that we was in to even win that game.  
  
Q. Alisia, this is two big games inside where you have taken charge and done
things. Now, I know that you want to enjoy the victory but can you talk about
the size that Connecticut is going to present inside and how you go about
taking on something like that with the rebounding and things that you do so
well?  
ALISIA JENKINS: Truthfully I'm going to have to believe in myself and hit hard
and fight for rebounds like I normally do. Just do all the small things.  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, you're free to leave.  
  
Q. Coach, you're facing an utter juggernaut in UConn, they beat Eastern
Carolina by 50 today in one of the best first halves I've seen, how do you
plan to slow them down on both their aggressiveness on offense and defense?  
COACH FERNANDEZ: They were at 82% before‑‑'s four second shot before the half,
I thought it brought their field goal percentage to 78. I thought last Monday
night, that's what happened to us in the first half.  
I thought they shot a big number and we turned the ball over and in the second
half we got in the flow and we defended a lot better and we made shots.  
I think, you know, they cannot get‑‑ they're just too good offensively, you
got five, six guys over 50%, they're too good to get wide‑open looks.  
So we have to make sure that every shot they take is challenge and had if they
make those shots and there is a solid, good contest, we got to inbound it and
go answer. That's our plan. We're excited, we're playing for a Conference
Championship, right?  
  
Q. Coach you mentioned how yesterday you were able to rest team and I'm sure
that will help, but you had to get 40 out of Alicia and Courtney today. Does
that concern you trying to get past them?  
COACH FERNANDEZ: At this time of the year everybody is tired. We played a lot
of basketball. Maybe that wasn't the best for them not to be rested to be
honest with you, because we hadn't played since Monday against the No. 1 team
in the country and the we looked very sluggish today, we looked out of rhythm.  
Laura Ferreira, we haven't had one kid foul out all year and she fouled out
today. She doesn't defend hard enough to foul out, seriously. We didn't
contain the dribble, we were leaving our feet, we went under flares, we were
uncharacteristic today. If we do that tomorrow it will be the same scenario
that happened up at Gamble and that won't be fun on national TV.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach.

### [Geno Auriemma](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14072)

### [Moriah Jefferson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28435)

### [Kaleena Mosqueda-
Lewis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23275)

  
_UNCASVILLE, CONNECTICUT_  
  

UConn  106  
East Carolina  56

  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us from Connecticut is junior guard, Moriah Jefferson
and senior forward Kaleena Mosquesa‑Lewis. We will start with questions.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
MORIAH JEFFERSON: It was good. Got to play basketball so that's all that
matters.  
  
Q. Moriah, the first seven baskets you guys had were layups. Can you talk
about how your mentality was in terms of getting inside early, were you doing
what you were trying to do and getting off to an aggressive start?  
MORIAH JEFFERSON: No, they being really aggressive. So anytime somebody's
playin' on you that hard, you really just wanna try to drive and get by 'em.
Either you get a lay‑up or you have to make somebody help and dump it off to
the post players, so really I was just trying to get to the basket.  
  
Q. Kaleena, do you feel the team is building momentum, these two games have
been UConn for the most part, is that something you sense?  
KALEENA MOSQUEDA‑LEWIS: It's definitely something we like to build on. Each
game we try to make sure that we're doing things better and better, so whether
it's defensively, offensively, finding a flow with each other, we definitely
try to build on that, especially after these first two games, playing as a
team and tomorrow we will hopefully play even better than that.  
  
Q. Kaleena, can you just talk about your first half and the team's first
half, 62 points in a half. Was that the best half you guys have played
offensively this season? How did you come out for this game?  
KALEENA MOSQUEDA‑LEWIS: I think that's a question for Coach.  
  
Q. Players first.  
KALEENA MOSQUEDA‑LEWIS: I don't know if that's the best half we have had but
it was definitely an aggressive half‑‑ one of the most aggressive halves we
have had, attacking them offensively, defensively, making sure we're not
backing down and making sure we were the ones bein' the aggressors. It's
definitely something we made a point to do tonight.  
  
Q. How tough is it to play three games if a row, three days?  
MORIAH JEFFERSON: It's really tough, pressing and running all over the court.
I think it's just a mental thing, you have to stay focused mentally and we
have been going after things like that all season in practice, going hard in
practice day‑after‑day, so I think that makes is easier when you are going
into these games.  
  
Q. Kaleena, 5 out of 7, 3 ‑point shooting guard, almost video game numbers.
Did you feel like you were just open or you had a good flow goin'?   
KALEENA MOSQUEDA‑LEWIS: It was all Moriah, no I think that, you know it just
felt like I was open. My teammates were doing a good job, like Moriah said,
when the defense playing you that hard and they're pressuring you wanna make
sure that you're attacking them, and the guards on our team did a great job of
making sure they were making penetration and finding the open man and so um, I
think that's what it was and also our post players are doing a great job at
carving out some space and when they were doubled they kicked it out.  
THE MODERATOR: I thanks, ladies. Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. Geno, given how many three's that she has made in her time here, are you
ever stunned at how wide open she is? I've been here both days and I was ‑‑  
COACH AURIEMMA: I thought there was a couple times tonight where I was
surprised she shot it and it was like there wasn't anybody there but I thought
tonight there were a couple of contested shots.  
You know, it's really hard to run plays for a great 3‑point shooter. If you're
not going to guard anybody, at least you're going to guard that guy.  
So I like the fact that we get a lot of K's three's, where they come from some
transition stuff, somewhere‑‑ you know, our guards are pretty good at getting
in the lane, and she's pretty good at not wasting a lot of time and just
catching and shooting.  
Seven 3‑pointers is a lot in the game, take seven. That's probably a good
number. I would be happy if it was ten if she played more minutes. Some guys
in our league that have taken 500 shots. Love to see how many points some of
my guys would score if they took 500 shots in the season up to now.  
We try to be efficient, you know. Getting the 3‑point shooter open is not
easy, it's not easy so you got to get 'em when their defense isn't set.  
  
Q. Yesterday you said you were kind of looking forward to the athleticism
and speed of this team. You trounced them in the first half but did you see
some of that? Was there that challenge for your team?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah, I think so. You know, when there is‑‑ like our guys look
like they play at a certain pace, and it works for us, you know, against every
team we play. But when we play a team‑‑ and it's happened this year a bunch of
times, I think. We play a team that is athletic like this team and is physical
like this team, because our guys kick it into another gear, it almost looks
like they're not nearly as athletic as they looked last night against whoever
they played last night. Or however athletic they will look tomorrow night if
they played tomorrow night. But when they play us and we don't play at that
pace that we played, let's say, maybe last night because now all of the sudden
we know who we're playing and we play at a completely different pace, it makes
them look less than what they are. That's why we do what we do. That's why we
practice the way we practice, to take advantage of nights like tonight.  
  
Q. Geno, I remember at the South Carolina game you talked about what it
would take for them to become a national power and win championships, and I
think you mentioned three things they need to do. Along those lines, you've
run through the conference for two years, 20 points is the closest game you
have had in two years. What's it going to take for that gap to close, what do
schools need to do to make this a more competitive conference? Is it a time
thing? Is there something schools can do to make this not a 40 ‑point blowout?
  
COACH AURIEMMA: What's the difference whether it's a 40‑point blow out or you
win anyway? Is the ACC really competitive? Notre Dame has lost one game in two
years. In our league if you take us out of the league, this league is pretty
competitive, because at the end of the season, if you were third, and you
lost, you went to, like, seventh. So South Florida and UConn, yeah, because of
where we come from and because of what our backgrounds are and what we're used
to dealing with, a little different than the rest of the teams in our league,
somewhat, but the rest of the conference is very competitive among themselves.
It's just that putting us in it changes everything. If we weren't in this
league, everybody would say, wow, that's a pretty competitive conference.
Every game is pretty competitive.  
Putting us in there, it changes everything. I'm sure the ACC is a very
competitive place to play until Notre Dame got there.  
  
Q. Geno, what did you make of the three managers standing side ‑by‑side? We
saw you wave to them!   
COACH AURIEMMA: Somebody mentioned it yesterday‑‑ I hadn't seen it. Somebody
mentioned it yesterday so today I wanted to look down there and see what all
the commotion was about and I saw the three guys lined up there, just staring
at us and I gotta say, I've never seen that before. I was like kind of like,
what are you guys looking at? I couldn't figure out, was there something going
on in that huddle that we weren't supposed to know? But I gotta tell you, I've
been coaching forty years and I've never seen that, ever.  
  
Q. You waved at them. Did they wave back?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I think their orders are like London Yards‑‑ you know, the
guys that are guarding the Queen, they're not allowed to smile, but one guy
couldn't help himself, I made him turn and look away, he started laughing but
he didn't want to get caught. He didn't want to get in big trouble.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2015

  

### [Maegan Conwright](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28384)

### [Sue Semrau](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24768)

  
_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

Notre Dame  71  
Florida State - 58

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening statement from coach and then take
questions for the players.  
COACH SEMRAU: Well, they're a tough, tough basketball team. I thought they
played extremely well. I thought defensively there was a stretch where they
held us scoreless for awhile. I thought that affected our defense. And any
time our defense is affected, that's not our strong suit.  
We have got to be able ‑‑ that's what we hang our hat on, defending on
rebounding. And this is the first time we have been out rebounded all year.  
I think that's what hurts the most is that in a big game situation, we lost
what we were best at. Give credit to Notre Dame. I mean, they put us in tough
positions defensively and made big plays.  
  
Q. Do you think the fact that Notre Dame had been in it last year and that
you all were very rightfully to be in the game made any difference?  
COACH SEMRAU: Well, it sure looked like it in the first half. I thought that
maybe ‑‑ I think any time you have experience at something it's a great
teacher.  
I felt like the first time that we played at Notre Dame on January 2nd, that
that experience was a great teacher for us for the rest of the year. For the
rest of our conference games.  
This experience will be a great teacher for us.  
  
Q. Obviously you got some more games to play, Maegan, what have you learned
from the ACC tournament experience at this point?  
MAEGAN CONWRIGHT: We played against some of the best, so going into
tournament, that gives us a really strong suit as far as getting started.
We're playing against some of the best people, potential Final Four teams. So
to learn from them we wish we could have won, but to learn from them and get
better is really the thing that we're going to take out of this.  
  
Q. You've been playing very well. Is this just kind of a blip particularly
since you got so long to get ready for your next game?  
COACH SEMRAU: Yeah, I think it was just more mentality and possibly it was ‑‑
I just haven't seen my team respond that way in so long.  
We haven't‑‑ very, very, rarely have played from behind. So, you can ask my
SID, the statistic is unbelievable. That we lead in most games for the entire
game. Maybe they come and make a run.  
So, learning how to play from behind is something that hopefully we got a
taste of here today and we'll learn from that.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you.  
COACH SEMRAU: Thank you.

### [Jewell Loyd](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26561)

### [Muffet McGraw](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14071)

  
_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

Notre Dame  71  
Florida State - 58

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening statement from coach before taking
questions.  
COACH MCGRAW: I'm really proud of this team for where we came from to win
this. To go through the league with just one loss I think was a remarkable
accomplishment. We had so many new pieces to fit together and I think with
Jewell Loyd's leadership, we were able to just get a little bit better every
game.  
Tonight I thought was the best game we played all year. I don't think it's the
best game we will play but it was definitely the best game we have played so
far. Jewell was phenomenal. Madison Cable, Brianna Turner, Lindsay Allen, Taya
Reimer, everybody that came in the game I thought, gave us great minutes.
Great team win.  
  
Q. The stretch of the game where you really took command was when Madison
was in the game there, hits the two, 3 ‑pointers. Jewell gets the thing
started. Talk a little bit about what you were doing well there, and‑‑  
COACH MCGRAW: Well, when Madison comes in, she always gives us a spark. She
brings instant energy, usually it's on the defensive side, by taking a charge
or getting a steal. Tonight it was both ends. She hit the threes, some really
key shots.  
I thought they lost her on the wing in transition a couple of times and she
was able to knock it down and that was just a big momentum swing for us when
she came in the game. Best sixth man in basketball.  
  
Q. How important is scoring balance to your success?  
COACH MCGRAW: I thought it was really key. Everybody's going to key on Jewell
and try to take her away so, when somebody else can come in and make shots I
think it's really great for the team.  
I think it takes pressure off everybody. Everybody wants to contribute and
they're just looking for their opportunities. I thought we started the game
well with Brianna and Taya trying to go inside. I think that really opened
things up for the guards.  
  
Q. Is there anything that Jewell does on the basketball court that surprises
you, that she does something that comes out and says oh my goodness, every
game just to surprise you?  
COACH MCGRAW: I think the turnovers, they always surprise me.  
(Laughter.)  
I think that the back door opportunities, the post ups. I thought yesterday's
game was fun to watch when she took over the game in that stretch.  
And she did the same thing tonight at times when we needed a bucket, we were
trying to use some clock, and she was able to shake free and get some layups
and some post up opportunities. So, she never ceases to amaze me.  
  
Q. Talk about the defense in this tournament. You're holding a very good
basketball team shooting under 40 percent. What's going well?  
COACH MCGRAW: Yeah, that's great for me to see. We are a team that has worked
on our defense all year long. I think since the first time we played Georgia
Tech, I really wasn't happy with the defense and from then on I think we've
really made some great strides.  
Our help side is better, our on the ball defense is better, our zone is
better. I think we're mixing things up a little bit better. So I think the
freshmen are getting more comfortable and more aware of how we're trying to
rotate.  
  
Q. Jewell, with about seven minutes left to go in the game you got the ball
and you drove to the basket and Bulgak was there. And you put on a move that I
don't think too many people can put on a move. You went under ‑‑ you ducked
under and then you had some kind of spin on the basketball that got the ball
in. How long do you ‑‑ how can you practice for things like that?   
JEWELL LOYD: Well, I do have an older brother who used to always block my shot
and then practicing against Brianna Turner, you learn. You have to. And having
trust and knowing that my abilities to go in there. But having confidence from
my teammates for sure helped a lot.  
  
Q. Maddy, when you see a play like that ‑‑ you were on court at the time but
when you see a play like that, do you say, how does she do that?   
MADISON CABLE: I literally stood there and said, wow. I should have probably
been running back on defense but it was amazing play. But like coach said, it
didn't surprise me.  
  
Q. Jewell, talk a little bit about when Madison comes in a game, and the
energy she brings, and the way she plays, how much inspiration do you on the
other players draw from the way she plays?  
JEWELL LOYD: I love it. Maddy is awesome. She's dedicated, she risks her body,
she always brings energy no matter what. She has cramps in her leg and she is
still giving you a 110 percent. That motivates all of us to play like that.
She's the real MVP.  
MADISON CABLE: Thanks, Jewell.  
  
Q. Did you take a ‑‑ right when you came in early in the game you got in a
little collision. Looked like you took one to the solar plexus?  
MADISON CABLE: I tried to steal it but I didn't and I got the wind knocked out
of me, bad timing. I'm fine.  
JEWELL LOYD: She's tough.  
MADISON CABLE: Yeah.  
  
Q. How long ‑‑ what's your plans now with the long break and‑‑  
COACH MCGRAW: We're on spring break, so the girls are heading home from here
and we'll reconvene on Friday.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

## March 7, 2015

  

### [Mariya Moore](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28386)

### [Jeff Walz](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19715)

  
_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

Florida State  66  
Louisville - 51

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll get started with an opening statement from coach and then
take questions for the student‑athletes.  
COACH WALZ: Congratulations to Florida State. I thought they came out with a
lot of energy. Played extremely hard. Did a great job of executing in the
first half. We were extremely poor again. I mean it's twice that we played
them and unfortunately, they come out two times, and I'll take the blame for
it. I've got to figure out a way to get some of these kids motivated to get
going, to get the games off to a better start.  
You get down ‑‑ I think it's 24 in the first half ‑‑ and then you climb all
the way back and get it to a 2‑point game and then you expend so much energy
to just get back to that point that you have a breakdown. And we give up a
wide open three.  
So, you know, it's things we have to figure out, our kids have to figure out.
We have to figure out as a staff. Because you can't play somebody twice now
and spot them 20 points each game and then expect to win. Because we're
sitting there in a 2‑point game with, I don't know, about a 10 or 11 minutes
to go, and if you show up at all, to start it off, it's probably a different
outcome.  
  
Q. You were talking about energy. The circumstances of your game last night
compared to the circumstances of Florida State's game, do you think that
carries over?  
COACH WALZ: No, you can't do anything about it. You know going into the game
if you're the three seed you're playing that 8:30 game on Friday night. Then
you've got a quick turn around for a 2:30 game. So, you know it going into it.  
So it's not like we played last night, it goes overtime, you win and all of a
sudden they say, hey, by the way, you're playing at 2:30. So we knew it. Is it
ideal? Of course it's not. But it's part of it. So, it's not an excuse. We did
not come prepared to play and that's a shame on us.  
  
Q. In your 29 ‑7 comeback run what did your kids do really well?  
COACH WALZ: We actually followed a scouting report. We forced their point
guard left instead of the first half, we allowed her to go right every time
and shoot a pull up jump shot and score. We made her go left. She may have
scored one or two points in the second half, if that, and I thought she was a
big part of their first half.  
We did a better job at rebounding until we cut it to a 2‑point game and give
up an offensive board and an and‑one. It's things like that that I thought we
did a much better job of defensively.  
At the offensive end, we finally started executing. We started actually
running some things instead of just trying to freelance. Because as I've said
before and I'll keep saying it, we're not a team that can just get their own
shot. We have to rely on each other, we have to have good ball movement, we
have to set screens for each other.  
We'll see if we stay in the Top‑10 here. But as I said yesterday, we're the
only Top‑10 team in the country that does not have a first team all‑conference
player on it. So I think that just shows you that we have to play as a team.
We have got to be able to execute and run things.  
I thought that there for awhile we tried to do a little bit too much of
one‑on‑one. Then we veered out of plays, trying to create our own mismatches.
But during that run I thought we did a great job of just being patient and
executing and finishing around the basket.  
  
Q. To build on what your coach said without having the high all conference
player, what do you think's been the key to the team's success this year?  
MARIYA MOORE: I think passing, finding the open player. When we are on the
same page and executing plays it's really when it looks the best.  
  
Q. What have you thought about your first experience in the ACC
tournament?  
COACH WALZ: It's been great. Obviously, I've been here before at Maryland.
It's a first class event. It's run extremely well. It's a great experience for
the players.  
When you get the opportunity to see things run the way it is, and just
everything, the media here, you've got the press room, you come in here, you
do this. It's a great experience for our players.  
So, it's been good. It's been good. Unfortunately, we're going home a day
earlier than we had wanted to, but in the grand scheme of things, it's been a
great experience for our young women.  
MARIYA MOORE: I think it's been a great experience. I don't know of any league
that's harder than this. This is a really a tough league. Every night you're
playing a team that is really good. So, I feel like it's been a great year, no
matter the outcome, it's been a really good year.  
  
Q. This time next week you're going to be preparing to play in the NCAA
tournament. Are there anything specifically you feel like you need to work on
in preparation to get that tournament started?  
COACH WALZ: Well, we're going to really need to work on half‑court execution.
When you get in the NCAA tournament, it's going to come down to as you
advance, whoever can execute in the half court better is going to win.  
Because you're going to play enough good teams and a talented teams that
you're not just going to be able to press and steal the ball and shoot layups.  
So if you can't execute in the half court offensively, it really makes it a
challenge. So we're going to have to go back and really work on going through
some things, making sure we're setting screens and using screens, timing of
plays, what we're looking for out of some plays. Making sure some kids know
the plays.  
Because there are times where you have to come out and run a set that it
affects things if you're on the floor and you don't know what you're doing.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you.  
COACH WALZ: Thank you.

_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

NOTRE DAME  55  
DUKE - 49

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll go ahead and take questions from coach. Student‑athletes
Jewell Loyd and Kathryn Westbeld.  
COACH MCGRAW: I thought Jewell Loyd took over the game. Five baskets in a row.
Had some amazing offensive production. Then the offensive rebound off the
missed free throw I thought was just huge to really seal the win.  
But she was, she was just simply amazing. Which she has been all year long,
but I thought in that stretch, definitely the best player in the country.  
But really pleased with our freshmen, Brianna and Kathryn really came out and
gave us great minutes inside.  
We were able to out rebound them, which is a really great accomplishment,
because that's great rebounding team. I think Elizabeth Williams is a
phenomenal player. Just really hard to guard and did a nice job inside. But I
was really happy with the way we defended Greenwell today.  
THE MODERATOR: Down here.  
  
Q. When you took the timeout, Duke had cut it down and then that was prior
to when Jewell took the game over, was that buy design or did she just do
it?  
COACH MCGRAW: We talked about driving the ball and I thought we got her in
better position and she really was aggressive looking to drive the ball. Came
off a couple of screens for some open jumpers. I thought we did a little
better job helping her get open at that point.  
  
Q. The key to the game for you was getting off to a fairly decent start
while Duke couldn't do anything. What led to your dominance in the first few
minutes of the game?  
COACH MCGRAW: Michaela maybe was on fire at the start. I think she hit at
least two of the threes early on. We got out to get a little bit of a lead.
But not that comfortable, considering they had the same lead on us at our
place.  
So we knew it wasn't exactly insurmountable. But I thought Michaela really
stretched the zone out a little bit.  
  
Q. What did you ‑‑ what was your game plan as far as the rebounding? What
did you want to do rebounding wise? It seemed like you just brought everybody
in there to try to offset what Duke had.   
COACH MCGRAW: That was one of the keys to the game. But we really felt like it
was just going to start with a box out and that's something that we haven't
been doing especially well this year.  
But I thought we had just great intensity and focus on the box out. I thought
Kathryn in particular really did a great job. Bri was able to go get some
balls but I thought Kathryn was really physical inside.  
  
Q. Jewell, on that final play, where you got the rebound between the two
Duke post players, what were you thinking on that play, just go up and make a
play on the ball or was what was going through your mind when you got that
rebound?  
JEWELL LOYD: I heard the Duke player say, she's by herself, so they were going
to pinch on the other side, so I just knew I could at least get in there and
make a tip out and luckily it was a ‑‑ bounced right to me. So I just went up
there and got it.  
  
Q. This ‑‑ people look at this team and it's really an incredibly young
team, when you stop to think about it. From the perspective of a freshman to
the perspective of a Junior, what do you see your particular roles in handling
on this team?   
JEWELL LOYD: Well, I just try to lead by example. We're very young but we're
very motivated. It makes it easier when you have underclassmen that want to
learn and step in and do their role. Early in the year we found out when our
roles were and we embrace it and we want to just be productive and help the
team have success.  
  
Q. Kathryn, following up that question for the gentleman, what do you see as
your role on the team and things like that?  
KATHRYN WESTBELD: Just as much ‑‑ being a freshman just as much as I can help
with anything, really.  
Rebounding was a big role of mine and scoring when I have the opportunity.  
And also just I think, every day just learning from the upperclassmen, Jewell,
watching her. Just how motivated she is, that just kind of helps us as a team
all together and us underclassmen a lot. So, really just looking up to them.  
  
Q. Kathryn, did you think that you might have had this many points and when
you went in there, what did you try to do to offset what they were trying to
do rebounding wise?  
KATHRYN WESTBELD: I mean, just looking‑‑ coming to the game we saw that the
middle was open a lot in the zone, so that was really where I was focusing on
scoring.  
But my shots weren't really falling too well. So just focusing on the
defensive end and I think that's the way I contributed the most.  
  
Q. They give you a lot to handle with their size and stuff like that; do
they not?  
KATHRYN WESTBELD: They're a pretty big team.  
(Laughter.)  
  
Q. Coach, how huge were those two rebounds off the missed free throws at the
end?  
COACH MCGRAW: That was the game. I thought that rebound that Jewell got really
was the game. That was a tight situation. You needed to score, you miss the
free throw, now we can run some more clock, get back to the free throw line.
And then Bri getting the next rebound, I think that was kind of the dagger.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you.

_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

NOTRE DAME  55  
DUKE - 49

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll go ahead and get started with an opening statement from
coach and then take questions for the student‑athletes.  
JOANNE P. MCCALLIE: It was a great basketball game. We ran out of time. We
needed a longer game. We gave the first half away. They played well, we did
not.  
Then we spent the whole second half getting ourselves in a position to try to
get after the game. I'm extremely proud of our team's fight in the second
half. That reflects the kind of fight have you to have in this world. Very
physical game, some really tough shots going down and some great team play.
Some incredible defensive stops. We had some very, very good defense
throughout the day in a lot of areas and one guard made the difference. Jewell
Loyd is a great player, she's very, very good. I think she's the best in the
country. And she was the difference in the game.  
  
Q. What were the biggest problems in your offense early in the game?  
JOANNE P. MCCALLIE: It was just, I think, really silly. Problems? Put the ball
in the hole. Focus on what you're doing. There's just an entirely different
attack mode in the second half. This, we're not messing around at this level.
You're getting after it and it's going to be physical and you're going to be
bumped. I thought in the second half we had a whole different persona. I
thought Elizabeth was outstanding in the second half and showed what she could
do. I thought Ka'lia was steady throughout. She played a smart game, she had a
lot to manage and the floor, and but you got to play two halves of basketball.  
  
Q. What do you think were the factors in Notre Dame winning the rebounding
battle today?  
JOANNE P. MCCALLIE: That's really disappointing. Wake won the rebounding
battle. Another difference maker.  
They were more aggressive. I think they worked harder for position. That's
something we'll take back to practice. That's really disappointing.  
  
Q. Elizabeth, did you notice that they were doing anything differently from
the last game to this, as far as rebounding and trying to do, trying to be
more physical inside?  
ELIZABETH WILLIAMS: Well, they were definitely physical. I think they did a
good job, like Coach P said, of being in position, they were consistently in a
good box out position. I don't think we did a good job of kind of fighting
back, specifically in the first half, and getting our position to get some
offensive rebounds.  
  
Q. For coach, do you feel like the kind of defense you played today could
take you a long way in the tournament?  
JOANNE P. MCCALLIE: Absolutely. Absolutely. Trying to shut down a player like
we did a little bit better job and I wanted Jewell Loyd to have like 16
points, not what she had. But that defense, if we could get our rebounding
back where it should be, that's absolutely the kind of thing that can take you
deep in the tournament.  
  
Q. So you guys are known as a rebounding team, how do you get back to your
identity of being a rebounding team in practice for the NCAA tournament?  
JOANNE P. MCCALLIE: I'll leave that for the players.  
KA'LIA JOHNSON: I just think we have to be in position and just go get the
ball. At the end of the last three minutes those two free throw box outs
really hurt us. We got to really, really put bodies and people and go get the
ball. One person has to box out and they just grab it and grab it, don't tip
it.  
  
Q. Coach, how do you think the momentum you guys built in the second half
with that good offensive play is going to help you going forward into the
tournament? Is this what you want to see from your team the way you guys
played in the second half on offense?  
JOANNE P. MCCALLIE: Absolutely. I thought Ka'lia showed a lot of poise in
making good decisions. Getting the ball in the right places. I'm really proud
of the team. They were executing a new play we came up with and doing a very
good job of it.  
So there was a lot of good things. The second half is how you play. The second
half, I'll take every bit of that second half. That's just how you play. You
know it's going to be a blood bath at this level, you don't wait for it to
start. I think that's a little bit of what the problem was for us.  
But without question, if I could take that second half, we could take that
far. We could take that very far.  
  
Q. You battled the number two team in the country toe ‑to‑toe you're not
going to face anybody any better in the NCAA tournament. Does, even with a
loss, is this performance particularly the second half a real positive for you
going into the tournament?  
JOANNE P. MCCALLIE: Yes and no. I think that‑‑ I don't think you have to lose
to learn. I'm not into that too much. We have had some great times here in
Greensboro doing well and I think it feels strange to be going home to
practice and not play Sunday. So, I guess there's no doubt we're going to take
the lessons now, but that's not the way we want to operate. You want to be a
dominant team, you want to take advantage of being in Greensboro.  
The fans are great, it's a special place, and we're fortunate that we're just
a little bit of a ride away, but the idea of being sent home, I don't think
that feels too good.  
  
Q. Coach, Mabrey made some 3 ‑pointers in the first half, which extended the
lead, one, why are they able to do that and why are they so good at defending
the three‑point shot?  
JOANNE P. MCCALLIE: Yeah, we did spot her nine points. That was most
disappointing. You're absolutely correct about that.  
First of all, they have got more shooters. I mean, we have led the nation in
three‑point shooting percentage for two years straight. Just not this year.  
You got to have the people that are shooting that in high school and coming to
college, they have got some terrific shooters. I think everything goes around
Loyd. I think Loyd's the best player in the country. I mean between her and
Stewart, pick one.  
  
Q. Why are they so good as far as defending the three ‑point?  
JOANNE P. MCCALLIE: Well, that's what I'm saying is when you have a player of
that caliber, she elevates the play of everybody around her. You talk her off
the floor, it's very, very different.  
So, it's the intensity it takes to defend. And again, we don't have the
three‑point shooters, they didn't have to defend our three‑point shot. That's
not what we do this year. We're an inside out team. That's just the nature of
who we are.  
  
Q. For both of you, you're seniors and you didn't quite get what you wanted
this time, how does this motivate you for the next tournament you're in?  
ELIZABETH WILLIAMS: It's definitely a lesson learned. Unfortunately, we don't
like to learn lessons this way. But I think that like Coach P said, if we can
take the momentum from the second half and not wait when we play our games,
especially in the tournament, we can't wait and hesitate to be in attack mode.
So if we can kind of take that mentality and take that toughness throughout
the tournament, I think we'll be okay.  
KA'LIA JOHNSON: Just kind of going off that, I mean, any game, you can't wait
to start playing at the 10 minute mark. We spotted them nine points with
Mabrey's threes and stuff like that, but we have to be ready and I don't think
today we came out ready and of course we turned it on in the second half, but
it's tournament time, you can't just wait around. So, we'll just carry that
momentum, we'll go home and practice tomorrow and unfortunately learn from a
loss.  
  
Q. You struggled a bit in the first half against their length and just
missing easy shots down low. What do you think really changed in the second
half when you were able to get into the flow of the game and take over a
bit?  
ELIZABETH WILLIAMS: Well, just putting the ball in the basket, honestly. I
missed a lot of chippies in the first half and I don't think I was in full
attack mode, so I think in the second half I just focused a little more
getting it higher off the glass and taking my time on offense.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you.

_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

Florida State  66  
Louisville - 51

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening statement from coach and then take
questions for the student‑athletes.  
COACH SEMRAU: I just want to give a ton of credit to Louisville. We started
off really strong, shooting the ball very well, and they fought. They battled.
They made it a 2‑point game and then Maegan Conwright, dang. I mean just the
guts, I mean it was like she had ice water in her veins when she stepped up
and knocked down that three. I thought that changed all the momentum. I
thought that when she really realized that we needed to be pushing the ball in
transition, and we weren't doing a good job of that, and she said put it in my
hands. We put it in her hands and you see the result.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. If my math is correct and as an old geezer it isn't always. But first 15
minutes you're up 33 ‑9, the next 12 they outscore you 27‑7\. Last 13, you
outscore them 26‑15\. What created that disparity insofar as the ebb and flow
of the game?  
COACH SEMRAU: I mean it's an ACC semifinal. Both teams made runs. We had to
answer. I told the players in the locker room that Louisville led for zero
minutes. And it felt like they led.  
But for us to jump out and to be able to sustain their run, I thought that was
‑‑ and I thought both teams made runs, because they were playing great
defense.  
Louisville played great defense during their run, we played great defense
during both of our runs. You're not an old geezer, Tom.  
  
Q. Both players, what does that feel like, that hasn't been said much that
you've never been in this game before?  
MAEGAN CONWRIGHT: It's a great feeling just because we have never done this at
this school before and to be the team to be able to bring them to the
championship is a great feeling.  
IVEY SLAUGHTER: Just going off of what Meg said, it is a great feeling and
this is my second year. And actually going to the championship and going
through a game like this game, showing how hard you have to fight and never
back down, it's just a great feeling to see the hard work actually paid off.  
  
Q. Coach, I know it's been a long time since you played Notre Dame, but
think back, tell me what this team learned from that game and how much you've
improved since then.  
COACH SEMRAU: We didn't have much of an identity during that game. They are an
excellent basketball team. And I think they were just still developing their
identity, so I think it's going to be a really different game than it was the
first time.  
I know, obviously, there's a championship at stake. But the most important
thing is we get an opportunity to represent the ACC in the championship game.
And I think all of what we want through this tournament is to face the best
competition, so we get ready for the NCAA tournament. And we have had an
opportunity to do that, just that, in this tournament.  
  
Q. When we talked at the media day, there were a lot of questions about this
team, they weren't ranked. How did you get to be so dominant over the
season?  
COACH SEMRAU: It's been a maturing process, it's been a ton of effort to
become unified.  
It doesn't come easy. When you have six new players, it was something that we
had to really be intentional about.  
It starts with Maegan, a fifth year senior.  
Starts with Lauren Coleman, who you didn't see on the floor, but you see
behind the scenes as somebody that really took hold of this and created an
atmosphere that's very special for us this year.  
  
Q. Maegan, talk about you being a senior, how special this game's going to
be. But also Notre Dame, obviously, has a good reputation, they have had a
tradition of winning in women's basketball. What do you think about being the
upstart challenger?  
MAEGAN CONWRIGHT: We focus on being the best team that we can be. We want to
play to our potential. If we do that, then we have nothing else to say or
nothing else to do. It will show on the court. That's what we try to strive
for each and every time we step on the court.  
  
Q. Could you address a little bit the timeouts during Louisville's run and
your all ‑ACC player getting very little touches during that time.   
COACH SEMRAU: Well, the timeouts were to make sure that we were all on the
same page. They were switching their defenses and causing a bit of confusion,
which we shouldn't have been confused. But we got that settled.  
I thought that you look at what our team's done day in and day out, game in
and game out. It's always been someone different. It doesn't matter ‑‑ Ivey
stepped up today, 17 points. That's not something that she does every day. I
wish she would, but, again, it's because we have such great balance on our
team.  
If they're going to take one away, then we have an opportunity with someone
else.  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you. We'll see you tomorrow.  
COACH SEMRAU: Thank you.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 6, 2015

  

### [Sue Semrau](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24768)

### [Shakayla Thomas](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28353)

  
_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

Florida State  82  
Virginia Tech - 43

  
SUE SEMRAU: Just want to compliment Virginia Tech and how much they battled,
not just today but gosh, those last two games. Got to give them a ton of
credit. For a really young team, only losing one player.  
I was really proud of my team, proud of the contributions that we got off the
bench. Shakayla playing in her first ACC game and going 8 for 10 is pretty
impressive.  
The other thing, you look at the stat sheet and what you don't see is a lot of
credit going to Brittany Brown and Morgan Jones, and those two played
tremendous defense. Morgan did a great job of getting the ball to the right
people, and a lot of times you don't see that. I just want to give them as
much credit as the rest of the team.  
  
Q. Sue, what about your defense made it a tough shooting night for Virginia
Tech?  
SUE SEMRAU: I'll tell you, our defense was really tough tonight. They
communicated. They knew what was coming. We've defended all kinds of sets all
year, and really, it took being very locked in. Virginia Tech, I think, does a
tremendous job of running their stuff, and they don't usually turn the ball
over, and so to force 17 turnovers was really big for us.  
  
Q. What did you think the Hokies had a kind of fatigue with the three games
in three days?  
SUE SEMRAU: Absolutely, I don't know how you couldn't. You look at Vanessa and
how many minutes she had to play in each of those games, and she's the one
that makes them go. She didn't play in the first game against us, and so we
knew that we had our hands full with her on the floor, and so again, that's
where you credit really Brittany Brown and Emiah Bingley, who I think did a
tremendous job on her.  
  
Q. Shakayla, on the flipside, it was a good offensive day for your team.
What helped you guys click so well on offense tonight?  
SHAKAYLA THOMAS: I think our communication was the key to all of this. We
talked on defense with led the offense, so the communication was basically the
main key.  
  
Q. Dennis Wolff described Florida State as a Final Four ‑type team. Is this
the year Florida State plays in the ACC Championship Game, and what does it
take to advance through tomorrow's round and get to Sunday?   
SUE SEMRAU: I think that this is a team that needs to rest tonight and focus
and figure out who we play tomorrow, and that's as far as we look. We know
that every single game is tough, and we know that every team in this
conference deserves our full attention.  
  
Q. When you're at your best, what do we see?  
SUE SEMRAU: A great rebounding team, a tremendous defensive team, and a team
that really has a lot of unity. You've got 13 players that 12 of them got
minutes tonight, and one didn't because she's retired. They just do a great
job of encouraging one another and celebrating each other's success.  
  
Q. Sue, you only had 59 points in the first meeting in Blacksburg. Obviously
you didn't have your All ‑ACC center in that game because of a concussion, but
anything else to explain the higher output by your offense tonight?  
SUE SEMRAU: Well, I just said to our staff, gosh, what a different game from
when we played them the first time. It's tough to play in Blacksburg, and I
thought we came out very slow, lethargic, and I thought that was credit to
Virginia Tech and the way that they like to slow down the pace. We knew that
we had to increase the pace tonight in order to be successful.  
  
Q. How do you go about preparation in a tournament setting in regards to
tomorrow's game with not really knowing who you're going to play until a
couple hours and then only having a few hours until the game starts?  
SUE SEMRAU: Well, it's everybody's in that situation, and we have scouted both
of the teams. We'll be prepared to give a scouting report tonight on whichever
team is victorious and get some rest and get up and prepare for them tomorrow.  
  
Q. What helped you click on offense tonight, and also, just the ‑‑ you guys
took control of that game pretty early. What helped you guys seize control of
that game in the opening stretch there?  
SHAKAYLA THOMAS: Being on the same page as my teammates. I have to read off of
what they're doing, and I just go in and do whatever they need me to do.  
SUE SEMRAU: Shakayla gives us tremendous pace. I don't know that I have
coached an athlete of her caliber. To be able to get her up and down the
floor, and she's not only fast but she's powerful, and she really helps us to
establish that tempo.

_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

Florida State  82  
Virginia Tech - 43

  
DENNIS WOLFF: You know, I just told the ladies in the locker room, they gave
all of us and everybody that follows our program a week to remember. I don't
think anybody thought we would be sitting here on Friday night. We knew going
in it was going to be a challenge. I felt all along that Florida State is a
Final Four‑type team. They're tremendously well coached, they have depth. So
even if we hadn't played two days prior, it would have been a tough task for
us.  
So they did a good job of taking away what we were trying to do, and we had a
hard time guarding them. Our hats off to them.  
In regard to my team, I'm really happy to be their coach, and they gave us a
great week.  
  
Q. Obviously your third game in three days. They were well rested. Just how
much gas in the tank, what kind of lead did you have in this game today?  
DENNIS WOLFF: You know, we didn't have the same amount of gas we had the other
two nights, but I don't want to use any of that as any way to take away from
what Florida State did. We would have to be on point to the nth degree to be
able to put ourselves in position to beat them. I think that the combination
of how good they are and our having played led to a game like this.  
But again, they're very unselfish. There's nothing about them not to like. I'm
sure Sue will come in here and say she wishes she shot free throws better, but
other than that, they're big, deep, smart, and they did a good job of wearing
us down.  
We don't have a tremendous amount of depth, and we had some ladies that played
a lot of minutes the two prior nights. Normally you get a little bit of rest,
but you don't have that ability during this week.  
VANESSA PANOUSIS: I mean, yeah, except like Coach said, you can't really say
that as an excuse.  
  
Q. What did they do on the defensive end to make it such a bad shooting
night?  
DENNIS WOLFF: Well, I think they have great size, so they did a real good job
of closing out on our shooters. We started the game and had some opportunities
inside that we didn't take advantage of where we missed a couple lay‑ups and
we fumbled the ball, and that then put a little more pressure on us to be even
better on the perimeter.  
You know, we were trying to tell the ladies as the game went on that we needed
to be in not quite a rush on the perimeter when they were closing out, try to
lift them up and take a dribble. In the heat of battle after what we've been
through, it's a little easier said than done.  
  
Q. Coach mentioned the three games you played here. Can you talk about what
this experience has done for you as a player and how this will help you and
the team going forward?  
VANESSA PANOUSIS: I think this experience has been great. You know, we've had
three tough games, and the first two, it was really pleasing to see that we
could actually come up with the win.  
You know, we've had a few losses throughout the season, and to actually pull
out those wins was really uplifting for the team.  
  
Q. You guys have played really good defense the last two nights. What about
Florida State's offense posed a lot of challenges for you tonight?  
VANESSA PANOUSIS: I think they have really good range throughout the team. You
know, their guards are really good with the ball, and their interior play is
great. It was just tough to guard both outside and inside.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Kelsey's impact on both of you as individuals and the
team and the program?  
VANESSA PANOUSIS: Kelsey, she's great. You know, she's so positive within the
team. She's the glue to our team. She keeps us together, always positive, and
she's a great leader, as well. I think when you have those characteristics as
a person, you can't really go wrong.  
HANNAH YOUNG: What she said. I'm going to miss her, that's for sure.  
  
Q. The players, in terms of the tough shooting night, did you feel ‑‑ was it
hard to get good looks? What was the effect of the Florida State defense as
shooters today?   
VANESSA PANOUSIS: I think it was a bit difficult as Coach said how their
defensive pressure kind of sped you up, so it was kind of difficult to try and
slow down with your shot and to make a play for somebody else.  
DENNIS WOLFF: They did a good job of pressuring Vanessa and Hannah and some of
the people, and it was a little bit harder to catch the ball than it had been
the prior two nights, and that's going to put a little bit more pressure on us
in general.  
  
Q. Coach, what are you going to take away from that tournament and for your
team moving forward into next season?  
DENNIS WOLFF: Well, you know, I return everybody but Kelsey and Regan will be
back healthy and we've had a good recruiting class. I don't think by talking
about it you can duplicate the kind of experience we've had, and now we've had
some players that have lived through two days of success in the ACC
Tournament, which is not something that's happened to Virginia Tech teams in
the past. So what we can take out of it is that if we stay the course and we
keep battling as a team and working on the things we try to talk to them and
work on and try to recruit to the level of the other teams in the league that
maybe we can put ourselves in a position to be back here.  
  
Q. Dennis, the first meeting you held them to 59 points. Their star center
had a concussion and didn't play in that game, but anything else to kind of
explain how they were much more productive than in Blacksburg?  
DENNIS WOLFF: You know, again, I think they made a much more concentrated
effort in this game to get the ball inside, so I think that their size was a
big factor right from the beginning in the game.  
  
Q. The fact that you did win a couple games this week, is that something you
can ‑‑ do you feel the team can build on? Is that something to give you some
encouragement in the off‑season? What can this week do for you guys going
forward?   
VANESSA PANOUSIS: Yeah, of course. I think it's a great bonus for us to have
11 players coming back. I think throughout the spring season, we're all going
to work hard, try to get better, and then come back stronger for next season.  
HANNAH YOUNG: I think we've had a rough season, and I think winning these past
few games has almost like set a bar for us almost in what we can do, and I
think if we work like what Vanessa said in the spring, we can reach this goal
again or maybe even go further.  
DENNIS WOLFF: I think there's some kids in the league, Kiesel last night is a
player for everybody to emulate. I heard her answer the questions and she
worked really hard in the off‑season and came back and had a great year. It's
the only way it happens for any team, and I think now we've seen with the
pieces we have and if we add a few more pieces that there's a possibility for
some success, and hopefully that will spur everybody to work.

### [Katie Meier](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23619)

### [Jessica Thomas](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28347)

  
_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

Notre Dame  77  
Miami - 61

  
KATIE MEIER: I thought Notre Dame was very, very focused, offensive game plan
and defensive game plan. They came in here and executed a heck of a game plan,
had us pretty confused in the first half, switching up their defenses as much
they did didn't allow us to get out in transition and get our flow going. I
thought we made some adjustments at halftime, picked our tempo up a little
bit, and I thought that second half was really great.  
But we were in a little bit of a hole, so we had to take some chances at the
end there to try to cut it. But their balanced scoring is really impressive,
and honestly, their 4s, their 4 players, so Reimer and Westbeld really hurt us
in the first half. They got a lot of points from those two players and kind of
we had to change our schemes a little bit and that opened it up for the rest
of them. They showed great patience and great composure.  
On the flipside I think I had two players who had career highs tonight. They
took away Adrienne Motley. I was really proud of Jessica Thomas Jassany
Williams to say, all right, they gave us looks and the team has great
confidence and faith in each other, and I think we showed balance on the other
end, but it took unbelievable effort by J.T. over here and then Jass, and we
really went to her, and I thought she came through.  
Biggest point of the game in my opinion was around the six‑minute mark. I
think we got about five stops in a row, and I don't think many teams can say
that, that they stopped Notre Dame. That was about a 10‑ or 12‑point game
there. I think we got about five stops in a row, and I know we got four
empties on the other end, and I thought that might have been where we could
have made our little run, and it really, really‑‑ it's so hard to get stops,
multiple stops against Notre Dame, and I'm pretty sure there were four or five
of them, 53‑‑ something 55, somewhere around there, 53, 43 kind of score,
three of our looks I think were at the rim and one was a three.  
If you're going to beat Notre Dame, you've got to make those plays and you've
got to take advantage of those stops because they're like gold when you get
them because they're a great offensive team and they showed tonight that
they're a great defensive team, as well.  
  
Q. You played the No.2 team in the country, so you're not going to play very
many better teams. What do you have to do better to make some noise in the
NCAA Tournament?  
KATIE MEIER: Yeah, I think our flow. I'll take that. We saw some looks on film
that we thought we could get in resets, and I probably thought a little too
much about the resets in the first half. I think you see the essence of who we
are is to kind of push the ball up the court on the pass and really execute
there. Defensively not many coaches are going to sit here and say they're
proud of the defensive effort, but they're very hard to defend.  
You know, they got about six or seven points at the end there, but I'm
thinking we held them around 70 for real in the game, and that's big‑time. But
they also went deep into their offense. They didn't want to turn the ball over
and get us going.  
But I think that right now, if you think about our team and you think about us
making a run, that performance by Jass and Jess, that really makes me
confident that we can really beat some big‑time programs.  
  
Q. What was the difference between this Notre Dame team today and the one ‑‑
how much of a factor is Reimer's addition‑‑  
KATIE MEIER: Well, honestly, it was pretty big in the first half because a lot
of our defensive‑‑ we know Reimer had been playing well coming in. It wasn't
just Reimer, though, it was Westbeld hitting the three. We needed to do
something to Turner and you need to do something to Loyd, and what's your next
check down. You've got to choose somebody that you're going to give some
catch‑and‑shoots to and we chose those two kids and they made them. So that
got us on our heels. I lost a little bit of confidence in our game plan going
in, and so we had to get to halftime. I was just trying to get to halftime
around 10 so that we could gather and talk and kind of really kind of make
offensive and defensive adjustments.  
But I believe they had 20 points in the first half from that position. It was
Reimer, Westbeld and somebody‑‑ I'm talking maybe Cable that was playing a
little bit of the 4, as well, and I looked and said, dang, they got 20 points
off what we were giving them. So they executed. But we got 24 on what they
were giving us. We got 16 off what they were giving us.  
So that was just a high level basketball game where other secondary players or
players that weren't the leading scorer on the team, now their coaches were
saying, okay, we'll give you this, Miami, we'll give you this, Notre Dame, and
players stepped up. There was a lot going on in that basketball game.  
  
Q. Jessica, what about scoring 24 points against a team like that? What does
that do for your personal confidence?  
JESSICA THOMAS: Coming into this tournament, actually, I've not really been in
a slump but just trying to figure out my offensive flow, and finishing with
24, still took the L, you know what I mean, but you've got to have more of an
impact with 24 points for the team.  
  
Q. Coach, all this who gets in the NCAA or not is still a lot of
speculation. You don't know what goes on in the room. If you could be in the
room, what would you tell the committee about Miami?  
KATIE MEIER: I think that we've shownthis year and in years past that we can
beat anybody, and if you're putting the tournament together and you want to
say, well, can they go on the road in sub‑degree weather and beat Syracuse at
Syracuse, yeah, we can, with our plane getting delayed and having a stopover,
we can handle adversity, we can beat people. We did beat Notre Dame and
there's not another couple head coaches in the country that can say that, me
and one another, and that's it. That's a team that has such flair and we have
such dynamic players.  
And then I also think that we compete in the nation's best conference where
the travel is amazing. It's really something, and you really get beat up and
you really get exposed and then you come through and you put your best
basketball together in a tournament where you're playing your guts out. We
play our guts out, and we're a very, very good basketball team.  
  
Q. You brought up the travel. How much of a handicap is that for Miami when
you're away at the end of a conference?  
KATIE MEIER: We are definitely at the end. I will tell you the truth, we take
charter flights, which I'm so grateful for, it's so great to have the support,
but the charters have to stop sometimes and refuel. You know what, I'm not
complaining, but that's the reality. That's what it is. It does wear on you a
little bit, and that's why I think our depth‑‑ we are a multidimensional team
that plays defense‑‑ we love it, and so I think besides our résumé, besides
our wins, besides our top 100 RPI wins and all the other stuff, we've beaten
people from major conferences the whole year.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 6, 2015

  

### [Jewell Loyd](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26561)

### [Muffet McGraw](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14071)

### [Taya Reimer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=27004)

  
_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

Notre Dame  77  
Miami - 61

  
MUFFET McGRAW: I was really pleased with our defense on Motley. I thought we
did an outstanding job. Jill guarded her for most of the game and I thought
really limited her touches. I thought we were very aware of where she was when
we went to the zone and were able to have somebody on her most of the game.  
I thought Williams really played well for them, Williams and Thomas both
played well for them. But I was really pleased with our overall effort, just a
really great team effort offensively. I thought we shared the ball really
well. We got a lot of people in double figures, Brianna with the
double‑double, Madison Cable giving us great minutes off the bench, and then I
thought Taya had an exceptional game as well as Jewell.  
  
Q. Obviously you're motivated for every game, but was there special
motivation for this one?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Yeah, there was. I think any time you lose a game, that's the
team that you want to play again. I think it's tough to beat a team a couple
of times, was glad we didn't have any of our double opponents, again, because
three times is really too much. I thought that match‑up was a good one for us.  
  
Q. Did your team do so well that you hadn't done well in the loss?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Well, we did stay out of foul trouble. That was, I thought,
really key for us, to be a little bit smarter in containing the ball because
they really drive the ball well. I thought we rebounded better, we didn't turn
it over as much, we defended better and we shot the ball much better, and I
think that was our worst shooting percentage of the season down there, and it
was nice to see us back up around 50.  
  
Q. When we sat at the lunch table at media days, you told me you had a lot
of questions about this team. Are you surprised how dominant they have
become?  
MUFFET McGRAW: No, I'm not surprised. I think we definitely played better
sooner than I expected. I thought the freshmen really did a great job early in
the season. I thought in December and January were going to be kind of our
learning experiences with all the tough games that we had. So I was a little
surprised at how quickly they figured things out and got comfortable. But when
you have a player like Jewell Loyd who's the best player in the country, she
makes everybody comfortable.  
  
Q. Taya, what's it mean for you to come out and play this game considering
all you were going through back the last time the teams played?  
TAYA REIMER: I mean, we knew that this was a big game coming in. Miami is a
great team, but we definitely wanted to get them back. We all were really
motivated for this game, and just wanted to attack them and get the W.  
  
Q. Coach said you were more ‑‑ she sensed that you were more focused the
last couple days of practice. Do you want to talk a little bit about that?   
TAYA REIMER: I mean, Coach talked to us in practice a few days ago about this
is a new season, and now it's one‑and‑done, lose one game and go home. I think
that all of us have really tried to refocus and get in that mindset because, I
mean, you can't really mess up. Just paying attention to all the details, all
the little things.  
  
Q. You play Duke now. Talk about the adjustment, if you feel there is one.
Do their length and their defense?  
MUFFET McGRAW: They gave us a lot of trouble last time with their length. I
thought our passing was not as sharp as it was in some other games. I think we
learned a lot from that game. We played well defensively. We didn't play as
well offensively I think because of their size. They just have so many big
bodies around the baskets and limiting our passing angles. I think this game
we have a couple of new ways to attack them.  
JEWELL LOYD: Yeah, like Coach said, they're really long so we've got to make
sure we play team ball and play Notre Dame basketball.  
TAYA REIMER: Exactly. They definitely are a very long team, like we've said
already. But just make sure we're attacking them and just knowing how to go at
their length.  
  
Q. Jewell, talk a little bit about where the team has come from the last
time you played Miami to now? What was the difference in your eyes?  
JEWELL LOYD: I think we just played team basketball. We were having fun, we
were communicating, something that we've been working on all year, and we knew
where the shooters were, and we just came together, and we wanted to fight for
each other and fight for Notre Dame.  
  
Q. Coach, do you think you beat an NCAA Tournament team today?  
MUFFET McGRAW: You know, I'm not familiar with their schedule and RPI as much,
but I do think they're an excellent basketball team. I think they have great
athletes. I think this league is certainly worthy of having eight teams in the
tournament. I thought Pitt and Miami both deserve a really good look.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 6, 2015

  

### [Sara Hammond](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24902)

### [Jeff Walz](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19715)

  
_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

Louisville  77  
North Carolina - 75, OT

  
JEFF WALZ: I'll keep it brief. Our kids are tired and need to get back and get
a good night's sleep. Just a very intense basketball game, no question about
it. I think everybody saw how physical of a game it was. You know, Carolina is
a great basketball team, very well‑coached. Those kids were going to continue
to fight, also. Unbelievable shot Cherry makes there at the end of regulation
to send it to overtime. But got to give credit to our kids for stepping up and
knocking down free throws there. Hammond had some big ones at crunch time for
us.  
We're just very fortunate to have the opportunity to continue on. Want to wish
Carolina the best of luck in the NCAA Tournament because they're a handful.
They're very, very, very talented. Thank you.  
  
Q. What was your approach defensively against Mavunga after she had such a
big game last night?  
JEFF WALZ: Well, we just tried to make sure we played her on the right
shoulder. She has some tendencies that we tried to follow through and defend,
but I mean, she's tough. She's really, really good. She missed some shots that
were great shots for her that last night she made. So there were a few that we
were just fortunate that did not go in, and she's just a relentless worker on
the offensive glass. She buried us two or three times and got boards and
put‑backs.  
  
Q. Sara, when you step up to take some of those free throws at the end of
overtime, what is going through your head?  
SARA HAMMOND: Really nothing because if I overthink then I know I'm hurting
myself. I kind of go up there with confidence, especially being a senior and
being in the post tournament in those situations you've just got to step up
and make free throws. My teammates gave me confidence. Every time I stepped
up, they said, it's going in, it's going in. Just their trust and confidence
in me knocking those down, that's all I needed to put them in the basket.  
  
Q. How much of an emotional roller coaster was tonight's game? How did you
keep your emotions in check?  
SARA HAMMOND: I just had an adrenaline rush the whole time. Our coaches have
been throughout this whole season just pushing our seniors to mentally keep
our team in it, and I think that's what I tried to do was just when they made
a run, just keep our heads, let's continue to execute on offense and defense,
don't get ahead of ourselves, and just keep everybody emotionally in it, don't
get down, don't put your head down because we're in the ballgame, and I think
for the most part we did that, and I'm proud of these freshmen, Myisha
Hines‑Allen and Mariya Moore because they never experienced something like
this in post tournament time. I'm just proud of the effort they had and
mentally staying in the game.  
  
Q. When Carolina pushed the lead to 10 there in the second half and you got
a time ‑out what were you telling your team?  
JEFF WALZ: You know, we're not executing at the offensive end or defensive
end. We were allowing Carolina to do what they wanted to do. We just talked
about getting back to the basics, trying to make sure that we played scouting
report defense, played individual player personnel particular ways that we had
talked about, and then at the offensive end we actually finally started to
execute. We pushed the ball in transition a few times, got some lay‑ups, but
actually ran through some things and did a very nice job of that.  
You know, at that situation you've got two ways to go, and that's get buried
and beat by about 18 or 20 or fight back, and I was really proud of the fight
that these young women showed.  
  
Q. With this being the first game that you've ever played in the ACC
Tournament, what are some of your thoughts going on with the pressure of the
league going forward and just settling in?  
JEFF WALZ: Well, it's a great event. I was fortunate enough when I was the
assistant coach at Maryland for five years to go through this and be a part of
it. I was able to let our kids know what a well‑run tournament it is. It's
first class, the environment. It was great. I was really proud of these kids.  
When you come in here and you play Carolina, Duke, NC State, Wake, they have a
great following that comes out to these events, so you've got to get them
prepared that, hey, there's going to be a lot of fans there cheering for them,
but I thought our group that came were really loud and did a fantastic job of
being supportive of our young women.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 6, 2015

  

### [Kendall Cooper](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28342)

### [Rebecca Greenwell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28343)

### [Joanne P. McCallie](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14490)

### [Elizabeth Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26534)

  
_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

Duke  77  
Wake Forest - 68

  
COACH McCALLIE: I just thought it was a hard fought game, and very physical
game and a great game for us to prep to keep getting better, in particular the
rebounding. There was some pretty awesome rebounding out there, offensive
rebounds, defensive rebounds, and to be out‑rebounded is not something that
we're used to, not something we appreciate. That was a good lesson for us to
focus on and to refocus.  
I was very proud of Kendall in terms of her aggressiveness in coming off the
bench and giving us such confidence and such great moves, tremendous duck‑ins
and a lot of aggression. I thought Becca was, as always, competing hard,
looking for things and attacking, which is very important, and Elizabeth,
those 16 rebounds were huge since too many‑‑ we only had 10 with Azura and 16
with Elizabeth.  
We've got to get everybody involved in the rebounding deal, and I think
everybody knows that. But I'm proud of the team for the fight out there,
especially despite the foul trouble that cost us a little bit, as well.  
  
Q. I guess everybody in the country knows when you're playing Duke you need
to guard Liz and Azura and Becca. What difference does it make when she goes
out there and gets 21 points?  
COACH McCALLIE: Well, Kendall is a very good player. You have your gifts and
you have to use them, and I thought today she did. I'm very confident in a lot
of our players to pull big games like that. It takes focus and concentration.
I didn't think it was easy.  
I didn't think Kendall was left open. I thought she worked for it. She had
some beautiful duck‑ins, some tough defense, and she made some huge plays.
That's just a great thing. We're a lot better team when we have more people
being that aggressive.  
  
Q. When they cut it to three, Joanne, do you remember what specifically you
addressed during the time ‑out?   
COACH McCALLIE: Probably just slowing down on offense and executing and
probably rebounding and getting some good stops. I think we kind of went in
and out of the game. It wasn't a full 40 minutes for us. We played segments of
it very, very well, but it wasn't a continuous segment. So probably something
in that nature.  
  
Q. Liz, when they did cut it to 45 ‑42, you scored on the next play on a
drive from the top of the key. Was that something you had in mind that this
was a point in the game when you needed to sort of take over and make an
aggressive play because you hadn't scored for most of the second half prior to
that?   
ELIZABETH WILLIAMS: Yeah, I think it was just important to be aggressive, like
you said, and the opportunity was there on the high post. I had the driving
lane, so I just kind of took it myself. I mean, yeah, that was kind of it.  
  
Q. Kendall, what did you feel like helped you have a game like you did
today?  
KENDALL COOPER: I just felt great coming out there playing with Elizabeth and
Amber and all of our posts down low, really helped carry the momentum into the
game, and then finding Becca when she's open. I mean, it feels great to help
teammates and get yours at the same time.  
  
Q. Kendall, you went out of the game early with some kind of injury. What
was that about? What was the nature of the injury?  
KENDALL COOPER: It was just a minor injury. She fell on top of me, but I'm
okay now.  
  
Q. Coach and players, you talked about rebounding. I'm sure you'll talk
about that some more in this question, but what do you feel like you have to
do better on the weekend?  
COACH McCALLIE: Yeah, I think I just position aggressiveness to the ball, and
also more people rebounding. Becca has had as many as 14 rebounds in a game,
14 or 15, and Ka'lia. We have some rebounders. I think there's sometimes a lot
going on when you're getting ready for a game, and I think the important thing
is to boil it down. And basically if you own the boards and if you're
aggressive, you basically control the game. And so I think we'll get more
people involved and be quicker to box out and quicker to the ball, as well.  
REBECCA GREENWELL: Like Coach P said, defensive rebounding, those are the two
main things we try to focus on every game, so we definitely need to improve
there.  
  
Q. Becca, you finally got to play in an ACC Tournament game and it didn't
seem to take you long at all to get comfortable. What was going through your
head?  
REBECCA GREENWELL: Yeah, I was just really excited to be out there this time.
I kind of got a little taste of it last year, just being on the sidelines.
Just really excited it's finally here.  
  
Q. Just wanted to ask Liz, you haven't had your last battle with Dearica
Hamby. What's it been like going against her for four years?  
ELIZABETH WILLIAMS: She's a great player. She's improved tremendously each
year that she's played. She's really active, so she's hard to keep contact
with her and hard to box out. I mean, it's definitely fun playing against
someone like that in this league.  
  
Q. Wake Forest shot 18 percent in the first half, 53 in the second half. Did
you feel like particularly in the run where they cut it to three, were they
getting better shots or were they just making their shots?  
COACH McCALLIE: I think they got some good shots. I thought our defense was a
bit soft in the second half and our communication was, as well, in terms of
where people were. I see them getting some high post shots and other things,
15 hit a couple, and I just think that we weren't as aggressive. I thought we
were extremely aggressive in the first half, causing them to miss more, and I
think that's the nature of defense. When you can make a team miss, you're in
business.  
Now, we did that first half, but not as much second half. Give them credit;
they fought really, really hard.  
  
Q. Playing with a short roster, did you feel fatigued at all today?  
ELIZABETH WILLIAMS: I think we felt pretty good. I mean, coach did a good job
of rotating us pretty well, and I think media timeouts are always helpful.  
  
Q. Liz, what does winning the Kay Yow Award mean to you as a player and also
as a scholar?  
ELIZABETH WILLIAMS: I mean, it's incredible. It's such an honor to win such an
award. Academics is definitely important to me, and like I said, it's just
really an honor to win an award like that and to kind of see my hard work in
something like that.  
  
Q. Coach, what does it say about the conference that Wake Forest was playing
today and Virginia Tech is still alive in the tournament?  
COACH McCALLIE: It's a great conference. You know, any night, all these
teams‑‑ Wake is a terrific team. You cannot be at all thinking about records
at this point. They took some hits in the regular season clearly, but you can
see what they've got. Hamby is one of the best players in the league, and
those guards have stepped up a great deal. That was not any kind of big seed‑‑
they were as good as anybody in this tournament in a lot of ways. The seeds
don't matter. Nothing matters at this point. When you have seniors that are
really getting after it, that's a plus, as well. I just thought they were
excellent, and they played some really good basketball.  
  
Q. Coach, what do you have to do tomorrow to beat Notre Dame?  
COACH McCALLIE: Did they win? (Laughter).  
I mean, you know, Miami and Notre Dame, they're great teams. I can only say
that we had a pretty good game against Miami at home. It would be good to play
them again because they're a great team. Notre Dame, again, we started the
game 14‑5 and were in control of that game in the first 10 minutes and then
just did not manage any sense of control after that. Jewell Lloyd made a huge
difference in that game. But to me it's a team effort.  
It'll take better rebounding than tonight because everyone is going to have to
get down and dirty and get involved, but I think that would be true of anybody
we play at this juncture. These teams are all very good, and they're all very
beatable, too, but they're all very good, and so you've really got to bring
your A game and A effort to it.  
And at the same sense if you're fortunate, get better, too, in the process.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 6, 2015

  

### [Danielle Butts](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28366)

### [Sylvia Hatchell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15656)

### [Brittany Rountree](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28367)

  
_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

Louisville  77  
North Carolina - 75, OT

  
SYLVIA HATCHELL: I brought my three seniors because I'm extremely proud of
these three young ladies, and I'd just hate for them that we weren't able to
pull this one out. I'm extremely disappointed. I thought we fought hard. We
missed a lot of shots around the basket. Really disappointed we didn't get to
the foul line in overtime, but I thought we fought hard and missed a lot of
shots around the basket, but I'm extremely proud of these three young ladies.
Brittany did a great job on Moore. Last time we played them she got I think 28
and she got seven today. But I thought we had the shots to win. It was a
hard‑fought game.  
  
Q. It seemed like you had an awful lot of momentum after Cherry hit the
three ‑pointer. What went awry in overtime?   
SYLVIA HATCHELL: Say that again?  
  
Q. What went wrong generally in overtime because it seemed like you had a
lot of momentum.  
SYLVIA HATCHELL: Yeah, we were trying to go inside. I thought we got the ball
in there some and we couldn't score, and we had some shots, Jessica had that
shot in the corner that was wide open and she's a great three‑point shooter,
and I thought we had some good things. But they got on the foul line. That was
the biggest difference. They got on the foul line in overtime and we didn't.
We kept trying to take it in there and everything, and we missed some shots,
like I said, that I thought we would have made. So it just didn't go our way.
But I thought we battled hard. I thought we had some momentum, got the lead,
but they just, again, got to the foul line and we didn't.  
  
Q. Coach, when Allisha Gray fouled out in the final minutes of regulation,
did it feel pretty reminiscent of the first time that you played Louisville
this season?  
SYLVIA HATCHELL: Well, the first time she played really well. This is probably
the worst I've seen Allisha play. Seven points and four rebounds in 30
minutes, that's not Allisha Gray. I kept thinking she was going to get going
and get going. But she didn't. But yeah, and that's what she said when she
came to the bench. They were targeting her a lot, but Allisha is a pretty
tough kid. But like I said, she didn't have her normal game.  
But we had a lot of other players step up and do a good job in there. I
thought N'Dea did some good things. Even though Jamie didn't shoot that good,
she made the big one that we needed to go into overtime. We just needed a
little bit more from some other ones. Latifah usually has a little better game
than she did today, but she had a little bit of a foot problem going on.  
But anyway, that's why it's called a team. Everybody has got to step up when
other people aren't playing that well.  
But I really felt like we was going to pull it out, especially after we went
into overtime.  
  
Q. Danielle, how physical was that game in the paint?  
DANIELLE BUTTS: To be honest, I don't think it was as physical as the Georgia
Tech game. I think in the paint‑wise, Georgia Tech was a lot more physical. I
just felt like it was just a regular battle in the post.  
  
Q. Brittany, when you see Louisville going to the free ‑throw line at the
end of the overtime period, what's going through your head about what you guys
are going to do on the next play and everything?   
BRITTANY ROUNTREE: One thing, we were talking to each other, remain confident
and just go down and we were just ready to execute the next play because we
were confident that we would get the win.  
  
Q. Danielle, what was the emotional difference there after Jamie makes the
buzzer beater there at the end of the regulation and then with the game ending
the way it did, what was the difference there in terms of the emotion
displayed by you guys?  
DANIELLE BUTTS: It definitely gave us a boost when Jamie hit that shot to tie
and go into overtime, it was definitely a boost, and it was like, okay, we've
got another chance to pull this one off. The momentum carried us back and we
didn't finish, but it was a big energy booster, confidence booster.  
  
Q. Coach, you had the 20 ‑5 run there in the second half, pushed the lead
out to 10 but had a stretch where you turned the ball over five or six times
in the span of four minutes. How much of that was on your team and how much of
that would you put toward Louisville?  
SYLVIA HATCHELL: Well, again, we're running three different people at point
guard because Latifah was struggling some out there. But I think they stepped
it up a lot. They started going inside a lot more, and we came down and missed
some shots, and they got some momentum going.  
We got some transition going during that time. Jessica and Jamie were out
there and really pushing the ball good, and we made some big shots and all.
But then it just turned the other way, and we couldn't get stops, and then
they started getting on the foul line and so, you know ‑‑ but it's a game of
runs like that.  
We were trying to rotate people and give people some rest, but of course
eventually I went back with Latifah because of experience, but I did think
that at times Jamie did some nice things, and then also Jessica, as well.
Jessica had 16 points, and I really thought that one in the corner was going
in because she's a really good three‑point shooter, and that would have really
probably gave us a boost, maybe could have helped us carry it on through.  
But again, that's just the way it went.  
  
Q. Latifah, tough night right now, but obviously you got a good little bit
of time to get ready for the NCAA Tournament. What are you hoping to take out
of this?  
LATIFAH COLEMAN: I just hope this loss brings us more together as a team and
we just build on the things that we didn't do and just go and practice and
regroup and come out ready to play in the NCAA Tournament.  
  
Q. Coach, with about 10 seconds to go in overtime you were down by three,
Jamie drives in for the lay ‑up, about four seconds to go. Was your philosophy
did you want to see a three‑pointer there?  
SYLVIA HATCHELL: We were trying to run an early ball screen and we had, I
guess, three‑point shooters in there, and they were spread out everywhere, so
I told her to get the early ball screen and take it in there and get it to one
of them because I think we had Jessica and Brittany and‑‑ who was in there,
Latifah, Jamie, but there was one other one. But yeah, they were spread out,
so I told her to get an early ball screen and try to take it in there and dish
it out to one of those. But Jamie is a freshman and she took it in there, but
she'll learn from it. I thought we fouled the right people at the end. We got
the ball back and set some things up the way we wanted them, but just couldn't
quite knock them down.  
We went in there, to start overtime, we went inside a couple times, with
Stephanie because I really felt like Stephanie got going in there and she
would score and we could get on the foul line and stuff, but it didn't work.

_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

Duke  77  
Wake Forest - 68

  
COACH HOOVER: I couldn't be more proud of our team and just what we've done in
the last two weeks, and particularly how special this has been in Greensboro
for us.  
They never quit on us. We were down 18 today and you saw there's no quit in
these Deacons. We came storming back, and just so proud of the grit and
determination that we saw in these young ladies over the last three days in
particular, and obviously disappointed with the outcome.  
Duke is a very good basketball team. There's a lot of length there that you
have to deal with. It took us a half to get, I think, familiar with it again
and reacquainted with it, if you will, before we really got comfortable again.
You've got to give them a lot of credit for that.  
  
Q. You anticipated my question by talking about their length, and even
though you had played them twice you felt like it took you a half to adjust.
In the second half do you feel like in that run that you got better shots or
that you just made your shots?  
COACH HOOVER: I think we adjusted and we kind of settled in and we got a
little bit more penetration and went by some of the initial length. We really
felt like we had an advantage when we could get by that initial length on the
perimeter, and I think, again, in the second half we were able to exploit that
a little bit off the bounce with both Ataijah Taylor and KK Atkinson and then
that opened up a lot of things. And when Dearica gets going and you hit a
couple threes, we're a pretty hard team to defend, like we've been able to do
down here.  
Really proud of the overall team effort and each of our kids just really
bringing what they bring to the table.  
  
Q. Were you a better team having played the last two days instead of playing
Duke just clean, or do you think it mattered that you had a lot of fatigue
going on?  
COACH HOOVER: I thought the first five minutes we looked like we were the team
that had been playing and it was the third day. I think after that I didn't
have that feeling as much, but I did feel like those first‑‑ the first four or
five minutes, I didn't feel like we had quite the pep in our step. You know,
11:00 games are a little tough. We don't play very many of them. You're
getting up and eating breakfast at 7:30 a.m. These are college kids, they
don't get up 6:00 a.m. very often.  
But that was part of the hand we were dealt and the hand we dealt ourselves
with not taking care of business early in the ACC season.  
  
Q. What do you think the three days here did for your program?  
COACH HOOVER: Well, I just‑‑ for what this team laid out, they sold out for us
for the last three days, and we talked about it in the locker room. We've had
our ups and downs this season, and we've faced a lot of adversity. We've lost
three kids that we lost for the season with injuries, and they never wavered
on their belief in each other. They're the closest team, one of the closest,
if not the closest, I've ever coached. They're true sisters. They get along
with each other, love to be around each other. And in that respect I feel like
they saw what they can do for each other when we come to Greensboro.  
Again, I've got to talk to Mr.Whalen (phonetic) back there and see if we can
buy this floor and put it in the Coliseum because we like it. We don't want to
wait. We talked about today if we wouldn't have played the first day, imagine
this game being us a day fresher than we were or two days fresher. But it was
what we were dealt, and these kids came in with the determination and a
relentlessness about them that I just couldn't be more proud of.  
  
Q. You cut that 18 ‑point lead down to three. What did you do well during
that stretch?   
COACH HOOVER: Stopped some rebounds, okay, and that was the difference in the
Syracuse game. When we got stops and rebounds, we get the run, and when we get
stops and rebounds and we can run, we're pretty good. It's one of those things
we talk about a lot. You have to be able to defend and limit their
second‑chance opportunities. We hammered them on the O boards when you have
the comparison, but of course they shot better than we did. But that was the
difference in the game I felt, and then when we're running we get a lot of
really good looks and we love to play with each other. We practice a lot
running, and the looks we can get.  
  
Q. Dearica, what has your college career meant to you and are you looking
forward to some future games with Elizabeth Williams?  
DEARICA HAMBY: It's exciting, but I'd trade it all to be still playing.  
  
Q. Dearica, you broke the rebounding record today. You folks fought hard
enough and continued to play so that you got that record. Can you talk about
achieving that and also what you hope that you've left behind for your
teammates?  
DEARICA HAMBY: Just that anything is possible. I came in as a freshman, I
averaged 4 and 3, and if you would have told me this two years ago, I would
have told you that you were crazy and that you didn't know what you were
talking about. It was exciting, and I just hope they continue to build off of
it, and hopefully somebody within recent years can come in and break the
record, also. I'm all up for that.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about the energy that Kelila brought to the floor
today?  
COACH HOOVER: Well, KK is such an explosive player. She loves to play off the
bounce for us. I thought she was one of the big lifts, like what I said, we
were a little about the flat early, I thought she came in. I told her before
she went in, I don't know if she remembers, Hey, we need your energy, we need
your spark. And that's one of the many things she brings to the table for us.
She was a starter for us much of the season and then had a concussion in our
game against Boston College at home and we lost her for a few games. But she
stayed the course and when she got back in‑‑ the thing that happened when she
was out is Millesa Calicott got minutes and seized an opportunity.  
Well, that's one of the things that makes this team so special, when everybody
starts playing to the best of their ability, now you add another player back
into there, now you bring KK's ability to create off the bounce and shoot the
pull up and get by people and you've got Millesa shooting threes, as well.
Then it becomes a really, really hard team to defend and a really special
group of young ladies.  
  
Q. For both players, what's it like to see all those 6'4 " and 6'5" players,
particularly coming after you on the perimeter? How do you adjust to that? And
Coach McCallie was fretting about her team's rebounding. How did you get so
many second chance points against this team?   
KELILA ATKINSON: I think our team was more capable of not being scared of any
of the players on the opponent's side. I think if we have the mindset of being
aggressive and going around and keep attacking it instead of like hitting a
bump after a bad turnover, and we just have to keep the mindset of keep moving
forward and keep attacking until the time is over.  
DEARICA HAMBY: Honestly I thought we were the tougher team tonight. Obviously
the game doesn't show that with the final outcome, but we definitely gave it a
fight and attacked.  
The first half wasn't our best, and I take some of that blame. So yeah, the
first half was definitely the difference in the game.  
  
Q. Coach, how do you kind of quantify the stages of despair as you're going
through that shooting slump? There was a period of time where you got good
looks and then there was a period of time where you missed three front ends of
one and one and there was another period where it seemed like everything was
getting blocked. How do you get the girls to work through that frustration?  
COACH HOOVER: Right. Well, I thought the period in the first half where it
seemed like everything‑‑ we were getting the ball inside and we were getting
blocked quite frequently, it was just a matter of we just had to keep
remembering to attack the basket and to not fade on our shots that we were
getting great looks, that those are going to fall. We had to stay the course
and stay positive with them.  
When we missed the three front ends of one‑and‑ones we had to talk about,
well, we got every rebound, didn't we? You're trying to build the confidence
in them and understanding that those are a lot of opportunities for us to get
O boards is on free throws. We worked a lot on that, and they do a great job
of running a few little looks that they do, and they play off each other on
the O boards.  
But I think the biggest thing for us today was this team believed in each
other so much, was to keep that belief going, and take the teaching moments we
could but then also point out the positives because we were able to build on
those positives. We were able to come up with 24 offensive rebounds. We did
end up shooting 14 of 18 from the free‑throw line in the second half. So I
thought we really made some great adjustments at halftime, and these kids just
made the adjustments, that they weren't ready to go home. They've enjoyed
being here and staying at the proximity and they've enjoyed the crowd and what
Greensboro does for this tournament. It's unbelievable. It's the highlight
event, and they know that they're playing in the best conference in the
country and they know they're going to play against the best players.  
  
Q. What becomes of the lucky pants? Will we see them next year, go to
charity, or what?  
COACH HOOVER: I don't know. They're pretty‑‑ they need to be washed. They
became a little bit of a distraction, and I didn't want that to take away from
the kids at all, but even the kids were saying, Coach, you've got to wear them
again. If it ain't broke, don't fix it.  
I think it was a special weekend and it was special for a lot of reasons. I
have to give a lot of credit to our administration and our fans and our
cheerleaders and our band. The Deacon fans, there's none like them in the
country. We don't have as many of them because we're such a small school, but
they were as loud as they could be and so proud to be a Deacon today. And
these seniors know once you're a Deacon you're always a Deacon, and you bleed
black and gold, and there's nothing like it.  
  
Q. Other than the pants, what were you able to do in these three days so
well that you were not able to do consistently during the season?  
COACH HOOVER: Well, I think this team really took coaching and game plans and
just really applied them, and I would say that's probably just growth. We were
so young and inexperienced at the guard position most of the year that we grew
every day. Every game we came out of we had a lot of teaching moments. These
guys can tell you we saw a lot of film, and I think in this last two weeks we
were able to draw plays up at a time‑out that we had never ran before, and we
could execute them to a T.  
The game winner against Miami, it was something we drew up in a time‑out, we
told them the reads, we didn't have any timeouts, and they executed it.  
I think that's what the growth of a young basketball team is, again, to trust
each other, that the right person is going to make the right pass and we're
going to make a shot or we're going to get a rebound. We were able to do that
the last couple weeks, and I'll tell you, these kids, they respect all but
they fear none.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 5, 2015

  

### [Katie Meier](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23619)

### [Adrienne Motley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28316)

### [Nicole Sterling](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28315)

  
_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

Miami  62  
Virginia - 52

  
COACH MEIER: I'll tell you what, that whole game I thought was going to be a
grind. It was the last time we played them. We talked about there's a
difference between confidence and faith, and confidence just has the patience
to it, and that's what I was‑‑ at the beginning of the game, we were confident
but we didn't have faith. We were in a hurry, we were fumbling balls, we were
trying to win the game in the first four minutes. And then I think we found
our patience and executed our sets and simplified the game plan and gave the
guards a little bit more power to make the calls that they believed in, that
they had faith in.  
I think there's a play that we've put in lately, ran Motley that runs it deep
into the shot clock. Literally we visualized it in the time‑out and said
exactly what look we'd get and she got it for that lay‑up, so that was faith.
There's confidence and then there's faith.  
My seniors, I got a little emotional in the locker room right now because
their senior night didn't go the way any of us wanted it to go, but in our
postgame senior celebration, just beautiful, powerful things were said. And so
I told them that this was their senior night because I don't think the three
of them collectively have played their guts out like they did tonight. So this
is their senior night.  
  
Q. Katie, how much of this was sort of a familiar feeling for you, this kind
of game in which you have a game in which Adrienne played really well and then
you have one or two other players who stepped up in scoring, and your big wins
this year could have been any four, five, six players who had double digits.
Can you speak to the versatility of your guards, and speaking of faith, your
team did an amazing job of shutting down Faith Randolph of Virginia.  
COACH MEIER: That's ironic. I didn't mean that, I promise.  
  
Q. Can you talk about your defensive game plan and how you focused on her
and forced the role players to do things for Virginia?  
COACH MEIER: Yeah, that was obviously the large portion of our prep. Faith
Randolph has been amazing.  
But to your first point, the first media time‑out I looked at our stat sheet
and it was 2, 2, 2, 2, 2. Every one of my starters had scored two points. I
felt good about that. As good as Adrienne Motley is, the coaches and players
in this league are really good, too. So you think you're going to ride one
horse, you're going to win some games but you're not going to win enough.  
So when Necole lit up, I thought Suriva McGuire started the game making a huge
statement for the team. And she was absolutely 100 percent called out in the
locker room before the game, I stared right at her and I called her out, and
she came through. That's why I'm so excited.  
To your second point, I think Faith Randolph has been carrying a heavy load
for a lot of months, and she's an electric shooter, and her jump shot is
impossible to defend. You saw that everybody on my team, including Jassany
Williams, guarded her at one point. You've just got to mix it up with her and
I thought our team was very committed to that.  
  
Q. Along the same lines of stopping Faith Randolph, you limited Sarah
Imovbioh, too. Anything specific you did to limit her?  
COACH MEIER: Yeah, I thought Jassany Williams did a great job, and then we'd
bring in Erykah Davenport, and we brought in Khalia Prather to give it a
different look. That's one thing about our team, we can switch sometimes and
maybe they miss it or something or maybe Jessica Thomas is on Sarah Imovbioh.  
There were times throughout that game, but if you have a job to do, we just do
it. And it's hard to call a specific play against us when we're all together
defensively because you really don't know how it's going to end up because
we'll switch throughout the game.  
  
Q. I guess you never know until the next game, but is a grind ‑it‑out type
of game against an even‑ish team usually a good way to start a tournament, and
what do you need to do over the next few days to make sure you're in the NCAA?
  
COACH MEIER: Well, I thought our non‑conference season was amazing. We brought
a lot of great wins, a PAC‑12 win, a Big 12 win, an SEC win and almost another
big win against Arizona State who had an amazing. Then we beat some really
high RPI opponents within this league and went .500. I honestly personally
think that's enough, but I'm sure this win today should seal it for us. And if
it doesn't then we've got to win our next game, and if we win our next game,
you'd better invite us to this dance.  
  
Q. A lot of open three ‑pointers from the wing, you missed some early but
had some late. Why was that so open?   
COACH MEIER: Well, I just said to Mot, she makes the lay‑up, but then the next
two plays that seal the game is an assist, a sharing of the ball, Faith with
Michelle Woods was struggling and hit a big shot. Then Jessica Thomas hit a
huge shot. They're sinking in, they're taking away, they're hedging ball
screens, so the plays are out against Virginia. That's what we prepped and
they were out wide. If we missed them, we were going to lose and if we made
them, we were going to win. But that's what they give you, and that's when I
talk about she has faith in her teammates, too.  
Necole made the shots open out wide in her first half effort because she was
shooting from the top, so now they had to react to that stuff. We sucked them
in and then we got things out wide. Virginia covers a lot of ground, you'd
better take what's open and you'd better hit it because they are a great
defensive team.  
  
Q. You beat the next team earlier this season. What do you remember from
that game, and what did you do so well in that game?  
COACH MEIER: You know, we started the game with a complete commitment to
defense, and they're very, very difficult to defend, and I think we really
just‑‑ in that game I think we threw the first punch and then we punched again
to end the half and just had this glorious run. They came back, didn't blink,
and then it became players making plays.  
Between Nigia and Motley and then some others, there was just players making
plays. It was a beautiful basketball game. But I am sure that Notre Dame saw
the brackets come out and were hoping that we would win this game. I'm sure
they were because they're great competitors.  
  
Q. This is for both players about tomorrow's game. The only people that have
beaten them in the last year besides Miami and I think Connecticut. What did
you do so well and what do you hope to recapture going into tomorrow?  
NECOLE STERLING: We played with a lot of passion the first time Notre Dame at
home, a lot of faith maximized our capabilities as individuals and we played
as a team, as well. Great team defense, communication. We played one of the
best games of our season.  
And tonight I feel like we definitely got back on that track, so tomorrow I
feel like we have a good opportunity ahead of us. I feel like we have great
focus right now and we have a date with destiny.  
ADRIENNE MOTLEY: I agree with her, one of the best basketball games we played
all season and it just so happened to be against No.4 Notre Dame at the time.
So we're definitely not going to back down at all this time around. We know
that they're going to come even harder at us, so we're just going to have to
play our A game, do the defensive concepts, and play basketball.  
  
Q. Katie, I've noticed when your team is playing great defense, they're
playing with their feet and with their brains and with communication, and in
games where you've struggled it's kind of more handsy defense and players
getting in foul trouble. Can you talk about the defense today just as a team
in that especially with reference to chastity not getting in foul trouble and
being able to stay in for a long time and giving your team that ‑‑ I thought
she was sort of the key to the whole stew.   
COACH MEIER: Yeah, you're so good because you really know the team in the
league, and that's exactly it. If Jas decided to just flail her arms ‑‑ I told
her I didn't want blocked shots from her, I wanted stops towards the end and
then she went out there and blocked a shot. Her length was impressive, and she
really was just staring at the midsection instead of staring up at the ball.
We've all been working on that defensively. We look at the ball a little bit
too much defensively and that gets you high. So we stare at the midsection and
don't worry about the shot, just challenge high, and I think that made a big
difference for us.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 5, 2015

  

### [Kathy McConnell-
Miller](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14195)

  
_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

Virginia Tech  51  
Pitt - 45

  
COACH McCONNELL‑MILLER: When you look at the stat sheet, I can look at one
statistic and see where we lost this game, and that was at the free‑throw
line. You can't go 10 of 24 from the free‑throw line and expect to win a game,
especially in the postseason against a team that is coming off of a great
upset yesterday.  
I credit Virginia Tech. They did a great job defensively, disrupting what we
want to do, and when we couldn't hit shots, we tried to‑‑ creating off our
defense, we started getting out in transition, started to make things happen,
and when you're not scoring the basketball, we missed lay‑ups, we missed open
shots. But when you're not scoring, you find ways to get to the free‑throw
line and you start being more aggressive and attacking, and we got there, and
we just‑‑ really a lot of missed opportunities for us.  
Virginia Tech made timely plays. They hit timely shots. They made their free
throws. They made plays. Disappointing loss across the board for us. When we
struggle‑‑ it's no secret that we go as Brianna Kiesel goes, and today was a
struggle. They did a great job of defending her and disrupting. Our concern
when she does struggle is who's going to step up and make plays and score the
basketball. I thought Stacia did a great job in so many ways. She's our best
post player who can hedge on ball screens. She was a presence inside when they
went box and one. We used Bri as a screener to get her lay‑ups, rebounding the
basketball, a double‑double first postseason as a freshman, I thought she did
a lot of good things, but just wasn't enough as a team.  
  
Q. What about Tech's defense, can you elaborate on what made you a tough
shooting night for you guys?  
COACH McCONNELL‑MILLER: Well, we set a lot of on‑ball screens, middle of the
floor, side pick‑and‑roll. I thought our post players did a great job of
challenging Brianna Kiesel. They helped off a great deal, switched off, with
their under drives, I thought Campbell did a nice job defensively on her. But
we didn't hit shots. When we made the extra pass and moved the ball, we
weren't hitting shots. They sat in driving lanes, they forced you to take
jumpers.  
And when we played them the last time, it was a similar situation where the
way they defended. But when we played them, we hit shots. We were able to come
away with a win.  
Just disappointing. You have to be able to put more than 45 points on the
board to win in a conference tournament.  
  
Q. You don't want to lose to a 1 ‑15 team in the conference. How do you
assess your postseason chances, whatever you think they might be?  
COACH McCONNELL‑MILLER: We probably killed them in all honesty. I mean, I
don't have‑‑ I don't know what the committee thinks. I would love to think
that we would have a chance with what we did all season long. I know we'll be
in the postseason somewhere, just not sure where that will be.  
  
Q. After seeing the season, what do you think the biggest difference between
last year's team and this year's team is?  
COACH McCONNELL‑MILLER: It's night and day. Just the chemistry that this team
has developed over the course of the season at a quick turnaround, the
leadership that we have among our seniors, the fearlessness of the three
freshmen that we have that have come in. We start three freshmen, and Monica
Wignot, who played volleyball for four years, and the chemistry that they have
developed has been tremendous.  
I think looking at it now where we are, not that fatigue should be a factor,
but when you play a short roster, sometimes fatigue becomes a factor this late
in the season. But it's just night and day. The mindset of these players, the
focus and the talent level, as well.  
  
Q. I know she's not here right now, but can you talk about what Brianna
Kiesel has meant not just on the court but off the court for this program?  
COACH McCONNELL‑MILLER: We play through her at crunch time, throughout the
course of the game. We want the ball in her hands. She's just tremendous, and
it was a tough day for her today, but when you look at her entire season,
she's a special player. She's been a scorer for us, a play maker. Defensively
she has controlled the tempo, put pressure on the other team's point guard,
and she's the one that probably made the biggest mistake today of not getting
her rest with taking her off the floor because I think fatigue became a factor
throughout the course of this game today.  
I say all the time, we go as she goes and these players feed off of her. She's
a special player, and I've really enjoyed coaching her. I hope I get to do
that again.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 5, 2015

  

### [MaChelle Joseph](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24769)

### [Aaliyah Whiteside](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28299)

  
_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

North Carolina  84  
Georgia Tech - 64

  
MaCHELLE JOSEPH: Obviously we're disappointed in the final score of the game,
but like I've told this team all year long, the scoreboard doesn't make you a
winner or loser, it's how you play the game. I really felt like we played hard
for 40 minutes. Obviously we had challenges inside with Mavunga. She had her
way with us with our undersized posts. It's just one of those things where we
know what we have to do moving forward to compete at the highest level in the
ACC and with somebody like Mavunga, we've got to have bodies that can
challenge her on the inside. I thought struggled to score with their size and
their physicality. I thought it was probably the most physical game we've been
in all year, and I thought that bothered our shooters a little bit, and we
just weren't able to connect on shots that we normally hit.  
  
Q. Aaliyah, can you address what coach said about the physical play and how
it affected y'all's shooting?  
AALIYAH WHITESIDE: I think we just didn't go up as strong, and we weren't
getting the calls, so we just kind of missed a lot of shots, so I think that
really affected us. We definitely struggled to score at times, and we got some
good rebounds, we just couldn't put it in the basket.  
  
Q. Coach, they had three different scorers in double digits. How important
was it that they got balanced scoring from different players?  
MaCHELLE JOSEPH: Well, I think it was more than double figures. We had four
players in double figures. They had three, but they had balance across the
board. They had seven players with eight or more points. Their scoring was
spread out. I thought this was one of the most balanced attacks that I've ever
seen a North Carolina team have. I really thought that they shot the ball
really well from the perimeter. They did a great job of getting Mavunga
touches on the inside. Sometimes she doesn't get enough touches, and I thought
tonight they really made a concentrated effort to give her the ball, and I
thought that caused us several problems. I mean, one of the things that I'm
proud of our effort is any time you out‑rebound North Carolina you're doing
something, and that's a huge effort on our part with our post players being
5'11" and six foot to out‑rebound North Carolina, I thought that was a great
effort.  
  
Q. What really gives you so much trouble with North Carolina this year? You
haven't been able to stay in the games, although you've done better against a
whole lot of other teams.  
MaCHELLE JOSEPH: Well, I think one thing about North Carolina, they always
give us their best shot. It seemed like this year in particular, I think maybe
since last year when we kind of upset them at home, I think we've kind of got
their attention a little bit. I know that they don't come into the game
overlooking us, and I think that's one of the things they give us their best
effort. I thought when we played up there this year and tonight in the ACC
Tournament, I thought we got to see one of their best efforts I've seen all
year. I've watched about ‑‑ 10 times, I've watched them play this year and
this was one of the best all‑around games I've seen as a team.  
  
Q. Your team probably played the best game of the day yesterday. Do you
think that maybe got their attention a little bit?  
MaCHELLE JOSEPH: Possibly. It's hard to say. Again, I thought that they came
out and they were very, very physical and aggressive, and this time of the
year you've got to be very physical and aggressive. I've always said that
guards‑‑ post players get you to postseason and guards win in postseason, and
I really think that Mavunga is really stepping up her game right at the right
time. This could be a very dangerous North Carolina team throughout this
tournament.  
  
Q. Aaliyah, what do you think about possibly playing some more basketball
this year.  
AALIYAH WHITESIDE: I would be excited for it. We have a young team, so I think
it would definitely help for next year. I think we definitely need to just
keep working because I think we're a good young team.

_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

North Carolina  84  
Georgia Tech - 64

  
SYLVIA HATCHELL: First of all, it was great to be back here with all you guys.
Appreciate y'all staying up late tonight. It's been a long day. These last‑day
games or games at the end of the day, they're usually pretty tough. But I
thought we came out of the gate pretty good, played well. Georgia Tech is a
great team. They're so physical. They've got so many weapons. I mean, gosh,
Whiteside and Davis, they just‑‑ on and on. They just bang and battle so hard
in there, so we knew it was going to be a tough game and very physical. But I
thought we came out and played well. They were in a triangle‑and‑two most of
the time. Brittany did a really good job I thought on Davis. She was on her
most of the time. We just tried a few different things, and we also backed off
the point guard and put our other defender in the middle of the lane, so that
helped us out some, also.  
The rebounding was always major, and we did get out‑rebounded, but I thought
we battled them pretty tough in there.  
But we had some good shooting, especially down the stretch. Stephanie, when we
got her the ball, did well, and had a really good game, and I'm proud of
Allisha Gray for coming back out there. She's such a tough kid, and I think
that actually motivated the team when she went out, and especially when she
came back out there.  
It was a great ACC game, and we're going to get rested up, and we're looking
forward to playing a really, really good Louisville team tomorrow. We played
them a few weeks ago up there, and it was a great, great game. We led until
just the last couple minutes, and so we feel‑‑ we're looking forward to
playing Louisville tomorrow because of the game that we played with them a few
weeks ago.  
But again, it's great to be back. We love Greensboro and the ACC, and it just
doesn't get any better.  
  
Q. When you're at a tournament and they've had all these crazy upsets, do
you address that with your team, and what do the upsets say about this
conference?  
SYLVIA HATCHELL: You're right, I did, that anything can happen. That's how‑‑
again, I've been saying all year how great our league is, so really, you say
upsets, but they're not really because we have‑‑ all the teams in this league,
I mean, when we played at Virginia Tech, I was impressed with them, and then
of course we played Wake Forest a couple weeks ago, and I was impressed again,
because they've got a first‑round draft pick on their team.  
I just think our league is that good.  
I really think we ought to have at least 10 teams in the NCAA Tournament. I
could actually see more than that. But it is a great league, and the
competition is so good, and on any night‑‑ and that's why you have the
tournament, because it's a new season for everybody, and I think Virginia Tech
and Wake has proved that.  
  
Q. What did you guys do defensively to hold them to such a low shooting
percentage?  
BRITTANY ROUNTREE: Well, just one of the things like Coach Hatchell said, we
played off the point guard a little bit and one thing I did was guard Kaela
Davis, so we played great team defense and played Carolina basketball.  
  
Q. Stephanie, what made you so motivated to have such a good game tonight?  
STEPHANIE MAVUNGA: I don't really know. I don't think I was motivated to have
a good game, but I just knew that I really had to step up big, especially
after having such a bad game the other day, and I felt like I let my teammates
down the other night. I knew I had to just turn it around. The first half I
remember Brittany said to me, come on, you need to get in and just kill, just
kill. We're going to just keep going to you. I was like, wow, for someone to
have faith in me like that and to say something like that, that means a lot, a
lot of respect. I just tried to do as best as I could, and another thing is
during the game when Allisha got knocked down, I didn't like that, so that's
my best friend, so I was actually furious, so I think I really got ticked
after that, and that also had something to do with it.  
  
Q. Coach, look ahead to Louisville tomorrow and your thoughts on that
game.  
SYLVIA HATCHELL: Well, first of all, the honor, it was special because I knew
Bob when I was at little Francis Marion and we used to go up and play Clemson.
That's when I first met him. So it was quite an honor because I knew Bob. It's
amazing right before I came to the game tonight there was a special on TV
about a man that had the same thing I had, acute myeloid leukemia and he just
had a match and it was his story and everything. I was actually very emotional
coming to the game tonight because of that, because it really is special to be
back here. It means so much to me and all, and especially with these group of
kids because they're just great. I love this team.  
Now, Louisville, they're good. They've got everything. Jeff does a great job
with them. They're really tough. We had a great game with them up there. We
got in some foul trouble. Allisha fouled out with‑‑ we were actually ahead
when she fouled out with about four, four‑and‑a‑half minutes, wasn't that
about what it was when she fouled out, and we were ahead, and we just couldn't
hold it right down the stretch.  
But they're athletic and they'll battle us, and they've got shooters, they've
got everything. We're excited about having another chance to play them
because, again, like I say, we felt like we should have won the game when we
played them in the regular season.  
  
Q. Coach, did you guys make a concentrated effort to feed the ball to
Stephanie even though you had a couple players who finished with at least
eight points?  
SYLVIA HATCHELL: Yeah, at times we did. We have certain things that we call,
and the other thing is we got a lot of good penetration. Danielle was getting
penetration, and as she drew the defense, she was dumping it off. She did that
about three or four times to Stephanie and Stephanie got some easy buckets
because of the penetration of her teammates. But we have several things that
we run for Stephanie to get the ball, and we did that, and she was able to get
it in there.  
Last year she was a freshman, and people didn't know that much about her, and
she didn't get doubled‑ and triple‑teamed. Now about every time she touches
it, there's two people on top of her. I think she could also get a lot of her
points off of rebounds, missed shots, like when we beat Virginia the other
night she got a rebound and put it back in at the buzzer and that's how we won
that game.  
But we do have several things that we try to run to get Stephanie because if
you can get Stephanie a couple buckets, she'll get going. Allisha is the same
way. We run some things for them, and if they can get a couple buckets, then
they get rolling, and that's pretty important for us.  
  
Q. How motivating is it to see someone such as Brittany working just as hard
on the defensive end? How does that motivate you guys to work harder on the
defensive end yourselves?  
STEPHANIE MAVUNGA: More than anything, to be honest, Brittany is the best, the
best defensive player I've ever played with, played against, whatever. She's
the best defensive player I've ever seen. I know that she gets on me a lot in
practice, especially like in games, she's like, straighten up, and I'm like,
man, she's working hard for me to just slack off. She'll play this great,
great defense on a star and then maybe I'll let the ball get into the post and
they'll score and sometimes that makes me feel bad because she's playing so
hard and sometimes I just give up a play and I know I really can't do that.
Her turning around and working really hard and you see her working really
hard, and she does a lot of communicating on the court. Sometimes I'll be
fronting my player, and she's like, I've got you, Steph, I've got you, Steph,
and that assures me like she really does have me. You know, at first when I
first got here, a lot of people told me they got me back there and then the
ball would go over and the next thing I know it's a lob and it's a score, but
not with Brittany. She says she's got me and she's probably going to get the
steal, and if she doesn't get the steal, there's going to be a stop somehow.
Something is going to happen. There's no way that someone is going to score
and it's not going to be easy. I know that I can really count on her to be
back there. Yeah, best defensive player I've ever known.

### [Sidney Cook](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28325)

_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

Virginia Tech  51  
Pitt - 45

  
COACH WOLFF: Well, I'm going to kind of repeat everything that I said last
night, that for us to have to come back on a day's rest against a good team,
really, really proud of the way the ladies played. I've coached a lot of games
in my career. What these kids have done‑‑ and really I'll start last week
because we went to Boston College and they played as hard as they could in
that game. I think that we were smart against a good defensive team. We
changed defenses at the end to try to limit Kelsick's touches, and I thought
Kelsey Conyers did a real good job when that happened. Vanessa and Sidney both
made big plays, so it's a real, real big win for our program.  
  
Q. Can someone explain to me after you guys won one ACC game during the
regular season what's gotten into you guys and what's been different this week
in Greensboro?  
VANESSA PANOUSIS: I think it's just the fight that we have. We've stuck
together the seasons and we knew that there were a lot of losses that we had
during the season that we could have won, and I think we've just stuck
together and now we've pulling them off.  
  
Q. Do you feel like ‑‑ obviously not a very successful season. Do you feel
like this run kind of salvaged the season and can you guys make a tournament
run?   
COACH WOLFF: You know, I don't want to say it salvages the season. I think I
speak for all the girls, we're disappointed the way the season went. If you're
coaching a team at Virginia Tech, with the success that our football team has
had, you expect to be competitive and win. I don't want to say it salvages the
season.  
I think that it gives us an idea of who we are. We only lose one player off
this team. We have a very good player that got injured that we redshirted and
we have a good recruiting class. So I think in terms of where we are going
forward, it helps us.  
  
Q. You guys led the entire second half. You've had some games in ACC play
where you lost the lead and lost the game. Can you talk about what helped you
guys be so effective in the clutch tonight?  
COACH WOLFF: I think the very start of the second half was‑‑ if we had any
fatigue, that kind of took the fatigue away. Vanessa made two big threes, they
made a lay‑up, they had to call time‑out and all of a sudden the momentum had
switched. Not the momentum, but we gained the momentum, and I think that was
important.  
VANESSA PANOUSIS: I think that we've just learnt throughout the season, like I
said, we've had so many close games that we haven't won, and I think we've
learnt from those games.  
  
Q. Pittsburgh shot 31 percent from the field. What did you like about your
defense in general and your defense on Kelsick in particular?  
COACH WOLFF: I thought that Kelsey did a great job throughout when we were man
to man and when we were in the box and one. I thought everyone was really
locked in all day when we spent time going over the game plan. So I thought
that ‑‑ I mean, this is a very well‑coached team. They drilled us during the
year. We tried to make some adjustments, and the ladies paid attention and
tried to go on with what we asked them to do.  
  
Q. Do you just think you've grown as players primarily off the court, just
whether it's in practice or in team meetings or whatever? How do you feel that
you've matured?  
VANESSA PANOUSIS: We've always been a close knit team, so that's not really an
issue. I think throughout the year we've come to practice every day with a
positive attitude, even if we have lost games, so yeah, our practices, and
then we try to put what we put in practice into the game.  
  
Q. For each player, Vanessa, 20 points, four threes, Sidney a double
‑double. For each of you what helped you be effective tonight?   
SIDNEY COOK: I guess my teammates really just giving me the ball, and if I
didn't have anything I'd kick it back out to them. I don't know, I'd just go
after rebounds. I'd just give it my all.  
VANESSA PANOUSIS: I mean, like yesterday, I tried to give what the defense
gave me, so they were going under some ball screens, so I decided to shoot the
ball.  
  
Q. The move in that box and one, was that always the plan if you got the
lead, to go to that box and one?  
COACH WOLFF: I had said to the ladies before the game that if we were going to
stop playing man‑to‑man that's what we were going to do. There was a stretch
in there, and Kelsick is so good with a head of steam going toward the basket
that I felt, A, we needed to stop turning the ball over and missing lay‑ups
because that was enabling her to run out at us. And then once we were able to
score and get settled, it made her have to work and them have to work, and
that defense, you can only play it so long, and it puts some of their other
players in some positions that they probably weren't comfortable in.  
  
Q. What did you guys do better than when you played Pittsburgh the first
time and also your assessment of the challenges of playing Florida State
tomorrow?  
COACH WOLFF: You know, I thought the first time was one of the worst games we
played all year. We were really discombobulated from the beginning. We didn't
have a lot of life. You know, and at that point I was struggling to try to
figure out the best way for us to play defensively. I've been on the ladies
hard about the way we've been playing now for a few weeks, and they have
embraced it. It's not going to work if they don't buy in and they've bought
in.  
Florida State is one of the best teams in the country, so we'll prepare for
them like we have these last two games. It's an enormous challenge, but for
us, where we're at with our team, to be here playing for a third night in the
ACC Tournament is a great thing.  
I thought we played hard in the first meeting. I think Hannah Young had a
pretty good game. I think they were missing their big post player. She didn't
play in the game. I think this is as deep a team as there is in our league.
For our ladies it's going to be really important that we get as much rest and
we try to get them to get gas back in their tank so we can play as well as we
can tomorrow.  
  
Q. This is the first time Tech has ever won multiple games in the ACC
Tournament. With the way you guys have been playing, are you shocked to still
be sitting here and winning two games in the ACC Tournament?  
VANESSA PANOUSIS: No, not at all, really. I think at the beginning of the
tournament, we said as a group that we could beat all these teams, like I
said, there's been so many games throughout the season that have been so close
and we should have won, so no, I don't think we're shocked at all.  
SIDNEY COOK: I'm not shocked.  
COACH WOLFF: Sidney is a woman of few words as you can tell. She's going to
break the press conference record for nothing said.  
I thought Sidney was very aggressive today, and I think in the second half,
she's a little bit undersized, and I think in the second half when she slowed
down a little bit and was able to get them up off their feet. She got to the
free‑throw line and she was able to score. Sidney tries very hard. She played
with a lot of energy and did that yesterday, as well. I'm happy for her, and
it's really helped the team.  
  
Q. You got off to a slow start. How did you use all those lessons from the
season to help turn things around during that game and create such a better
offensive showing later on?  
COACH WOLFF: Well, I think that our being sluggish to begin with would have
been more concerning if we were not guarding them the way we were guarding
them. They didn't get a lot of separation from them, and then we made a couple
shots and got ourselves right in it. I mean, again, we all watch a lot of
basketball.  
That UVA men's game the other night, those guys didn't score for like 13
minutes and still won by like 20. There's going to be runs in the game, and I
think we get‑‑ from a coaching standpoint all you're trying to get the ladies
to do is continue to run good offense.  
  
Q. Dennis, in all seriousness, let me ask the question, I'm sure Tech fans
were thinking. Do you feel you have much better job security after these last
two wins here now?  
COACH WOLFF: You know, again, I don't want to be a wise ass to you in this.
I've never once thought that I didn't have job security, so I work for great
people, they've been unbelievably supportive. We lost our best player to begin
the year, so if you're asking me did I need to win two games here to still be
the coach of Virginia Tech, my answer would be I don't believe that's the
case, but you need to ask Whit Babcock about that. I'm glad we got through
here talking about my job again.

_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

Wake Forest  85  
Syracuse - 79

  
COACH HOOVER: I couldn't be more proud of this team. We came into the
tournament with a determination about ourselves. Even the last two weeks of
the season, I would say, that there was definitely a sense of urgency, and
when you have all of our young ladies playing and doing what they do best,
we're a very dangerous basketball team.  
Today I thought we were just relentless in all aspects of the game. A little
too relentless to turn the ball over at first, but I thought after we kind of
withstood all of the chaos that was creating, we settled in in the second half
and just took care of the basketball.  
  
Q. You just beat a team that's not a bubble NCAA team, they're a lock NCAA
team. What's with the magic pants?  
COACH HOOVER: Fear the pants (laughing). Again, this team, when they come in
with that kind of determination, you're right, I told every one of their
players good luck in the tournament because that's a tournament team. They're
a top 25 team, and we knew when we played them back in January that we didn't
put our best foot forward, we didn't play our best game, and we still had a
shot at it. They had gotten 28 offensive rebounds against us in that game, and
so we knew that we couldn't do that. We knew they're extremely talented.
They're a very dangerous three‑point shooting team.  
Alexis Peterson is what we like to call a Deacon killer, but today that might
have been the case had we locked them down on the boards. I think the boards
probably were the determining factor and the difference in the game.  
  
Q. What are you doing to stop Syracuse from being able to hit the three? I
think they started off 0 for 17.  
COACH HOOVER: Well, you know, one of the things, when the seeding came out,
both Boston College and Syracuse are both great three‑point shooting teams, so
for two days we got to talk about it and we prepared for it, and we talked
about trying to be able to get out and dictate with our defense. Those are the
two leading, I think, three‑point shooting teams per game made in the
conference, and we held them both under their average.  
I thought we just did a really good job of locking in and really getting out
and contesting them, and that's our thing always. Both of those teams shoot
well. They're going to knock some down. We can't let that deflate us. We've
got to contest it and make it be a hard, contested shot, and then we want to
box out and get to the other end.  
Two days ago we started preparing for Boston College and we prepared solely
for Boston College, and then last night we prepared for Syracuse.  
  
Q. Coach, the team committed 16 first ‑half turnovers. How was that
addressed in the locker room?  
COACH HOOVER: You know, I don't think I really said a lot about it in the
locker room because I didn't want it to become such a mental thing with us. At
that point I think a lot of those were early and we had kind of settled in. We
just talked about a couple different looks we were running in our press break
and we gave them a different look, and I thought that our kids did a great job
executing the different look, and we changed things up a little bit. And just
the poise that we came out with, and I'm sure they may have talked about it a
little bit at halftime, but sometimes as a coach I think when you talk about
it too much, it becomes in their head and then we're worried about it. We just
drew up a couple things as a press break, what we were going to do and how we
wanted to look to attack it. We were confident if we could get past the press,
we knew we could score in the half court against them, and I think when you
saw shot 62 percent in the second half, our confidence in the half court was
very good.  
  
Q. What's been the keys to your career success in the ACC Tournament?  
MILLESA CALICUTT: Every year we just take it as a new season. We definitely
pull a different side of us out for tournament time. I know this year has been
definitely different because we truly have a vibe, all of us together, and
we're pushing each other, and we had a frustrating season, and so we're not
going to go out without a fight, so perfect timing for tournament time.  
DEARICA HAMBY: To piggy‑back off what she said, yeah, basically it being
tournament time, knowing the season is coming to an end possibly, and nobody
wants to go out, so just playing with a sense of urgency and playing hard.  
  
Q. Dearica, last time you played Syracuse you said the game plan on Briana
Day was to force her left. Today getting her into foul trouble, what was the
game plan?  
DEARICA HAMBY: I know for me, it was just to duck in on her and pose hard.
She's long, she tries to come over, so we were pick up some early fouls on
her, and that could have also been a game changer because she's really good at
alternate shots and blocking the ball. We didn't have to really worry about
that as much.  
  
Q. Coach Hoover, what was the key to the team fending off that late rally? I
believe you folks did that without any time ‑outs. You were never able to get
them to the sideline and get them to regroup, and it was a furious rally.   
COACH HOOVER: Yeah, it was, and again, that's the danger of that team. They're
such a great three‑point shooting team and they're so quick. Brianna Butler
has got one of the quickest releases in the league, in the country probably.
Again, I think our confidence at that point because we didn't get rattled in
the second half with the pressure, I thought we just‑‑ I think it's a little
bit of what these two young ladies said and that freshman sitting down there
at the end being all quiet, we knew we had to step to the ball, and if we
could step to the ball and take care of it in the half court we were going to
be able to get good looks.  
I think Lis hitting a couple of those threes late obviously were huge. We had
a couple big‑time rebounds I thought that were difference‑makers for us and
just being able to knock down free throws today.  
  
Q. What enabled Kandice Ball to have such a good game today?  
COACH HOOVER: Well, Kandice, she's one about two weeks ago, too; in the
practices going into our Miami and Georgia Tech week, she just was a monster
rebounder in practice, like she just ‑‑ like a sense of urgency for her. She's
our lone junior on the team, and she's really close with these two seniors and
Susie Webster, who is another senior that probably doesn't get spoken enough
about. Susie just pushes us every day in practice. She is phenomenal. She has
been determined this year to get every rebound in practice that makes these
guys have to work even harder, and she's been challenging Kandice and the
other kids that get more time than Susie. And Kandice is just‑‑ I told her
today, I'm going to need about five more of those one‑handed rebounds because
I don't know how many she got today that were just one‑handed, but she right
now is just ‑‑ that's made a big difference for us because we're not just
relying on Dearica to do the rebounding, and that's huge.  
KK Atkinson came in and got seven rebounds, I believe. That's what it's going
to take. It takes each one of us doing what we can do, and that's what Kandice
brings to the table for us. She's a big that can rebound, she's physical, and
she can finish right around the basket.  
  
Q. Amber, what made the Deacons' offense so successful in general today, and
how much are you playing for the seniors?  
AMBER CAMPBELL: Actually being able to get stops defensively, and getting our
hands on deflections, and how Coach told us, you know, that we just have to
keep going. Our momentum took us to keep going and further, and yeah.  
  
Q. Coach, in the second half you really beat Syracuse in transition.
Entering the game was that something that you targeted, that you wanted to
do?  
COACH HOOVER: Well, we talked about it a little bit because if we could get
stops, to kind of parlay on what Amber was saying, our emphasis was to get
stops. When we played at their place, they shot 32 percent from the floor, and
that was including 28 offensive rebounds that they probably shot 75 percent
on, so we really felt like in the half court we could force them to one tough
shot, and if we would get stops we knew we could run out on them, and we knew
we wouldn't have to face the press.  
That was really one of our emphases was talking about forcing those tough
shots and we had to finish it with a box‑out. Once we got a box‑out, we knew
we could run on them. We were able to run on them up at their place a little
bit, and I think sometimes you look at it and say, well, it's your second
game, we want to push the tempo because they're going to be tired, but I'm
going to tell you, these kids don't get tired, they just don't.  
At this time of the year, every team across the country, there is no such
thing as tired.  
  
Q. Millesa, you've gotten hot from three at just the right time for your
team. Are you doing anything different or are the stars aligned?  
MILLESA CALICUTT: That's a good question. I go through some slumps every now
and then, but I guess I'm just feeling the rhythm. I like these Wilson balls
here this year, and I mean, it's the last chance to go big, so got to help out
my team in some way.  
  
Q. Dearica, I have two questions for you. First of all, how disappointed are
you you're one rebound short of the record?  
DEARICA HAMBY: We have another game, so I'm going to get it.  
COACH HOOVER: She's benched for tomorrow. No, just kidding.  
DEARICA HAMBY: I'm really glad we got the win. That's more important right
now.  
  
Q. A lot of times you've faced double teams down low, but today you were
facing double teams getting the ball in on the full court press. What's that
like for you?  
DEARICA HAMBY: It's frustrating, but especially in the first half my team was
able to pick up where I couldn't contribute with the scoring. I know I only
had like two shot attempts and maybe like four points, so they were able to
knock down some shots and keep us within the game in the second half, and I'm
not sure why we happened to be so open.  
  
Q. Dearica and Coach, what do you need to do to beat Duke tomorrow?  
DEARICA HAMBY: Millesa needs to hit some three‑pointers. The first time we
played Duke we were really successful scoring the ball in the first half, and
just spreading their zone out and then cutting to the basket and knocking down
outside shots to open up the zone, and doing some pump fakes. They've got some
big girls.  
COACH HOOVER: I think a lot of it is this time of the season we talk about
defensive rebounding is the difference maker, and they start three big kids,
and we've got to be able to keep them off the boards, and that's got to be an
emphasis for us. And then we've just got to continue to do what each player on
our team does. We don't talk a lot about Millesa, you go try to be KK, or
Amber, you go try to be Millesa. We need Millesa to be the best Millesa she
can be, and that's being able to knock down shots, helping players, being a
settler for us at times, and that's Dearica doing what she does, that's
Kandice Ball rebounding. Everyone on our team has a role, and when they step
in and fill those roles to the best of their ability, like I said, we can be a
very dangerous basketball team, and that's what it's going to take tomorrow.  
  
Q. You called Alexis Peterson a Deacon killer, obviously 66 points in the
past two games. What is she able to do? You got everyone else down. How was
she able to do that?  
COACH HOOVER: Well, I don't know what it is that she particularly likes
against us or not. We switched up defenses on them a little bit, especially in
the second half tonight. We totally went to some different things and just
tried to throw different people at her. She's a great point guard and you can
tell she really controls the team and controls‑‑ she's the coach on the floor
for them and she's got a lot of confidence against us right now.  
She got 34, but the difference is that we still had 85 as a group, and we come
out on top. I thought we did a really good job on Butler, and we really made
her shots tough looks and tough contested shots, and that was really an
emphasis.  
In the first half we kind of let Fondren go too much left, and so we talked
about that a little bit at halftime, that we really had to force her to her
right and take away that left side a little bit. Unfortunately we've got to
see Peterson for two more years, so we'll keep throwing different things at
her.

_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

Wake Forest  85  
Syracuse - 79

  
COACH HILLSMAN: First, what a tremendous game by Wake Forest. They really
played a very‑‑ they played an outstanding game, so I give them a lot of
credit. They really‑‑ first half we turned them over 16 times, I think it was.
Second half we just didn't get that done.  
I think that was the key in our game. We just weren't able to get them turned
over the second half to get some points off turnovers, so they did a
remarkable job.  
Our kids really competed at a high level and that's all you can really ask for
is for your kids to just go out and compete, and we did that. Obviously to
have two of your top three players on the bench with fouls the entire game is
tough, if Briana Day is playing 13 minutes against Hamby, we've got a problem.
That was huge for us.  
And obviously Brianna Butler with the fouls. We've got to have our best
players on the floor when their best players are on the floor, so that was a
big key for us. We couldn't get into any kind of flow or any kind of rotation
with our lineups because we had our players in foul trouble until the fourth
fouled out. It was just fouling and putting ourselves in positions where we
couldn't execute our game plan, but overall just give Wake Forest a lot of
credit.  
  
Q. How tough is it when you guys aren't making shots?  
COACH HILLSMAN: Well, that's everything. When you're not making shots, you
can't win. You've got to put the ball in the basket to be able to win. Also
for us to be able to press, we've got to score. That's a lot of our game is
offensive rebounding and getting our pressures set, and tonight we wasn't able
to do that.  
Last game we played, we had 28, I think, offensive rebounds last game. This
game we had 14. That's a big blow for us.  
  
Q. Coach, when Wake Forest was on the 22 ‑5 run, what was going wrong there?
  
COACH HILLSMAN: Well, we wasn't scoring. That was the biggest thing. We just
didn't score the basketball for a large chunk of the game, and when we get
into those droughts where we don't score, that means we can't press. That's
our game is making the game fast, getting the game up tempo. We want to play
in the 80s, and they played in the 80s, we played in the 70s, and that's not
our game, so we've got to get the game sped up. I think we did that in the
first half. Second half we didn't do that.  
  
Q. Coach, how tough was it to defend their role players because Hamby didn't
really get it going until later in the game, but Ball and Amber had big
games.  
COACH HILLSMAN: Well, I thought Amber did a tremendous job. She really stepped
up and made some shots for them, and that was huge. But our goal was to try to
keep Hamby around 19 points, 20 points. She had 23 points, so part of our game
plan was just trying to keep the ball out of her hands, or when she caught it
to get there early and defend her.  
Like I said earlier, give them a lot of credit. They had four players in
double figures, and that's a recipe for success. We say that every day in our
locker room and that's one of our goals, to have four players in double
figures. They had four players in double figures. We had three, we lose.
That's it.  
  
Q. Brianna, when you guys go on that run at the end, what started clicking
for you?  
BRIANNA BUTLER: I was able to make the ball go in the basket, and once I was
able to get that to happen, I started to feel it and get back into the game.  
  
Q. Cornelia, getting beat in transition a lot of times in the second half,
how tough was that to see, and what was going wrong there?  
CORNELIA FONDREN: It was tough. We could have got back in defense, but the
toughest thing was letting them get a run.  
  
Q. Coach, what was Wake doing defensively to kind of make three ‑point
shooting a tough aspect for you folks today?   
COACH HILLSMAN: Well, I thought it was a couple things. We got some clean
looks at the rim, and I thought that we just wasn't making shots early. But
they did a very good job of just closing us out and making our shooters put
the ball on the floor.  
But I thought that overall, if you look at the stat line, it's amazing because
it tells a story. They got 36 points in the paint, we got 34 points. We had 24
points off turnovers, they got 14. You can look down this line and the real
key to the game was we didn't have our best players on the floor. We were in
foul trouble. We were in almost every line on the stat sheet. The line they
won was they had their best players on the floor, our players were on the
bench, and that's tough.  
We've got to find a way, and one of our goals was not to foul, not to put them
in one and one. We fouled them, and they made shots, they made free throws.
They made 20 free throws, and that's tough.  
  
Q. Alexis, what got your individual offense going so well today?  
ALEXIS PETERSON: I think my teammates played a big role in me getting going
early. Cornelia did a great job of finding me early, and Bria Day, Briana Day,
Taylor, they all went to the boards hard. I thought it just left me open and I
was able to make some shots.  
  
Q. Coach, how do you now prepare your game for the NCAA Tournament?  
COACH HILLSMAN: Well, we've got to do things that we've been doing. We're
going to go home and get some rest, get off our feet. We're definitely going
to do that because I'm not confused that that's going to play a big part in
what we do in a couple weeks here, and just go back in the gym and just get
ready to play.  
It's tough, obviously Diamond Henderson didn't play and she plays a lot of
minutes for us. That's 10 points, almost 11 points a game for us. So we've
just got to make sure that we get our players into their roles and try to go
back into the gym and make sure we get Maggie going in the right position, we
can get Bria Day going in the right position. And we'll do that. We're not at
all discouraged. That's not what we do.  
We're going to go home and get some rest and get to go into the next
tournament and make a run at it.  
  
Q. Not having Diamond, does it force you to maybe pick up your offense a
little bit? She's a player who can store 20, 30 points a game. Are you looking
to score a little bit?  
CORNELIA FONDREN: I think other players, she stepped up, and everybody else
plays a big role, and everybody needs to step up. I think that will take the
coverage of her points.  
  
Q. Alexis, when Wake Forest is going on that big run, what are you guys
talking about and trying to improve to stop that? And then eventually you did
at the end make a small run there, what are you working on at that point in
time?  
ALEXIS PETERSON: I think basketball is just a game of runs. They just happened
to get their run at the right time, but we just wanted to stay composed and
stay poised and keep turning them over and keep playing hard, and I think we
did a good job. I don't think we ever gave up, and ultimately we just fell
short.  
  
Q. Looking ahead, Coach, is there any fear, obviously going into this, you
lose to the 13 seed and now you have to go right to the tournament and you
don't have Henderson. Is there a little uncertainty right now?  
COACH HILLSMAN: No. No, I'm not nervous at all. We scored 79 points, and we
had three players that really stepped up and played big. It's not really how
we're built to play, to be nervous or to be scared. We're excited going to the
next tournament.  
I mean, do you think that we're going to go in and lay down the next
tournament? No, we're going to go and we're going to get after it. We're not
thinking like, we're done. We're thinking we're pretty upset right now. In the
first round of the tournament, we're going to get after it. We're not nervous
at all. I wish the tournament started tomorrow.  
  
Q. In the next week or two, what can you work on with the bigs to avoid foul
trouble?  
COACH HILLSMAN: Well, I thought that we did a very good job of just trying to
pack the paint. And for them, they averaged about four and a half threes a
game. They made seven, so they made a couple more, and we've experienced some
games where we had Marsha Gaines scoring and we've seen her throughout the
conference.  
For us it's just about, like I said, getting our players into roles and to
make sure that we protect our bigs by guarding the ball. That's a big thing,
guarding the ball because now we're not getting ourselves into full rotations
and they get off on the rebounds and we foul them and things like that. It's
some minor things, and most of the things is make sure we play our principles,
keep people in front of us, protecting our bigs and not letting their guards
and their fours get in the paint on us off the bounce.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 5, 2015

  

### [Joanne Boyle](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24771)

### [Faith Randolph](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28318)

### [Mikayla Venson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28319)

  
_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

Miami  62  
Virginia - 52

  
COACH BOYLE: Just a lot of credit to Miami. They've struggled here towards the
end of the season, and they just came in and had a new fight about them, and I
thought they came in and just played a really good game.  
  
Q. Coach Meier talked about how their plan was kind of to run multiple
people at Faith. How do you think that had an effect on your offense and the
way you guys weren't able to get into a flow?  
COACH BOYLE: Yeah, this last month we've really had a flow to us and that's
what we talked about. We just were so disjointed, and we didn't just have a
flow offensively, and where we've been really good is if we get stops, we get
into a little bit of transition and we can kind of go back and forth between
running and pushing the ball in transition, calling a couple quick hitters,
running a couple sets, and I just felt like we got back to where we were a
month ago, it was just like walk the ball down the floor, miss a shot, just
one pass, just a brokenness to us on the offensive end of the floor, and we
weren't scoring, and then we spent the whole night in transition defense
against a really, really athletic team.  
  
Q. Joanne, this was kind of a ‑‑ this season in general was sort of an
almost season. You had a young team for the most part, and there are a lot of
games where you were close, and you're probably not going to get into the
NCAAs this year, but kind of reflect on the season in general, and have you
and the team talked about a potential WNIT bid and if you will accept it?   
COACH BOYLE: Well, we will accept it, but we try and focus on what's at hand.
Midway through the season we kind of gave them a realistic shot in the arm and
said this is what we're going to have to do to get there, so we were very real
with them. It wasn't any kind of hidden agenda, so they knew what we had to
do, and I was proud of how we approached all those games, in particular those
last four games and put ourselves in position to have a great win against
Louisville and try to come in here with a clean slate and just continue that
great basketball, but we definitely took a step backwards tonight. This is not
the team that we've been these last four weeks.  
So yes, everybody is back and we have great kids coming in and all that, but
it's disappointing because like you said, this is an almost team, and as
coaches you just want it for them. You really do. You want it for them, and
just to fall short, it just‑‑ it's just a hard lesson, you know.  
  
Q. Joanne, Sarah played 22 minutes. You took her out after the second foul
in the first half. Was there any reason in the second half that she wasn't
effective or that she played those kind of minutes?  
COACH BOYLE: We were just trying to find a rhythm, you know. Really as the
flow of the game goes, we were just trying to make substitutions accordingly,
so I don't think there was a rhyme or reason. It was just what's‑‑ that's the
worst feeling as a coach, be like, well, try this, try that. We just were not
in a flow. That just hurt us. I don't think there was any particular reason
why she was‑‑ it was just 22 minutes.  
  
Q. Faith, rare that you have this off of a day. Was it something that more
they did or you weren't hitting shots, couldn't get into that flow as you
talked about with the offense? What do you think was maybe the reason for some
struggles today?  
FAITH RANDOLPH: I think it just goes back to the flow. I didn't feel like we
had a rhythm at all throughout the game, and I thought we were just constantly
trying to figure it out.  
  
Q. Mikayla, there's been times when Faith and SI haven't been at their
average. Sometimes you've been able to take over and shoulder the load a
little bit. How frustrating was it today to not be able to have that and maybe
kind of fill in when the other two weren't doing as well?  
MIKAYLA VENSON: It was just upsetting knowing that we couldn't really get into
a flow. We were constantly trying to find it. But Miami was playing good on
us, playing good defense, and we were just fighting to find a flow and it
never really came to us.  
  
Q. Joanne, you were up 40 ‑39, I think, with about 13 minutes left. What do
you think happened at that point? I know the next bucket for them was one of
those three‑pointers from the wing that they hadn't been hitting and they hit
some down the stretch.   
COACH BOYLE: We went back and forth a little bit between the 2‑3 and our man
defense, and we kept helping up on the strong side, where we know our help
side comes from the weak side. So we pulled ourselves off of that strong side
guard twice, and they hit both of those threes, and we came out of the 2‑3
because we were not slotting well in it at all, so I think that hurt us a
little bit.  
That hurt us, and then we turned the ball over once or twice at the top of the
key, they got a quick two or four points I think it was, and then the momentum
shifted.  
  
Q. Faith, just overall kind of how frustrating is this because you guys have
been playing so well here the last two, three weeks, got a big win obviously
on Sunday, to not come in here and have the same effort. Kind of describe the
level of frustration right now.  
FAITH RANDOLPH: Yeah, like it was said, I felt like we've had some ups and
downs throughout the season. Just really want to find that consistency.

## March 4, 2015

  

### [Vanessa Panousis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28287)

### [Dennis Wolff](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24772)

### [Hannah Young](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28288)

  
_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

Virginia Tech  57  
NC State - 56

  
COACH WOLFF: Needless to say, I'm extremely proud of how competitive our girls
have been, particularly given the way the season has gone. To come in here and
play a good NC State team and both teams play well and us to make one more
play, which we needed to do a number of different times this year, it's very,
very satisfying, and I'm very, very proud and happy for the kids.  
  
Q. Hannah, how did that game ‑winning shot unfold from your point of view?
And Dennis, was that kind of how the play was drawn up?   
HANNAH YOUNG: Yeah, it was exactly how the play was drawn up. I'm still in
shock to be honest. Vanessa threw me that pass and I just shot it with
confidence, and it went in, so here we are.  
COACH WOLFF: They did a good job, Vanessa did a very good job of keeping her
dribble alive, and I thought they probably thought we were going to call
time‑out again, so I just thought, it might be in our best interest to just
play out of that first time‑out.  
  
Q. What have you been telling the team so far this season? Obviously a rough
year wins and loss wise, but the teams fought hard consistently. What does it
mean for you and the players to finally break through in this final game?  
COACH WOLFF: Well, you know, again, I think it negates to a certain degree a
lot of the frustrations that we felt. I think that we've had for the folks
that follow us, we've had a half a dozen games against some of the better
teams in the league that were played like this, and unfortunately we didn't
make enough plays.  
I thought that Spencer made a big play for them there in the end, and Hannah
came back and made a huge play for us. For us, again, I've had to answer a lot
of questions, this is the first win we've had in the ACC Tournament, and to do
it against a good team is gratifying.  
  
Q. The game in Raleigh, State shot 6 of 3 from 10 in the first half. I think
they finished 8 of 19. What did you do differently to take away their three in
this game?  
COACH WOLFF: Again, Wes is a great coach, and I thought the first game we
switched a lot of their actions, and they made us pay for it, and I thought it
was in our best interest not to do that today. Everybody kind of stayed with
their own man, so we didn't have mismatches in the post and everybody guarded
their guys on the perimeter.  
  
Q. For the players, Tech had gone one ‑and‑done in this tournament seven
years in a row. What does it mean to each of you to win a game in the ACC
Tournament for the first time?   
VANESSA PANOUSIS: It's great actually. I feel like the season that we've had,
we haven't had this many wins, so to get this win is a great feeling.  
HANNAH YOUNG: I have to agree with her. It's unbelievable, actually.  
  
Q. Did your game plan work almost to perfection today?  
COACH WOLFF: You know, I don't want to‑‑ we had a game plan we thought would
work for us, and our kids did what we asked them to do, and I think that some
of their players‑‑ Brown is a very good player, Wilson is a good player. They
had tough shooting nights. Some of it was probably our defense and some of it
was that they missed some shots they normally make.  
  
Q. Vanessa, what helped you have a good game offensively today, and for the
players, what do you feel your team did better in general than you have in
recent weeks?  
VANESSA PANOUSIS: For me, I think what I wanted to focus on was what the
defense gave me, so if they were stepping off me, I wanted to shoot my shot.
If they were all up on me, I wanted to attack, and like the last play, pass
off to my teammate, so that's what I focused on.  
COACH WOLFF: If I could add to that, I know you did a nice piece on Vanessa,
Vanessa has had a lot of pressure on her to make a lot of plays. She and I,
I've been a little bit mad at her recently for not having the swagger that she
should have for as good a player as I think she is. It's a pleasure to coach
her, and she responded to everything that we did since Sunday in a positive
fashion and played her best game of the year today.  
  
Q. Why did you do better today than any of the nine straight losses?  
VANESSA PANOUSIS: I feel like we stayed with the game plan for longer periods
of time and we didn't have as many lapses as we did throughout the season. I
think our defense was good and we tried to limit them to just one shot.  
  
Q. Hannah, you were so wide open on that shot. Can you take us through what
you were thinking mentally? You had all day to shoot it.  
HANNAH YOUNG: Obviously I had a rough first half and I think I came back in
the second half a lot better, and I really just shot it with confidence and
took my time since you did say I had a lot of space and whatever, so I just
took my time, and I hit it.  
  
Q. Players, do you think the number of fouls in the game affected you in a
positive or a negative way because there were 40 plus fouls together
combined?  
VANESSA PANOUSIS: Yeah, I think it was a bit on both ends, and I think us
players just need to adjust to what the referees are calling.  
  
Q. What made you believe you could win today?  
VANESSA PANOUSIS: I think throughout the whole season we've stuck together,
and I think we made it like an emphasis. For us to stay together throughout
the whole game, not just 38 minutes, 35 minutes, but throughout the whole 40
minutes.  
  
Q. Hannah, at the end of the game, are you nervous putting up that shot? Are
you confident putting up that shot? What are you feeling when you realize this
is it, the game is on me, the season is on me? And Dennis, you guys have been
0 ‑15‑‑ the school had been 0‑15 against State going into this. How do you
explain this difference today?   
COACH WOLFF: Again, you've got amazing stats that you usually throw at me. I
look at each game, as I've said to you repeatedly, I look at the next game.
You know, I didn't look at what we did with NC State last year. I looked at
the first game to see if there were things that I thought we could do better
from our end. But again, it's up to these kids, and again, I'm the coach of
the team, but I'm giving them the credit because they're the ones that had
to‑‑ after obviously a rough season that didn't go the way we'd all liked it
to have gone, we could have come into this tournament and just thought we were
going on spring break, and the kids are to be tremendously commended for that.  
HANNAH YOUNG: Just I'd like to obviously thank my teammates. They had
confidence in me through the whole season, and then when I finally had the
opportunity to hit my final shot, it just happened for me, I think. So
finally.  
  
Q. Was the mentality of the team in this ACC Tournament game any different
than the last several years in the ACC Tournament?  
VANESSA PANOUSIS: No, not really. Like Coach said, we had gotten together and
said if we wanted to have one more game, we needed to win this game.  
COACH WOLFF: I don't think you go into‑‑ last year in the ACC Tournament, we
ended up playing a team that we had played like five days earlier. So when
you're in those type of situations, this was more of a normal tournament thing
where you hadn't played the team four or five days ago. Again, I just want to
emphasize, again, how proud I am of the ladies on our team.  
  
Q. I just wanted to clarify an earlier answer. I think Vanessa said the last
play worked exactly as it was designed. Were you supposed to be the decoy on
that play and Samantha was supposed to take the shot or was it an option type
of situation?  
COACH WOLFF: What I wanted to do was they obviously were playing such close
attention to Vanessa that we tried to give her two ball screens at the top.
She refused the first one, Sidney set a screen for the second one, and what I
told both the kids was, Vanessa, you get in the lane and you see what you
have, and if not, I'm relatively certain Hannah is going to be open on the
wing and then she'll have a shot. Again, a bunch of times I've drawn stuff up
and it hasn't worked, so we're fortunate this worked.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 4, 2015

  

### [Wes Moore](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26514)

### [Miah Spencer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26513)

  
_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

Virginia Tech  57  
NC State - 56

  
COACH MOORE: You've got to give Virginia Tech a lot of credit. They knocked
down shots, and obviously hit some big threes.  
We've probably have gotten a little too one‑dimensional this year and relied
on the jump shot too much. We haven't established a good inside game, so I'll
take the blame for that. We lived and died by the three or by the jump shot,
and today we just didn't get enough good looks. Again, very disappointing. Our
kids have faced a lot of adversity, and they've hung in there and they've
battled and fought, but still, it's a tough loss.  
  
Q. Coach, what did you think of your defense on the game ‑winning shot? And
then just in general, any differences between when you played them in Raleigh
this year and today's match‑up?   
COACH MOORE: Well, I don't know, Panousis, I guess is the pronunciation, we
just felt like we couldn't let her come off the pick on the ball and get an
open look, so we were trying to trap her whenever possible, make her give it
up.  
You know, they did a good job. They rolled the post on the first pick on the
ball and came up with another pick on the ball, and that one got her free, and
then Miah had to help up, and that left them open for Young in the corner.
Again, she knocked it down.  
You know, I don't know. Looking back on it, maybe we should have done
something different, but again, we felt like we didn't want to let her knock
down a three off the pick. They won this one, they won that one. What do you
say? They did a good job versus the pick on us at our place. We switched and
we were able to take advantage of the mismatch. Today, which we expected it,
they showed a lot, but they did a nice job of helping and covering up when the
roll happened. They were able to help and recover well, and you know, I just
think we missed some shots, missed some lay‑ups, missed some open looks, and
you have a day like that and you've got to find a way to win otherwise.  
Like I say, I feel bad that I've let us get so one‑dimensional. We've got to
establish an inside game and be a threat from there. But again, Virginia Tech
did a great job. They made that adjustment on pick on the ball, and I thought
it worked really well for them.  
  
Q. Really odd statistic today, zero fast break points scored in the game.
What did they do so well to slow you down?  
COACH MOORE: That's a good point. And there again, I can probably take some of
the blame for that. Maybe we're calling too many plays. Maybe we ought to just
be pushing it and seeing if we can get something in transition. Their posts do
a good job of running the floor and getting back and taking away the paint.
But again, we probably should have tried to put a little more pressure on them
in transition and seeing if we could have made that happen.  
But again, we just didn't make enough happen. We shot 26 free throws. I
thought the kids attacked. They did some good things there. But again, we
probably should have been more aggressive in transition.  
  
Q. In the first half, you guys shot the ball very, very well. In the second
half, it seemed like they were able to shut it down. Did they do anything
differently? What led to that lower shooting percentage?  
COACH MOORE: Yeah, again, like I said, they did a nice job. When we shut pick
on the ball, they did a really nice job of rotating and taking away the first
and second looks.  
You know, as we mentioned already, in transition they did a pretty good job of
getting matched up and not leaving anybody open really. And they limited our
offensive rebounds. We weren't able to get any second chances, which I think
when you're not shooting the ball well, you've got to make something happen on
the boards, and we didn't do that.  
  
Q. Coach, the referees obviously called this game very tightly. How much did
the number of fouls play into this game?  
COACH MOORE: Yeah, you know, again, we had a hard time when we were trying to
trap pick on the ball, we had a hard time getting our post up there early
enough and really doing a good job of making it hard for them to come out of
the trap. That's where we got a lot of our fouls.  
Again, Panousis did a great job of attacking off the pick on the ball when we
tried to trap, and she put a lot of pressure on our defense and on our post,
and consequently she was able to get to the foul line some and create some
things off of that.  
  
Q. Wes, you look at the numbers between the game you played in Raleigh and
this game and they're incredibly similar. The one glaring difference that I
see is that in the win, you got 52 shots up, in this game you only took 42.
Was that ‑‑  
COACH MOORE: How many offensive rebounds did we have in that game?  
  
Q. In Raleigh?  
COACH MOORE: Uh‑huh.  
  
Q. Let me look here. Eight.  
COACH MOORE: Not much different. You're right.  
Well, like I said, I think you look at a lot of things. First of all, we shot
26 free throws, so that means you're shooting less from the field because
that's at least 13 possessions probably where you didn't get a shot up. 25
last time? I don't know, maybe they slowed it down, did a good job of making
the possessions fewer. I'm not sure. But we'll look at the tape and try to
figure it out.  
  
Q. My question is for both. How much thought have y'all put into the WNIT?
Obviously you're not going to play in Reynolds anymore. Do you want the
opportunity to extend this season, coach some more games, play some more
games?  
MIAH SPENCER: We had a conversation about it last practice. Coach came and
talked to us about the situation and asked what we wanted to do, and so we met
as a team, and I asked Len'Nique Brown, our senior, if she wanted to play, and
if she wanted to play, then everybody else would play for her, so we said yes.  
COACH MOORE: Yeah, you know, it's a tough call, obviously, because you know
you're going on the road. We know we don't have a real deep bench right now,
so it is a tough call. Trying to get the players' input, see how they felt,
and we wanted to kind of see, too, how we came out of this tournament
injury‑wise, and that sort of thing.  
But answering your question, yeah, we did have to discuss it because we were
getting a lot of pressure to let people know what we were thinking. So we have
discussed it.  
  
Q. Does the outcome of this game now have any effect on that previous
decision? Do you feel you're going to rediscuss it?  
COACH MOORE: I don't know. We'll see. Haven't crossed that bridge yet.  
  
Q. Miah, did you feel like you were going to win the game until that last
shot went in, and what was Virginia Tech doing so well defensively to disrupt
the other guards' shooting?  
MIAH SPENCER: After the three‑point play I really felt like we was going to
dig down on defense and not let them score, not let them have a great open
look, and defensively, I guess they were just putting pressure on us, I
believe. But yeah, we didn't have a good shooting night, but we have to do
other things, attack, so other people get to the free‑throw line, stuff like
that.  
  
Q. Miah, you're just a sophomore, so I know this is a disappointing loss for
you, but you'll be back next year. Can you take anything from this year and
this season and look forward to next year with some new hope?  
MIAH SPENCER: Well, I just wanted to play for 'Nique because I knew it was her
last year, and also KB, knowing that she's not able to play. But what I took
from this game is that you have to start the game with a lot of intensity, a
lot of urgency. Discipline comes into it, as well. I mean, anybody can win a
game, anybody can be beaten, so we just have to come ready to play every night
for 40 minutes and not just 20 minutes.  
  
Q. Coach, when I talked to you the other day you said you were like a bubble
team for the NCAA, and there's been some mention of the WNIT, but does this
definitely put you out of the NCAA?  
COACH MOORE: Yeah, I would probably say so, yeah. Again, I think we had to
make a little run over here, had to win a few probably, and we didn't get that
done. Yeah, I would say so.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 4, 2015

  

### [Chelsea Lindsay](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28297)

### [Audra Smith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26427)

  
_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

Georgia Tech  80  
Clemson - 53

  
COACH SMITH: First of all, I'd like to give credit to Georgia Tech. They
played an outstanding game tonight. They shot the three ball unbelievably, 8
for 14, and they played a very good ballgame. Kaela Davis got into foul
trouble and it was a good sign for them obviously when she went out with the
foul trouble that the rest of their players were able to sustain the lead, and
in addition push the lead and play without her. So just want to commend them
on a great game.  
Also want to talk about my players. The seniors, it's unfortunate, I would
have liked to have had a win for them today so we could have advanced on to
tomorrow, but I want to thank them for the two years that I've had with them
and how hard they've worked and what they mean to this program.  
And also for our newbies, which we have quite a few of, how hard they played
tonight and how hard the entire team played tonight. We continued to battle,
we continued to fight, so I'm excited about the future of Clemson women's
basketball and where we're going. We're a very, very young team, so coming to
this tournament with the caliber of players and the caliber of coaches that
are here, it can be a little bit of intimidating, and with this being your
first time and your first trip.  
I'm just excited about the fact that they continue to fight hard. We made a
valiant run there and cut it to 10 but just couldn't get over the hump. But we
have a lot to look forward to in terms of our future.  
  
Q. You guys went into halftime down 21 and you came out like a house of
fire, cut it to 10. What adjustments did you make in the locker room?  
COACH SMITH: I just told them that they have to continue to fight. I've been
in these situations a lot where we've been down and I told them what's going
to happen. I said they're a little complacent and they're going to get a
little comfortable. Typically, the team that has the lead it, always happens,
and we just have to chip away and be patient and we have to make shots.  
In the first half, we couldn't buy a basket. And I also stressed the fact that
we needed to attack the basket. And as you know, we attacked the basket and
that's how we were able to cut that lead to 10.  
But with Georgia Tech, they have some very, very good scorers and they were
able to knock down some shots and pushed the lead back up to 14 before we knew
it, then 16, then 19, and it was tough, and then we tried to dig ourselves out
of the hole again, but by that time it was too late for us.  
  
Q. You mentioned how hard your players fought. Is this a tough game to get
people motivated for when you have to win the whole tournament to make the
NCAA?  
COACH SMITH: No, it's not. You focus on one game at a time. And like I said,
with this young group, I think about my nine freshmen last year at this time,
and you think, a whole year, that's a long time to be in college basketball,
but it's not. It's a huge adjustment. But last year at this time my nine
freshmen, their seasons were over. They were done.  
For them coming in, I mean, it was‑‑ it's been a long, long year for them. But
no, it wasn't a situation where it was hard to motivate them and get them
ready to play. They were ready to play. I just felt like Georgia Tech just
came out on fire. I mean, they were hitting threes, and again, Rogers is
phenomenal. She's a very, very tough kid to defend, and she did a great job.
That was part of it.  
  
Q. Chelsea, obviously not the ending you wanted here, but could you talk a
little bit about the progress you've seen the program make the last couple
years and where it's headed from here with the younger players coach
mentioned?  
CHELSEA LINDSAY: Well, I'll talk about the younger players. I think that in
the off‑season, they'll work hard and for the next season they'll be a little
bit more ready and prepared because they'll have a little bit of experience
under their belt.  
As for me, I'll just try to get better every year, working on my game, making
sure I'm more aggressive on the offensive end.  
  
Q. Chelsea, what's been the best thing about playing four years at Clemson
and being a student at Clemson?  
CHELSEA LINDSAY: I would say the fans. They're great. They're always
supportive. They come out regardless.  
  
Q. Coach, you're two years in now. When you first came in, you wanted to
change the culture as far as bringing up the intensity. How close are you to
what your vision is?  
COACH SMITH: We're getting there. I mean, obviously we're not there, but the
culture has been changed in terms of the type of players that I want in my
program. They're hard workers. They are great kids, and they give me
everything that they have within their abilities. And so I think we're well on
our way.  
We have a great group of young kids coming in next season to add to the kids
that are returning, so we're headed in the right direction. It's just going to
be a matter of time in terms of experience. That was our biggest downfall this
year. With nine freshmen, a sophomore and two seniors, it's the experience.
You can't teach experience. You have to go through it.  
So I'm hoping that with everything that they had to encounter this year,
finishing the season 9 and 21 and just not being able‑‑ we haven't won a game
since January 2nd, so I'm just hoping that they'll learn and they'll have that
experience, they'll understand what it takes and the level of commitment at
this level, because for freshmen, when they come in, they come in and they
have these grandiose ideas that they're going to be all world when they get to
college, but it's a totally different ballgame and they don't realize it until
they step on the floor.  
Non‑conference is a totally different deal. When you step onto the court in
the ACC, you're playing pros every night, so it's a huge, huge adjustment.  
But I feel like we're headed in the right direction. We'll have a great
postseason. We'll have a good summer. We'll take an international trip to play
some games and experience some different culture and get better, and then next
year this time I'm hoping that we'll be sitting up here as winners and moving
on to the next round.  
  
Q. You'll be honored still here this weekend. Any thoughts on that
personally for you here?  
COACH SMITH: It's funny, I was teasing Jane Miller when she called me and I
said, Could you not find anybody else? Is this a joke? But no, it's an
unbelievable honor for me to have played in the ACC for four years, coached in
the ACC for ten, leave the ACC for nine and then be back and have coached for
two more years, and to have it is an unbelievable honor of being an ACC
Legend. It's just unbelievable. And I have so many fond memories of Greensboro
Coliseum, and I'll go all the way back to Rock Hill and Winthrop Arena there
and all the way back to Fayetteville and the arena there.  
So I have so many fond memories of the ACC and the coaches and just how
grateful I am to have had the opportunity to attend the University of
Virginia, to have played under the legendary and Hall of Famer Debbie Ryan, to
have worked under Debbie Ryan, who really helped prepare me for this level,
and to be back in the ACC and coaching in the ACC, I am just so ecstatic.  
Actually honestly, kind of funny, I think my husband, Anthony Oliver, who was
also a student‑athlete at University of Virginia, and my son A.J. are more
excited than I am. When guys start talking about, hey, what are we supposed to
wear, then it's a big deal.  
I'm really excited. I'm humbled, I'm honored, and I feel very fortunate and
blessed to represent UVA as this year's ACC Legend.

_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

Georgia Tech  80  
Clemson - 53

  
Postgame Interview With:  
  
COACH MACHELLE JOSEPH  
RODDREKA ROGERS  
AALIYAH WHITESIDE  
  
  
COACH JOSEPH: Obviously I'm really proud of this young team. We've been on a
journey all year long trying to figure out how to win and be successful in
this tough conference.  
I think over the last month, we've really grown up. We've started to
understand each other. We've started to trust each other, and we've really
developed an understanding of our roles.  
And I thought today you saw that in certain situations with Kaela Davis only
scoring three points and us being able to score 80, I think it says a lot
about our team and the other players, how they've stepped up, and with the
majority of freshmen on our team. We have nine players and seven of them are
freshmen and sophomores, so that says a lot about their growth and their
development throughout the course of the season.  
  
Q. Your team looked like you were shot out of a cannon. Had you referenced
or even noticed the other two higher seeds had lost today and did you mention
that to your team? And also do you think if you have a good run this year and
don't win the tournament that you could play your way into the NCAA this
week?  
COACH JOSEPH: I'd like to answer your last question first. That's our goal.
That's what we're here to do. We feel like we lost a couple games early. We
had a couple one‑point losses. We wish we could have those back because we
would be sitting here right now in the NCAA Tournament, but we know this is
our last opportunity to play ourselves into it.  
We feel like we've been playing really good basketball for over a month. We
lost some tough games to Miami and at home with Notre Dame, but we feel like
we were right in the mix with those two teams. So we definitely feel like
we're playing really good basketball right now, and we're looking forward to
the opportunity we have tomorrow.  
As far as‑‑ we didn't talk about any other team except for Clemson. I think
I've talked about Clemson so much for three days that I think that these guys
are tired of hearing about it. I really felt like we were focused. We came out
with a focus and a purpose, and I felt we were able to make plays on both
ends.  
  
Q. You're working hard there inside in the first half, but can you talk
about also when you get the inside ‑outside game going, you knock down six
threes there, how that helps you guys out and opens things up for you, too?   
RODDREKA ROGERS: Just for us, throwing the ball inside, it just helps us open
up the outside, because once they start helping in on us, the outside is open
so all we have to do is just kick out for the three, and it's just a momentum
builder, just being able to throw the ball out.  
AALIYAH WHITESIDE: I would say it definitely feels good when everybody steps
up and hits their three, the open shots, and I think it opens up the inside
and Dreke's able to get the rebounds, too, if we don't hit the shots. I think
it has the defense kind of on their heels and don't know what to expect.  
  
Q. Coach, how did you settle your team after Clemson came back and cut the
lead to 10 after going to 22 at halftime?  
COACH JOSEPH: I think it's really tough when you get a lead like that in the
first half in this kind of environment, it's hard not to relax, and with a
young team it's really hard not to relax.  
I think one of the things we did, we were all a little panicky and trying to
make up the difference in one possession, so what we talked about was taking
our time and getting stops on the defensive end. We felt like if we could get
stops on the defensive end and get rebounds, then we would get right back in
it where we needed to be.  
One of the things we did was we adjusted and started pressing again and
slowing the ball down because we felt like they were getting the ball in quick
and just running it down our throats. We just started pressing and slowing the
ball down a little bit.  
  
Q. Roddreka, what's the keys to your rebounding success?  
RODDREKA ROGERS: The keys to my‑‑ I can't even tell you the secret. Just
knowing where the ball is. It's just a feeling I get, like, Oh, it's going to
come off this side. So usually I just go weak side and more than likely it's
coming to me. I work my butt off to get it.  
COACH JOSEPH: It's interesting, in practice today I mentioned to other
players, I stopped practice and I said, you know what, if you guys wonder why
Roddreka can rebound the basketball, it's because when the ball goes up she's
moving and the rest of you are standing there watching. And we're 5 on 0, and
she's moving to go get the rebound, and we're working on plays 5 on 0, the
shot is in the air and she's already underneath the basket. Where a lot of
players stand and watch the ball come off the rim, she's moving for position
while the ball is in the air.  
  
Q. Playing North Carolina tomorrow, what are your thoughts on that?  
COACH JOSEPH: Well, any time you play North Carolina it's a battle, especially
when you play them in Greensboro in the ACC Tournament. I enjoy playing North
Carolina. I think we play a very similar style.  
I think that throughout the years we've had some great battles and some great
match‑ups with North Carolina, and it's one of the things that since we played
them the first game, we weren't at full strength and we really didn't play
well. And we were just still getting our bearings and figuring out our roles
and trying to figure out what to do without Sydney Wallace.  
I think now we're a totally different team and we understand our roles. We've
played obviously some of the best teams in the country in this league.  
We're excited to have that opportunity now because we played North Carolina so
early. We're looking forward to the match‑up. Obviously have tremendous
respect for Sylvia Hatchell and the program at North Carolina, but we feel
like over the years we've had some great battles, and we're looking forward to
this opportunity because, like you mentioned, we're trying to play our way
into postseason.

_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

Wake Forest  69  
Boston College - 53

  
COACH HOOVER: I'm just really proud of the whole team, and again, I obviously
can't say enough about Dearica Hamby and what she does for us night in and
night out. It was definitely a total team effort.  
  
Q. Coach Hoover, in the first half Boston College got a lot of back door
cuts, a lot of lay ‑ins, and they also hit four three‑pointers. Seems like you
did a better job of eliminating those in the second half. What changed?   
COACH HOOVER: Well, I think when you come in to play Boston College, we
probably talk so much to our young ladies about we don't want to give them
threes. They lead our league in made threes. Season record of how many threes
they've made this year for their University.  
So I think we were probably so jacked to be out and guard the three‑point line
that it opened us up and exposed the backdoor cuts a little bit in that first
half. Kudos to our players for kind of making that adjustment. They're a very
difficult team to guard because they're just really dangerous on the perimeter
and they do a great job reading. And whatever you do defensively, they're
going to try to beat it. I thought our hands were really active and we tracked
deflections. I don't know how many we ended up with, but I know right before
the half we got six in a four‑minute span right before the half. Those
deflections really affect a lot of their actions, and I know this one had a
couple of deflections, and Milessa, too, on what they call a flood pass when
they penetrate baseline, and it takes away some of their offense for them.  
  
Q. Coach, you talked about the deflections late in the first half. How big
was it to get that separation, that little bit of run, you caused turnovers on
four of the last five Boston College possessions to kind of regain control of
the game.  
COACH HOOVER: I think that was key for us, it gave us some momentum coming in
at halftime. In a game where we had been able to pull up, get our lead and
then it got erased and then get a lead, I think it definitely gave us
momentum. They when you talking about coming out in the second half and that
lead was gone almost before we blinked our eyes. I thought the O board put
back by Amber Campbell right at the half was key. It really kind of lifted us
up, and O boards were an emphasis for us.  
  
Q. Coach, you had a pretty good game up in the Dome early on this season. It
was close late. What has to change for you guys tomorrow to get it over the
top?  
COACH HOOVER: Well, I'll tell you, it's been a long time since we played them.
They've had two assistants been working on that scout for a while now, I've
watched all their games since then. I'd say we had a very slow start up there.
It was our first time playing there. We can't have a slow start.  
Obviously Peterson, Alexis Peterson, just had a field day on us, so we've got
to be able to contain her. Butler is a phenomenal shooter, one of the best and
quickest in our league at shooting. And then they've got a shot blocker inside
and we're going to see zone again. We've got to take care of the basketball,
we've got to be aggressive and we've got to continue to dictate with our
defense.  
  
Q. Dearica, you had 28 in that game at the Dome, pretty big double ‑double.
What can go right for you again tomorrow?   
DEARICA HAMBY: Our shooters knocking down shots on the outside, opening up the
zone, and when you open up the zone, it's practically one‑on‑one, and then
finish.  
  
Q. Dearica, you seemed to let the game come to you today, kind of a slow
start statistically but then you had that run where you scored 12 points in a
row. What were you seeing down low to enable you to attack those gaps?  
DEARICA HAMBY: I don't really remember.  
COACH HOOVER: I think one thing we did with Dearica we really tried to do a
lot, she does a good job when she can move around and she can get in space.
It's one of those when she flashes in and ducks in on somebody, it's tough.
When you just leave her on one block, it's a little bit easier. They can be
really physical with her and that kind of thing.  
And again, I think one of the biggest keys was before we had the halftime, two
and a half minutes in, we had hit two threes, one by Amber and one by Millesa
Calicott. Even if your game plan is to come in and really take away the inside
game, they're not going to continue to sit there. That really makes them
worried.  
  
Q. Coach, what is it about you guys in this particular building every year?
It just seems your whole entire level of play from top to bottom is
elevated?  
COACH HOOVER: I have to give all that credit to our seniors because that
started before I ever got here. Our upperclassmen, every year they come in
with a confidence here and pass it down through the underclassmen about this
is our house, we protect our house, and so I think a lot of that comes from
them and just that it is‑‑ it's the premier conference tournament in the
country, it's kind of show time, and so I think a lot of it comes from them,
and then we've just come in and been confident in them.  
We knew today would be a dogfight. Again, our game at home was back and forth
and we came out on the short end of it. Did that give us more motivation
today? Maybe it did, but I do know we have three seniors that poured their
heart and souls into this program and they're not ready for the season to be
over. They're not ready to hang that jersey up and not put it back on, and
we're not ready for that to happen. I think they come in with that mentality.  
  
Q. Could you kind of talk us through the process of what you guys did during
the little delay, what you guys discussed and points of emphasis and all
that?  
COACH HOOVER: Well, they weren't sure how long it was going to be, but
probably the advantage for us in that situation is we were in that situation
last year. We were up 14 on Carolina before the lights went out last year, and
we had about a 15‑minute delay. I think our kids just going through it last
year and knowing, we said, go out and shoot a little bit, we want to try to
stay up on your feet, move around. We don't want to tighten up and have to
warm completely back up. And then just relax because we weren't sure exactly
how long it was going to take and if the lights were going to get fixed.  
  
Q. But you guys did come out and make a couple quick threes, and I think
that was before the delay.  
COACH HOOVER: Right.  
  
Q. Was there a concern that might get you out of a rhythm?  
COACH HOOVER: Yes, it absolutely was and that's why we kind of stayed pretty
chilled and relaxed over on the sideline. We didn't bring them and start
talking a bunch of game planning and that kind of stuff. We did come out with
a specific play to run coming out of it, but I thought our kids did a good job
just kind of staying the moment and I do truly believe because we went through
it last year, we weren't like, oh, gosh, what do we do, this is awkward,
because we kind of did that last year. So we didn't have that situation.  
  
Q. Amber, can you describe your impressions of your first ever ACC
experience?  
AMBER CAMPBELL: Actually my first ACC experience, it felt pretty good. I just
treat it like any other game, but also being aggressive on both ends of the
floor. I mean, it actually felt really great to play in the ACC for the first
time, tournament, at that.  
  
Q. Being your first ACC Tournament, does it help to have, I guess, a safety
net or maybe a safety valve like Dearica down low?  
AMBER CAMPBELL: Yeah, it does help a lot, actually. It takes like a good
amount of pressure off of me. You know, me and her play‑‑ have good chemistry
together. When I see her on the block, I try to give her the ball inside, and
like, you know, cutting off of her passes and stuff.  
COACH HOOVER: Yeah, I think that's one of the biggest things, when you look at
her stat sheet and what this young lady did for us, she came out with five
offensive rebounds today. And I think our other players understand how much
attention Dearica draws on offense and on the boards, and so it just opens so
much up for them. Kandice Ball had three and Milan Quinn are the two centers
that saw most of the time today. That was a big, big part of our game plan was
to attack those offensive boards. When she's got two people on her, it's a
harder for her to get them, and she still comes up with three.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 4, 2015

  

### [Nicole Boudreau](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28284)

### [Erik Johnson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24766)

  
_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

Wake Forest  69  
Boston College - 53

  
COACH JOHNSON: Wake Forest and us are two young teams that have been really
inconsistent this year. We've both played some really, really good games.
We've both struggled with some turnovers, just some consistency issues.  
We're going into this game, we said, Hey, the team that plays solid, the team
that takes care of the ball, the team that defends the rebounds consistently
is going to win, and that held true.  
Wake Forest deserves all the credit. I thought coach Hoover did a great job.
They were prepared, they made some good adjustments. They're defensive
pressure really got us back on our heels. We didn't do a great job of getting
to the rim in the first half.  
We finally got ourselves to the line a little bit more in the second half, but
again, you have to credit their pressure. They turned us over a little bit,
they took us out of rhythm, they contested shots very well. On the other hand,
Dearica Hamby, that's a legitimate, high level WNBA players, and she played
like it tonight. Her teammates rallied around her, and when she attracts that
much attention, it makes it more difficult to box out and do some other things
on the rest of the team, and her teammates stepped up, as well.  
Again, the credit goes to Wake Forest tonight. This wasn't a game where we
just blew it. We got beat tonight, and again, I was very impressed with their
game.  
  
Q. The right side of your record, is that kind of a testament to how good
this conference is?  
COACH JOHNSON: Is the right side the losses? (Laughing).  
It is. We made a lot of progress this year. There was a lot of games‑‑ we were
playing three freshmen and two sophomores consistently, along with Nicole and
a couple other juniors.  
And you're right, we played really well at North Carolina, had a chance to win
that game. They come back and win it down the stretch. We had a five‑point
lead at Pitt. These are some high‑level, really, really good teams. We played
great in stretches against some of the top teams in the country. But you're
right, if you don't play great against a great team, then you're going to get
beat.  
There's no question, the ACC is the premier women's basketball conference in
the country, but we love it. And I'm telling you, that's why Nicole and her
teammates are at Boston College. I will tell you that the attitude in the
locker room there, a lot of it came from, our leader here, Nicole, was there's
a hunger and one of our assistant coaches pointed that out to them.  
This wasn't a thank‑goodness‑it's‑over type of feel in this locker room. We're
bummed, we're mad that we lost. You can tell it hurts, but there was, man, I
can't wait to get back in the gym, I can't wait to go see what we can do next
year. We've got so much ahead of us, and even the players that are leaving the
program and they're graduating, they said the same thing, guys, you've come so
far, you can do this. We're going to keep fighting and we're going to get over
the top in some of those. We made big strides this year, and it's going to
continue.  
  
Q. Nicole, what's the biggest thing you learned from the season?  
NICOLE BOUDREAU: That's a tough one. I'd have to say that not one person on
our team can do it by themselves. I think you saw us play our best basketball
when we played as a team, when we moved the ball, when we played team defense,
stuff like that. We're that team where we don't have a Dearica Hamby, we don't
have an All‑American on our team to carry us through every single game. You
might have Kelly step up one game, you might have Emily, you might have
Ashley. You don't know who's going to step up and I think that's what makes us
really special. So we have to really take that and run with it and play
together and really get that chemistry going with each other.  
I think that grew from game to game this year with, how many freshmen do we
have? Five, whatever it is. I think we excelled over the year at getting
better at that, and now we have a full off‑season to work at it.  
And I think next year that ‑‑ I'm so excited, I was telling‑‑ like Coach
Johnson was saying, I'm so excited for next year and kind of the pieces that
we're brining back and building that chemistry. And I think we have a chance
to be really good, so yeah.  
  
Q. Coach, in the first half you had both the backdoor game and the three
‑point shot going. What did Wake do different defensively in the second half
to limit you folks to four field goals?   
COACH JOHNSON: They used their athleticism well, and I thought that was
something that we were able to exploit in the first games that we were able to
score 75 points because we got out in transition. We got the ball to the rim.  
They really picked it up this game, and I've got to give coach and her staff
credit, and those players. Their hands were in a ton of passing lanes, and
some of those passes were‑‑ somebody is open, but we're a little bit lazy
maybe in going over the top instead of faking and going down, and boom,
they're there. So look, you've got to credit their players. They played really
hard. They were motivated, and again, that's a good team, too. You're going to
see that team. I know they lose an All‑American, but there's some good young
players, and that's a program on the rise, as well.  
  
Q. Is that Wake Forest team a team that can make an extended run in this
tournament and make a run into the weekend?  
COACH JOHNSON: Hey, it's March, right? Nicole right now is wishing that we had
another shot at Syracuse. Syracuse is a team that they rely heavily on the
three‑point shot, and they're not shooting well.  
Wake Forest, absolutely. They've traditionally played well here. So look, it's
tournament time. Anybody can win, so absolutely Wake Forest has a shot, and I
think the world of Coach Q and that Syracuse team. They got us pretty good the
last time we played. I thought they played us as tough as anybody did, turned
us over, so difficult to guard. It's going to be a great game.  
I just wish that we were still in this bracket. We had a shot to do it, but
absolutely Wake has got a shot, so no question.

_DALLAS, TEXAS_  
  

Baylor  75  
Texas - 64

  
MODERATOR: We're now joined by the winners of the Big 12 championship this
year, and also the tournament, the Baylor Bears, Coach Kim Mulkey, Alexis
Prince, Nina Davis and Niya Johnson.  
Coach, I'm going to give you one more opportunity this year, would you like to
make an opening statement?  
COACH MULKEY: No.  
MODERATOR: We'll take questions for our student-athletes first.  
  
Q. Nina, in the regular season both of the big players, but particularly
Kelsey Lang, gave y'all problems. What did y'all do to adjust to that and how
did you contain them?  
NINA DAVIS: We just focused on her more, every time she got the ball, we just
tried to heals down, kind of double-team her and then get back out to the
guards. Like you said, the two players that killed us in previous games, and
we just didn't want that to happen again.  
  
Q. For Nina, and then Niya, looked like it was a somewhat understated
celebration out there, I was just wondering why that was, are you looking
forward to bigger and better things or what were your emotions?  
NINA DAVIS: I'm not sure what you mean when you say understated. We're
excited. Yes, this is the fifth year in a row but we don't have five rings.
This is only like our second one of the season, so this is definitely an
exciting time. Of course you're looking forward to the NCAA Tournament but
we're never overlooking winning the championship, and I feel we was pretty
much excited today.  
NIYA JOHNSON: I just thought we all were excited after the game, we were
looking forward to this championship tonight, playing hard on the court and I
just thought we were very excited and it showed after the game.  
  
Q. Nina, your second straight Most Outstanding Player Award. Is there
something about this tournament that just works for you, appeals to you; what
is it?  
NINA DAVIS: It's just that part of the year, it's March Madness and exciting
part of the year. I love big games, I love the spotlight, and they say big
players step up in big games. That's a quote I always tried to lean on.  
  
Q. Niya, shot selection in particular looked really good tonight
particularly in the second half. What was the key there? And talk about the
perimeter shooting and Alexis and Imani, what you got from them.  
NIYA JOHNSON: In previous practice and games we try to focus on ball reversal,
having much more ball reversal and shifting the defense, and I thought we did
pretty well in the second half by having them shift and making good shots and
knowing when to shoot and when to not. I thought Kristy, Alexis Prince and
Imani shot very well from the perimeter, and also attacking.  
  
Q. Alexis, talk about the second half for you, you seemed to have a lot more
energy. You had energy the whole game, but the second half you made some
plays, you had that steal that turned into a 3-pointer, just talk about how
things were different for you after half-time.  
ALEXIS PRINCE: Just wanted to provide a spark and get off to a better start
than I did the start of the game.  
  
Q. Niya, you don't get tired of confetti and putting hats on backwards and
cutting down nets and all that kind of stuff, right?  
NIYA JOHNSON: Oh, no, and I don't take it for granted either. We won like,
what, five in a row, and we just want to keep it going. We don't want to be
the team that fail the fans, the team and the coaches as well.  
  
Q. Nina, I know you guys said after you wrapped up the regular season title
you were going to enjoy it for about the rest of the night, and then that's in
the past and you're moving on. How long are you going to enjoy this one?  
NINA DAVIS: We have a little bit more time to enjoy this one. The next one is
not until the 20th. We're on spring break so we get a little break so we have
more time to enjoy this one, but we're going to get back to business. And
after selection Monday we'll know who we play, and it's back in the gym we go.  
  
Q. Niya, how important was Texas when Sune went out with foul trouble, they
cut it down to two points and kind of made it a game, but you guys kind of
came out in the second half and like, okay, it's over. How important was it
for you guys to kind of reestablish things there in the beginning of the
second half and kind of take their hope away?  
NIYA JOHNSON: Well, first off, I thought KK came in and took care of her job.
She did very well scoring off the block and I thought she did very well,
defending Lang and Imani Stafford. And then Sune came in and she apologized,
hey, I'm sorry guys. She knew how valuable she was to the team. And we all
said it's okay, just come back and play smart. She's just a huge valuable
player to this team, just because of her presence.  
  
Q. Nina, does it ever surprise you how efficient offensively this team is
and efficient you are? I mean, 75 percent to start the game from the field,
and especially during tournament time, do you ever look back and kind of go,
we just hit a lot of shots and didn't take as many as it took?  
NINA DAVIS: It doesn't surprise me. We pretty much -- we're a young team but
we have a lot of depth, we have a lot of talent on this team. We pretty much
-- nobody knows yourself better than you, and we pretty much know each other
as a team, so when my teammates are making shots and when they're on, it
doesn't surprise me that they're going. We're just trusting each other, we
believe in our talents and we know how far we can go.  
  
Q. Nina, how far has this team come from the beginning of the season?  
NINA DAVIS: We have came a long way since our first loss against Kentucky.
We've just grown, and you can tell from offense to defensively we've just
really grown as a team. We've been through a lot of games when we were down.
There were games we were up and we lost the lead. As you can see today, we had
a lead and we lost it, and then we had it again and we lost it again, but
finally we was just able to grow up and we matured and it's just showing every
day.  
MODERATOR: Okay, ladies, congratulations on a great season. Good luck in the
NCAAs.  
Questions for Coach Mulkey.  
  
Q. Kim, the shot selection all night, were you getting exactly what you
wanted?  
COACH MULKEY: I thought all but a few times when they made a run we were
taking quick shots. I thought what we did, and we've done a lot and we're
pretty good at it, is we share the basketball and we make sure we have ball
reversal. We're going to make people guard you for the entire shot clock. And
when we didn't and we missed shots, they would go down and make a shot or two,
but just patience offensively. I thought when they went to their 2-3 zone we
might have been too patient. I thought we rushed shots at the end because the
shot clock was winding down. But I thought we hit some big 3s against their
zone. I thought Alexis hit a big 3, I put Kristy Wallace in there and ran a
play for her and she hit a big 3.  
  
Q. Kim, in a conference as competitive as the Big 12, what does five
consecutive tournament championships mean?  
COACH MULKEY: I don't know. You tell me. It means we're pretty good. It means
that our name goes in a book. I don't know that anybody's ever done that, men
or women, in the Big 12, have they? I don't know, Wendell, help me here. It
means that women's basketball's bigtime at Baylor.  
(No microphone.)  
COACH MULKEY: There you go, well, he signs my paycheck, so get his quote. My
AD says we're a dynasty.  
  
Q. Nina only scored two in the second half. I don't know if that was
something their defense did, but the way that everybody else stepped up. Y'all
still scored 35 with her only scoring 2.  
COACH MULKEY: I thought Nina had some good looks. It's amazing to me how that
kid can get a shot off of these bigger players. How do they go in? How does
she get them off? How do you describe her? I would not have known that until I
saw the stat sheet, Jerry, that she only scored 2, but obviously she's not in
there just for her scoring. She's just a -- she's a player that just settles
us but we're not the Nina Davis show. We've got a lot of kids that have some
talent out there. You know, when you walk in a gym and you look at us, you
don't just go, wow, but when you sit and watch them play, you go that's the
way the game should be played, everybody touches the ball, everybody has a
role to play, everybody does it right. And what we lack is just being a great
defensive team all at the same time. Getting better. I thought we showed more
signs of being better today than we have in some games, but that will come
with time.  
  
Q. You've mentioned this team has surprised you, amazed you. Back last fall
what were you expecting from this group?  
COACH MULKEY: I don't know. I expected them to finish in the upper echelon of
the Big 12. I expected them to make the NCAA Tournament. I expected them to be
ranked, but I couldn't put a number on it because you had too many kids whose
roles were going to change, and I had to let them tell me by their play. You
tell me what's fair. And as they played and they played and they played, I
think they set their own parameters. I think they set their own identity and I
just couldn't -- it's a team I couldn't do that. I knew what I had in Nina, I
knew what I had in Niya, but everybody else's roles of everybody else's role
-- Sune, I knew, but the roles of everybody else, Imani and Prince, was she
going to be healthy, were any of the freshman going to help you. Sune started
the season hurt, Kristina Higgins starts 13 games, probably is our most
improved player. Yet late in the year, Sune takes over, that senior leadership
starts coming out in her. Then you have KK, who is just like a deer running in
the forest. We just had to put all of it together.  
I've played a lot of players, I've played a lot more players this year than I
ever have in 15 years because they're basically demanding that from me. They
want to play and they're doing things to get out on the floor. I thought the
Baylor fans were outstanding today. It's just so good when you walk in an
arena; not just at home, but when you go to a neutral site, and your Baylor
fans are dominant. Then I thought Sune, being a senior, she played like a
senior.  
  
Q. Following up on that, you said it wasn't the Nina Davis show but Sune's
play, particularly when she went out with two fouls, you guys were up 12. How
important was her being out and then the second half her not getting in foul
trouble at all and being able to play?  
COACH MULKEY: She's the one that has the most experience in the paint and
she's, as I've said many times, is super intelligent and what she can't do
physically, she gets to the spots because she anticipates. She is a big body
and when she's on that floor, we are so much better. And when she picked up
the second foul, I rotated about three post in there and gave all of them a
shot and I thought they did fine, I thought they did fine.  
  
Q. I was with you on February 11th when the NCAA came out with their pre-
seed list and Baylor kind of got snubbed. On that particular day you had the
No. 1 RPI in the country but you were left off their prospective No. 1 seed
line. Since then you've only lost one game, one more game, you've won your
conference championship and you won it as decisively as Tennessee lost their
conference championship. Could you make the case for No. 1 seed for Baylor,
please?  
COACH MULKEY: Well, I can always make the case, but I'm like a fine wine, I
get better with age. What difference does it make what I think? I have learned
that each year a committee is a group of individuals and it's their job to do
it regardless of how I feel. I've expressed myself many years on what I think
is right and wrong, and I guess I'm like a fine wine, I've just realized keep
your mouth shut, it doesn't do any good, it probably pisses them off.  
  
Q. You said yesterday that your expectation is to win these championships.
Does that take away from the excitement of doing it at all when you feel this
is how business is supposed to be?  
COACH MULKEY: I think it does for some people, I do. I visibly have seen it. I
think it does and it bothers me. It doesn't -- you have to remember that there
are a lot of kids in that locker room, this is their first. It's kind of like
having children, your first child comes into the world, man, we just -- we're
out of our mind. And then the second one comes along and the third one comes
along and we get a little bit, you know, lazier. I don't want to be around
people like that. I want everybody to be as excited today as they were the
very first one we won. And it's work to do it and we're doing our part in that
locker room and I want everybody around me to continue to do their part.  
  
Q. You just talked about that going into the season you didn't know what to
expect from this group, now you're headed to the tournament. What do you
expect from here on out?  
COACH MULKEY: I expect to host the first- and second-round games at Baylor, I
expect a great Baylor crowd, and let's see how far we can take this thing.  
  
Q. Coach, you've mentioned several times throughout this season how happy
you are with your team's effort. It kind of shows today out-rebounding a team
38-31 when they played two post players for most of the game. How proud are
you of their effort again especially on the rebounding end, but going forward
into the tournament?  
COACH MULKEY: I can list a dozen things to tell you how proud I am. We weren't
picked to win the league, we won it. Wow. You look at my team, I don't have
6-7 and 6-5 out there. We've got to figure out how to do the dirty work and
win. They do it, they buy into it. Everybody wants a shot at us. I think two
Texas players have been waiting for this, right? We're going to beat them
today and we wanted another shot at them. Well, be careful what you wish for.
So I can -- the list goes on and on and on. I thought it was great that I
substituted with a minute nineteen to go because I learned from two of the
best in the business to call off the dogs. I learned from Leon Barmore and I
learned from Pat Summit and I gave everybody an opportunity to play. So I
didn't like the game ended with them pressing with starters on the floor, but
that's her prerogative and that's her team to do that. Just proud of all of
them.  
  
Q. How log-jammed the conference finished and with all the teams above 500,
how many teams do you think should make the NCAAs from the Big 12, and any of
those bubble teams, which do you think deserves --  
COACH MULKEY: Well, I always believed the regular season is more important
than the tournament. Sixteen, 19, 18 games, an 18-game season means more than
coming and playing good for three days. That's why I've never understood why
we put so much emphasis on who wins the tournament and they get to get in.
Because they got hot for three days? I would start one through five, I would
take the first three that won, that puts TCU in because they were third in the
league, and then four and five, take those fives. And then if you want six,
take somebody who played well in the tournament and at the end of the year. I
don't put a big emphasis on the tournament being more important than what you
do over the long haul.  
MODERATOR: Okay, Coach. Thank you very much, congratulations.  
COACH MULKEY: Thank you.

_DALLAS, TEXAS_  
  

Baylor  75  
Texas - 64

  
MODERATOR: We're now joined by the University of Texas Longhorns coach, Karen
Aston; Celina Rodrigo and Imani McGee-Stafford. Coach, your thoughts about
this afternoon's game?  
COACH ASTON: First of all, I just want to say how proud of our basketball team
that I am. It was a long few week for us and I felt like we really needed to
show a sense of urgency within our team down the stretch of league play and
then obviously in this tournament, and I think that our team did that. I'm
very, very proud of them. Disappointed obviously that we didn't play better
tonight, but proud of our team and how they performed down the stretch of
league play and how they performed in this tournament.  
Baylor was more efficient tonight in every area. They shot the ball really
well from the perimeter, established themselves in the paint, and I just
didn't think our team could ever string along anything positive from a
standpoint of getting some stops, two or three stops in a row, and then
converting on the offensive end, we just couldn't get any confidence.
Obviously that had something to do with Baylor, but we were able to do that in
our two previous games in this tournament we just couldn't get that
accomplished tonight, but again congratulations to them. I think our team
represented the Big 12 really well and I'm looking forward to seeing how many
teams we get in the tournament this week.  
MODERATOR: Coach, thank you. We'll take questions for our student-athletes.  
  
Q. Celina, Coach kind of mentioned it there that Baylor just had some
stretches there where they went 9 for 12 or 8 for 12 from the field both
halves. How tough was it for you guys just to have to continue to answer that
offensively?  
CELINA RODRIGO: Like Coach said, they were shooting the ball really well so it
was tough for us to kind of make a push for the offensive end. We were
constantly taking the ball at the net. We kind of let our defense kind of
dictate our offense so it was just kind of tough for us in the second half.  
  
Q. Imani, you've been here for a while, you've seen Baylor a lot. Is this a
tougher Baylor team to defend because they don't have the one dominant star
like Odyssey and Brittany, they've got several players who can fill it up, so
to speak?  
IMANI McGEE-STAFFORD: I haven't beaten Baylor yet, so I'm not going to say
it's a better or a worse team. At the end of the day they put more points up,
we didn't do what we needed to do on the defensive end.  
  
Q. Celina, did you feel like with how Baylor shot the ball all season,
especially through the tournament, that y'all needed to be as close to perfect
on the offensive side of the floor to be able to keep pace?  
CELINA RODRIGO: I think we definitely just needed to answer them and we didn't
do that in the second half. They got one on the run and we just couldn't
answer it on the offensive end.  
  
Q. For both, start with Celina, despite the loss, you've won 7 out of 9. How
do you feel about going into the NCAAs where you are now?  
CELINA RODRIGO: I think we're all pretty confident. I think we did good. I'm
proud of us as a team, I think we played really well in all of our games, just
didn't come out with a win this last one, but I'm really proud of this and
we're going to build on this for going into the tournament.  
IMANI McGEE-STAFFORD: I kind of concur with what Celina said, this game is
frustrating because we obviously wanted a championship and we'll probably all
be dwelling on it this week and working hard to correct the errors we did
today, but hopefully the committee will see how hard we've been working and we
can get a good seed going into the tournament.  
  
Q. Imani, what makes Nina so hard to defend?  
IMANI McGEE-STAFFORD: She's a great player. She's improved a lot, and good for
her.  
  
Q. Both of you, we can start with Imani, what is in your head when you're
playing a game? You have the first five minutes, last five minutes, can you
describe in a good or bad game what goes through your head when you're making
plays on the court?  
IMANI McGEE-STAFFORD: I mean, today I was trying to focus on defense and they
got a lot of points in the paint and I consider that like my job so when I'm
not shutting down the paint I think it makes it harder for our entire team to
play defense so today just focusing on defense, and that's kind of always my
mindset, like rebound and defend well, and normally I score off getting
rebounds anyway so that works out.  
CELINA RODRIGO: Today my focus in my head was just getting some stops, string
along some stops and then make sure we're executing our offense, and we're
going to shot every time done.  
MODERATOR: Ladies, congratulations on a great season. We wish you the best in
the NCAAs. We'll take questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Is one of the tough things about Baylor that you kind of had to play
perfect? I know I remember one time there was just a pass that was maybe a
little bit careless, they tip it, get a run out, yet a couple times you go to
the line, shooting two free throws in the second half. You missed them. Is it
one of those things where the execution has got to be in the high 90
percentage to win?  
COACH ASTON: Well, I don't necessarily think it has to be that way, but I do
think you have to be efficient offensively. We didn't get to the foul line
very much and I thought that was significant compared to the last time that we
played them, I thought we got them in foul trouble. We were able to be a
little bit more aggressive offensively. They were in probably better position,
their defense was probably better today than it was the second time that we
played them. But you know, when they shoot the ball well from the perimeter,
they're tough to beat because they're obviously going to score some points in
the paint and they're going to rebound well, but when they're shooting pretty
well -- and there have been some games that they haven't shot well -- but when
they're shooting well, it's hard to beat them.  
  
Q. Coach, is Baylor tougher to game plan for because in previous years you
had the one dominant player, and it looked like there were five players out
there that could sink it at any time?  
COACH ASTON: Well, I don't necessarily think that they had one dominant
player. I think when Brittany played there was a whole lot of people that were
good on that team, if I remember correctly. And then last year obviously they
had Nina and Odyssey and Sune and Alexis, so they had those players before.
The team that Brittany was on, if we need to go back to that team, I doubt
anybody really necessarily needs to, but they were pretty good, they had a lot
of really good players on their team.  
  
Q. With how log-jammed the Big 12 finished and with how many teams finished
above .500, how many teams would you expect or would you think would make the
NCAA Tournament?  
COACH ASTON: I would think seven. I'll be really, really disappointed if six
do not get in, but I would hope for seven. I think the tournament was a really
good indicator of -- and the games down the stretch in our league was a
terrific indicator of the competitiveness of our league. Then the tournament
games were close. So I think that six will get in, that's my assumption, and I
would like to think that we have a chance for seven, and I hope that we do
because I think that we'll surprise some people from a national perspective
when we get in.  
  
Q. Coach, it was 28 in the first half, Agbuke got her second foul, they sat
her down. From there, you obviously cut it down to two. Second half, she
pretty much stayed out of foul trouble. How key is her to that, particularly
playing against your team?  
COACH ASTON: Well, I think she does obviously provide a presence for them
against our big girls and like I said, just a few minutes ago, I do think that
we were not able to get on the foul line tonight and that was one of our
goals, was to get to the foul line. The two things that we didn't do well at
all besides defensively, we weren't really very good, but in the two
categories that we really try to win in games are free throw attempts and
offensive rebounds and they beat us in both of those categories. Those are
areas we try to be successful at.  
  
Q. You mentioned earlier how proud you are of this team and how they played
with such a sense of urgency. What does it say to you when you hear your
players talk about they're proud, but this is going to dwell on them for a
while and they know that they can do better and they know that they've got
more to do to get to the NCAA Tournament.  
COACH ASTON: Well, I think they're disappointed. What I didn't want to do was
go in the locker room and everybody fall apart, because there's a lot of games
to play. I want them to be disappointed. This is not what we came here to do,
is lose. But I want them to feel proud of the fact that they reset. We had
some adversity going this year and for them to -- and as I told them in the
locker room, I think there were a lot of people that thought we were done a
few weeks ago and for them to rally the way that they have and reset their
brains and really focus on what the task was every single day and every game
we played is a testament to the fact that they wanted to achieve some things.
So I want them to be able to push the reset button after a few days off and
rest their bodies and their minds but get ready for the tournament. The
tournament's all about matchups, and I think we really helped ourselves from a
seeding perspective this weekend.  
  
Q. You talked about it a little bit, but Nina Davis, you held her to two
points in the second half but is the key on Baylor maybe not letting that
third, fourth, fifth option beat you?  
COACH ASTON: Well, I think the hard part is how well they penetrate and how
good of decisions that Niya Johnson makes. As good as Nina Davis is, I have
said this for a good month, that I think Niya is really the key to their team
and because her decision making is just so good against the zone, against man,
she gets the ball to the right people at the right time and she creates really
easy shots for her teammates. So as much as -- that's great that we held Nina
under 30, but they made shots. They made a lot of tough jump shots, some in
the first half, I thought our defense was a little bit slow reacting. In the
second half, I thought we contested some shots and they were tough, they made
some tough shots.  
MODERATOR: Any further for Coach? Okay, Coach, congratulations on a great
season, good luck in the NCAAs.

_DALLAS, TEXAS_  
  

Baylor  69  
Oklahoma State - 52

  
MODERATOR: We're now joined by Oklahoma State university coach Jim Littell,
Roshunda Johnson and Brittney Martin.  
COACH LITTELL: Baylor's very talented. Their length and athleticism affected a
lot of things that we did tonight offensively. We probably needed to be in a
situation where we play close to a perfect game and I don't think we did that.
But you've got to credit Baylor. Nina Davis is a very, very tough matchup for
us and she shows why she's the best player in the league tonight. Just
outstanding the things that she can do athletically set her apart from a lot
of people. Conventional thinking says that when you couldn't guard them in
man, you go to zone and we did that. She's probably more effective against the
zone than she is against the man.  
Just a tough matchup for us, didn't hit some shots that we feel like we
normally do. And also against Baylor you've got to get a lot of 50-50 balls
and it seemed like they got a lot of those 50-50 balls, especially in the
first half. But we have got to regroup and get ready for the NCAA Tournament
now.  
MODERATOR: We'll take some questions for our student-athletes.  
  
Q. Brittney, what happened between the first half and second half for you
offensively?  
BRITTNEY MARTIN: In the first half my shots weren't falling. I couldn't really
do much about that. I kind of just had to play hard on defense and hope it
kind of helped me on my offensive end. And in the second half my shots started
falling, so I think that's the only thing that changed.  
  
Q. Questions for both players, Brittney first. Coach talked a little bit
about it, but Baylor, what does Baylor do on defense that creates so much
disruption for you guys?  
BRITTNEY MARTIN: I think the main thing is they're just incredibly long,
they're all fast, they're all athletes. So I think it kind of, I can't say
we're not used to it but it's a lot more pressure on because they're longer
than us, we have to make better cuts to get open, we can't just stand to get
open so we have to do a lot more things to get open than just standing and we
have to help each other screen and things like that. They're just long so we
have to adjust our game to that.  
ROSHUNDA JOHNSON: I agree with her, and basically they just sped us up during
the game and second half we just needed to calm down.  
MODERATOR: Okay, ladies. Good luck in the NCAAs. Questions for coach?  
  
Q. Jim, I asked you this yesterday and you referenced it there at the end,
the NCAA Tournament. Do you feel like you're in?  
COACH LITTELL: You know, all I can go by is what's occurred in the past. I've
been in this league 10 years either as an assistant or head coach and 9-9 has
gotten in every year. We're the No. 1 RPI conference in the country and if you
believe any of the projections, yeah, I do. I think we built our resume, we
beat a lot of good teams. And to win nine games (no audio) Texas, TCU with
Iowa State with nine wins and we get nine wins, I think we are, but we won't
know until Monday, the following Monday.  
  
Q. Coach, what are your thoughts on the team's effort in the final minutes
in the game? Do you think you can build on that going into the tournament?  
COACH LITTELL: I thought we played harder. It's a difficult (no audio)
stretches and we had some scoring droughts and it's hard to keep up your
intensity on the defensive end. It's a difficult game to play when you're not
making shots. I thought we continued to play hard. Our turnover number wasn't
very high. Our rebounds were okay as far as that goes. I think you could just
look at the shot totals that we didn't make shots and that was the difference
in the game. I'm not going to question our kids' effort or our attitude, it's
just a hard game to play when the ball isn't going in. And credit Baylor on
that, they do a great job defensively. This game favors the teams that get the
most easy baskets and Baylor doesn't give up easy baskets.  
  
Q. The last couple years since they split the men's and women's Big 12
tournaments, you guys have to wait the extra time to find out if you're in for
the selection show. Does that make it tough when you're not 100 percent sure
to spend the next week-plus wondering?  
COACH LITTELL: Oh, yeah, there's anxiety involved in that. I think you just
proceed like you're going to be playing and I think it's a time this time of
year that we'll give days off and let people get healed up, let people get
rested both mentally and physically and get ready for the tournament. We're
proceeding forward like we are in the tournament. I don't think there's any
other way that you can do that, but we need to give some days off. We've had a
lot of players, especially our starters, log a lot of minutes. I saw some
quotes from somebody, I don't remember who it was, on rest versus repetition.
I think this is the time of year you probably need to get some rest.  
  
Q. Jim, Baylor, we talked about this is their fifth straight championship
game they're going to, they won the regular season title five years in a row,
but talk about the transition you've seen Kim make for that team. She had
Brittney for so long and she had Brittney and Odyssey, neither one of those
girls are still there, but now look where they're at and look what they're
doing.  
COACH LITTELL: Well, it's a very, very athletic team, it's a team that's got a
lot of weapons. I think this is her deepest team. There isn't -- yeah, there
is a star. There is a star, you know. You maybe think there isn't with
Brittney Griner gone or Odyssey Sims, but Nina Davis is a star. She's just a
tough matchup for a lot of people. They still have the star, but I think
they're deeper. What about Baylor is kind of a hidden mystery to some people,
it's not a mystery to anybody who knows the game, it's how good Niya Johnson
is. I told her at the end of the game I think she's one of the premiere point
guards in the country about decision making, getting the ball where it needs
to be, not turning it over. Baylor gets a good shot at the basket every time
down and it's because of Niya Johnson. Kim can coach defense, she can coach
rebounding, and when you do those two things you're going to successful and
that's always been a trademark of Baylor basketball.  
  
Q. Last night we had the time change, they lost an hour of sleep. Do you
think that had any impact on them and did you do anything different as far as
coaching them on what to do with the hour less?  
COACH LITTELL: No, we didn't do anything different. We didn't get up this
morning and do the early shoot-around. I talked about playing our players a
lot of minutes and I didn't think that that would be the positive thing to do.
So we had a court taped down in the banquet room and we went through what we
needed to go through today. But it didn't seem to affect Baylor very much,
that extra hour that they lost. I don't think it was a factor in the game.  
MODERATOR: Any more questions for coach? Coach, thank you very much.
Congratulations on your season and good luck in the NCAA.  
COACH LITTELL: Thank you.

_DALLAS, TEXAS_  
  

Baylor  69  
Oklahoma State - 52

  
MODERATOR: Coach, congratulations. I'm going to give you the opportunity.
You're going to pass? We'll go straight to the questions for the student-
athletes.  
  
Q. Nina, just talk about the way you guys got off to a good start and was
able to maintain it today.  
NINA DAVIS: It was very important for us to get off to a good start. We pretty
much came out like we did yesterday. We had a quick start and we got an early
lead but I'm just proud of the way that we kept the lead this time, we didn't
let them come back in. We kept playing hard for the first and second half and
we maintained the lead today.  
  
Q. Nina, it just looked like Alexis made a couple shots early. How much does
her being able to do stuff like that just kind of loosen things up for you
inside?  
NINA DAVIS: It loosened things a lot, because on the paint when you have don't
have no one on the perimeter they can shoot the ball, they kind of like pack
it in, but we have great perimeter players and when Alexis is on, she's on,
and she kind of opened things up for me. And I'm proud of the way she played
today.  
  
Q. Nina, how much will that help you, if any, tomorrow that you got to kind
of sit the last 12, 13 minutes? Several of you guys got to sit and kind of
rest the last several minutes of the game?  
NINA DAVIS: That will help a lot. You know, at this part of the season we
played a lot of games, it's been a long season so any type of rest that you
can get is always great.  
  
Q. Nina, just talk about the defense, holding them to 29 percent in the
first half, driving rebounds, taking charges, stealing the basketball, I mean,
just a complete game overall.  
NINA DAVIS: It was. We played a lot of energy today. We had a lot of fire, we
had a lot of emphasis on playing defense today and that was something that
hurt us yesterday and we had the big lead and they kind of came back. It was
definitely our defense and being a young team, but today we definitely
improved on our end, and I'm just glad.  
  
Q. Alexis, what kind of confidence did you get from ending the shots early,
and what do you feel about your offensive game right now?  
ALEXIS PRINCE: It gave me a lot of confidence to keep shooting. Every time the
first couple go in, it just gives you a lot of confidence and I just wanted to
give a spark to the team since I wasn't able to do that yesterday because of
foul trouble.  
  
Q. Nina and Alexis, just talk about playing for Baylor's fifth straight Big
12 conference tournament title and just what it means to kind of keep that
streak going.  
NINA DAVIS: It means a lot, it's amazing the dynasty they have built here, the
tradition they have. Don't want to be the team to end it, so we're just going
to come out tomorrow and give our all and try to make it the fifth year in a
row.  
ALEXIS PRINCE: Like Nina said, we don't want to be the team that doesn't do it
so we just want to carry on what they started.  
  
Q. Alexis, we've talked a lot about how when you have gotten off to good
starts, and kind of let teams in. Was that an emphasis today, to make sure you
kept the foot on the throttle and didn't allow them to get back in the game?  
ALEXIS PRINCE: Yeah, we just tried to play hard every possession and not get
comfortable with the lead and just come out and play hard.  
  
Q. For both players, Nina first, with your resume what you guys have done
this year, do you think you deserve a 1 seed?  
NINA DAVIS: We've had a great season but -- we had a great season but seeding
doesn't matter whether it's 1 seed or 2 or 3, or even a 4 seed, it really
doesn't matter, you just have to come out with a mindset that you can beat on
any day. And whatever seed we are, we're going to take it and we're going to
run with it.  
ALEXIS PRINCE: Yeah, 1 seed would be nice, but whatever the committee decides,
that's what we'll be happy with.  
MODERATOR: We'll take questions for coach.  
  
Q. Kim, was this kind of a perfect situation for you? You get off to a great
start, kind of never let them back in the game and get to rest a lot of people
for tomorrow?  
COACH MULKEY: I don't know about a perfect situation but it sure is better
than having to play all the starters 40 minutes or even go into an overtime. I
don't know that any of us could anticipate this happening but, yeah, it's good
because three days in a row, it allowed us to get some rest.  
  
Q. Kim, their post player got off to a good start, looked like you kind of
adjusted, maybe use of one of the guards to double down a little bit?  
COACH MULKEY: Yes, game plan was for Niya to help at every position and let
Patton shoot whatever she wanted. Just thought it was really disruptive. And
then when I took Niya out, Kristy was our point guard, guarding her, and just
told Kristy, let her shoot it and you help at every position and I just
thought the scouting report was very good.  
  
Q. Kim, Steven asked your players about the streak being a championship
game, but does this team have a little different vibe or a little different
feeling around it than maybe teams you've had in the past that reached the
championship game?  
COACH MULKEY: I don't really know, they're so quiet. I don't really know if
their vibe is any different. I know they're as competitive as the other teams.
They may not be as experienced and certainly they're not as mature and they're
not older; they're younger but I don't know that their vibe is any different.
They made it this far, let's go win it.  
  
Q. Coach, I know you talked yesterday about you didn't like the way your
defense didn't respond. I know the last several minutes of the game today you
had kind of a different lineup in there, but are you pleased with the way they
maintained it throughout compared to yesterday?  
COACH MULKEY: Well, you know, I hope y'all are pleased. It seems to be
bothering y'all, it doesn't bother me. I know what their weaknesses are, I
know how young they are. Just the mere fact that this young bunch is getting a
25 and 30 point lead amazes me. And what is happening, as I said yesterday, is
that they just lose focus. They're not all five zeroed in on defense at the
same time and I thought today they were zeroed in, but Niya Johnson had a lot
to do with that because she was helping. Then when we were able to put them on
the bench and rest them, I thought the second group, they hadn't played that
many minutes for that period of time and I thought they got fatigued a little
bit and they allowed it to go from, I don't know what we were up, 28,
whatever, 30, to 17. But they got to play and that's all that matters and we
got to rest and we won. And those problems, Shawn, on the defensive end are
not going to be fixed overnight. You've got to just -- it's repetition and
practice, it's experienced playing. By the time those kids are juniors and
seniors, they'll be better defensively collectively as a unit.  
  
Q. Just talk about how this team has matured from nonconference, conference
and every game seems like a little bit more momentum and this team just keeps
maturing more and more.  
COACH MULKEY: They do in some areas. I think we are better defensively than we
were when the season started but we're not anywhere near where we have to be
to really contend for a Final Four or National Championship. There's just so
much physical play involved, and we lose rebounds. You've got to be able to
defend one-on-one in some situations, and if you can't, you've got to be very
good help-side, and sometimes we don't do that, we don't communicate. Maybe we
have too much faith in a teammate instead of saying I've got your back and I'm
going to help you.  
  
Q. Coach, I know that winning another Big 12 tournament championship is a
big deal and it would be a big deal to you guys, but you have talked about
going to final fours and winning national championships on a regular basis is
kind of the big focus, so knowing you're in line to play for another one,
regardless of the outcome tomorrow, you guys are going to the tournament. What
is the significance of playing for it again tomorrow and possibly winning
it?  
COACH MULKEY: Well, the significance is there aren't many people who ever win
one, and to think how many we've won in a row, this isn't my first rodeo, but
I'm really not that old, okay? I'm really not. I might look older, but I'm
really not. So when I get too old to see that scoreboard, then I'll retire.
But as long as I can see that scoreboard, and as long as I've got a
competitive juice in my body, I want to coach kids that want to win
championships. I wasn't hired at Baylor to win games; that era of basketball,
that era of sports at Baylor is over. You're there now as a coach, you're
there now as a player to win championships, and you have to maintain it.
That's the hard part. It's just so difficult to maintain it. I think it's more
difficult to maintain it than it is to win your first one.  
  
Q. Coach, I know you don't know who you're playing next, it will either be
Texas or Oklahoma, both those teams last time you played them, pretty tough
games. What do you expect from either one of them, whoever you play tomorrow,
tomorrow in the championship?  
COACH MULKEY: I expect a tough game, I expect them to bring their best, I
expect Texas to probably play a man-to-man. I expect Oklahoma to mix it up a
little bit with their one-three-one and maybe a diamond or something, but not
much of it. I think sagging man-to-man, I think two well-coached teams, two
teams that would sure like to knock us off that perch. We'll give it our best
shot with the understanding that, as Shawn said, we're moving on and hopefully
we can win it, but if not, we're going to get on that bus, give them a few
days off, I'm going to see Kramer play at Ole Miss at Baton Rouge this
weekend, come back, selection show and get ready to play.  
  
Q. Players talk all the time about when they go up against another great
player, it really gets their juices flowing. You might potentially play Sherri
a third time this year. I wonder if the same applies for coaches.  
COACH MULKEY: No, not for me. I don't shoot it, I don't pass it, I don't
dribble it. It's just another game. Your adrenaline might get a little bit
higher if you're playing for a national championship, that's about the only
time I can say that I really kind of get really excited and wish I was a
player again, but no, I don't have a coach that I have a fear of, I don't have
a coach that I don't respect. Just prepare your team and let those kids go out
there and decide it.  
  
Q. Kim, this is the No. 1 RPI conference and you're the No. 1 team in the
regular season and could be again tomorrow. Does it matter to you from a
national perspective if you're a 1 seed or not?  
COACH MULKEY: No, it doesn't matter. We've won a National Championship not
being a 1 seed and we've won it being a 1 seed. It really doesn't matter. I
like that we're going back to the home arenas first and second rounds. I never
wanted to leave that. I think it was an embarrassment to women's basketball to
turn on television sets and there's nobody in the stands at some of these
places where they tried to go to neutral sites. We're not there. I don't know
that we'll ever be there. Our game is different than the men's game. And I
like that when you turn on a television for the NCAA playoffs, you're going to
see people in the stands, or at least you will at Baylor. I can't speak for
other places.  
  
Q. I want to talk to you about your career because I watched you when you
first came down here when you were down the road at the Reunion Arena, and you
were going against Texas and Texas Tech about the I am fact and women's
basketball and with Baylor about how the game's changed over the years since
you've been doing this now?  
COACH MULKEY: Yes, I can tell you, I'll never forget walking into Texas Tech
arena my first year at Baylor and the place sold out. I just thought oh, my
God, I hope to live to see the day that we have a crowd that's bigger than
that one little section that cheers for free pizza every night. Went to Iowa
State, I don't know that I had ever been to Ames, Iowa in my life, that's the
coldest place. When I got off that plane, I thought I guess they do sell out,
what else are you going to do in the snow, but they love their women's
basketball. You look at places like that, and you envision what you want your
program to become and you demand things, and you keep everybody sharp and you
don't settle for mediocrity. And you beat the bushes and you find players that
are willing to take a chance on you as a coach. And that's what we did and
that's what we will continue to do. I have to tell you about my staff. Bill
and Jim and Johnny have been with me from day one, and I'm probably not the
easiest coach to play for but I think Bill Brock said it best. You may be the
only woman I could ever work for. And I take that as a compliment. Not many
men would express that. And Bill just said yes, I'll step away from my head
job at Grayson because you're the only woman that really I could work for.

_DALLAS, TEXAS_  
  

Texas - 59  
Oklahoma - 46

  
MODERATOR: We're now joined by the Oklahoma Sooners coach Sherri Coale and
student-athletes Kaylon Williams and Peyton Little.  
Coach, your thoughts about the game.  
COACH COALE: Well, I'll start by congratulating Texas, and I apologize for my
voice, I've been sick. I thought Texas played really hungry. I thought they
were very aggressive, very physical, and they really played like they wanted
to be in the championship game and I thought we played bad basketball for 40
minutes. It was just bad basketball. We didn't execute, we go 15 of 58 from
the field, and we just -- you've got to score points to win basketball games,
you've got to put the ball in the basket.  
MODERATOR: Questions for our student-athletes.  
  
Q. For both players, start with Kaylon. There were a couple moments about
the 10-minute mark of both halves where they went on a pretty sizeable run,
first to take the lead and in the second half to put some distance between you
guys. Can you sort of diagnose what happened on those two runs?  
KAYLON WILLIAMS: Well, like Coach said, we had to score and we went on a long
stretch in the first half where we didn't score any baskets and it hurt us
because we didn't score. And Texas, they executed and they went and scored on
their end, so it was kind of hard trying to bounce back from that. And in the
second half it repeated itself and they found an area where they could stick
their foot down on us and take that chance to put that gap in between the
score.  
PEYTON LITTLE: Texas just looked like they wanted it more than we did. We
never really connected the whole game, the whole 40 minutes we just couldn't
get connected, and obviously you've got to make shots to win games and we
didn't do that tonight.  
  
Q. Again for both players, Peyton first, was it anything specific that Texas
was doing from a defensive standpoint? I know they had a big height advantage.
Expand on that, what were they doing?  
PEYTON LITTLE: I don't think it was anything Texas was doing necessarily, it
was what we were doing to ourselves. We weren't moving the ball on offense, we
weren't doing what we have to do in order to win games. We just didn't do what
we're supposed to do.  
  
Q. I guess for both players, I'll give it to Kaylon first. Their bigs,
McGee-Stafford and Lang, just seemed to shut down the lane and though the ball
might come in there, good stuff didn't happen and that seemed to put pressure
on the perimeter, one had to be pushed back out. Did it start with their
height advantage inside?  
KAYLON WILLIAMS: I think Texas used their size advantage to help them. They
did go big at one point where they had Kelsey Lang and Stafford in at the same
time and they went into a high-low and we tried to play inside-out, but like
Peyton said, we got stagnant and we really weren't connected on the offensive
end and we really didn't put the ball in the basket to try and help us to
generate things that we could get on defense to go back on offense.  
PEYTON LITTLE: I think whenever they did go with the two bigs, we let that
affect us a little bit, and give credit to them, they were good tonight.  
  
Q. Peyton, a minute ago you said you guys just weren't connected today. What
do you attribute that to?  
PEYTON LITTLE: Just being not in the moment, not being totally engaged in
every possession. When it comes to this point in the season, every possession
matters and we can't take possessions for granted.  
MODERATOR: Anything further for our student-athletes? Good luck the rest of
the way in the NCAAs. Take questions for Coach as long as she can talk, and if
she can't talk we'll let her go.  
  
Q. Coach, specifically the Texas defense, I know you faced each other three
times and Karen thinks the familiarity with both teams is one reason the
defense is better than the offense at this point. Were they doing anything
specific to nullify the shots?  
COACH COALE: I thought we probably tried to go inside a little too long. We
really thought we could attack inside and thought maybe we could draw some
fouls and we didn't have any success with that. Got really stagnant on the
perimeter when the ball did go inside, and we kept talking about cutting and
moving without the ball and there was a little, maybe a three-minute span in
the second half during which we took the lead when the ball went inside and
came back out and we had movement on the opposite side of the floor, on the
weak side of the floor, and that's how you have to play. And we missed a few
shots and quit doing that. And when you think, you know, when Jason asked what
do you attribute that to, kind of like a boxer getting hit in the jaw and
getting stunned for a little bit and forgetting what his strategy is. That
seemed to happen to us, whether it was a foul that didn't get called or a shot
that didn't go in or things of our own doing mostly and we let it get in the
way of what we knew we had to do to be successful.  
  
Q. Just want to get your take on you've seen Texas at three different points
in the year and obviously they've even acknowledged it's been kind of a
rollercoaster season for them. What was your takeaway of Texas today? Do they
look like a different team than the first two times you played them?  
COACH COALE: Well, they go 50 percent from three, I don't think they do that
every night. So yeah, I mean, I thought they played really hard together and
used their size extremely well. When those guards are knocking down threes,
you've got your hands full because you've got to kind of roll the dice
somewhere.  
MODERATOR: Anybody got an important question for Coach because I'm going to
let her go.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

### [Karen Aston](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24311)

### [Krystle Henderson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28429)

### [Brianna Taylor](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28430)

  
_DALLAS, TEXAS_  
  

Texas  59  
Oklahoma - 46

  
MODERATOR: Joined by the University of Texas Longhorns coach, Karen Aston;
Brianna Taylor and Krystle Henderson.  
Coach, congratulations on the win. What do you think about this afternoon's
game?  
COACH ASTON: Well, it was obviously a bit of an ugly game offensively for both
teams, but we know each other so well, and very, very familiar, play similar
styles, so I anticipated it being a little bit ugly and it was. But we got off
to a slow start and really have to give a lot of credit to our players that
they didn't get down on themselves, they've really matured this year with that
in a sense that they've not let their offensive woes sometimes get to them
defensively, which is much better than we were a month or so ago. But a lot of
contributions from a lot of players but I would say that this was just a team
effort defensively. A lot of players made some plays for us, but I thought the
difference in the game was our team defense.  
MODERATOR: Okay. Questions for our student-athletes first.  
  
Q. Krystle, you went into the ballgame with about six minutes to go and you
quickly hit a couple 3s. When you went in, what did you think your role was
when you went in?  
KRYSTLE HENDERSON: Well, I feel like my role is whatever my team needs it to
be. I just try to come in and give the team energy, and I was open for the
shots and I just took them without hesitation.  
  
Q. At the beginning of the season everybody thought you might be in this
position playing for the tournament championship, then midway through the
season nobody thought you would be here. Just talk about the journey that you
guys have taken and maybe what you guys have learned along the way.  
BRIANNA TAYLOR: Well, the journey has been tough, but we overcame the
adversity that was put upon us, and I think that's what it's all about.
Basketball is a game of up and downs and it's how you handle it, so I think
that we're handling it pretty well now. We're starting to become more of
ourselves and we're getting back to playing defense so everything is working
out well.  
  
Q. Brianna, OU didn't score a field goal for about the last 10 minutes of
the first half except for the three at the very end. What specifically
defensively were you doing to create problems for the Sooners?  
BRIANNA TAYLOR: I just wanted to be active. Of course I didn't want them to
score, so we started playing more team defense, we started helping each other
more, relying on our help, so that came together and our defense's just solid.  
  
Q. For Krystle, Coach talked about it was kind of an ugly game but will you
take winning ugly, especially with the defensive effort, things you had to do
out there?  
KRYSTLE HENDERSON: Of course, you always want to win. It was an ugly game but
Coach told us going into the game it wasn't going to be pretty, so we just
hung in there and stayed solid as a team and got the win.  
  
Q. Krystle, you went to Skyline High School nearby. Were you extra motivated
by playing in Dallas and how many people did you have here?  
KRYSTLE HENDERSON: Well, it's always fun to play in your hometown so I was
pretty happy about coming back home to Dallas. I knew we had to get a win. I'm
more excited about being in the championship game, and bringing a win home to
Austin, so that's exciting for me as well. I probably had about 20, 30 people
in the stands, a lot of family, friends.  
  
Q. Both players. Brianna first, playing Baylor now for a third time, how do
you see that matchup?  
BRIANNA TAYLOR: Well, I think third time's a charm, so we're going to get
them, we're going to beat them. That's my mindset.  
  
Q. Krystle?  
KRYSTLE HENDERSON: Sorry. I think we match up pretty well with them. It's
going to be a good game, a fun game, and we've been waiting for this chance so
we're going to redeem ourselves, like Brianna said. That's our mantra extra
going into the game, we are just going to do what we do as a team and just
focus on us and everything else will take care of itself.  
MODERATOR: Anything else for our student-athletes? We'll now take questions
for Coach Aston.  
  
Q. Coach, it seemed like you talked about a team defense but it seemed like
it began inside with laying in Imani Stafford. I guess, expound upon when a
team can do nothing in the lane what that does to them everywhere else?  
COACH ASTON: It makes a huge difference. We were able to get out on their
shooters, run them off of the 3-point line because we do have those two, and I
spoke about that in the locker room, as much as I thought some of our guards
hit some big shots and made some big plays, I really thought that the interior
defense and the interior play, period, was probably the difference in the
game. I thought we were more solid than we have been at times against Oklahoma
on the inside. Again, we're both so knowledgeable of each other's sets and
what we do that I think we paid a little more attention to detail this time. I
thought Imani played really terrific.  
  
Q. You mentioned the defense, and when you hold a team down to a long period
of time with no shots, that's really impressive. Do you see these grinder-type
games not much offensive flow but a lot of defense as you move forward, and
what do you think about facing Baylor again?  
COACH ASTON: Well, I think it could be potentially one of those kind of games
also because we mirror each other quite a bit also from a personnel
perspective. I think they're really good. I mean, our players are confident
and I love their -- the way they spoke just a few minutes ago. But Baylor
wears the crown right now so we're going to have to really show up and play
tomorrow and have our best, absolute best effort because of how solid they
are. They have a lot of balance, they can score from the outside, obviously we
know about their inside game. So it's difficult to guard them because there is
quite a bit of balance with their team. It will be competitive and we will
have to bring our most competitive nature that we own.  
  
Q. Coach, the game was still in the balance and you put Krystle in with
about six minutes to go. Do you remember thinking why you put her in at the
time? Was it hit a couple 3s like that?  
COACH ASTON: That was it. I put her in because Celina had been playing an
extended amount of minutes and I thought at that time I needed to give Celina
maybe a minute or two blow so that she could finish the game because the one
thing we know about Celina is she knows how to finish a game, she knows what
we expect, she knows where to get the ball, and I thought she was really great
from a floor perspective tonight. But we did want to give her a break so I
went with experience because I thought the freshmen looked a little rattled
today so I decided to go with the ones that have kind of been there and done
this before and Krystle made that move look pretty good.  
  
Q. I know it's almost become a little bit of a running theme here, but the
roller coaster your season's been on, but it looks like it's taken another
turn here, you're on a hot streak right now, you're playing for the Big 12
Championship against Baylor. Just talk about everything this team's gone
through and especially what you're seeing from them now.  
COACH ASTON: I thought it turned a few weeks ago. We still had some bumps, but
I did think that their enthusiasm and their willingness to kind of put their
selves aside and become more of a team was created a few weeks ago.  
I think Kelsey mentioned this last night, it's tournament time, they got down
the stretch of conference play and realized we had better kick this thing in
gear. I thought that they did, I thought the leadership's gotten better and I
thought we had balanced off a little bit a couple weeks ago and gotten off the
roller coaster. Quite honestly, most of that's got to do with the fact that
now we have played a few weeks without an injury and we've settled on a group
of people that they can figure out what their roles are, we can have some
rotation in the games and the substitution rotation's gotten pretty solid. So
we've gone enough period of time where they feel comfortable with who they are
and what their identity needs to be.  
  
Q. Coach, you had to play your starters all the way to the end. Baylor got
to rest theirs for the last 10 or so minutes. Playing a third game in three
days, is that a significant difference?  
COACH ASTON: You would think that it would be, from the outside looking in,
but our players are excited. I mean, I don't think they've been in a
tournament championship in the Big 12 in a while. They've won, what, seven out
of their eight last games, so I do think they're really excited, I think
they'll have a high energy level and we still have some people that can come
off the bench and help us. I mean, our freshmen didn't play well tonight and
they're good players, so the one thing we can look at is they should have some
energy tomorrow and we do have some other players that can come off the bench,
so we'll give our best effort, promise you that.  
  
Q. Your bench was -- made significant contributions today, I think 32
points. Talk about that contribution.  
COACH ASTON: Well, it's been significant, probably our last four games because
of sort of what happened with the injury to Empress. She missed a couple of
conference games so she was removed from the starting lineup basically because
of the injury. So now we have Empress coming off the bench, who has been a
three-year starter, and we had been going big for a while with Imani and
Kelsey and we made the decision to bring Imani off the bench also. So you're
talking about two players that are solid, experienced players that are coming
off the bench. So probably two weeks ago or so you would have noticed that our
bench contributions have picked up considerably. You can't start but five and
those two have accepted their roles, and they're really the difference in our
team right now. And you have Celina and Krystle coming off the bench, so our
bench is strong.  
MODERATOR: Okay, Coach, congratulations on the win, we'll see you tomorrow
evening.

## March 7, 2015

  

### [Jeff Mittie](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13840)

### [Haley Texada](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24862)

  
_DALLAS, TEXAS_  
  

Baylor  82  
Kansas State - 70

  
COACH MITTIE: Well, I thought we played pretty solid in the second half, made
a really good push, really proud of our group for the push they made. We just
couldn't run it all the way back. And Baylor's obviously a very, very talented
team. For us, the inability to keep them off the free throw line was
problematic all day long. Davis was -- she was a problem all day long. We just
could not rotate to her in the zone, we couldn't keep her off the free throw
line. She's just a very, very talented player and they do an excellent job of
finding her and she does an excellent job of finding the gaps in the zone. But
I thought our group played real hard, I thought our group played at a
championship level, I thought our group played at a post season level and
that's what we've been striving for all year is to play at that level and real
proud of our group for doing that.  
  
Q. Haley, down 20, what do you guys do to rally the troops and kind of get
things going?  
HALEY TEXADA: Well, the main goal is just to keep playing hard. I mean, when
you're down by 20, I know for a lot of teams it's easy to just kind of fade
out the game and get a little bit funked up in the head, but just got to keep
playing hard and I think that's what we did and that's why we were able to
come back in and close that gap a little bit, but just don't give up.  
  
Q. Haley, did you find maybe more openings for shots? I know you started
heating up from the three-point line. Was it a little more open in the second
half, did their defense kind of sag a little bit or did you find some ways to
get better open looks?  
HALEY TEXADA: I would say just going hard. I mean, in the first half we had
it, we just kind of beat ourselves on some plays and made bad turnovers,
including myself, but second half we slowed down and found the openings and we
were able to get some good looks.  
  
Q. You guys had 19 turnovers, they had 15 steals. Obviously Baylor has quick
hands and they're very fast. How do you approach that when you're playing --
what do you do to try to cut down those turnovers?  
HALEY TEXADA: Like I said, the beginning is where we kind of got a lot of our
turnovers just in that first half of the game. Like I said, when we slowed
down and played our game, we reduced it by quite a few. You know, with them
you've just got to play smart and also fast, but play smart as well and make
the right passes so they can't get run-outs.  
  
Q. Jeff, the first half, I kept looking up and watching the game and
thinking Kansas State's not playing bad and then I look at the scoreboard and
you're down 16, 17. Did you feel the same way?  
COACH MITTIE: Well, I think, yeah, I didn't quite feel the same way. No, I did
not share in -- our problems were the turnovers. The pace of play was
problematic for us in our decision making and I thought we were stagnant with
the ball at times, which was -- you talked about the 3s. We took a lot of 3s
in the first half that were one-on-one type 3s that were just bad 3s. Second
half we were able to move the ball better, we were able to make better
decisions and consequently we got better looks at the basket. I thought our
group played well together in the second half. I thought in the first half we
were very individual and tried too much one-on-one. We weren't shooting the
ball -- we don't shoot the ball great, so when you take a look statistically
at us, this isn't too bad for us. The fun begins when it goes towards the rim.  
  
Q. Coach, you talked about your turnovers. Was that them getting in the
passing lanes or did you feel like some of that was just sloppy play?  
COACH MITTIE: Well, a little of both. Let's give them credit, their length --
I'll give you an example. Wesemann had some turnovers that were just, you've
got to throw below them. She's a 5-7 guard, she's trying to throw over Imani
Wright. That's not going to happen. That's not a good play by us. You're
playing into their strengths. We had two or three openings early where she
just made the wrong decision. We also felt like our guards were standing and
watching the dribble a lot and that plays into their length as well. So I do
think they do a great job with how they play. They try to keep that length all
inside and you've got to hit shots against them. But I get back to this, I
would have liked to have had seven or eight more possessions in the first half
and instead of being down 16, maybe we were down 8 or 9 and maybe that would
have been more manageable. But they do a good job, there's no doubt. They're
tough to score inside on so they force you to hit jumpers, and first half we
didn't react to that very well.  
  
Q. Speaking of inside, I thought Jessica Sheble gave you quite a bit at
first half when Breanna got in foul trouble. Thought a little bit about her
playing and she seemed to almost keep you in it at some point.  
COACH MITTIE: She's had a good stretch here the last two, three weeks of the
season. You're right, she's really given us a lift off the bench and today she
gave us a lift with the 4 for 4 from the free throw line because she didn't
just get easy stuff, she got fouled and had to convert from the line and we
came away with solid possessions. But you're right, she did keep us in it.
Both had foul trouble. I thought Baylor really attacked our zone well most of
the day and really put us in tough positions. We had foul trouble all day at
the center spot and that was because they kept getting the ball in there with
both the pass and the dribble.  
But back to Sheble, you're right, she gave us a big lift and we needed it. We
went into this game wanting to play a little small against them because we had
seen on tape that Iowa State had some success with that with the shooters. We
don't necessarily possess the same pieces but we did want to try to go small.
It didn't play out that way for us, we just didn't have a very good rhythm
today with it.  
  
Q. You talked about Nina Davis. What makes her a tough matchup, and I think
you had cut it to 6 and she makes that little floater in the lane. How
difficult is that to defend, I guess?  
COACH MITTIE: Yeah, boy, I appreciate her more every time I see her. Initially
when I saw Nina play, it was like what a great effort kid, undersized, great
knack for the ball, all these things. Then you go wow, she's expanded her game
to really quick off the bounce, really understands where to be, so quick along
the baseline for our bigs to get to, and then you add that floater in the
middle of the lane. Just a huge shot because we really just need one more. If
we get one more, now all of a sudden, you know, who knows, right? Ball bounces
off somebody, we knock a couple down, we walk out of here. But she's a great
player, I appreciate her more every time I see her. I don't like her any more
every time I see her, I just appreciate her game every time I see her. But
heck of a player, heck of a player.

### [Jim Littell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23326)

### [Brittney Martin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26550)

  
_DALLAS, TEXAS_  
  

Oklahoma State - 67  
Iowa State - 58

  
COACH LITTELL: Thank you. We're very excited to get this win. We've got the
utmost respect for Coach Fennelly and Iowa State and the program they have.
Very talented team that's been in the NCAA Tournament year after year after
year. I think our first half was probably as good a first half as we've played
all year. Clicking offensively, did a great job to hold them to 21 points in
the first half. The second half, I don't know if there was a little fatigue or
we lost some focus, but we quit guarding as well as we were in the first half
and they put a scare into the coaching staff, our fans and everybody else. We
had these two to my right step up and make big plays all night long. Roshunda
Johnson, I think -- she's a sophomore here and I think that's the best game
she's played since she's been at Oklahoma State, was really good, got us off
to a good start and down near the end of the game when the lead was slipping
away, we went to Brittney Martin and she hit some big shots and really
delivered some big rebounds on the defensive end of the floor. So proud of our
team, proud of these two young ladies and the way they performed tonight. Very
relieved to get 20 wins. It was the first time in the history of the school
that there's been four consecutive teams to get 20 wins, so that's a huge
accomplishment for our program and we're very proud of that and it came at a
good time.  
  
Q. Brittney, you got off to a really hot start and then finished the game so
well. How important was that for you considering the game you had against
Oklahoma on Monday?  
BRITTNEY MARTIN: I think I was just trying not to let that happen again.
People are going to have off games but that's something that I was kind of --
I guess it embarrassed me so I had to come out here and just play hard and
hope that things went well, so I just had to play hard.  
  
Q. Roshunda, your matchup with Nikki Moody, she was 1 for 15 at one point, I
don't know what her percentage was here, but why was that -- why were you guys
so successful in being able to contain her?  
ROSHUNDA JOHNSON: She's a very good player, I just had to contain my player
and knew that I had to play defense in order for us to win this game for my
team.  
  
Q. Both players, can you talk about what you needed to do there after they
cut the lead, your lead, to 3 points?  
BRITTNEY MARTIN: I think we've done this all year, we get leads and we come
back in the second half and I feel like we get comfortable. I don't think it's
on purpose but we just get comfortable with our lead, our 20 point lead, yeah,
it looks good but when the other team is just shooting three-pointers, it's
going to cut down fast. I think we just get comfortable and I think we just
had to pick up the defensive intensity and get back to what we were doing in
the first half obviously to stop three-pointers.  
ROSHUNDA JOHNSON: I think it was all about just controlling the game and not
letting them be able to come down and control the game, we just had to do what
we normally do at practice. The last minute you're up five and Iowa State has
the ball and Roddricka makes the steal on the wing there, how big a play was
that? Was that basically the game at that point? Talk about her defense
because you had seven steals for the night.  
COACH LITTELL: It was a huge play and it just didn't happen tonight. We were 2
and 6 playing at KU and we were down 23-8 in the first half and we put
Roddricka Patton in, she energized us, we came back and won that game, we won
five in a row and I believe we've won eight out of the last 11 with her in the
lineup. Not very smart on the head coach's part for not putting her in
earlier, but her energy, her enthusiasm, her passion for the game has really
energized our program, our fan base. It's fun to watch somebody that enjoys
playing the game that hard and I thought her steals were very significant. She
turned the ball over too many times tonight but she also got us 10 points in
fast break transition. And prior to playing her, we hadn't been getting easy
run-out baskets. So everything she's done has turned our program from being
2-6 to, you know, being in position to where we feel like we're in the NCAA
Tournament.  
  
Q. Jim, you kind of addressed it there, but do you feel like after this win
you guys have done enough to impress the committee to make the tournament or
are you trying to stay focused on the task at hand?  
COACH LITTELL: Well, I mean, we want to play and win as many games as possible
here and our focus is Baylor. I've always been under the opinion that you
don't worry about things that you can't control, and we can't control that.
History in this league tells us though that 9 and 9 has gotten you in and I
think this win here helped us further our resume. So I can't say on that, but
I feel a lot better about it than I did 24 hours ago, I can tell you that.  
  
Q. Coach Littell, first half was basically the way you all put your
defense's stamp on this afternoon's game. Not allowing Iowa State to get into
an offensive rhythm, doing what they normally do, which is what they did late
in the game, got their 3s going, what was the effort, the mental state going
-- coming into this game and putting in your defensive stamp?  
COACH LITTELL: Well, we've been -- I haven't looked at stats lately but I
think we've been leading the conference in a lot of defensive categories this
year and that's been the foundation of our program, defending and rebounding.
Sometimes we're challenged to score the basketball at times and we've won
games 47-44, 52-48 and that's been the staple of our program the entire year.
As I said, the first half I thought we were as good defensively as we've been
all year long. And then we lost focus, allowed a lot of easy shots, but that's
how we win. We win some grind it out games, we win some games that aren't
pretty, we have some ugly wins, but at the end of the day they're wins and
that's how we have to play to be successful.  
  
Q. Did you tell them anything there toward the end when the lead had gotten
cut?  
COACH LITTELL: Yeah, guard somebody. Guard somebody, quit stopping the clock
and fouling and sending them to the free throw line and let's get a good
possession and get the ball where we needed to get it. We did that at times.
We ran a nice set at the end of the game and Liz Donahoe's open and we throw a
bounce pass between her legs out of bounds. Those are things that are
responsible for this bald head up here. You can't make those mistakes against
a good team. We got away with it, but we quit guarding the way we guard in the
first half and that may be that they were in more of an attack mode and it may
have been a little fatigue on our part. We're not playing a lot of people, so
we're having a lot of kids log a lot of minutes.  
  
Q. Did you start trying to milk some clock there the last five minutes up
nine, and if so, do you look back on that and say maybe that was too early to
start doing that?  
COACH LITTELL: Well, you know, hindsight can be can 20/20 on it and I'm glad I
did it now. It maybe took a little momentum away from the game but they can
score in such a hurry with the 3-ball that we wanted to use 20 seconds per
possession on it and I don't know if it's the right thing. I would probably do
it again the way they play and how quick they can score, I wanted to keep the
ball out of their hands as much as possible.  
  
Q. Jim, I know that Baylor and Kansas State haven't played yet but if you're
playing Baylor, you guys haven't beaten them in I think five years but they
enter this tournament on a little bit of a slump having lost a couple of their
last games and you guys, like you said earlier, are pretty hot right now. Do
you feel like you're catching them maybe at the right time?  
COACH LITTELL: Well, I appreciate you pointing that out that we haven't beat
them in five years. I don't know if you can ever catch Baylor at the right
time. Great program, going to have a very high seed in the NCAA Tournament,
have always played well in this tournament. They've shown through some losses
that some people are playing them close or beating them. You know, we're just
going to come compete and play hard. It's a tough matchup for us. They've got
size, they've got Nina Davis, they've got some other players that are a very
difficult matchup so we would have to play extremely well, but that's why you
play the game and we're excited to play them again. Very talented team that
always seems to play very well in this tournament.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2015

  

### [Veja Hamilton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28411)

### [Zahna Medley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26543)

### [Raegan Pebley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25014)

  
_DALLAS, TEXAS_  
  

Texas  67  
TCU - 61

  
COACH PEBLEY: I was really proud of how our team fought. If you're going to
lose, we would want it to be because you just didn't make enough shots. I felt
like we took, or gave our best effort defensively. They believed in their game
plan, they worked hard at it. Were there mistakes made, yes, but I know there
were mistakes made on the other side of the floor as well. But I'm just
really, really proud of this team and our body of work as well and what we've
accomplished this season thus far. I want to congratulate Texas, they did a
fantastic job. They, I'm sure, felt confident with staying true to their game
plan as well, but that's probably it at this point.  
  
Q. For both, but Zahna first, did it take some time to adjust to the
shooting atmosphere in this gym, lower shooting percentage than first half,
y'all kind of caught on the second half. Is that something that y'all saw out
there?  
ZAHNA MEDLEY: I don't think it was the atmosphere, I think it was more
nervousness, maybe a little nerves from the team in the beginning, like all
the other teams in the Big 12 that were playing but I don't think it was
really the atmosphere that caused us to shoot that low.  
VEJA HAMILTON: We're not new to this, I don't think it was the gym at all. I
think there were just some shots that were open and they didn't fall for us
tonight, there's going to be games like that, but I think overall we fought
hard and we hit more shots in the second half and we just let the game come to
us, and it just wasn't enough in the end.  
  
Q. For both student athletes starting with Veja, just the fact of the late
comeback, the rally there, did you think you guys were going to be able to
pull it off and what was your mindset at that point?  
VEJA HAMILTON: Absolutely. There wasn't a point in the game where I thought we
couldn't win it. I think towards the end it was just trying to keep us all
motivated and staying poised and encouraging us to fight throughout the whole
game and that's what we tried to do.  
ZAHNA MEDLEY: I think I a hundred percent believed that we were going to come
back and win the game, I had a hundred percent faith in my teammates like I
always do and we just didn't make enough shots in the end to pull us forward.  
  
Q. For Zahna, were y'all just looking for that one person to hit that big
shot, hit that big three there in the second half, seemed like Jada was the
person that did that?  
ZAHNA MEDLEY: Yeah, I think we were all just finding open shots and trying to
make those tough shots to get over the hump that we were in and Jada just
happened to be that person, to have the bigs guarding her and they were
sagging off of her a little bit. She was confident in her shot.  
  
Q. Question for Zahna, what was the difference between this game and the
game you played in Austin from you guys' standpoint?  
ZAHNA MEDLEY: I think one hundred percent of it was effort, just staying to
the game plan, sticking to the game plan, and just getting those 50/50 balls
against them.  
  
Q. For both of you girls, what was different in the second half where you
came out, you outscored Texas, what was the different mindset that you guys
came out and played with?  
VEJA HAMILTON: I just think we knew that we didn't -- I think we came out a
little bit maybe not nervous but just overthinking in the first half and I
think we just kind of relaxed a little bit more in the second half and made
more plays, found open men -- or open woman, my bad, and just kind of played
more as a team, had our chemistry going.  
ZAHNA MEDLEY: I agree with Veja and we upped our confidence in the second
half, just believing still in the game plan and that we could still pull it
off.  
  
Q. Coach Pebley, talk about being on that first Big 12 championship team at
Colorado and some memories you might have had from '97 and being around
there.  
COACH PEBLEY: It was a long time ago, it was a long time ago, but oh, man, I
feel like we played Iowa State, I don't remember exactly, gosh, I don't know,
it was a long time ago. It's not even about me, it's about these girls and TCU
and how far we've come as a program and I think how great we can become. The
Big 12 is just I really think one of the best women's basketball conferences
in the country. Our RPI's proving it right now. I think we're poised to go
pretty deep with NCAA Tournament participants. I know that this conference, I
remember very clearly the leadership that was in this conference back then
from my coach, Ceal Barry, Jody Conradt, Sherri Coale was a part of the start
of the Big 12. We had, I think, Deb Patterson was there my senior year, Kansas
State might have been her first year. There was just awesome coaches. I mean,
and you knew that they were together in building this league. They wanted to
do what was best for their programs but they saw a vision of what Big 12
women's basketball could be. Angela Beck, too, at Nebraska, I don't want to
leave her off the list. They went after it and they did things that sometimes
weren't going to be great for their school but it was the best thing for the
Big 12. The Big 12 is special, I really think it's special. The home crowds,
you see the parity in our conference right now and I believe it's because of
home crowds. Home teams won a lot in the league this year. I've had people ask
me a lot, like what's the difference, you played Texas at home and Texas on
the road, what's the difference between Baylor playing Iowa State and losing
or Baylor playing Oklahoma and losing but they won at home. It's home crowds.
The vision of those coaches back then -- back then, it sounds like they're way
too old -- but I think helped contribute to building a fan base in the Big 12.
We attract I think some of the best athletes, great coaches, administrators
that believe in women's basketball, the conference believes in women's
basketball. We're going to host the regional here and the Final Four here and
women's basketball is important in the Big 12. So it's a long answer to your
question but I love being a part of this conference.  
  
Q. Was the difference between the first half and the second half just
confidence in the shot selection? It seemed like several players weren't
taking those shots that they've been comfortable with and made through the
season in the first half and were kind of letting them rip in the second
half.  
COACH PEBLEY: I think you've seen it in a lot of games that have happened so
far, just rough shooting, not great shooting by many teams from the perimeter,
but I just don't think you change a whole lot of what your team's doing at
this point in the year. We share the ball well. We've got a lot of people that
can score for us. I was proud of the shots that Caitlin took, that Jada took,
D. Breaux again, we had -- D was vomiting, throwing up, I didn't know if she
was going to play until tip. I'm not surprised that she didn't shoot as well
but she's a senior and deserved a chance to be out there and fight for her
team. You know, the difference between the first half and the second half I
think also was the fact that we moved the ball better, we didn't hold it as
long. We also had a little bit more offense from our defense that helped that
scoring.  
  
Q. You have about nine days now to wait for the selection process. One,
what's that going to be like, and two, what would you like the selection
committee to focus on in terms of your body of work?  
COACH PEBLEY: That nine days is going to feel -- see that little guy sitting
right back there sitting next to Kim Johnson? He was nine days overdue. He was
born ten and a half pounds and it was about a 25, 26 hour labor and I begged
my OB/GYN to induce me. And I think these next nine days are probably going to
feel like that last nine days of carrying him. But it was worth it, absolutely
was worth it and it will be worth the wait here because I just really think I
trust the committee and I say that first, and that is not just speak. I really
trust that committee. I know that they do an excellent job of seeding and
selecting. You know, I just think the Big 12, again RPI, we've gone out and
we've challenged ourselves in the nonconference as a conference, and we
included have. I don't think we really have any bad losses right now. We have
good wins, we swept Oklahoma State, we beat Iowa State, we beat Texas. We got
that third place tie -- we won the third-place tiebreaker because of those
teams that we were tied with, we had the most wins amongst those teams. So I'm
biased, but I don't know how you leave out a team that had the most wins
amongst those teams that were tied for third. But the committee looks at a lot
of different variables, there's a body of work, there's RPI, there's last 10
games, there's so many things. But I'm just really proud, and special things
are going to still happen for this team. I told them at the end of the game in
the locker room, their season's not over, I trust the committee and special
things are in store because this team is still so engaged, so extremely
engaged and eager to continue to play and they're quality. They'll be a
quality product.  
  
Q. The ultimate difference in the game, did you see it as just a few more
missed opportunities on your side especially down there in the stretch, a
couple of missed layups?  
COACH PEBLEY: Oh, absolutely. And also I'll say we also beat West Virginia,
they were in that tie, too. Yes, Chelsea missing the layup, the ball slips out
of her hand as she's going up for it. And Veja missing an open layup, missed
the front end of two 1 and 1s right there at the stretch. Again, if you're
going to lose a game, I want it to be because you just didn't make enough
shots. We put ourselves in situations to win it. I hate seeing it that juniors
and seniors weren't able to finish those plays because they deserve to,
they've worked hard to, they've made way more of those than they've missed.
Look at our free throw percentage as a team, those specific young women.
Chelsea in a fast break layup, we don't see her miss those. We've had so many
opportunities, so many.

### [Brynn Williamson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25249)

  
_DALLAS, TEXAS_  
  

Oklahoma State - 67  
Iowa State - 58

  
COACH FENNELLY: First of all, I want to thank the Big 12, there isn't a
conference in the country runs an event better. Really, on behalf of our
university and our program, I want to thank you for everything, and the people
of Dallas. It was a tremendous event as always.  
As far as the game goes, it's pretty much the struggles we've had all year of
when you don't have a couple people show up and make shots, we're going to get
beat. Oklahoma State's an outstanding team, they guard us great, but this game
is about making baskets and we certainly didn't make even close to enough.  
  
Q. Seanna, when it's 20 and it looked like this may be a blowout, you seemed
to really kind of take the game into your own hands and keep your team in it.
Can you talk a little bit about what was in your head and kind of that whole
stretch there?  
SEANNA JOHNSON: I knew someone had to step up at some point. I knew that if it
wasn't one of the seniors, I knew that I was next in line, so I knew I had to
help my team out no matter what, if it was a rebound, a basket, getting a stop
or a steal, I just knew I had to step up in a big way.  
  
Q. I know you're disappointed, but can you say what it means to be able to
come back like that, what does that say about your team?  
BRYNN WILLIAMSON: We talk about all the time in the locker room after games
and stuff like this that we're not a fan of moral victories or anything, but
the first thing we said in the locker room was that what we asked for everyone
on our team before the game started was that we needed to have a bench that
was behind us, and we needed to have players willing to fight. To OK State's
credit, they stopped us really well and things like that but we took 20
minutes off in a game and you can't win games like that, and we've been
through that this season, we haven't learned how to finish games and things
like that. But like I said, it's all about the fighting. Just seeing even a
couple minutes of that shows the potential of the team but right now we're
running out of time to prove it to everybody else.  
  
Q. Ladies, if you can both address, Nikki had an awful shooting night, I
think she was 1-15 at one point. When your leader is struggling like that,
what do you guys say to each other and how do you handle that?  
BRYNN WILLIAMSON: I tell her what she tells me every time, whether I'm 1 for
11 or 1 for 20, you got to keep shooting. Every shot is going to be the one
you don't take is going to be the one you're going to miss. One for 15, it
sounds really bad on paper but Nikki's carried us through so many games and I
think people kind of lose sight of that. She had a 30 point game at Oklahoma
and comes back, great game against Baylor. People lose sight of it whenever
you do go 1 for 15, but you look at the second half, she came out, made some
really big plays for us, that kept us in the game and got us back within
striking distance. So I mean, I'm not looking at this so negative for her but
it was a tough shooting night and she knew it and she looked to her teammates
and asked how they could help her.  
  
Q. Seanna, do you want to add anything to that?  
SEANNA JOHNSON: We talked about it, we talked about we've got your back no
matter what, no matter what it says on the paper, we're going to fight as a
team. I knew that we talked about it, when she went to the free throw line,
she made her two free throws, I told her, this is a start. So after she made
her two free throws, she came down and hit two 3s that we needed that kept us
in the game that got us back so that helped her. As that helped her, it helped
us as a team.  
  
Q. Bill, I'll ask you the same question, when your leader is struggling like
that, what changes for you? Do you just keep doing the same thing you've been
doing or do you kind of make adjustments on that?  
COACH FENNELLY: There's not a whole lot you can do at this point. Nikki's the
kid that has the ball a lot. We don't have a lot of people that can beat
people off the bounce. She had some good looks, I thought. But for the people
that have followed our team, this was kind of a microcosm of -- you know,
Fallon starts, goes O for 5. The kid plays 20 some minutes, gets one shot off,
just kind of the way it's happened for us. You know, obviously when Nikki's
struggling the way she is because she's going to get a lot of shots, Oklahoma
State's not been good for her. She was 6 for 26 at their place. Luckily for
her, she won't have to see them again. But their defense is very good. They
had 12 steals, which that's a lot in a college game, and they picked us a few
times. But defensively they have a great plan and they do a great job.  
  
Q. You mentioned their steals and I thought there was one in particular you
guys had cut it down to 3 and then it was 5 at about a minute to go, you have
the ball and Nikki loses the ball and 23 steals it and goes down and scores.
Basically, I thought that kind of iced the game. Did you think that was kind
of the dagger, I guess?  
COACH FENNELLY: Yeah, probably. That play kind of ended whatever chance you
had because we found transition but, yeah, you don't get a shot off, they
picked us. I think she had seven steals. Brittney Martin, we know is a great
defender. We just made some really loose decisions with the ball. We talked
every single timeout, we told them don't dribble the ball around certain
people, and to her credit every time we did it, she picked us. That's a great
addition to their team, that's changed their team. I think the first time we
played them, I don't know, she might have got in two minutes but that's a
credit to their coaches, to their program that they made the adjustment they
needed to make to make them a better team and they're going to be a tough out
in the NCAA Tournament, they really will. They play hard, they're physical,
they've got some depth, but it's a very, very good basketball team.  
  
Q. Coach, was it more of what OSU did in the first half defensively that
kept y'all from getting into an offensive rhythm and then weren't able to find
yourself until late in the game when it was almost like a rush?  
COACH FENNELLY: You know, I think as coaches we never give -- it's always we
didn't do this and we didn't do that, you don't give the other guy credit.
Their defense is very good but we missed some shots that we need to make. We
missed three free throws, which doesn't sound like a whole lot, but when
you're struggling to score you've got to do those kinds of things. Defensively
I thought we weren't very connected in the first half. But you've got to give
Oklahoma State a lot of credit, they were the main reason we struggled and
that's kind of been the pattern when we've played them this year.  
  
Q. Coach, how important were Seanna and Nikki with sparking that run? And
did you say anything to them and the team to get them going again?  
COACH FENNELLY: I thought Seanna made some really big plays. I think Seanna is
the most versatile kid on our team as far as scoring. She's fast to the
basket, got an and-1, got a defensive rebound, got a tipped steal. Those are
the kind of plays that excite the other kids. Every timeout it was the same.
You're wearing an Iowa State jersey and you had better be damn proud of it and
you had better compete. That's all we kept saying. Anyone can start things in
life and anyone can finish it when it's easy, but when you're getting your
butt kicked and you got a choice, you either bow up and compete and finish or
you make an excuse why you couldn't, and I thought we competed really hard the
last 10 minutes of the game and gave ourselves a chance, which is a credit to
the kids. You know, you can't -- you can't play very often down 23 in this
league and expect to have enough left to win a game.  
  
Q. You mentioned Oklahoma State's a tough out in the NCAA Tournament. Do you
guys have a shot, are you in?  
COACH FENNELLY: I guess I would say obviously that's not -- it's like my
beautiful bride sitting right there, it's like at home, I don't get many --
they don't care what I think at home. I don't know that the committee cares. I
don't know if the committee thinks what my opinion is, but I think when you
look at it, and I went through the mock selection thing in the fall, which was
an amazing learning experience, but we tied for third in the best league in
the country, we have some great wins, our strength of schedule and RPI, all
those numbers are good. I guess I put it this way: I think we deserve the
opportunity to play. If we don't, it will be our fault, but we'll see what the
decision is.  
  
Q. Is she the committee at home?  
COACH FENNELLY: She is the CEO, the CFO, the boss, she's the boss. Best
recruit I ever got 32 years ago. Lifetime, yep, she stuck with me. Can you
imagine that?  
MODERATOR: Well, congratulations on that.  
COACH FENNELLY: You'd better stop me right there.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2015

  

### [Nina Davis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26576)

### [Niya Johnson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26555)

### [Kim Mulkey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13704)

  
_DALLAS, TEXAS_  
  

Baylor  82  
Kansas State - 70

  
Q. Niya, kind of a little bit like the Tech game, y'all had a nice lead,
they got back. What did they do to kind of get back in it like that?  
NIYA JOHNSON: Mainly just attacking us, getting us on our heels and, yeah,
like I said, attacking us and getting us to the foul line, more than us, or
try to at least.  
  
Q. Nina, you got off to a good start. What did you feel like you guys did to
get off to the good start that you had?  
NINA DAVIS: We just came out focused. We just had the mindset and we know that
every game is important. You know at this time of the season everybody is
going to give you their best shot and no team is going to go away, as you can
see, at the end so we just have to learn how to play two halves, and we can't
just play one half and not the other.  
  
Q. Niya, is that a concern at all that you have had big leads and kind of
allowed teams to get back in the game a little bit? Or at this point in the
year is it all about getting the win?  
NIYA JOHNSON: Oh, most certainly. We just can't get content at the end and
back off and not playing any defense and stop attacking because they're going
to keep attacking us, we'll just have to keep attacking until the clock says
zero, zero.  
  
Q. Nina, y'all had 15 steals as a team, you and Niya each had 6. Talk about
that, was that a point of emphasis or was that just something that happened?  
NINA DAVIS: You can say it was a point of emphasis, we just want to kind of
get in the passing lane, we want to disrupt their offense. We didn't want to
just let them catch passes and be able to see over to us and throw off to
Lewis down in the post, so we were just kind of denying the wings, and it
worked for us.  
  
Q. Kim, it is survive and advance but what was your message, because, like I
said, seemed like y'all had some games like this when teams have kind of
comeback on you?  
COACH MULKEY: Isn't it fun to talk about wins, and we're worried about teams
coming back on us? Okay. Let me see if I can help y'all. Freshman, sophomore,
sophomore, sophomore, sophomore, junior, senior. That's the problem. They've
never -- other than those that got to play last year -- been on the court when
people are in a desperate situation. K-State understood this could be their
last game. Baylor, whether we liked it, admit it or not, that mind's still a
freshman and a sophomore, and they get comfortable out there, and where it all
breaks down is on the defensive end of the floor. It's not anything
offensively; it's defensive end of the floor. You'll have three of them doing
it right and, boom, the one that's not doing it right gets scored on. You'll
have two of them talking and three of them not talking. It's just going to
take a while to get this bunch all doing it at the same time in games when
people make runs at you. It's good that they respond, they don't panic,
they've won in all these situations, but let's write about what they're doing
good. They are 27, 28-3 and played a desperate team, and moving on, survive
and advance.  
  
Q. Kim, you had 15 steals out there, 19 turnovers, how big much a deal was
that for you guys to get out on the open floor and get some transition
baskets?  
COACH MULKEY: Well, we're going to run. I mean, if you scout us, it's not a
secret. You had better get back in transition defense and I thought we did
that early. Either they adjusted and didn't let us do it as much but we're
still going to push it. I just thought that rebounding, I thought we didn't
attack rebounding on the offensive boards. Sometimes when you're shooting
pretty good, you don't worry about that, but I just thought there's more to
get on the offensive end of the floor. But Nina, Niya, they're our leaders and
they both had 6 today and played a lot of minutes.  
  
Q. Kim, I think the first lineup we had, had Kristy in the starting lineup,
then she came off the bench. Talk about what she gave you and did you make a
last minute change there?  
COACH MULKEY: Yes, I did, and what did she give us? Gave us about, what, 13,
15 points. I haven't even seen it. 5 for 9. But again where she -- I don't
want to say hurt us, because they all did, but where the lead was going away
is she would get manhandled, outthrown, even on the inbounds play, that's just
being tough. Just felt like make sure you have her and Prince and Imani in and
out of the game, and different people guarding them. One of those three at
some point, Jerry, has got to become our defensive stopper, and right now our
defensive stopper is Niya. And you can't -- you just can't get a championship
at the elite, elite level when you're point guard who has to do everything
else also has to be your defensive stopper. A freshman and two sophomores,
you've just got to keep playing them and just hang with them when they make
their mistakes.  
  
Q. Coach, you talk about this being a young team. With such a short
turnaround to tomorrow's game, is there anything you can really work on or fix
or is it just something, like you said, they just needed to experience to kind
of get this atmosphere and this kind of stage?  
COACH MULKEY: They're going to experience it more. You're never satisfied to
have to turn around and play quickly, but everybody does in conference
tournaments. You worry about kids like Sune having to play as many minutes as
she did today. I would have liked to have seen KK be able to give her more
rest but I thought the matchup with the big girl from K-State, Lewis, we were
better with Sune in the lineup. Had she fouled out, I would have put KK back
in there and given her more minutes.  
  
Q. Kim, you've got 32 free throw attempts today. Did you like the
aggressiveness of going to the basket?  
COACH MULKEY: Absolutely did, and that was part of our game plan or what we
talked about is when you play a zone, a lot of times you tend to want to
stand. I thought we were very active, I thought we got the ball to the short
corner or the T and that's just the way we attack a zone. They play their 2-3
very high and we wanted to get the ball down in the baseline. We had good ball
reversal. I thought we attacked their zone fine. The offense is not the
problem. Scored 82 points or whatever it was today. It's your defense. And
it's your defense in spurts, when they're excited and they're making a run, we
need to make a defensive stop. And we did for the most part. I mean, we won by
12, but it's, like, let's do it when we have that 25 point lead, let's don't
do it when they cut it to 8 or 10. Again, I just think it's kids become
complacent out there. And it's not all of them at the same time, they take
turns.  
  
Q. Coach, Oklahoma State knocked off Iowa State earlier this morning. You
swept them this season, I think by an average score of 16 points. Always look
to beat the team a third time. It's like you said, survive and advance, you're
going to have your hands full tomorrow.  
COACH MULKEY MULKEY: Yeah, I haven't even had time to look at the -- think
about that game, man. Very good team. I think it's been a while since we've
played a team in our league that doesn't bring post players away from the
basket. So maybe it's more of the traditional look for us than chasing people
all night, and that's what we've done the last four or five ball games because
that's the type of offenses we have faced. Oklahoma State brings some bigs in
there. In fact, they've played double bigs in there when we've played them. So
I'm kind of looking forward to a traditional matchup where we don't have to
chase people off screens and run and find post players that shoot the 3 ball.  
  
Q. Kim, you talked to us about remembering KS' size. You guys did win the
game, but from your standpoint, you have to remind yourself of that?  
COACH MULKEY MULKEY: Oh, absolutely. And I have to go in there and coach them
and teach them and be tough with them but I also have to be a realist. Who's
my defensive stopper out there? Who's my big rebounder out there? This team is
going to be really, really great one day. I am absolutely shocked at what they
have done this year, and there's more to do. But as they mature and they get
older, a leader's going to emerge, a defensive stopper's going to emerge.
We've got recruits waiting in the wings, we've got Alexis Jones waiting to get
on that floor. We've got all those recruits waiting to join this bunch. It
doesn't happen usually your freshman year or your sophomore year, it usually
takes two or three years to get them to where they get it. But what they do
have is they have heart, they have unselfishness, they have an unbelievable
will to win and they don't panic. Panic usually is something you have to deal
with. We've panicked in one game this year. We didn't panic in the two losses
recently. We had shots at the end to win those, took good shots, missed them.
So yes, Chuck, I do, but I also tell them that, too.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2015

  

### [Mike Carey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20552)

### [Averee Fields](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26586)

### [Bria Holmes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26581)

  
_DALLAS, TEXAS_  
  

Oklahoma - 67  
West Virginia - 55

  
COACH CAREY: Well, I didn't think we would come out with much emotions the
first half, kind of stood around. They were taking the ball out of our hands.
I think they had 18 second-chance points first half. Second half, I think they
only had four. So that tells you right there. We just wasn't -- we were a step
slow, we weren't ready to play. Oklahoma was. But I thought the second half,
we cut it to 7 and then couldn't cut it any deeper than that.  
  
Q. This question's for Averee. It seemed like when Lanay Montgomery or even
Kayla Montgomery was out there, West Virginia had a sizeable size advantage
and almost seemed like they were a little intimidated but when Leary had to
play center, it was almost the opposite there. Can you talk about how Lanay's
foul trouble affected this game?  
AVEREE FIELDS: It did hurt us a lot, just because she had a lot of high energy
and she really wanted to be out there, but foul trouble was keeping her on the
bench, so we're used to having her out here, her size does help us with not
only their center but also helping with blocking shots and from our guards.
When Crystal's in, she played hard but she was just undersized and it was a
lot easier to play when Lanay was in the game?  
  
Q. This is for Bria. Bria, a couple times you cut it to 9, got it down to 7
at one point. Seems like every time that would happen maybe someone would get
free underneath for an easy basket or someone on the perimeter throwing down a
3. What was going on there, just little breakdowns kept occurring?  
BRIA HOLMES: Yeah, I just felt like we had a lot of breakdowns that we didn't
need. Like Coach Carey was telling us, when one breaks down, we all break down
together, all five of us. So we just need everybody to communicate and talk,
which didn't really happen so we broke down a lot. Coming up in these next
games that we're going to have, it just can't happen.  
  
Q. Averee, with all the people in foul trouble throughout, I know your
defense obviously, you're always very aggressive, but when you get those fouls
that's got to be in the back of your mind that you just can't do some of the
things that you would like to do defensively? Was that an issue throughout the
game tonight?  
AVEREE FIELDS: I think the most with Lanay since she was in the most foul
trouble, but we do play an aggressive defense but honestly, our defense is up
the lane so we shouldn't be touching our person, we shouldn't be fouling. So I
think when we're not doing what we're supposed to do is when we get in foul
trouble and I think that did hinder us a little bit tonight.  
  
Q. Bria, the ladies scored 20 points going into halftime and coming out of
half you kind of went on a scoring barrage, scoring 20 more points by the
10-minute mark of the second half. What happened during halftime that really
changed your offensive mindset?  
BRIA HOLMES: I feel like we came out more aggressive and more energy coming
off from when we first started. When we first came out, I don't think we
really had -- we came out with a quick start with a lot of energy, being
aggressive, attacking the basket, find our players. The second half I think we
just regrouped and came out stronger but we just couldn't finish.  
  
Q. For Averee and Bria, I guess your resume is complete now with 18 wins.
Your thoughts on NCAA, do you feel like you're an NCAA team?  
AVEREE FIELDS: I feel like we're definitely an NCAA-quality team. We are on
the bubble as Coach Carey's told us, so we're just going to have to wait and
see where we end up. But whatever tournament we're in, we're going to go hard
and hopefully get some wins and win the tournament, whichever one we're in.  
  
Q. Coach, Averee was talking about this, the way you played defense up the
lanes, you shouldn't be fouling. What was so frustrating tonight with getting
all those fouls?  
COACH CAREY: Yeah, you know, we were a step slow and you know what, that's no
excuse. I don't care if we did play last night, we were a step slow, we
weren't ready to play. I thought Lanay Montgomery was ready to play. I thought
she came out there, had her quickness, was making a difference in the game but
got in early foul trouble and kind of took the energy away. Second half, like
I said, they had 18 second-chance points first half, they only had four the
second, so that tells you all you need to know right there. And here's the
thing, if somebody don't front at the block, somebody's got to come and help,
somebody's got to rotate, if somebody don't get up the lanes or somebody loses
their man, now we've got to rotate, or if somebody lets them drive the lane
and we've got to rotate. You know, one person that keeps messing up cause the
other four people to do different things. The night before against Texas Tech,
we weren't doing that and they were just as quick, if not quicker.  
  
Q. Coach, it seemed like the girls were more inclined to pass on a couple
possessions when they seemed to be driving the hole and they seemed like they
had the shot, they still passed out for the 3-point attempt. Is that something
that you addressed at all during the game or is that something that it just
seemed to like manifest itself?  
COACH CAREY: Yeah, I mean, we've addressed it all year. Sometimes we play 5 on
4. We addressed it all year.  
  
Q. Coach, the pick-and-roll coverage, you guys never really seemed to
collapse on the roll. Did you want to change anything about that? It was a
really effective play for Oklahoma today.  
COACH CAREY: Second half they didn't get it one time, I don't think. First
half we weren't moving, we weren't getting to the ball, we weren't going over
top ticks, we weren't off moving our feet. I mean, they could have run
anything the first half. We just didn't defend the first half and when we
don't defend and we don't get turnovers and get our running game going, we
struggle to score on the other end, too. Our defense leads to offense and we
wasn't creating any.  
  
Q. I'll just ask the same question I asked the players at the end. Your
resume is complete now with 18 wins. What are your thoughts on where this team
should play its next game?  
COACH CAREY: Did you ever see those bubbles you blow out of one of them
things? That's where we're at. I told them in there, you know what, hopefully
we do make the NCAA. If we don't, we make the NIT. Either one, I expect us to
go in and play hard and try to win some games. We're going to try to get
better no matter what tournament we're in. If we don't get in the NCAA, we
have no one to blame but ourselves.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2015

  

### [Sharane Campbell-
Olds](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28404)

### [Sherri Coale](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13897)

### [Kaylon Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28403)

  
_DALLAS, TEXAS_  
  

Oklahoma - 67  
West Virginia  55

  
COACH COALE: Low turnovers, high rebounds, that's how you beat that team. I
thought we did a terrific job of being secure with the basketball and going
getting it off the glass on both ends of the floor. I'm not sure where the
offensive rebound number ranks but it was one of our best performances of the
year. KK was tremendous with 7 all by herself. Those just change the
complexion of the game.  
  
Q. Sharane, you're a senior, it's your last post season, Big 12 NCAA, did
you feel more urgent out there, did your team feel more urgent now that it's
the post season?  
SHARANE CAMPBELL-OLDS: I feel like we just went out there and played like we
know how to play. I mean, I guess I can say I'm really not thinking about this
is my last post season, I'm more concentrating, I want to win this game so I
can keep playing with my team. So I wouldn't say I'm like this is my last post
season. But of course there always is that part of me that's saying I need to
play hard so I can be with this team as long as possible.  
  
Q. Kaylon, 18 second chance points for you guys in the first half. Obviously
that speaks to a ton of aggressiveness there. Is it sort of the game plan
coming in, that you could be aggressive down there and get those second chance
points?  
KAYLON WILLIAMS: Well, we had to emphasis for this game that coach kind of
told us before was boards and -- more free throws than they have, the
aggression stat for us. When we're not typically shooting it as well, I kind
of think in my head that second chance shots, usually something good happens,
so going to go rebound after that and finding shooters and cutters, and our
guards are really good at moving when we get rebounds, so I know a couple of
the plays that I specifically remember with Sharane hitting a couple of jump
shots Gioya Carter getting an and-1 off of a rebound, kind of generates some
good offense for us from those rebounds.  
  
Q. For the players, I guess Kaylon first, can you tell us what sort of the
half court defensive game plan was? You guys talk about adhering to the
scouting report and it seems like West Virginia, all they could do was throw
it around the perimeter a lot so whatever you were doing seemed to be working,
what was it?  
KAYLON WILLIAMS: Well, our game plan for tonight was keeping it out of the
paint. Just kind of knowing personnel and knowing where the shooters were and
be aware of which guards like to attack and just kind of building a wall and
kind of keeping the ball out of there was pretty much an emphasis for us
tonight.  
SHARANE CAMPBELL-OLDS: I mean, she basically said it.  
  
Q. For Sharane, could you just talk about the lift that Maddie gave you out
there in the second half on offense when West Virginia was trying to mount a
comeback, seemed like she had a couple timely baskets for you.  
SHARANE CAMPBELL-OLDS: She is, just words can't describe how much she's came
along. Us seeing her in practice, we know what she's capable of and I think
it's great how she can come in and give us these major baskets that we needed
because we were going through a slump at that time. So I feel like it's just
her coming into herself and she's starting to be comfortable out there and I
think that she's going to be a force to be reckoned with.  
  
Q. Sherri, I wonder if it was the perfect game for you guys in the sense
that nothing seemed to come easy and yet you seemed to control it anyway. Is
that about all you can ask for in the first game?  
COACH COALE: Yes, and especially against them perhaps. They're a difficult
match for us because of their size, their athleticism. I thought Gabbi Ortiz
as a true freshman playing, I don't know, 35, 56 minutes, four assists, zero
turnovers against West Virginia. That kind of tells the story. I told our
assistant coaches before the game if Gabbi's' tempo is good, if she is solid
with the ball and everybody else relaxes around her we'll be fine. If your
point guard gets sped up, then you've got a problem that's hard to stop. I
just thought she was terrific all night and sort of set the stage for us to do
what we did against a very good defensive team.  
  
Q. Sherri, I'll ask you the same thing I asked your players about Maddie,
especially given the adversity she's gone through in her career at Oklahoma to
see her come out and contribute like that, just kind of put that in
perspective for us.  
COACH COALE: You were spot on, those two baskets came at a time when we could
not have needed two baskets worse, she delivered both of them and they weren't
easy shots, neither of them. I thought she blocked a key shot and it seemed
like every time we had to get a rebound or we felt like we had to get a
rebound she came up with it so I thought her play was integral in every part.
It's so rewarding for everybody on our team because when you watch a kid go
like 700 days without getting to play the sport that she loves, working on
just the drudgery of rehab every day, to get to come back and not just play,
but play in a big way and impact the outcome of an important game. It's just
fun for everyone. I think the team was as excited for Maddie as we were for
ourselves.  
I didn't answer your question like you wanted, did I? I saw you, Clay.  
  
Q. Another shot at the same question. To get all the second chance points
you had and to beat them on the boards, it's hard to game plan for, all right,
we're going to struggle shooting but we're going to score 18 second chance
points, but yet that's how you've stayed ahead, they never really cut closer
than 7 in the second half. Is this about as hard as your team can play, is
this everything you want this time of year?  
COACH COALE: No and no. As far as rebounding goes, we spent the three days of
preparation come into this weekend working on things that we felt like we had
to do regardless of who we played in the post season. Rebounding, offensive
rebounding in particular is a huge part of it. We doubled our time each day
and on the first day in practice we actually tripled our time spent working
just on rebounding. Of course it's a part of everything you do every time a
shot goes up. We're all screaming block out, go get it. It's an emphasis, but
we actually broke it down and tripled our time spent on it just to draw out
focus to it because you're going to have a game where you don't shoot it well,
and the way you buoy yourself through those spells or games, if you will, is
by getting second-chance opportunities and it affects the defense, it does all
kinds of good things for you internally in terms of juice and momentum, it's
just a critical part of the game. That was something that we prepared
regardless of opponent.  
  
Q. Coach, I'm curious, you played West Virginia three times now, they have
18 wins. In your mind are they an NCAA Tournament caliber team?  
COACH COALE: This always just cracks me up. Like I know? I don't have any
earthly idea and I went through the mock bracketing thing and I know what they
do and my hat is off to all of them who do it because it is a tremendously
difficult job. I have no idea. Do I think they're better than a bunch of teams
that finish in the first, second, third spot in their conferences around the
country? Yes, I do. Yes, I do, because we've played them three times and
there's nothing easy about it, but I have no idea.  
  
Q. You've talked about trying to earn a top 16 seed. I think your one out
here probably happens. Do you think one more victory or do you have any sense
of if that's enough?  
COACH COALE: Here we go again. I feel like remember when Johnny Carson had
that ball? Like what am I supposed to do? I don't know, I have no idea. What
we want to do is win a Big 12 conference championship here. That's what we
want to do. We want to win the tournament championship and if we do that, we
will love what the committee comes up with, I promise.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

_DALLAS, TEXAS_  
  

Texas  67  
TCU - 61

  
COACH ASTON: Thank you. A hard fought game. You have to really give both teams
a lot of credit for how hard they played. We knew that this was going to be a
different game than it was in Austin, TCU was obviously a little bit flat, it
was senior night for us and we played with a tremendous amount of energy in
the last game and expected them to return that energy level and they did. Our
team played really well for a long period of time, and then I thought we
relaxed a little bit in the second half defensively and started letting them
have some 3s, some open looks, started letting them have some drives, but I
really thought the difference in letting them back in the game was our
inefficiency offensively. We missed four or five layups early in the second
half. We got in too big of a hurry maybe trying to think we were going to
close the game out early. That's a sign of youth, but I'm pleased with the way
we finished it. It looked like we learned some lessons from a couple of other
games where we didn't finish very well.  
  
Q. Kelsey, when they cut it to four, I believe, in the last few minutes,
what was the mindset? I think Coach called a timeout with four minutes to
go.  
KELSEY LANG: I think that with this team the most important thing is just
trying to calm everyone down. We get really worked up and anxious and I think
that we just needed to calm everyone down, take a deep breath and really focus
on executing offensively.  
  
Q. For Kelsey first, then for Ariel. Just talk about the stretch that you
guys are on, six wins the last seven games, what's changed for you guys during
that span?  
KELSEY LANG: I think we finally found our sense of urgency. We realize that in
the last few conference games that in order to not have to play on the first
night, we would have to get those wins and now we just know when you lose,
you're out. So I think that we're playing with more urgency than we were
whenever we were going through the middle of conference.  
ARIEL ATKINS: Like Kelsey said, I thought we found our urgency, we knew what
was at stake and we wanted to accomplish what we set out to accomplish towards
the beginning of this season, so we just found it in us to pull together and
do what we needed to do.  
  
Q. Ariel first, then Kelsey can chip in, too. I thought Empress had a big
impact, she came in with about eight minutes to go and scored almost all of
her points in the last eight minutes. Can you talk about Empress's roll
shooting and dishing off inside?  
ARIEL ATKINS: Empress is very energetic, she feeds off of energy and different
things that happen on the court. So with her coming in and her energy helping
us, basically we all just feed off of each other and she has that fire that
makes everybody go, okay, let's get it done.  
KELSEY LANG: Definitely. I think that this year Empress has definitely been
our person that when we know we need to go get a layup, we get her the ball
and we know that we can rely on her to do that. I think that building on that,
she just has gotten so much better with realizing when she can take it and
whenever someone else's man is helping over and she needs to pass it.  
  
Q. Coach, the same question, I thought Empress was a big difference in the
last eight minutes. What are your thoughts?  
COACH ASTON: No question about it, and she's really been playing well the last
I would say three or four games, been extremely solid and obviously she went
through a stretch of time when she was unhealthy also and she looks healthier
and more confident. But you look at her line, there's no question it's an
impactful line. She was 5-9 from the foul line, she had nine rebounds, one
rebound away from a double-double, four assists, no turnovers, so that's a
miracle in itself for anybody on our team at this point. But she definitely
understands there are certain sets -- because she has experience, there are
certain sets that we call to Empress because she's been around, knows exactly
what we're looking for and her decision making is pretty good.  
  
Q. Going back to that run that TCU had, what were you telling your team
during the timeouts at that point?  
COACH ASTON: Slow down. Brianna Taylor made a couple of really great plays and
just missed the layups, Kelsey missed the layup, Brady missed the layup. They
were making good aggressive plays and I wouldn't have told them, okay, don't
do that, but we needed to slow down. That's the tendency of our team,
especially I thought we really played with a lot of energy most of the game
and we have a couple of players, in particular young players, Brianna, Ariel,
that are just full of life and full of energy but sometimes they can just get
going so fast that you just kind of have to tell them to take a deep breath
and slow down a little bit.  
  
Q. Coach, Jada Butts was kind of the player that started that run for TCU
during the second half. How difficult of a matchup is she with her different
abilities?  
COACH ASTON: Well, they're a difficult matchup. TCU is good, they're a good
basketball team and I expected them to play the way they played tonight. They
had an incredible sense of urgency and that struggle with guarding them is
because at times they will put five guards in basically and Jada spreads the
floor. Diaz came in tonight and hit one. I just think they are difficult for
us to guard but on the flip side of that I'm not going to take my big girls
out just because it's a little bit of a mismatch because you can see that
they'll get some offensive rebounds for us. So it's a trade-off. It was the
one thing that I thought we did a great job of in Austin was not letting Butts
and Prince hit shots and both of those guys kind of got going tonight so it's
difficult when all of them are making shots.

### [Haley Texada](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24862)

  
_DALLAS, TEXAS_  
  

Kansas State - 57  
Kansas - 49

  
COACH MITTIE: Thank you. Well, good, hard-fought game as you would expect, two
rivals going at it. The third game of the year obviously, but just a good hard
fought game. We struggled offensively most of the game but we seemed to find
enough offense in the second half going through Bre Lewis, both Texada and
Lewis had the best look offensively and those were the two we kind of rode to
the finish.  
  
Q. Haley, how fun was it for you out there?  
HALEY TEXADA: It's always a good time playing in front of family and just a
home crowd, but like I said, we just try to go out and play hard and in the
end we got a win and that's what happens when you do that.  
  
Q. Breanna, you really came on in the second half, what clicked for you?  
BREANNA LEWIS: I just tried to blow off the first half and just not focus on
the mistakes I've made, and just try to improve on the second half and just
take it one step at a time.  
  
Q. Breanna, can you talk about the first half? They shot horribly, I think
it was 3 for 22. Did you feel like you missed a chance to really put this game
away early?  
BREANNA LEWIS: No, I don't really try to focus on the things that I could have
done better or should have done better, I just try to improve on the next
time. I mean, I didn't feel like I missed out on any opportunity to score
because that's not really what I'm really about, but I mean I was just happy
that we were up and that we were playing well.  
  
Q. Haley, what was Coach saying to you maybe in those last few timeouts as
Kansas was starting to come back before you guys pulled away?  
HALEY TEXADA: Just do the little stuff. We kind of, you know, came out of
focus and were kind of losing our heads towards the end and giving them open
looks. Just stay calm, get yourself gathered and play smart.  
  
Q. You mentioned this was a game both teams struggled early on at first but
it took key baskets. In a game like this, I like to call them grinder games,
and I'm directing this to Haley, what do you rely on the most, the shooting,
the defense, the combination of both? What do you rely on to pull you
through?  
HALEY TEXADA: Personally, I would say defense, offense will take care of
itself, but I'm pretty confident in our offense as a team. When we really want
to get after it, we get it done. That's what happened late in the game with
Ashia getting a couple tips, you know, pressuring a couple of players, Kindred
there to take the steal and just being really amped up on our defensive end.  
  
Q. Haley, this is a sweep obviously over Kansas, three in a row. Talk to me
how this game compared to the other two?  
HALEY TEXADA: They're all the same, every single one matters with them, every
second we pour our hearts out because it's not only just KU, it's our rival,
it's always nice to sweep them anytime we can.  
  
Q. Jeff, I just want to ask you the same thing I asked them. As poorly as
Kansas State was shooting that first half, did you feel like you let a chance
get away? And what did you tell them at halftime about what was going to
happen from that point?  
COACH MITTIE: Well, foul trouble really impacted our rotation. We felt like we
were getting good stuff with Lou early in the game, but then she had to sit
awhile, and Ashia did, too, so we got out of rhythm offensively. Obviously I
thought our defense was good. We thought Kansas was going to make some shots.
I think they were 0 for 6 in the first half from three and they're the
percentage leader in the Big 12, so you know you're going to make some. We
just talked to our group, same thing we always talk to them about, four
minutes at a time. I think because of the emotion of the rivalry game in the
mid part we did kind of lose our discipline of the second half.  
Kristin, you asked about what we talked about. We really talked -- I thought
the middle dribble was hurting us and then they were getting us rotating and
then they were kicking out. Aldridge got hot. They started to get more people
involved, so we just talked about getting back to keeping the ball on one side
of the floor, if we would do that we would be in rotation less and cover up on
the shooters better, so that was really the message the last five, six minutes
of the game. Transition D was also a part of that because they were catching
us early. Aldridge got her first two looks on an early push and then it kicked
behind, and we just didn't do a very good job there.  
  
Q. Coach, the free throws, you miss only one, how key was that especially as
it got close there toward the end?  
COACH MITTIE: It was big because we were four for four in the first half, we
didn't shoot a free throw until the last five minutes of the second half and
it was a big concern of ours because we were having trouble getting to the
free throw line. We got there late, Texada got that thing started, Ash got a
big rebound tip that kind of got battered around that Lou got to the free
throw line but it was big to convert because points -- you know, you guys
asked earlier about this game, when Texada says they've all been the same, the
scores are 58-52, the first one. The second one was, I don't even remember.
What was the score, anybody remember? That was Randy Peterson from the Sports
Information Department. 55-48. You can see the similarities right there.
57-49. These games have been grind-it games. They have had many runs to them,
they haven't had huge runs because both of us struggle offensively at times
but they've been grind-it games. We're fortunate to come out on the top end
but free throws played a big part in that.  
  
Q. Obviously a short turnaround to tomorrow, that's the way the tournament
is, but you've got No. 1 Baylor tomorrow. How do you feel about that, and how
do you prepare for that in the short turnaround?  
COACH MITTIE: Well, it beats the alternative, okay, so you know, that's this
time of the year. Yeah, I'm glad to be playing tomorrow. Baylor's a great
basketball team. They have gone through that 18-game gauntlet and been Big 12
champion again, so we know we have our hands full and we've got to play better
than we played today and we've got to play better than we played previously,
but the beauty of March is you get that opportunity and we're looking forward
to it.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 6, 2015

  

### [Mike Carey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20552)

### [Averee Fields](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26586)

### [Teana Muldrow](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28380)

  
_DALLAS, TEXAS_  
  

WVU  59  
Texas Tech - 40

  
COACH CAREY: I thought our effort was tremendous. I thought our first two
times against them, they played harder than we did. Tonight I thought we
played hard. Neither team was scoring in the beginning, but that's what we do.
We've got to keep the game close, and eventually we start hitting shots but
we've got to keep the game close. I look at the stats here, they shot 17
percent the second half, that's pretty good to hold them there. I thought we
did a good job on Amber Battle. At their place she had 33 on us, so I thought
we did a good job not letting her get going because they get going -- when she
gets going, they get going, so I thought we did a good job there.  
  
Q. For both Averee and Teana, just curious, that stretch where Bria banged
in the two three-pointers there, it seemed like even you guys had little grins
on your face. Could you tell maybe things were going to be a little different
at that point.  
AVEREE FIELDS: I think hitting a bank shot three is once in a game, so she hit
two in a row and I think we laughed because what are the odds of that. But I
think it just showed how hard we were playing and we got some buckets to go in
and we were working really hard, so I think that was a great reward.  
COACH CAREY: I will say this, I did tell them at the timeout, if she does it
the third time, she's going to have to call it.  
TEANA MULDROW: I just think those two shots really got us going. Any time we
could get Bria going I think that really helps us. We were pretty excited
about those two shots.  
  
Q. Averee, what was the team's mindset going down the stretch? Obviously the
other night against Kansas State, the lead got away from you and the game. Is
this what were you guys thinking?  
AVEREE FIELDS: I think we were just focused. We didn't want to let up, we
wanted to make sure we keep going at them throughout the whole game because
what got us there was our high intensity. So we didn't want to let up, we
wanted to keep, even down the stretch, keep pushing, keep running our break
and not trying to slow it down too much, but I think we did a much better job
executing.  
  
Q. Teana, are you guys just sort of looking at this now as a second season
kind of thing, especially after the disappointment after the other night?  
TEANA MULDROW: Definitely. Coming to the tournament is definitely a new
season. No one -- what happened in the regular season is basically not carried
over to this. This is zero-zero, no one has any wins against anybody, anybody
can take the title, so this is definitely a new season for us.  
  
Q. This is for both. You guys lost both games this season. Was there a
different mindset coming into this game?  
AVEREE FIELDS: Absolutely. It's always frustrating to get beat, and to get
beat twice in our conference is not something that we're proud of. So to come
to this game knowing that it's win or go home, we definitely had a different
mindset. We need to stay and just play hard and I think we did that.  
  
Q. Teana, would you answer the question also?  
TEANA MULDROW: Yeah, just different mind et, just do or die, just play as hard
as you can, leave everything on the floor and just play your hardest, just do
your best. You just try to have the best mindset possible, just stay positive.
Even when things are getting bad, just stay positive.  
  
Q. This question's for Averee. The records between the home and away in the
Big 12 have been starkly different, and playing in Texas against a Texas team,
did you come into this game looking as if it was an away game?  
AVEREE FIELDS: Definitely not because we haven't done well away. I think we
realize it's a neutral court and so I think I definitely have the mindset it's
a neutral court, it's anybody's game. They have more of a crowd because yes,
they're from here, but I think that we had a different mindset than playing
away that we know this is tournament time and anything can happen so we have
our eyes set on the championship game and so we have to make sure we take care
of each step and each game.  
  
Q. Averee, if you look at your side of the bracket, you had beaten every
team on it except for Texas Tech, which you took care of tonight. Does that
give you added confidence as you move on?  
AVEREE FIELDS: I think that, you know, every team that we play in the Big 12's
going to be a tough game, so I won't say that I'm happy about what side, but I
think that we can beat any team that we come up against in the Big 12. So
whoever our next matchup is, which is Oklahoma, I think we can win that game
as well.  
  
Q. Coach Carey, good win today, first of all. It seemed like in the
beginning of the game you were playing extended minutes for Kayla Montgomery,
something that hasn't really happened a lot this season. Is that based solely
on the size advantage or was that a different game plan you were trying?  
COACH CAREY: You know what, no, there was no strategy in that. I thought Lanay
wasn't moving very well in the beginning so we tried Kayla. I thought she
played well when she went in, and if you play well, you're going to go back
in, you'll continue to go in. And it's not all about scoring, it's about
playing defense, blocking out, rebounding. I thought she was doing a good job
at that time.  
  
Q. Coach, after looking at this stat sheet 21 turnovers, can you touch on
that?  
COACH CAREY: Yeah, I think we had, what? How many did we have at halftime? 14,
15 at halftime and I addressed that for about five minutes taking care of the
ball. We come out the first three possessions, had two turnovers. Yeah. We did
it the other night against Kansas State, had 18 turnovers and we lost the
game. I thought we've got to take care of the ball better tomorrow against
Oklahoma or it's not going to be the same outcome. We played hard, though. Our
team played hard. They got on the floor, they got up the lanes and they got to
the ball. Other than that, the turnovers, I was pretty happy what we did.  
  
Q. A couple things. Looked like Bria maybe tweaked her ankle there late in
the game and the early word on that? And Bre McDonald, I know she can make a
lot of plays out there for you but I know it's frustrating at times with some
of the lapses.  
COACH CAREY: Yeah.  
  
Q. She's somebody obviously can help you that you're going to need.  
COACH CAREY: And again what I said earlier, you know, the frustrating about
this year, you don't know what's going to happen, who's going to be ready to
play, who's not going to be ready to play. It's been a frustrating year that
way. We'll try everybody and see who's ready to play. Back to Bria Holmes, we
couldn't put her back in, we were told she couldn't go back in, so the extent
of her injury, I don't know.  
  
Q. I was just curious how you think the delays and the travel and the snow
storm and the tumultuous ravel to get here, do you think that caused sloppy
play in the beginning of the game at all?  
COACH CAREY: Have you been on other trips with us? No. Look at our record on
the road. We won one game on the road, but that's how we play. Sometimes we've
got to make the game ugly. Our defense makes the game ugly. I'm okay with
that. Let's get on the floor, let's get aggressive, let's bang. We're okay
with that, but we've got to keep the game close until we start -- quit turning
the ball over and start hitting some shots, and when we did that the second
half, you saw us take a big lead. I think we went up, what, 17 real quick.
That's the runs you look for. But you have to continue to play defense and
rebound. If you look at the stats, we had more points in the paint than they
did. Points off turnovers, we had more points. Second chance points, those
were the offensive rebounds we gave up. We were disappointed in that. So
tomorrow we've got to take care of the basketball a little bit better, can't
let them have those second chance points. Oklahoma's going to come in and play
hard because we beat them the last game at our place and they've had fresh
legs. Speaking about travel, you know, we've been delayed almost every trip
either going out or coming back but that's part of it, that's part of it. You
can't use that as an excuse, you've just got to play. And I was proud of our
girls that they continued to play, that they came out ready to play.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

### [Terriel Bradley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28355)

### [Chelsea Gardner](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24873)

### [Bonnie Henrickson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13895)

  
_DALLAS, TEXAS_  
  

Kansas State - 57  
Kansas - 49

  
COACH HENRICKSON: Well, we got off to such a poor start offensively and the
start, I mean, the half. Scored 12 points and had good looks, had uncontested
looks and didn't finish at the rim and then started to affect the other rim.
When you're going to struggle to score that much, then you've got to be able
to turn somebody over and go get some layups in transition. Then we make the
nice run coming out from the locker room and then we turn it over late and
into a one-possession game and same thing what we did at our place. They did a
good job of kind of pinching and we started to get some driving kick and some
uncontested threes and some opportunities one-on-one inside, but certainly not
enough of those. And then they went away and just started ripping drive on us
and we fouled and gave up layups. If you look at their offensive possessions
probably from the five-minute mark down, that's what it ended up being, shots
at the rim and free throws, and then certainly the separations when we turn it
over.  
  
Q. Chelsea, what was the thing in the second half, what did you guys key on
to make that run, and was that a difficult thing to do after making only three
baskets in the first half?  
CHELSEA GARDNER: We got a few stops on the defensive end and that's what
helped us get our offensive end together. I thought offensively we attacked
and got open kicks from 3 from Terriell, Natalie and Lauren. On the defensive
end. That's what helped us offensively.  
  
Q. Terriell, what was the mindset when things just aren't falling, the
frustration keeps building and how do you keep that from just destroying your
whole night?  
TERRIEL BRADLEY: You've got to stick with it and get after it. My teammates
uplifted me, and so did Coach Bonnie, so I just thought I have to be more
aggressive coming out in the second half.  
  
Q. Chelsea, same question. Again, tell me about what was going through
everybody's head as the half goes on and nothing's going down?  
CHELSEA GARDNER: I thought we contained them defensively, that's how we stayed
in the game, but offensively our shots wasn't falling but in the second half
we picked up defensively being aggressive and attacking the basket.  
  
Q. Chelsea, Breanna Lewis had a huge game, especially the second half. How
difficult is she to contain inside and what was happening in there that she
was able to get so many looks right at the basket?  
CHELSEA GARDNER: I thought defensively I was playing more on the top side and
she started getting open looks over the top over me, but after she started
going on the run, I felt that I had to get underneath her and stop her from
getting open looks over the top.  
  
Q. Terriell, you and Lauren especially really started to get hot from the
three-point line. Talk about how you were able to do that and how you were
able to post 3s there in the second.  
TERRIELL BRADLEY: I thought we just scored mostly off of baseline penetrations
and just that we were wide open once we got the ball from one side to the
next. That's basically how we were open.  
  
Q. I don't know if that's as bad an offensive half of basketball that first
half as you have seen your team play, but what do you say to them at halftime
to try to get them out of that, what buttons do you push to try to make that
all turn around?  
COACH HENRICKSON: Well, you get them to believe they're better than that and
focus on a finish at the rim. So you miss point blank, you're focused on
something, it's not making shots. Focus on how to make it. Honestly, I told
them we're probably lucky we're not down 30. Shoot 13 percent, if he's in his
locker room, he's saying they just shot 13 percent and we're only up 11. I
told them that. I said that's how -- I wouldn't say that to you but that's how
I would feel. We're only up 11, they shot 13 percent. And then again, not to
let -- not let the offensive end affect your defensive end, I said we've got
to win it in the 30s then win it in the 30s, I mean, if that's what it is. But
don't -- I thought -- I felt like the offensive end affected our toughness and
our intensity on that defensive end, which it can't happen. If you're not
going to score, then you can't let that guy score either, the other team.  
  
Q. You contained them pretty well defensively with the poor start on the
offense. You were able to come out and get, like I said, hit those 3s and
become hot on offense, but would you say turnovers played the biggest role
tonight?  
COACH HENRICKSON: Especially, yeah, down the stretch. Look at the numbers when
that happened with 18, which is too many against the 2-3 zone, and we scored
-- we turned it over too late. Then you look at that, the turnovers and free
throws unextended, and then it goes to layups. So it's a product of turning it
over and then what kind of shot is that for them, and certainly that was a
dagger, and quite honestly it's been our Achilles heel on the year to just
give a team extra possessions. They get seven more shots, seven more shots
than we get. And we've not done that, we've been so much better here down the
stretch and certainly frustrated that we end up in that situation again.  
  
Q. What does it say about your team that you were able to make that run, I
think it was 11-0 to get back in the game?  
COACH HENRICKSON: Well, we've done that all year. Honestly, we've done that
all year, and we've won some and we've lost. We were down 17 at Texas Tech,
we've been down before, we've come back, but there were probably about four of
those that we've not. It ends up being a one-possession game. Certainly I
think we're that team that makes the run. It's hard for me to believe we're
that team that does that in the first half quite honestly. I certainly believe
that we're more capable of sustaining, consistently being more aggressive and
attacking and being more productive. We've done that all year so there's
certainly value in that and that's a gut check and it's a character check, and
certainly that's -- so we've been in that situation. These kids aren't going
to give up and let it go, that's not going to happen, that's not who they are,
that's not who we are. The frustrating part is how we get ourselves in that
situation so we don't -- to me, we shouldn't be in that situation and play
like that, play like that and grow those stretches where we're that confident
and we're aggressive and we attack that much.  
  
Q. Talk about Chelsea Gardner as a player. I mean, another double-double
tonight and she's been a solid player for you all season long. This is it for
you, guys, but talk about Chelsea Gardner and how she wraps up the senior
year.  
COACH HENRICKSON: Yeah, she's been a player that we've depended on all year.
In most people's scouting reports defense is to try to take away some of her
touches, and the work she's got to do offensively early, to work early to get
position and put herself in a position where she can get a pass, whether it's
a man or a zone. Then you're at the mercy of the big, those little guys around
you, they're willing to throw you the ball and get you on time, on target and
get you a high percentage shot, so she's done a great job for us and her
future is really, really bright at the professional level and we're excited
for her about that.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 6, 2015

  

### [Amber Battle](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26545)

### [Ivonne Cook-Taylor](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26546)

### [Candace Whitaker](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25425)

  
_DALLAS, TEXAS_  
  

WVU  59  
Texas Tech 40

  
COACH WHITAKER: Tough game for us, we really struggled offensively
particularly and just to get some shots to go. Needed to take care of the ball
better than we did and obviously convert at the free throw line. West
Virginia, thought they played well, came out set on go and had several people
have great games.  
  
Q. Amber, last game against them you had 33 points, this game only 11. Did
they show you something different tonight or just stay on you tighter?  
AMBER BATTLE: They just played their defense and I didn't attack as much as I
needed to.  
  
Q. Ivonne, with them breaking on Amber a little bit harder today, did that
give you more opportunities to score? You had a pretty good first half.  
IVONNE COOK TAYLOR: Basically my teammates penetrated and I just had open
shots.  
  
Q. For both Amber and then Ivonne, the second half I think you only had 4 of
23 shooting. Did they up the defensive pressure in the second half or was it
your execution, what happened during that stretch?  
AMBER BATTLE: I just think we weren't being the most aggressive team and we
weren't taking our time in shooting the ball.  
IVONNE COOK TAYLOR: I agree with Amber.  
  
Q. Coach, you've been around basketball a long time. When you see two
banked-in 3s to start the half, is that one of those omens that --  
COACH WHITAKER: That's never a good sign, right? Yeah, I mean, West Virginia
made shots, they shot it well, they played well. I thought Averee played well,
I thought Bre played well. And they're tough defensively when they can switch
and pressure you and try to take away the things that you normally get. They
went with a lineup without their big where they switch everything and we had
trouble with that lineup.  
  
Q. Coach, did you see them do anything different or how did they alter their
game plan from the first two wins when you took them?  
COACH WHITAKER: Really didn't see anything majorly different. They did play a
lineup without a big more, but we did see that the first two times as well. I
thought we had some good looks from three that we didn't connect on throughout
the game, and then we had a stretch where we missed two or three layups in a
row at the rim that, you know, you've got to get to go down, especially when
you're struggling shooting the ball from the perimeter.  
  
Q. The second half, 17 percent shooting, what wasn't right on the execution
of the floor, were you just not getting open looks or was the spacing off?  
COACH WHITAKER: You know again, from three I thought most of our looks were
pretty open. We missed some layups at the rim there in the second half where
we strung missed layups together. We were fairly open. I mean, they're coming
over, they're not going to give you a completely wide open layup but we were
at the rim and didn't convert for whatever reason. And then they played more
of their lineup without a big and that caused us problems.  
  
Q. One win shy of qualifying for the post season but still a pretty big
turnaround. I know it's kind of short notice, the season just ending, but can
you elaborate on what the season meant?  
COACH WHITAKER: I thought we improved in a lot of ways. Nonconference we had
to win a lot of close games without Amber, so I felt like our team grew from
that and learned from that. ^We found ways to win there. Continued to get
better and evolve and it's been fun to watch them improve. But that's what we
talked about after the game. I felt like, you know, we had five to six close
games in Big 12 where it came down to one possession and you need one more
game, so how valuable a possession is, how valuable each game is for one game
to keep you from continuing your season. I think for our returners, they need
to hurt from that and they need to understand the value of a possession.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 10, 2015

  

### [Doug Bruno](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15667)

### [Chanise Jenkins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28436)

### [Megan Podkowa](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28456)

  
_ROSEMONT, ILLINOIS_  
  

DePaul  78  
Seton Hall - 68

COACH BRUNO: Any championship is always about the players, and I just really‑‑
every team and every group of players in America starts working very hard last
April, and you have to make this happen, and I've been blessed to coach
players that are really hard‑working, that are really intelligent and really
have a sense of purpose. So I was just really proud of my players for
understanding and the travails of what it takes to win a regular season
championship, understanding how to overcome the injury of an all Big East
player and the loss of Megan Rogoski; understanding that when you get waxed
twice by the same team, it's a really good team, the Seton Hall team is a
really good basketball team, and they've had a really great year, and they
just really have great players and their staff does a great job.  
For us to come out and be able to beat a team of this quality tonight, I'm
just really proud of the players, and it always comes back to the players, and
I'm just representing them, Megan and Chanise, but it's just about these
players that I'm blessed to coach at DePaul University.

Q. After losing to this team twice this year, once on the road after an
exhausting Friday night game at St.John's and then a heartbreaker at home, how
does it feel to get over the hump and beat this team?  
CHANISE JENKINS: I would say it feels great. A total team effort today by the
team. We sort of went into this game focused, and we know that Seton Hall was
hungry to beat us a third time, so it was great that we came out focused and
ready to play this time.  
MEGAN PODKOWA: First two times that we played them, our defense wasn't there
and our rebounding wasn't there, so I think we all came in ready to play and
ready to rebound and defend against them tonight.

Q. Seton Hall has come back against you guys in both of those losses early in
the season. Now you guys go up again. What was the difference this time around
that allowed you to stay in the lead?  
MEGAN PODKOWA: Coming out of every time‑out we would all huddle up and be
like, remember they did this to us before. We`ve been up by 12, and this has
happened before, so we really had to stick to our defense and rebounding and
make sure we get the job done. We can't let them back in the game.  
CHANISE JENKINS: Yeah, just add to that, I think Brittany did a great job of
huddling us up every time she could and getting us refocused, even though like
they will score a basket and then we come back down and we`re like they can't
score again, we have to get a stop and then get a rebound and come down and
get a score. I think the leadership from Brittany Hrynko the entire game was
key for us.

Q. How does it feel having an NCAA bid locked up and not having to wait until
next Monday?  
MEGAN PODKOWA: It feels awesome.  
CHANISE JENKINS: It's a relief knowing we don't have to sit there wondering if
our name is going to pop up or not.

Q. Chanise, you guys open up the first half 15‑3 run, second half I believe
13‑4 run. You guys had your foot on the gas pedal the entire game. What was it
like to feel that offense clicking like that?  
CHANISE JENKINS: It just felt great. Like I said already, we just came out
ready and focused, and I don't know, we know that we had an early lead and a
lead coming out of halftime, but we just had to keep huddling up and keep
focusing. We can`t let them come back into the game because Seton Hall is
really great and they`re really good at coming back ini games like this. We
just had to keep our foot on the pedal.

Q. Megan, your past two games, 22 last night, 19 tonight, do you have a
certain feeling coming into this tournament or do you credit your teammates
for how well you played offensively?  
MEGAN PODKOWA: It's definitely all for my teammates. I mean, I feel I was
getting a lot easy lay‑ups, wide open threes, and the guards really doing a
great job of getting me the ball. Also some of the other girls scoring like
T.T. stepping up and hitting those threes opened up more opportunities for all
of us, so it was a really good team effort.

Q. Coach, you sat here last night and you said‑‑ you talked about
Richardson‑Smith and how much respect you have for her, and I think that
showed tonight. You were all over her. You shut her down.  
COACH BRUNO: Well, the defensive approach was a total face guard, and I think
for a player to earn the right to be totally taken out‑‑ you can take out a
player, and that's one player assigned to her without giving help, but a total
face guard is the ultimate. Your player that's guarding her has got no other
responsibilities than to just guard her. We just put somebody in her chest the
entire game, and we were just trying to reduce her touches.

Q. Coach Bozzella told us before you got here that he told his team before the
game to keep you folks out of the paint. Could you talk about your game plan
if you're able to in terms of attacking tonight?  
COACH BRUNO: You know, we have a very excellent group of players. We try to
put the players in position to have different ways to attack, so as their
coach, I always want them to have the confidence of being able to score. We
know what to do defensively. That's pretty standard. You've got to put them in
position to score.  
We tried a lot of different things. The Seton Hall defense against the ball
screen tonight was really jamming us up. We weren't getting anything out of
the ball screens. So we opened the floor up, and we have players that can play
with the floor opened up. We have our spread DePaul offense that we can run at
any time, and we make our players learn that before they can step on the floor
as freshmen.  
I think it's my job as a head coach to always have answers for defense, and I
think your question earlier about the pedal on the metal, you might have
thought so and the players might have thought so, but I thought we were stuck
on 31 for about an hour, and I thought we were stuck on 55 for about an hour.
So when you get stuck on during a game, it's when your game kind of sputters,
and I thought we got stuck on 31 in the first half and 55 in the second half,
and I was glad to see our players respond.  
But it's all the players. Chanise Jenkins, Brittany‑‑ I'm glad Chanise talked
about Brittany because for a Player of the Year to come in and have a really
good, solid tournament, but not necessarily the glamour numbers or the
celebrated numbers that she had on the season, and still have major impact on
the game‑‑ I thought she had major impact on the game last night, I thought
she had major impact on the game tonight, and that's what this sport is all
about.  
To be able to have major impact, the tables‑‑ the game was reversed tonight.
The unsung hero for the season is Centrese McGee, and she comes out ‑‑ at
halftime I`m looking at the stat sheet, we`re shooting 53 percent. All right,
our big three, our three potent guards, Chanise, Brit and Jess, are 5 for 17,
and we're shooting 53 percent. Centrese McGee has got nine points and hasn't
missed a shot. Brittany made herself really, really functional tonight, even
though she wasn't having her best scoring night. She did the same last night.
I think that's really key.

Q. What is it like just winning back‑to‑back championships right on your home
court in Allstate Arena?  
COACH BRUNO: Well, first of all, when you talk about the tournament, I want to
thank the Big East for running the tournament. I want to thank our
administration for running the tournament. I want to thank the village of
Rosemont. This is a great place to have a tournament, and I'll guarantee‑‑ I'd
better not say that right now. But at the same time it's not our home court.
This is not our home court. This is totally a neutral court when it comes to
the court. There's more fans for us, so in that way it's not neutral. But this
is a neutral court. I'm thrilled that we're able to win the tournament, first
of all, win the regular season championships so our seniors can go out with
four championships. I'm just really proud of them, and that's really the major
focal point. And then the next facet to it or the next factor to it is we've
been doing this for 40 years. There's a lot of people in this rooms that have
been working very hard their whole lives to grow the game of women`s
basketball. And we`re really thankful to all the people that show up, but the
sport is just too good and we believe in it too much, and we just‑‑ I really
dream and envision and believe that there`s going to be a day where we step on
this court and I'm going to look up into all those corners and see the same
thing that I saw when I was out here watching the great men's games of
yesteryear pack this joint, and that's my vision for women's basketball, not
just here.  
I guess I'm really proud of what's gone on here at this tournament, but at the
same time, we've still got miles to go. We're just all working very hard to
get people to watch this great sport.

Q. At what point were you able to exhale in this game and realize that you
won?  
COACH BRUNO: When you choose to do what I do for a living, I never exhale.
Really, I mean, I think the only way to approach coaching, I really believe
this, is to coach every possession‑‑ if I coach every possession like it's the
only possession, and I coach every possession to win every possession, and I
think I can lead my players to play every possession like it's the only
possession, so I don't exhale at all. We're still fouling, we're still
committing stupid fouls with a minute and 14 seconds to go, and there's too
many crazy things that happen in basketball. I never exhale. I exhale probably
with about 14 seconds, 16 seconds to go, I finally figured out that I could
say to the kids on the bench, thanks for helping us win this championship, and
we're going to put you in for a little curtain call in the starting five.
That's 16 seconds to go. So I never exhale. Can't exhale.

Q. Coach Bozzella talked a little bit about how some of their players were
kind of nervous going into this game. How much do you think the experience of
being there last year and winning the tournament helped DePaul win tonight?  
COACH BRUNO: Well, you know, our players are veteran players, but so are
coaches. I really can't speak to Seton Hall. I think they're great players,
great talent, and I think Tony does a great job. Yeah, nerves, at this point
in time when you're a fifth‑year senior like two of these great guards are,
you need to‑‑ I can't really speak to it. I just really don't want to be
quoted on that.  
Nerves are‑‑ I talk to my players all the time about anxiety before games. I
expect our players to be anxious before games. We try to put our players in a
place of execution anxiety versus result anxiety, and I think if I can keep my
players in a execution anxiety place versus result anxiety‑‑ because you can't
play a sport and be a quality, high‑profile, high‑level athlete without
anxiousness before the competition. I just think it's how you channel the
anxiousness, and I don't think the experience‑‑ I think the experience that
helped us is this year's experience when we got‑‑ we had Notre Dame on the
ropes and beat and didn't finish the job, and I really think the
non‑conference schedule that we played at our highest end, UConn, Notre Dame,
A&M, and then Northwestern`s rank‑‑ I mean, our seven losses, I'm going to
repeat all the time until I`m blue in the face that of our seven losses, six
of them were against ranked basketball teams, and the seventh one was against
`Nova the night we lost Rogoski. I think that's where our players learned the
difference between execution anxiety and result anxiety, for the experience of
that.  
I don't know that it's these tournaments that do that as much as this‑‑
because it's a new team. The DePaulia wrote a commentary that this team isn't
any good. I'm just saying, I'm not talking about you. Whoever wrote the
editorial‑‑ last time we lost to Seton Hall we were written off, remember? It
was also pointed out that we couldn't win this tournament because we couldn't
rebound. You said we were 244th in the nation. Nobody said we were second in
the nation in scoring, second in the nation in assists, second in the nation
in‑‑ I love you guys. I really love the DePaulia, I really do. I think we're
really raising great journalists in America, so God bless you.

Q. The last two games Megan Podkowa has played as well as I've seen her all
season inside down low. Talk about the impact of that on your team and how
that bodes well for you going into the tournament.  
COACH BRUNO: You know, this team is different because Jas Penny graduated. Jas
Penny was an undersized post. We're a small basketball team to begin with, so
if you can get some kind of inside play from anybody, you're going to be a
better basketball team. People have the misconception that's all we want to do
is shoot threes. The reason we shoot threes is to spread the floor so we can
get great kids who can slash to the basket openings and kids that can post up
space. That`s what the three‑point shot is there for.  
I'm just really proud of Megan for finally stepping up and taking over some
ownership in the paint. We've been on Megan all year to want the ball in the
paint, and I think she really did last night, and again, this is Brit‑‑ the
only crunch time last night, she needed the ball and Brit helped get her the
ball, and I thinks that`s ‑‑ it continued tonight. We've really worked hard
all year to develop a post game. We really Brandi Harvey‑Carr played in every
game for 25 consecutive games, a lot of valuable minutes, and yet we were
trying to work Brandi into that spot and trying to get Brandi to take
ownership of that spot. Now it's crunch time and we've got to use what's‑‑ and
Megan has got to be that player, Mart`e Grays has got to be that player,
Centrese McGee. We've just got to scramble and do what we can do.

Q. Seton Hall talked highly of your defense tonight. Just what in particular
worked on defense?  
COACH BRUNO: When you score the ball as much as we do at DePaul and shoot the
ball as frequently as we do, it becomes a common thought that we don't defend.
And when you shoot the ball fast and shoot the ball‑‑ you can't score a lot of
points if you don't shoot the ball quickly. If you shoot the ball quickly, it
looks often like you're not defending. I just think that tonight we still
ended up with 70 points, and if we made some free throws down the stretch like
we normally do ‑‑ our best free‑thrower was on the free‑throw line down the
stretch, we would probably have ended up with 84, 85 points, right there where
our average is, about 87, in a tempoed game, in a game in which we weren't
quick shooting. We thought that offense and defense are interrelated in this
sport, so we really thought it was important for us to have to make Seton Hall
guard us for extended periods of time, and that would actually help us on the
defensive end. But taking and shutting‑‑ putting a take‑out player on
Richardson‑Smith was important. I think that was key. Not letting Johnson get
off for four threes like we did in Game 2, that was important. In Game 1 we
beat Seton Hall in Game 1 87‑85\. We beat their ‑‑ three guards had 85 and we
had 87, so the three guards at Seton Hall had 85 points against us out at
Seton Hall. We put them on the free‑throw line 30 times at Seton Hall. So we
just had much more defensive purpose, cleanliness, persistence,
relentlessness, and the game plan was a really good solid game plan.  
My assistants are great game planners. Candis Blankson had the scout but once
I start talking about scouts, I'm going to miss somebody. Jill Pizzotti had
last night`s scout, but the takeout factor of Richardson‑Smith was huge and
not letting Johnson get off. You're not going to stop them all. Dee Dee is the
player that we voted on for her‑‑ we voted her Player of the Year, and
Richardson‑Smith we voted very high, second or third, I'm not sure exactly
which. And Daisha can get to the rim all night. I thought our help defenders
did a good job, the kids that were in position to help did a good job of
helping. So it was a great team defensive effort.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 10, 2015

  

### [Anthony Bozzella](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28418)

### [Ka-Deidre Simmons](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28451)

  
_ROSEMONT, ILLINOIS_  
  

DePaul  78  
Seton Hall - 68

  
COACH BOZZELLA: First of all, obviously want to congratulate DePaul, the Big
East Tournament champions. Obviously very good team. They showed their
experience today. I think DePaul is known for their offense and they're one of
the best offensive teams in the country, but their defense won the game today,
clearly. They came out, they defended better than I've seen them play in all
the games I've watched, and their experience showed. You have a kid like
Centrese McGee, who`s not a good three‑point shooter at all make three for
three to start the game and I give her credit. She's a senior, she stepped up,
she knew the importance, shot the ball with confidence and I give her a lot of
credit.  
And certainly the environment did us no favors, but we've played in difficult
environments in the past. It`s hard to play on the road, especially as a No.1
seed in a conference tournament. But clearly they outplayed us today. This was
their day. The last two times we played them, it was our day. So I give them
credit. Hopefully they'll do well in the NCAA Tournament, and I know we will
do well because we deserve to be a top six or seven seed in the country,
there's no doubt in my mind. We're 28‑5\. We have played, I think, 14 top‑100
teams, and we've proven that we're not only a very good basketball team in the
Big East, but one of the best in the country. We've played teams such as
Georgia, Illinois at full strength and handled them easily. We've beaten
DePaul twice, St.John's twice, Villanova twice. Anyone we've played we've
beaten. We've gone on the road and played tough games teams, and this clearly
is a team that deserves a high seed in the NCAA Tournament and a team that
deserves respect for the 38 games we`ve played throughout the year, not the
one game that we've played in the Big East Finals on the road.  
But again, I congratulate DePaul, and hopefully they'll do well in the NCAA
Tournament, as well.  
  
Q. Dee Dee, this isn't the result you wanted. What kept your offense from
really getting into rhythm tonight?  
KA‑DEIDRE SIMMONS: Like Coach said, DePaul played really good defense. I think
our guards just didn't do a good job of getting open. We couldn't really start
our offense. But credit to DePaul. They played really good defense, and we
just have to come out a little bit more aggressive and just play better.  
  
Q. It seemed like at times tonight when you drove to the lane, you were
looking for somebody to throw the ball to. You were looking and looking and
looking and that's something that you do so well. Why weren't you able to
figure out a way to get that pass in? It seemed like DePaul was everywhere.  
KA‑DEIDRE SIMMONS: I don't know, that's a good question. Every time I drove, I
seen blue shirts, and I looked for my teammates and I didn't see them open,
either. I know, it was tough. It was tough.  
COACH BOZZELLA: Like we've talked about in the locker room, the problem is, it
falls on my shoulders. They play as hard as they can. They do what they're
supposed to. He made a great adjustment. We talk about it's all about points
in the paint. We outscored 96‑32 in the first to games. At one point in the
game it was 34‑30\. They scored 30 points in the paint. They only had 32 in
the first two rounds; we scored 34. We averaged 48 in the first two games.
They made an adjustment, I didn't handle it well, I didn't adjust properly,
and it falls on my shoulders. Don't blame the kids for this. This is on me at
the end of the day.  
  
Q. Dee Dee, at the same time, you look at this season and you still have a
lot of basketball to be played. I talked to Coach before, and he said he's
proud of you either way. How important is it now to put this away and look to
Selection Monday and get ready for the NCAA Tournament?  
KA‑DEIDRE SIMMONS: Before we put it away, we have to figure out what we did
wrong and just do better and make sure when we're in this position again‑‑
well, we won't be in this position again. Just look at film and watch our
mistakes and then once we realize the mistakes we made, we move on. But we
can't just move on right now. We have to go back and watch film and look at
our mistakes and things we could have done better. Look at the good, also, and
move on.  
  
Q. When DePaul jumped out to that early lead, 15 ‑3, what did that do to
your mindset now having to play from behind?   
KA‑DEIDRE SIMMONS: It's not something that we're not used to. We've come back
a thousand times.  
COACH BOZZELLA: Including twice against DePaul. We were down 10 in our gym, we
were down 18 in their gym. That meant absolutely nothing to be brutally honest
with you. I was like, whatever. Go ahead, you can finish.  
KA‑DEIDRE SIMMONS: Like Coach said, it didn't rattle us, not one bit. They're
a great team. They jumped out on us like they did the first two times we
played them, but that didn't rattle us at all.  
COACH BOZZELLA: That wasn't a problem at all. That really wasn't. Listen, this
team, we've been down double digits all year. That's irrelevant. I didn't mean
to interrupt you. I apologize.  
  
Q. Were you struggling to get Tabatha the ball? Uncharacteristic for her to
finish with six points in the game.  
KA‑DEIDRE SIMMONS: Yeah, they were denying ‑‑ they were face guarding her. It
just goes to show what type of player Tab is and what type of effect she has
on the court. It kind of helped us a little bit, but we have to just do better
at making sure she gets open because we do need Tab to step up and dig deep
and get open for us.  
COACH BOZZELLA: That's twofold. I did a stinky job of getting her opened, and
she did a bad job of adjusting to it. She's adjusted to it a lot better in the
past. She had no offensive rebounds. She had six in the first half against
Marquette, she had a bunch against St.John's. She's got to do a better job,
but ultimately I, as the boss of the program, have to do a better job of
getting her better looks, and I didn't.  
  
Q. Dee Dee, did the foul trouble affect you throughout this game?  
KA‑DEIDRE SIMMONS: No, I still played aggressive. This is the championship
game. I don't really care about fouls. It`s do or die at this moment.  
COACH BOZZELLA: I didn't even know she had four fouls. I'll be honest with
you.  
KA‑DEIDRE SIMMONS: It's the championship game. Leave it all out on the court,
and that's exactly what I did.  
COACH BOZZELLA: Exactly.  
  
Q. Do you think this tournament should be held somewhere else besides ‑‑  
COACH BOZZELLA: No. I think DePaul has done a great job. I think their
athletic director stepped up and saved our tournament because when because,
when we divided in the Big East, no one wanted to host it, and she stepped up,
and that's why she's one of the best athletic directors in the country. She
did a great job of stepping up and getting us this facility and getting the
people here to support us and everything. Ultimately, yes, I do think it needs
to be moved off, but I think for these two years the Big East has chosen a
great site with great people to host this tournament. Yeah, does it stink that
we had to play there? Absolutely. But it stinks to ‑‑ as opposed to not
playing here, I`d rather do that do that. It`s our fault. We've played around
the world many times.  
Do I think it needs to be moved? Of course, eventually, but I give Jeanie and
her staff and the people in the Big East so much credit to get us a great
facility like this in a great area, I can't thank the Big East enough and
DePaul. They're a first‑class school and University.  
  
Q. Is there any structure to this tournament you think needs to be
altered?  
COACH BOZZELLA: Yeah, we need to score more points in the championship game.
No, the tournament is fine. They've done it professionally. The Big East
people are tremendous. Pam, who's been our point person, couldn't be any
better. I couldn't be more pleased with the staff of the Big East and how
we've won everything here. The thing that stinks is we did not win, and that
stinks. I'm not happy about it and neither are the players. But ultimately I
have to take responsibility for that, and I will.  
  
Q. Your team led the Big East in field goal percentage defense at 37 percent
this year. DePaul shot almost 20 percent more than that. Do you have any
explanation for that?  
COACH BOZZELLA: That's a great point. I do, and that's a great question. I
think our offense really dictated the way we played defense. We were like down
and depressed and frustrated and annoyed, and we hadn't done that. Against
Marquette we couldn't score a basket forever. Against St. John`s they played
great defense. We struggled to score, but our defense set us up. And today our
offense dictated our defense, and that stinks. We said in the game plan, keep
them out of the lane. They scored 30 points in the lane. They had scored 32 in
the first two games. Unacceptable.  
And again, because on the offensive end we were out of our mind. But again,
you have to understand, I took over a program 27 wins in the combined three
years. We have 28 this year. This is not a group of kids that have played at a
high level like this under the high pressure that we have. Again, we're all
new to this. I know we have grad students and this, but none of them played in
this game, and there certainly was no success before I took over this program.
These kids, they were nervous, and I didn't help them at all, and that's my
fault. But at the end of the day, they're 28‑5 and I'm proud of them more than
any team I've ever coached in my life because they left everything on the
floor. They won a Big East regular season championship. They got to the Big
East Finals beating a tremendous St.John's team in the semifinals, and you
know what, we're going to learn from this, and when we play next weekend,
we're going to be ready to play that team.  
  
Q. When the game is all done, did you want your team to hang out on the
court and remember that feeling of losing?  
COACH BOZZELLA: No, and I'm sorry we left the court, but we didn't understand,
do we stay, do we go. That wasn't explained properly. If you ask one thing, I
would like to have been told: The game ends, both teams stay on the floor,
this is what happens. No one told me that. I'll take responsibility that we
walked off the floor. It stinks. No, I didn't want them to see it, but if
that's the rule, then we have to see it. It's fine. Listen, we don't need to
rub it in. These kids are hurting. That's fine. But again, that's what we do
and that's how to do it, then we should have stayed, but I needed that
explained to me, I did. If you ask one thing I`m upset about, I wish someone
had said to me before the game this is what we do at the end of the game.
That's all. That's okay. Next year when we win, then we'll know what we're
doing. And it would have been easier. If we won, we wouldn't have to worry.  
  
Q. I know you've talked about this before but just one last look at your
team's résumé overall, I feel like you've been disrespected at times. Do you
feel that way?  
COACH BOZZELLA: No. I mean, I think the only thing that bothers me a little
bit is I get up here and I talk about how great all the teams are that we
play. Very few coaches have said to us, you know what, that's some rebuilding
job Seton Hall has done, that's some group of players they've put together.
That's some program they have that's representing the Big East. But I will
tell you this, I think we have nine other great teams in this conference. I
think it's a tremendous conference that deserves a lot more than two teams in
the NCAA Tournament. Unfortunately, we're only going to get two teams because
Villanova had people injured and St.John's played a little inconsistent at
points. But St. John`s and Villanova are as good as any of the 64 teams that
are going to play in the NCAA Tournament, I`ll tell you that right now.
Creighton would beat a lot of teams, as well.  
So no, it's not‑‑ we'll get respect from the right people. Certainly our
administration has respected us more than anything, and certainly, I think
DePaul and St.John's showed a lot of respect because they played their butts
off against us. I've said this many times. I know Kathy is back here, but I
want to build our program to have the success that St.John's has had year in
and year out. You know what, we're starting to get that way. But you know
what, we've got to continue to understand how difficult it is to win and the
higher the level is, the more frustrating it is, the better you have to play,
and St.John's has done that. St.John's last year lost in this game, they did,
and then went and won an NCAA game. We need to do that. That's what we need to
do. I give them a lot of credit for it, and if we want to be a high level
program and be talked about like the DePauls and the St. Johns and the
Villanovas, we need to make the next step and win a game. Hopefully more. But
that`s why I do feel we do deserve a good seed, because this is a good
basketball program, and we've proved it all year.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 9, 2015

  

### [Alfiyyah Handford](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28425)

### [Joe Tartamella](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24904)

_ROSEMONT, ILLINOIS_  
  

Seton Hall  72  
St. John's - 60

  
COACH TARTAMELLA: I thought we started the game off pretty well with some good
energy and some good execution, and I thought we never really got ourselves
comfortable once we started to get a little stagnant offensively. I thought
some foul trouble, some shot selection that wasn't great hurt us in some of
their run to take the lead in the first half. Giving up eight threes in the
first half is not a recipe for success.  
And then coming out in the second half, we just could not break‑‑ we had a
chance to cut it to 10, which I thought would be big, and then we turned it
over for points. I thought we did our best to get ourselves back in. We just
never really got comfortable. They did a good job of keeping us off balance at
times.  
You know, we've got to get ready and hopefully we'll be playing in a
postseason tournament in a week or so.  
  
Q. Aliyyah, what is it that Seton Hall does that can make them so tough to
stop at times?  
ALIYYAH HANDFORD: To be honest, nothing. It's just the way we go out. They're
a great team, but we're also a great team, too, so it's just the way that we
come out.  
  
Q. What went wrong for you guys in this one?  
ALIYYAH HANDFORD: Our defense wasn't how it was the beginning of the game. It
was sluggish.  
  
Q. Jade, did you feel like ‑‑ you had a really strong performance. What more
could you have done as a team to pull this out?   
JADE WALKER: I think if we'd have got on the boards more and limited second
chance opportunities for the other team, maybe played a little bit better
defense on, like, the pick and pop, we could have got some more possessions,
and it probably would have been better in our favor.  
  
Q. Aliyyah, for you, this is tough right now, but next year looks really
bright for this program. How much do you look forward to something like
that?  
ALIYYAH HANDFORD: We've just got to get in the gym. We're going to be a much
better team next year, or this year, so look forward to it.  
  
Q. You out ‑rebounded them tonight, but you were up 13‑7, Seton Hall goes on
a 23‑8 run. What is it that they do? I know Aliyyah really said, nothing,
we're a good team. Is there something they do that makes them so good?  
COACH TARTAMELLA: Give Aliyyah a little bit of cushion there. She just came
off a loss, so I don't want to phrase it like nothing, all right. However,
Seton Hall obviously if you watch the first game and you watch them all year,
they pick their points to pressure you and to try to turn it over, try to make
you play faster, and there were points tonight that I thought they did that,
and that was part of it. I think they think they're going to speed you up and
when you start taking bad shots, they pressure you, they take you out of
things you want to do. It makes it difficult. When we have to go to our bench
at times or we're in foul trouble or we're putting different lineups out, we
struggle, that's not a secret, and tonight was no different.  
To their credit they kept us off balance with the pressure. I think that's
what they've been good at. If you look at a lot of their games they've made
some significant comebacks in games because of that pressure, and they can
make shots. So it's a big part. They're an experienced team. It's a team that
I've probably‑‑ and I don't know if I'll see it again‑‑ hopefully we don't see
it again‑‑ of players who have six‑year experience, five‑year experience and
older guys in different classes. It's a veteran group that's impressive. And
for that ‑‑ I'm happy for a kid like Dee Dee Simmons who I love, who I know
well, that she has an opportunity in her career now, at least in her last
year, to get a chance to play in the NCAA Tournament. For them, I wish them
the best, and we move on.  
  
Q. How good is it to have Seton Hall, St.John's really be a rivalry in this
league, that both these programs are playing at such a high level in this
league?  
COACH TARTAMELLA: I think it's nice to have. You know, and the existence of
it, I think it's a rivalry because we had players that were teammates, and so
with a little bit of that graduation part, some of that goes away. But it's
always good‑‑ it's great to have co‑champs in the league. That's big. When you
have Seton Hall and DePaul having great years, that's a big thing for the
league. That means we've got good parity. I think you've got a lot of teams
that can play. The rivalry pieces, I think new rivalries will be born because
of the league. I think you've got the old rivalries from some of the teams
that were in the existing league.  
But it's always ‑‑ I think people want to watch those kind of games. For us
it's big, and it's great to see the league improving and getting better, and
as coaches and for our programs and for our universities, that's the bigger
picture for our league.  
So I'm excited about the future. I'm excited about what we have in finishing
our year, and then looking forward, and I'm proud of the fact that we have a
program that has sustained success‑‑ and not talking about that was the
biggest thing about one year, talking about a sustained success over time, and
that's something that our kids are proud of, and we'll continue to do that.  
  
Q. When Aliyyah Handford and Amber Thompson both pick up two fouls early on,
how difficult was it to go to your bench, kind of stray away from what you've
been doing all season long? Yesterday you only played six players.  
A.It's hard. We had to give some kids an opportunity today. I thought the game
was still in a good area at that time, so we went with it. I can go back and
look at it, and we had to get Aliyyah back in to give her some more offense.
Again, with about four minutes to go, amber sat. There might have been two or
three possessions that hurt us on some of the personnel that were in and some
of the things they did to make it work, but a lot of our mistake were
self‑inflicted on the defensive end, where we just didn't do the things we had
done, whether we want to talk about legs and a lot of that stuff, it doesn't
matter. There's no excuses on it. Seton Hall was the better team today. They
played better than us in stretches and they beat us.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S

DePaul  58  
Villanova - 55

  
COACH PERRETTA: I just thought if you watched the game, it was a great college
basketball game. That's the way I saw it. We played probably as well as we
could. We managed to chew the clock up, keep their points down. Our turners
were under 15, which I thought we had to do to stay in the game, and it
basically came down to the end, who could make enough plays to win the game,
which they did and we didn't. I don't think there's anything else to say.
Sometimes you play that day the best you could, sometimes you win, sometimes
you lose. I've been doing this a long time, and all you can ask the kids to do
is play hard, which they did. They made some mistakes. Our younger players
made a couple crucial mistakes, but that's part of the game. But I thought our
upperclassmen really hung in there and played really well.  
  
Q. Emily, you take a look at this match ‑up, and Coach Bruno brought it up
that it's really your style. That's the way that this game really went. You
still were able to get your style, although you didn't come out on top, that
had to be a goal, but what did this really come down to in your eyes?   
EMILY LEER: I think that this game really came down to defense and just some
crucial plays, like we talked about the turnovers. When we make a turnover,
DePaul really scored off of it, and that really hurt us. We had a couple at
the end of the game that they converted, and plays like that, then we're
playing catch‑up when that happens. And catch‑up isn't necessarily the way
that we're good at playing basketball, so I think that really hurt us in the
end.  
CAROLINE COYER: I agree with her. It really just comes down to a few plays. We
missed some shots, they missed some shots, too. Just a few crucial plays where
they were able to capitalize and we weren't.  
  
Q. What did you think that Megan Podkowa did so well tonight?  
EMILY LEER: Everything. She hit the threes, hit the post‑up moves and drove to
the basket. She took advantages when there was miscommunications, and I think
that hurt us a lot. You know, I tried doing a good job guarding her, but she
made some good reads. She's a good player.  
  
Q. Caroline, you look at the season as a whole, and with all the unfortunate
things that happened to this team, you guys could have folded at one point,
but what was it that this season came down to, to catch you guys from doing
that and from getting to this point?  
CAROLINE COYER: You know, I think you're right, there's been a lot of
unfortunate things, injuries and everything. I think that what it is is we all
just really care for one another so much. We're great friends. We love our
upperclassmen, our seniors. Every season is important for different reasons.
That's when ‑‑ you're right, we could have folded, and it was frustrating at
times, and at times we were all yelling and screaming at each other and we all
hate each other, but that's kind of like what a family does. So we all, I
think, just continue to work hard and push through and try to get better each
and every game for each other.  
  
Q. You've been doing this a long time ‑‑  
COACH PERRETTA: Too long.  
  
Q. What is it about this team that really kept them from folding, from
staying on it?  
COACH PERRETTA: This team actually became a really fun team to coach. It's a
shame because I think that we actually are an NCAA team now, but we don't have
enough wins, obviously, whatever, because we were injured so much early in the
year, but it's just the way it goes. But they really did pull themselves
together. We were 3‑7 at one point and we were dead in the water. They just
kept plugging away, and obviously getting players back obviously helps, but I
think when we got the players back, the kids who had played earlier in the
year understood that they had to go back to being role players. If they didn't
understand that, then you would have had team problems.  
Once they accepted the fact that, hey‑‑ I said it in a nice way, I'm really
sorry but we're losing because you're playing a lot. I don't mean it
derogatory, but that's what it is. If you know what you are, then you can
become a better player, so those guys became role players, and they accepted
their roles of being role players, and then we started to get good, because
our team is based on role playing. We don't have a lot of individual kids who
can break you down off the dribble, so if you can't accept your role on our
team, then we can't be good. So I think that's what was the biggest thing.  
I told somebody one day, I said the most dangerous player in the world is a
kid who thinks they're good and they're not. If you know you're not good and
you can just play a role, then you help the team. But if you think you're
good, then you've got problems.  
  
Q. What do you think about this conference? What's the next step for it to
really gain some ground?  
COACH PERRETTA: Well, it reminds me of the Big East when we first started
years ago. I'm talking about years ago when we were getting only two teams‑‑ I
think we had 12 teams in the league and we were only getting two at the time.
And what happened was it takes time. Over the years the other teams got
better. One of our problems, and I said this the other day, is ‑‑ one of our
problems is we have six teams that are decent. You don't want to have six
teams that are decent. You want to have three teams that are really good and
then everybody else gets beat. We have six teams that are decent, so therefore
the four, five, and six teams appear to be not as strong. You follow? And then
the top teams appear not to be as strong because the fours, fives and sixes
beat them on occasion. If you look at the leagues that get more bids it's that
the top teams never lose to the bottom teams. Parity is not a good thing. You
don't want parity. Parity is everybody is 9‑9\. You want four teams to be
basically undefeated against the bottom teams and only beat each other. But
that shows you that the league is pretty strong. We have six pretty good
teams, I think.

Villanova - 55

  
COACH BRUNO: Villanova and Coach Perretta do a really good job. He's one of
the best coaches in college basketball, and had they not had injuries early in
the season and started on the road, they'd be in contention for an NCAA berth.
That's a really good basketball team once they got whole. People ask me all
the time why don't you get them into our tempo. We can get them into our
tempo, but to get them into our tempo, I have to give up some things that I
don't want to give up in playing against them. So we've been playing them this
way since we got into the Big East, and it doesn't give our fans the 80‑ and
90‑point game, but it does give them a little bit of drama, especially the way
we finished tonight.  
I thought it was really important that Brittany Hrynko here, who wasn't having
necessarily one of her signature games, did a real good job of understanding
down the stretch that Megan Podkowa was our go‑to player at that point and did
a great job of helping us get the ball to Megan and Megan answered the bell.
Coach Harry was trying to isolate around Megan, and I thought Megan did a
great job of accepting that challenge and still coming back the other way, and
I thought Brit led the team to getting Megan the ball and then Megan answered
down low. So I thought that was very, very key and very important.  
Our team this year has lost only to ranked teams, and Villanova once on the
night that we lost Megan Rogowski. This team that's sitting here at 25‑7 has
only had one defeat to a non‑ranked basketball team, and the ranked teams that
have beaten us, only Connecticut blew us, and yet they blew us with a 34‑‑
they didn't beat us a lot more than they beat No.1 South Carolina, so UConn is
really pretty good. I just want to make a point here that we've had a lot of
experience this year in close games. Notre Dame, we had beat, and it was a
close game that took it to overtime; Northwestern, double overtime; Villanova
overtime, so I just hope the experience that we had in all these close games
is going to bode well as we move into March, which is all about nothing but
close games.  
Again, it's always the players. The players won the game tonight. I'm really
proud of my basketball team that we're going to survive to play a very, very
good Seton Hall team tomorrow night for the Big East championship.  
  
Q. Coach talked about it a little bit where you all kind of played the floor
with tempo. When you're so used to playing a high, fast tempo, how much of an
adjustment is that?  
MEGAN PODKOWA: Well, I don't really feel like there's much of an adjustment
for me because I'm in the backcourt of it, and I'm never really the one run
that's running around chasing the ball, so I think this might be a question
for Brittney.  
BRITTANY HRYNKO: I don't think it's that much of a difference. We still up the
court, we still have pressure on the ball. We're still doing what we're
usually doing. So I guess it's just a matter of how fast we're going.  
  
Q. You guys were here last year, making it all the way to the Big East
final. You guys come back again. How does that experience help when playing
these really close games, then getting tired legs going into tomorrow?  
BRITTANY HRYNKO: Just having the experience, I guess, is good for us, but at
the same time we can't just come into the game just thinking we're going to
win. We have to come in with the same energy and just keep playing hard. Us
and Seton Hall both had tough games, so both our legs are going to be tired,
but it's just a matter of coming in ready to play.  
MEGAN PODKOWA: Yeah, I definitely think the experience from last year has
helped so far and, like she said, come in prepared for tomorrow. We can't get
overexcited. We have to come ready and have the same energy that we had
tonight .  
  
Q. Knowing that you were going to get the ball down the stretch, what was
your offensive mindset during that time?  
MEGAN PODKOWA: I'm definitely trying to be more aggressive with every game. I
think it was just either get the ball in or get it back out if I was double
teamed or my teammates. Like Coach Bruno said, all the guards did a great of
getting me the ball. They found me on the three, found me inside, so I have to
credit it all to the guards.  
  
Q. Brit, when you were out there playing, you're missing shots, what's going
through your head as you come back in the second half? We saw kind of your
facial expression after getting two quick fouls, going into halftime what did
Coach say to you or your teammates say to you?  
BRITTANY HRYNKO: Nothing, just me staying focused. Coach never says nothing to
me when I'm missing shots, it's just a matter of me staying focused, not
getting down on myself, and my teammates telling me to keep playing, I got it,
just keep shooting the ball. I wasn't making lay‑ups so I was getting mad at
myself, but at the same time my teammates were, like, Brit, stay focused, you
got it, you're going to make the next one. So it was just a matter of them
keeping me up and myself ‑‑ keeping myself together.  
  
Q. And Megan, on a low block coach is calling your number, the ball was
coming in. You had like an array of moves down low. Do you still ‑‑ like
looking ahead to Seton Hall like that's something you want to do, establish
yourself on the low block or it is more of stretching out and trying to get
the players to come out on you and open up the driving lanes for some of your
guards?  
MEGAN PODKOWA: I definitely prefer to play on the perimeter, but I do think
I'll have to do a little bit of both. Definitely I'll have to get out to the
three‑point line and open up so that the big girl has to come out and guard me
and our guards can go drive and get some people in foul trouble maybe. But I
also have to have a presence in the post. I don't think we really had too much
of that in the last two Seton Hall games, so I need to get in there and use
some of those moves to try to score inside.  
  
Q. You folks didn't come out until halftime until there were three minutes
and 20 seconds left on the halftime clock. What did you talk about at
halftime?  
COACH BRUNO: We understand how to play Villanova and we understand that it's a
grind, and that's a tribute to Coach Perretta, and believe me, if we could
turn this into an 80 pointer we would, but it's just not that easy to do. We
just talked about grinding it out, talked about winning a half‑‑ having to win
the next second half, and talking about just staying strong and staying
mentally focused. Nothing major. We talked offensively about finding offensive
answers. I always say it's UConn's dirty little secret how good defensively
they are because they're so efficient offensively, you lose sight of how good
UConn is defensively. Same thing with Villanova. They're a very good defensive
team, and you really have to find answers. I thought we found some answers in
the second half, so we talked about that we had to stay the course defensively
and then where we were going to try to find some answers offensively in some
of the things that we have in our repertoire.  
  
Q. Tomorrow you go up against Seton Hall, who you have lost twice this
season. How do you plan to go in and try and guard that three ‑guard attack
that they've used to well?   
COACH BRUNO: Well, Seton Hall has had a really great year, and at the same
time, I just want to first of all go on record because I know Coach Tony is
telling Richardson‑Smith that none of the coaches in the league voted for her
for first team, so I was using that as impetus. If you go look at the votes, I
think Pam is in there somewhere. We voted her at least‑‑ I know at least two
of our top threes players were ‑‑ Richardson Smith was in the ‑‑ she had 38
against us at the Hall, and she made three great stops against us defensively
in Chicago, so it was one of our highest vote getters along with another Seton
Hall player. So I just want to make sure that you guys all make sure that
Richardson‑Smith‑‑ make sure you do that, okay, just in case you‑‑ at any
rate, that's somethingthat I want to get out.  
They're a good team because they have three really, really good guards and
those guards are really hard match‑ups and they're really hard to guard. We
had a real tough game against St.John's in New York, and that was on a Friday,
and then we didn't have a whole lot left in the tank on Sunday. And we
probably played our worst game of the year and Seton Hall probably played one
of their best games. When that happens, you get a blowout, and the blowout
itself, we were still in that game. It wasn't quite like the score at the end,
and so I thought we came back and had a real good game plan in Chicago, and I
thought we put ourselves in position to win the game in Chicago, and then Dee
Dee made a great play at the end of the game, Brit made a great shot at the
end of the game, Dee Dee mad a great play at the end of the game, and you
know, it's an 81‑80 basketball game.  
So I think we know that we can play with people as good as Seton Hall, and I
think Seton Hall is a really, really good team. Having played against UConn
and Notre Dame and the Texas A&M when they were whole, Seton Hall, and all ‑‑
five of five teams in our league that I guarantee you, five teams in this
league would not‑‑ people in the ACC, Southeastern Conference, Big Ten,
PAC‑12, and Big 12 don't want to play us five. They wouldn't want us five in
their league, and I'm just telling you that Seton Hall is a really, really
good team. We should be prepared for it based on the schedule that we play. We
played a really difficult schedule, so we should be ready. But winning three
times in a row is something that isn't standard. You know how gassed everybody
is, everybody is playing on fumes tomorrow night, but it's the same for both
teams.  
  
Q. In anticipation of the fact that you're probably ‑‑ your squad as well as
Seton Hall is going to be out of gas, as you say, on fumes, do you think
you'll still use your full court press?   
COACH BRUNO: Yeah, I really think we'll take a look at it. I'm not trying to
evade the question right now, but at the same time what's going to be the
wisest way to play Seton Hall is what we're going to do. I'm not one of those
coaches that's really overly stubborn about‑‑ the end result is that our
players have the higher score at the end of the game. Yeah, we have a system
and we like to score the ball, and we like to share the ball, and we like to
shoot the ball, often at the same time, whatever it's going to take to be able
to defend and rebound against a very good Seton Hall team. That's going to be
what we're going to do.  
I'm not really ready to answer the question because I'm not really sure what
we're‑‑ how we're going to attack them, but I think it should be a really,
really good basketball team. They have three really good guards, and so do we.

_ROSEMONT, ILLINOIS_  
  

Seton Hall  72  
St. John's - 60

  
COACH BOZZELLA: First of all, I congratulate St.John's on another 20‑win
season. Certainly they set a high bar. When I took over this job, I said I
wanted to get our program to the level of success each year that St.John's
has, so I give them a LOT of credit and I congratulate them. I certainly
congratulate Amber Thompson. She's one of the most ferocious rebounders I've
coached against in my 23 years as a coach. She's a tremendous competitor and a
tremendous player.  
We are obviously very pleased. I knew this game was going to come down to
toughness and grittiness and the ability to defend, things we struggled with
on a consistent basis this year, but we spent the last week before we came
here working on our defense a lot, and it showed. Yesterday and today, our
defense is what won us‑‑ why we're the second highest‑scoring team in the
league and 19th in the country. Defense is what won us these two games. I'm
very proud of the girls for understanding and dedicating themselves to making
that effort.  
On the other hand, we did need some offense. The lady to my right made some ‑‑
big shot after big shot like she has in so many big games, and the lady to my
left has proven time and time again that she's one of the elite point guards
not only in the Big East, but in the country, and the best leader I've ever
had in 23 years.  
With that said, we're going to the Big East Finals, and I'm really proud of
the kids.  
  
Q. Janee, you're down 13 ‑7 early on, and then you go on a 23‑8 run and you
really got on fire. What was the key for you to getting in rhythm?   
JANEE JOHNSON: Just my teammates giving me the ball. They would dribble into
the lane and kind of make the defense collapse and feed me the ball to me. I
just think knock it down. Did it time and time again in practice, knock it
down.  
  
Q. And for you, Dee Dee, you've been knocked out by St.John's each of the
past two Big East tournaments. You know that feeling. What does this win mean
to get over the hump past a team that's gotten you before?  
KA‑DEIDRE SIMMONS: It means a lot for the program. It shows how far we have
come, and just how hard work pays off. We know what type of team St.John's is.
They are a great team. They're very athletic, great players, and we feel as
though we can run with them, and my team kept their composure today, and they
knew what today's game meant, and we went out there and executed the game plan
really well.  
  
Q. How important was it early on to get St.John's in foul trouble?  
KA‑DEIDRE SIMMONS: Well, we know that they have great players, and they do a
really good job with getting into your body and stuff like that, so the
referees were really on it today, and St.John's is very aggressive. So it was
a no‑brainer, the fouls that were called on them, the charges, the push‑offs
and stuff like that, very important to‑‑ they can't beat us if their best
players are on the bench, and that was key today.  
  
Q. Dee Dee, Aliyyah Handford picking up two fouls in the first half, what
did that mean?  
KA‑DEIDRE SIMMONS: It was big for us. We know that they really can't go deep
into their bench, so once she got in foul trouble, it was our time to attack.
Don't look to really pass the ball, but just attack and constantly drive the
ball to the basket, and when they collapse, kick the ball. It was key because
they really don't have anybody to come off the bench to replace what Aliyyah
can bring to the game. And that's where we took advantage.  
  
Q. Janee, battling in the paint with Amber and Jade Walker as well, what was
at that like?  
JANEE JOHNSON: They're some of the toughest competitors I play against in the
Big East. It's always a great match‑up. They're just really fierce players.
Like Coach said, Amber is one of the best rebounders in the conference, and
it's really tough, and we just got it done today. It was great.  
  
Q. Dee Dee and Janee, the years you've been with this program, did you see
your freshman year ever being in the Big East Finals down the road?  
KA‑DEIDRE SIMMONS: No. I always thought that by my junior year on the court
that we were going to be pretty good. I don't know why, I just always said my
junior year we're going to be pretty good, and my junior year on the court was
last year, and we made great strides last year, and this year is even better.
But nothing as big as this. This is the moment I dream of. I wake up every
morning thinking of this moment, and I couldn't have done it without this man
to my right and my teammate Janee and the rest of my teammates.  
  
Q. St.John's, were they approaching each of you defensively differently?  
KA‑DEIDRE SIMMONS: They were switching it up defensively. Amber ended up
guarding Daisha at one point, Handford was guarding me, then Lewis was
guarding me. We just took advantage of who was guarding us. We saw an opening
and our coach made great play calls, we executed and we attacked the basket
and we kicked when we needed to.  
  
Q. Dee Dee, first of all, this has been such a special season for you guys
setting multiple different records. As your final year with this program, what
is it like to have the opportunity to play in the Big East championship?  
KA‑DEIDRE SIMMONS: It's a moment that I'll never forget. It's a moment that I
can always look back to and just rethink of the great memories that we've done
and that we have. I don't know, it hasn't hit me yet. It will, but it's just a
great moment, and I'm really, really blessed to be a part of it.  
  
Q. Janee, Coach has come in and had so much success with this program in
just two years, and he's come in with some postseason experience and success,
so what are the different kind of messages that he's been giving to you guys
in these few days to get you guys excited and motivated?  
JANEE JOHNSON: Well, he's always instilled, like, the idea of family, so he
just reiterated, love each other, believe in each other, believe in what each
teammate can bring to the table, and that's what we've done. Everybody has
their role and their understanding, and everybody has executed that.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about going into tomorrow how you, as a leader, keep
your team playing at this level and not getting too excited for the game to
finish and win that championship?  
KA‑DEIDRE SIMMONS: I always tell my team, one possession at a time. People
constantly say, oh, one game at a time, take it one game at a time, but I tell
my team one possession at a time. We try to dominate every possession whether
it's get a deflection, get a loose ball, or make them take a tough shot,
anything like that is something that we need to focus in on. And that's what I
tell my team. We don't look ahead. That's not something we do, and that's
something we haven't done all year. We take it one possession at a time, and
when the game comes, we just play. We execute the game plan, and it's always a
great game plan. We stay within ourselves, we stay within the system, which we
all believe in, and just one possession at a time.  
  
Q. Janee, those threes at the top of the key, is that your shot? Is that
what you're looking for? Has Coach been telling you to knock that down?  
JANEE JOHNSON: Yes, absolutely, since we've started the season. Actually it
started last season, and it happened in the Villanova game, I think I hit two,
and ever since then, he's just, like, take that shot. Don't hesitate, take it.
And I find myself hesitating at times. Like, don't hesitate. And so that's
really been my best shot of the season.  
  
Q. After struggling to get the three going in the first half last night or
last afternoon, how big was it to get eight threes in the first half
tonight?  
COACH BOZZELLA: Well, it was huge. They came out with the idea of facing Tab,
and a month ago Tab would have been out of her mind and wouldn't have been
able to function. But Tab has grown up so much this year but so much in the
past month. I'm so proud of her. And you know what, we set a couple screens,
she was patient, she knocked down a coupling, and then obviously they're going
to leave that extra spacing ‑‑ by denying Tab, they're going to give us more
spacing. That's when people like Janee come in and get an open shot, and she
did.  
You know, it's funny, someone asked a great question, Janee made two threes
this year. She's made, what, 50 this year because she's worked hard and she
believes in it, and one of the things we instill as a coaching staff is being
positive. So much negativity in this world, there's too much negativity, and
we stress the positives, and we have pushed Janee and we have positived her to
the end, shoot the shot, shoot the shot, and you know what, she's won a lot of
games for us because of it. She's the first one on the court shooting. If we
didn't have that hour rule, she would have been out here three hours shooting
before the game. I'm proud of her.  
  
Q. You mentioned Ka ‑Deidre being one of the best leaders‑‑ the best leader
you've had in your time coaching. This is a team, though, that's got three
grad students in your starting lineup and all upperclassmen. How much do you
rely upon them and the years that they have logged now as players?  
COACH BOZZELLA: So much, and thank you. That's a great question because we
talk about this with those young ladies, it's a marriage, and a marriage is
about give and take, and a marriage is about understanding each other, and I
can do that with a group like this. They've been around, they've played a lot
of games, they're an experienced bunch, so it's not a dictatorship. I ask them
a lot, what do you think? I must have asked Dee Dee eight times tonight what
do you want to run? Because I'm not out there playing. I have to give up
freedom and I have to let them play because they've earned that through the
years of, A, all their life, but B, how they come to practice every day. I
said to the kids today in film, those are really intelligent questions. I'm
really glad you asked.  
Honestly, I've done this for 23 years. That's not a norm, but those three kids
aren't a norm. It's very rare to have three grad kids on you team and another
senior in Chiz and another junior in Tab. I say this all the time, it's
marriage. It's give and take, we love each other, we're going to fight a
little bit. At the end of the day, we have to trust each other, and I trust
them immensely, I do..  
  
Q. Towards the end of the game what were your words saying to Dee Dee? You
called her over when you draw the foul what words did you have for her?  
COACH BOZZELLA: I was so proud of her because when I took over this job, not a
lot of people believed that we could be successful, and a lot of people didn't
buy in, and she did. I'll never forget the story from the middle of our first
year. I was complaining to my recruiting coordinator who coached with me, and
we fight all the time, but I was complaining to her that I can't believe Dee
Dee is not leading better, I can't believe this, and she said, Coach, you're
struggling to lead this time right now. People are fighting, people are this.
You need to have her back better and you need to understand that it's hard for
her to lead this team until you're ready to lead this team. And you know what?
That was the best piece of advice I've gotten, and you know what? I brought
Dee Dee in and I made sure she knew I had her back, and I made sure that when
Dee Dee was struggling, I was there to pick her up because someone needed to.
And you know what? She blossomed so much as a leadership. I have two of my
former point guards on staff, and they talk to Dee Dee all the time. They
deserve a lot of credit, but most of all Dee Dee deserves 99 percent of the
credit because of the person she is and the belief she has. She loves Seton
Hall University. She really does.  
  
Q. I know you guys had the run into the WNIT last year but we heard the
numbers at the beginning, first time in the semifinals in just about 20 years,
tomorrow first time in the championship in 20 years. The way your team has
come out in these two games, it looks like you guys have been there before.
What is it about this group that allows them to come out with such a
confidence and such a calmness on the court?  
COACH BOZZELLA: Well, I think Amy said it, when you have two graduate
students, they're a little older. But we instill confidence. It's about
positivity. As you can see I'm a very passionate coach, and this team loves
the passion. This team follows that. It's not hard. They come out, we try and
make them confident, we make the plan simple. They know we're in this
together, and at the end of the day they know we have their back. I think it's
important nowadays for kids and players to know that the coaches have their
back.  
You know, we're going to have bad days. They're going to have bad days, but
that's when we supposed to be there for them, when they miss a couple shots,
they have a bad game, we're down. We've come back, I think, six or seven times
from double‑digit deficits this year. That's not a norm. But again, you have
to understand that, you know what, we're going to have our struggles. That's
when you need to be more positive and that's when you need to support them,
and the staff has done a great job of that, and I'm proud of the kids for it.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2015

  

### [Brian Neal](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28397)

  
_ROSEMONT, ILLINOIS_  
  

DePaul  87  
Xavier - 53

  
COACH NEAL: Well, I thought DePaul played like a really good team, a
tournament experienced team. I thought we played like a pretty average team.
It was not an experienced tournament team. They just punish you for the things
that you don't do that you should have done or the mistakes you make, and just
put so much pressure on you in so many ways, and then of course when they get
hot, it's a double whammy. We got whipped, and I don't know how else you
describe it.  
  
Q. Coach, obviously this isn't the way you wanted tonight to go, but in the
grand scheme of things, you doubled the win total from a year ago and you got
your first winning season for this program since 2010 ‑11\. What can you say
about all that you've accomplished this year?  
COACH NEAL: Well, starting the year, our goal, it might sound crazy, we knew
we're not winning the Big East championship this year, we're not at that level
yet. But we are trying to make those strides, and I think the things you
mentioned, our coaching staff knows where we are in the progression of things.
Certainly, we would have liked to have done a little bit better tonight, but
we're not in DePaul's class right now. They're in another world, and we've got
to now take the growth we've had this season and move forward and hopefully
narrow that gap a little bit next year.  
  
Q. Where do you see yourself next year?  
COACH NEAL: Well, I don't know. We have a large corps of players coming back
who have gotten some experience, and we have a couple nice newcomers. We have
a young lady sitting out who's going to give you more of a post presence for
sure and then we have a freshman transfer, a freshman next year who I think is
going to be a special player in the league one of these days. So I'm really
excited about those guys.  
And then we have one of our best point guards who was out with an ACL in
December. So those three players, when we get those guys back, we're going to
be a more talented team, a bigger team, so we'll see. But we have a lot of
work to do to get those guys involved.  
  
Q. What is it about DePaul's press that makes them so hard to deal with?  
COACH NEAL: Well, you know, I don't think the press was the problem tonight.
We had ten turnovers, and look, we've got a lot of experience turning the ball
over against their press. Tonight I thought we executed pretty good. I thought
when we got the ball to the other end of the floor is when our decision making
went out the window.  
But DePaul, they play competently at a very fast level, and when we play at a
fast level, it's incompetent. It's bad decision making. That's where we've got
to learn to adjust to a faster speed. But the press, normally after one of
their games, they just overwhelm us with it. Tonight I thought we had pretty
good technique and did a pretty good job. In the first half, I bet eight of
our first ten turnovers were in the half court taking the ball out of bounds.  
But they have good athletes, they play hard and they keep it on you. That's I
guess the biggest reason why it's successful in general.

## March 8, 2015

  

### [Danaejah Grant](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28424)

### [Alfiyyah Handford](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28425)

  
_ROSEMONT, ILLINOIS_  
  

St. John's  57  
Creighton - 54

  
COACH TARTAMELLA: Another great postseason basketball game in a tournament
against Creighton, and we know‑‑ just really proud of our young ladies. I
thought coming into the half we did a great job of sustaining ourselves after
the first couple minutes of the game, which I thought was huge, and then we
persevered and we made plays and executed the game plan that we had set forth
over the week.  
When we do those things and when we guard how we're capable of doing, we are a
very good team, so I'm just truly proud of our effort, especially to finish
the game, tight situations and the magnitude of the game that we had, so very
proud of the effort, and we move on to tomorrow, so we know we're ready.  
  
Q. After trailing for most of the game getting closer and closer, how did it
feel to get over the hump and get that lead with about nine minutes to go?  
DANAEJAH GRANT: It felt good. It just showed us that we're able to with stand
blows. There was a lot of times we could have quit throughout the game, and I
think just to rally together and be able to overcome that was just great for
us moving into tomorrow.  
ALIYYAH HANDFORD: I think it was just our defense. We had to play better
defense, and that's what we did at the last stretch, and that helped us a lot.  
  
Q. You guys had trouble scoring to start off the game. I don't think you got
on the board until about 14 minutes to go into the first half. When the shots
aren't falling, you're having trouble getting to the lane, how do you
adjust?  
DANAEJAH GRANT: We adjusted by attacking. We tried to get to the foul line a
little more, so I was able to‑‑ just being able to see the ball go through the
net was good for us. Like I said, just to attack and not settle for jump shots
anymore.  
ALIYYAH HANDFORD: And we was driving, everyone would collapse, and we had
opened up for the post, so if we're not screwing, post can score too, so we've
got to look at that, too.  
  
Q. Sydney got off to a good start for them, really hot start, and then
looked like you switched Handford onto her, especially the second half. What
did you think of the way she defended her and kind of neutralized your
offense?  
Aliyyah, would you talk on what you were able to do in the second half to be
able to neutralize her?  
ALIYYAH HANDFORD: I just stopped her from going to her right hand. That's what
she was doing the whole time. I just got up in her and just played great
defense. It didn't matter what was going on, who was guarding her before. We
all guarded her as a team.  
  
Q. Rebounding seemed to be a big factor, especially in the second half, your
second ‑chance points. I guess what was the adjustment you guys made to kind
of be better in that area in the second half?   
DANAEJAH GRANT: We knew our shots weren't falling really all night. We didn't
really shoot that well from the floor, so we knew that we had to focus on
offensive rebounds because we kind of had an advantage on them down low. I
think we just focused on that and were able to convert.  
  
Q. Aliyyah, I'll ask you this. You were down by seven, three minutes into
the second half, but it seemed like at the same time you were still getting
what you wanted and it was your kind of style of play. Do you think that was
the case even though you were down by a lot at one point?  
ALIYYAH HANDFORD: Most of it was us not rushing. Even though we were down by
seven we still didn't take shots that we didn't need. We didn't rush, so what
you just stated was true.  
  
Q. Coach, when Lamberty was kind of getting what she wanted in the first
half, how hard of a decision was it to put Handford on her and what did you
think of the way she was able to ‑‑  
COACH TARTAMELLA: Yeah, I thought it was a big moment in the game, and I
thought Danaejah was doing a great job and I thought she got a little
fatigued, and we felt that‑‑ and I felt that Aliyyah gave us a chance maybe to
be a little bit quicker with her and trying to get her open. I thought Aliyyah
did a great job. We've struggled all year at times defensively, and as has
been discussed earlier, our style of playing is trying to make sure we're
going to guard and make the game sometimes a little ugly is okay. We play so
hard defensively at times, Aliyyah and Danaejah, not that I like to look at
it, played 40 minutes and 40 minutes and 40 minutes, but they're playing both
ends. It's so impressive to me as a coach to watch these ladies do it.  
I just thought Aliyyah did a great job, and Danaejah did a great job, too,
when we moved her off and did some great things. I was proud of their effort,
but I thought that was a big piece to the game, yeah.  
  
Q. On one side for Creighton, Rollerson really played well for them today,
but you said in the conference call on Wednesday you need to defend, but you
also need to figure out a way to get somebody going in your front court. How
important was that for amber?  
COACH TARTAMELLA: It was truly huge. When people look at this line, for 'Ber
as a senior, this is what you want your seniors to do. You want them to have
big moments in big time games. Her focus today and her energy level, whether
we had her playing big or small, it was fantastic, making catches off tough
passes from our guards, and for her to have 14 points to give us a little bit
of a cushion there in that third score maybe on a night when we were
struggling some other areas was crucial, along with her defense.  
But I thought Kyra Dunn, and many of you may not know, but Kyra Dunn was
unbelievable today, and I told her in the locker room, and for a kid who
hasn't played a lot of minutes for us all year, she was fantastic. You need
those kind of things to happen to win these types of games, and I thought
Aliyyah Handford has a double‑double, which is probably the first time she's
had that in a while, and that's a big piece, too. She had some huge put‑backs
at the end.  
  
Q. Final minutes, you were going back and forth with timeouts. What were you
thinking was going through your head in that final sequence, as well?  
COACH TARTAMELLA: Well, we had a foul to give, and we talked about fouling.
They were out of timeouts in that last sequence, so anything can really
happen. We could say foul and they come in and knock down a three. Whether
they had a play set up or not, we decided to roll it, and he got a shot, and
he got a shot last year, too.  
But when you've got six‑four running at you sometimes that helps. They
happened to miss it. They did get the put‑back. Thankfully they went for the
two and it worked out in our favor. But I thought we made some really big
momentum plays as far as put‑backs even when we missed. But the final sequence
is always tough. You're talking about not giving up threes to kids who can
bomb. You're talking about making sure we can be effective on the glass. I was
pleased with the sharpness that we had toward the end of the game, and quite
frankly, we hadn't been in a lot of‑‑ last year we were in so many of these
situations. This year has been a little bit different. I've got a young team
as far as youth and minutes, so I mean, I'm so pleased with where they are,
but you know what, we also know we've got an opportunity again tomorrow to
come back in here and get an opportunity to play against Seton Hall. We're
excited about that moving forward. But Creighton is a tremendous program.  
  
Q. I don't know if you mentioned it at halftime, but did you circle points
off turnovers in that area because it seemed like the difference you guys made
in the second half ended up being kind of the difference in the game.  
COACH TARTAMELLA: Yeah, I mean, any game‑‑ we've got to manufacture some
points here and there and turnovers are a big piece. To have 17 off of them
today is a big piece to the game. And that's part of your finishing and your
conversion. We did some really good things in some great areas. They got 38
percent from the field, 28 percent from three. Those are things that we pride
ourselves on. As someone mentioned before, 57‑54, we'll sign up for that and
walk away.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2015

  

### [Kurt Godlevske](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28442)

  
_ROSEMONT, ILLINOIS_  
  

Villanova  70  
Butler - 49

  
COACH GODLEVSKE: Well, we thought coming into this game that if we could do a
job on Caroline and Emily Leer and force the other girls to beat us that we
might have a chance. Obviously they have a full amount of weapons and did a
terrific job on shooting the basketball. I thought Alex Louin was really good
tonight.  
Really disappointed in our first half, though, effort‑wise from our girls and
was happier with how we played in the second half, how we executed, and I
thought Blaire was way more aggressive than she was in the first half with
turning the corner. So was Lex.  
But you've really got to tip your hat to Villanova. They've got five kids that
can really shoot it, and Harry's system is incredibly tough to defend.  
  
Q. You look at tonight, and when you're missing IJ and you're missing
Lauren, how much does that affect you?  
COACH GODLEVSKE: Well, I think it affects us a bunch because you can always
count on IJ for 10 rebounds and 10 points almost every night, and she's
someone we could have thrown it to on the inside, and also allows us to match
up better defensively with them man‑to‑man, and we didn't want to play any
zone. We kind of had a scheme with it coming in. But when Edwards got hot
there in the first half, it kind of forced us to get out of it with that big
hole. But it definitely played a part in it for us because it limited us.  
  
Q. You look at your first year here, and not much was expected in the
preseason but you proved a lot of people wrong and this program proved a lot
of people wrong. You had a first round bye in this tournament. How excited are
you for the future?  
COACH GODLEVSKE: We're extremely excited, and that's one of the first things
we just talked about in the locker room when I was addressing the younger
girls, that we've done a lot, we've accomplished a lot, we've had a fantastic
year in that regard, but we've got to find ways to continue to get better, and
we've got a terrific recruiting class coming in, and as a coaching staff we're
excited about it, to actually be setting loftier goals as we go forward.  
  
Q. What do you take away from this league as a whole this year?  
COACH GODLEVSKE: Oh, man, it is extremely difficult preparation‑wise every
night because everybody is almost different on a different level, with Harry's
system to guarding St.John's with their terrific athletes to how complicated
Creighton is with their five girls that they play and with his motion offense.
Preparation‑wise and grind and the strength of the players and the athleticism
and how well they're coached, you've got to be on every night or else you're
going to take it on the chin.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2015

  

### [Jim Flanery](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28426)

### [Sydney Lamberty](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28427)

### [Brianna Rollerson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28428)

  
_ROSEMONT, ILLINOIS_  
  

St. John's  57  
Creighton - 54

  
COACH FLANERY: This feels a lot like this year at this time where we‑‑
St.John's has ended essentially our season three of the last four years, NCAA
Tournament, and twice here in the conference tournament, all by one
possession. You know, it was a struggle to score today. Obviously Sydney had,
I thought, really a terrific first half and played really well, and Bree kind
of kept us in the game a little bit the second half, but we struggled to
score, and the big thing was we didn't rebound in the second half. I mean, we
gave up way too many offensive boards. We had 20 defensive boards to their 15
offensive boards, and that's 57 percent, I guess, on our defensive glass, and
we're usually over 70.  
Those extra three, four, five offensive rebounds that they got probably made
the difference, and it helped them get to the foul line.  
You know, they're tough to score against. What we did defensively was very
similar to what we did in New York in terms of giving lots and lots of help
off of Grant and Handford and was effective in a lot of ways. We held Handford
to 4 of 14 and Grant to 5 of 16. Like I said, we didn't clean up the glass,
and that was probably our undoing.  
  
Q. How frustrating is it when you play out these long possessions, get
stops, and then they come up with the ball and get a put ‑back?   
SYDNEY LAMBERTY: I mean, we came into the game knowing we needed the backs on
rebound, and I guess it's frustrating knowing we needed to do that and we
didn't.  
BRIANNA ROLLERSON: Yeah, I think we thought about rebounding, and we tried,
but I think sometimes you just didn't try hard enough, and I think that's what
really hurt us.  
  
Q. Sydney, you came out guns blazing in the first half. What was your
mindset coming and playing your first survive ‑and‑advance game as a freshman?
What were you thinking?   
SYDNEY LAMBERTY: I was really nervous at first, but I was also really excited,
and I guess‑‑ I don't know, it was just a cool experience.  
  
Q. Bree, when Sydney is going like that in the first half, what does that do
for your offense when you get that ‑‑ get one player clicking early against a
team that's really hard to score against like St.John's?   
BRIANNA ROLLERSON: I think it really motivates us, gets all of us going. It
gives us someone to look to and someone to play through.  
  
Q. Coach, I don't know how much attention you pay to points off turnovers,
especially in the second half it seemed like a big difference for them. How
important was it, those plays where Tartamella manufactured points to kind of
make the difference?  
COACH FLANERY: Yeah, they were big. They were struggling to score as much as
we were. I think Matt Fritsche I had the scout, and he said first to 60 would
win, and if we got to 60, he felt like we'd win, and if we had, we would have
won.  
Those were big. I mean, you tell your kids that the hidden ways to score are
transition, a lot of times off turnovers, offensive rebounding, which we got
beat. We gave up about the same in second chance points, but the second half,
that was a huge issue for us. And then the third area, the hidden points area,
is free throws, and we got out scored by nine at the foul line. You know, and
that was probably the key.  
But we had too many turnovers. You look at Sid's line of eight assists and no
turnovers, the rest of our team only had six assists, and I thought we were
just‑‑ part of it's nerves, part of it's how good St.John's is defensively,
but we just weren't as solid with the ball, just in terms of‑‑ it's one thing
to have 14 turnovers, but we didn't connect passes well enough to get good
shots, which is hard against them because of how they defend. But you've still
got to do it, and then the third time we play them, I felt like we'd be a
little bit better. But we weren't, and you know, we had opportunities, five,
seven minutes into that second half where 'Ris had a three, a great look at a
three that would have put us up 10, and in a game like this, that would have
been huge. But they fought back, like you said, with some points off
turnovers. You know, those are big.  
I talked about‑‑ one of the things I wrote on the board before the game is‑‑
one of our defensive keys was to run good offense because we couldn't afford
the turnover in the transition opportunities, so that certainly bit us in the
second half, as well.  
  
Q. Coach, you got a look and then you ended up getting just a two ‑point
basket. Your thoughts on the final sequence there?  
COACH FLANERY: Well, if you thought my thoughts on the last sequence, we got a
great shot. We hadn't run that before, but the idea was to run a hand off with
Marissa and set a flare. Lauren was supposed to set a flare for Sydney and
Marissa couldn't get it on the hand off so MC came and got it, and we got a
great look by our kid who had the best game. You can't complain about that.
Certainly the game wasn't won or lost there. It was lost before that.  
Lauren had a wide‑open three and Lauren has probably been our last shooter
over the last month. She had a wide‑open three that would have put us up two,
I think, at about the two‑minute mark. So we had‑‑ you know, we scored enough
down the stretch. I felt like in the last few minutes, we were fine on
offense, just like I said, we didn't finish possession. We gave them
second‑chance opportunities. But yeah, you can't ask for a better look than
the one we got.  
  
Q. How bright is your future when you have some of the talent that you have
coming back next year?  
COACH FLANERY: Yeah, I mean, we're excited. I told our team in the locker
room, I'm proud of how far they've come this year and how much a lot of our
players have improved from last March to this March, but also just even from
October to now and even January to now, and I think that's exciting. I told
them we have a group that comes in every day and works to get better and
they're fun to coach because they have that‑‑ you know, they don't feel sorry
for themselves when you're‑‑ I haven't coached that kind of team a lot, I
don't think. But I just appreciate the fact that they come and they try to get
better, and you're right, we start two sophomores and a freshman and play some
freshmen off the bench. I mean, to only have one senior and one junior who
plays a lot, I definitely think that it'll take me a while to get excited for
next year, but we will be. I think that we'll have a great opportunity to have
a really good/special year next year hopefully.  
  
Q. You talked about the things you didn't do in the second half, but as well
as you were playing in the first, do you think you kind of missed some
opportunities to kind of extend the lead a little bit even though you don't
expect to be up that much against this kind of team?  
COACH FLANERY: Yeah, it was one of those, I felt like with how well Syd
played, you can always look at it two ways. I felt like, one, we were lucky
Syd played that well because we had a lot of other people that didn't who were
really searching to make plays, positive plays offensively, but on the
flipside, you think, okay, if Marissa and Bree and Lex had been a little bit
better offensively in the first half, we maybe are up 10 or 12 or 14. So in
some ways we didn't capitalize on how good Syd was because those three kids
who can score it for us kind of struggled that first half.  
But again, a big part of that is their defense. But the other issue was, you
know, Lex had three at half and MC and 'Ris got to the half, Marissa got to
the half with two fouls, which was good, because MC and Marissa both had two
fairly early, so that was‑‑ I thought that was a positive that we got to the
half with only one of those three, getting to three fouls. Because at the
10‑minute mark, and I can't remember when Lex got her second, but MC and 'Ris
had two with probably 11 minutes to go, and they were able to play out the
rest of the half without getting a third.  
But you're right, everybody is going to focus on the last couple minutes and
what happened, but it's a 40‑minute game, and there were certainly possessions
that‑‑ last year we lost to them in double overtime, and they hit a half‑court
shot at the end of the first half. That's three points that you're probably
not going to get too often, and at the end of regulation if they don't have
that, we win by three.  
It's a combination of we weren't quite good enough, and they were‑‑ we'd have
been fortunate to win, but I feel like they were fortunate to win, too,
because I think we're very evenly matched teams, and anybody who's seen us
play the last few years would tell you that, but we've been on the short end
of the stick in the conference tournament, which hurts. You know, it hurts.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2015

  

### [Katherine Coyer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28441)

### [Alex Louin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28440)

### [Harry Perretta](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24923)

  
_ROSEMONT, ILLINOIS_  
  

Villanova  70  
Butler - 49

  
COACH PERRETTA: I thought we played pretty well today. I mean, we ran our
offense pretty well. We got the shots we were looking for, and we got a boost.
Caroline didn't score today, who was our leading scorer, but we got a boost
from Alex, who came into the game, and I think she had five threes in the game
today, which really helped us.  
But again, I thought we played relatively well, but Butler was without two of
their top players. We know what that's like. We were without two of our
players, I think, almost in ten games this year, so we know the feeling. It's
not a good feeling. But I thought we played pretty well overall. I obviously
think we have to play better tomorrow to have a chance to beat DePaul.  
  
Q. Alex, as a freshman, your Big East Tournament debut, you really turned it
on. What were you trying to do out there tonight?  
ALEX LOUIN: I was just trying to keep my feet set and my teammates around me,
and I was able to knock down the shots.  
  
Q. How did that feel to step up on a stage like this? Didn't seem like you
had any jitters really.  
ALEX LOUIN: It was good. I'm happy we got the win.  
  
Q. What does it say about your team that Caroline is your leading scorer,
yet tonight she's scoreless and you guys are balanced really in the grand
scheme of things. How important can that be for this tournament?  
ALEX LOUIN: I think it's very important. We definitely showed our depth
tonight, so I think that was helpful.  
  
Q. Katherine, as a junior on this team, you look at this team, what makes
this one special, to have the potential to really make a run here?  
KATHERINE COYER: Well, I'm a little biased so I think a lot of things do, but
I think both on and off the court we just get along so well, just from a
chemistry standpoint we all really like each other, we all get along really
great, and I think that carries onto the floor. We're not a selfish team at
all. Like Alex was saying, we have a lot of depth so it doesn't matter who's
getting those points. As long as someone is, we're going to find that person,
and that really helps us.  
  
Q. In the first half you assist on every single basket that you had. What
was it about the ball movement tonight that made it so good?  
KATHERINE COYER: I think whenever we're moving the ball well, we're going to
get a lot of good shots and a lot of open shots and easy shots just because
that's the nature of our offense. Luckily we hit some shots early, which kind
of opened up the lane a little bit for us. But yeah, as long as we're making
those quick passes and finding the open player, we tend to be pretty
successful.  
  
Q. What do you do against DePaul?  
KATHERINE COYER: I don't know, DePaul is one of those very versatile teams.
They do a lot. They're not just three‑point shooters, not just drivers, they
have a lot of depth. I think the key is going to be defense, try to slow down
the game a little bit, play to our advantages.  
  
Q. Alex, thoughts on tomorrow night's game?  
ALEX LOUIN: Just defense, focus on defense, and I think we'll be okay.  
  
Q. Coach, you take a look at this performance tonight, and like you say,
you've been in this role where you've been short ‑handed. How much has that
helped you in the long run?  
COACH PERRETTA: It did help us a lot in the long run because kids like Alex
Louin could develop when we were shorthanded. When Katherine was out, she
played a lot more and she got more experience and she got more confident.
Emily Leer was out, we had to develop Taylor and Kavunaa, and then Samantha
was able to come in and play. So those kids got a chance to develop, kids like
Jordan Dillard. So they had a chance to develop early in the year.  
Now, it wasn't fun for them because we were 3‑7 when they were playing, but
it's paying off now because we can get players into the game that can help us.
You know, it gives other kids a break, and now their experience is helping us
later on in the season.  
  
Q. The approach to this one, there's never a guarantee, but when you're
facing a team that is very, very short ‑handed in this match up it seemed like
you were pretty hard on your players tonight?  
COACH PERRETTA: I was, because we have to learn that each game is different.
Look, they're shorthanded, we know that, so we have to be able to‑‑ when we
know we're going to win the game, we have a big enough lead, we have to
practice for the next game, and that's one thing that I don't think players
understand how important it is to use even a victory, even when you're up by a
lot of points, to develop and to get better for the next game, especially when
you're going to play a team like DePaul who's so good on offense. You saw us
tonight in the second half. We were having trouble guarding them off the
dribble.  
You know, DePaul is a lot better than they are taking it off the dribble. If
we don't practice, DePaul is going to take it by us like we're statues
tomorrow. That's why I was so hard on us to focus on the things we can do.  
  
Q. Seemed like, as well, tonight you were trying to get the ball into the
post to Emily. One thing DePaul has had issues with at times is that post
defense. How important will that be tomorrow?  
COACH PERRETTA: Well, it'll be important because they're going to double her,
I think. Every time we threw the ball to her the last game at DePaul, they
doubled her. The bottom line is we were trying to practice getting the ball
inside, and if she gets doubled, then she has to make the right pass. So we
were actually at points trying to do things that we were actually going to try
to use tomorrow.  
  
Q. When you face a team like DePaul, what's the one thing you've got to
do?  
COACH PERRETTA: You have to slow the game down for us. We physically cannot
score as many points as they do if the game is fast paced. We just can't.
We're just not good enough and we know that. We're not going to sit here and
pretend like we are. So for us to beat them, we have to‑‑ the game has to be
low scoring, and the funny part was, the one game we did win wasn't low
scoring. That was kind of weird. But the second game was low scoring.  
I just don't think you'll beat them many times in a fast‑paced game, and we
have to not turn the ball over, either. They're going to double us a lot. I
think we had 13 or 14 turnovers at DePaul, which is actually okay. If we can
keep it under 15, it's actually not bad. We're not going to go through the
game tomorrow with three, I'll guarantee you that. It's just not turning the
ball over, slowing the pace of the game, and just trying to guard them.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2015

### [Jessica January](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28437)

### [Chanise Jenkins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28436)

  
_ROSEMONT, ILLINOIS_  
  

DePaul  87  
Xavier - 53

  
COACH BRUNO: It's all about focus at this time of the year, and I was really
proud of our players' focus and readiness to play. No matter what has happened
or transpired during the regular season, you have to put yourself in a
one‑in‑a‑row mode or possession‑by‑possession mode, and I just thought our
players were really ready to play tonight.  
When the score ends up like the score ended up tonight‑‑ Xavier is a good
team, and they beat St.John's just in the last eight, nine, 10 days. They had
a really nice win yesterday. This is a team that's very, very capable, and
just because we've won a couple games this year against Xavier, you cannot
take for granted that you're going to win the third time out. So it's just
really important that your players understand the focus of the moment, and I
just thought our team was really ready to go tonight. I thought we also dodged
two foul‑‑ first half, two foul bullets a little bit. I thought we could have
got ourselves in a little bit of trouble there with Britt picking up two and
Hrykno picking up two, and I think Centrese McGee had two. So we dodged that
pretty well, as well.  
When you shoot the ball, the game is always easier, and I think the players
did a good job shooting the ball, also. They shared the ball and shot the
ball.  
  
Q. Jessica, could you talk about how prolific this offense is and what makes
it go and work so well together?  
JESSICA JANUARY: Well, we definitely have really good players on this team.
Coach always says he gives us an offense to run, but it's about the players
that run it. I think we did a good job spacing the floor and like attacking
and trying to get to the rim and also kicking it out to our shooters.  
  
Q. Chanise, did you feel like you were in the zone tonight, or what
transpired for you that made this game as prolific as it was?  
CHANISE JENKINS: I guess in the zone, but before every game, Coach always
tells me to be ready at the jump, and I think these past couple games, my
teammates and I have done a very good job of being ready at the jump. It was
just all about being focused.  
  
Q. Jessica, how about for you?  
JESSICA JANUARY: I would say the same. I think we were all just really excited
to play and have the opportunity to win a game and compete, so yeah.  
  
Q. Jessica, with the team's relatively slow start offensively, how do you
avoid pressing offensively and kind of sit back and wait for your chances to
come?  
JESSICA JANUARY: Yeah, we did start off a little slow, but I think our defense
picked up and we used that energy and that translated into our offense, and
then we started to get going.  
  
Q. Being the defending Big East champion, how much pride do you take in not
letting this get taken away from you this season, that you want to defend your
championship?  
JESSICA JANUARY: Well, I think not only just this championship but every game.
We're all really competitive players, and we want to get out there and give it
our best shot, so we're going to do whatever we can to try to win.  
CHANISE JENKINS: Just the defending part, we can't rely on what we did last
year. We're a totally different team with a totally new identity, and I think
we have to be ready to bring it every game because every team in this
conference is really good. And we're not just defending the championship,
we're defending the name on our chest, and we've just got to fight hard every
game.  
  
Q. Coach, could you talk tonight about your bench play?  
COACH BRUNO: I think our bench play has been very, very important all season
long. The way we play, our style of play requires depth. I just thought it was
really important that the players that have been coming off the bench, Mart'e
Grays hit a couple big shots early in her entrance, and then Brooke Schulte at
this did some good things, and it wasn't a great Brooke Schulte night, but at
the same time she did a couple things that don't show up in the box score, and
then she settled down and started to play a little bit more about the player
that she's been off the bench.  
Ashton Millender did a nice job. I just thought we were able to get a rotation
going, and then we're still trying to‑‑ I had to play with the foul situation
in the first half, so you don't want‑‑ you just don't want Brittany Hrynko or
going into the second half with three and you don't want Brittany Hrynko not
playing the entire ‑‑ you don't want to bench her the whole first half,
either, because she's got two. So that's a fine line there.  
So I thought the bench was very important. But the pressure that we use, I
think, is really important. At the end of the night here I think I'm going to
look down at this‑‑ I haven't looked down at it yet, but I'm going to guess
the minutes are in the 20 to 25 range for our starters. I had to put T.T. back
in at the end there because Schulte at this was wearing out and those two
share a spot almost. I think the minutes were pretty well preserved, as
preserved as they can be in one in a row, three‑night consecutive basketball.  
We're going to have our hands full tomorrow with whoever wins this next game,
and that's what makes tournament basketball, league tournament basketball, so
different than even the NCAA. The NCAA Tournament you still get the day in
between, whereas tournament, conference tournament basketball, is one in a row
three times or four times, so it's just a really different style of ball and a
really different style of usage of your bench. But we've been using the bench
all year. I don't think you saw anything different than what we've been doing
since we've lost Rogowski, this has become the rotation.

### [Tabatha Richardson-
Smith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28419)

_ROSEMONT, ILLINOIS_  
  

Seton Hall  77  
Marquette - 51

  
COACH BOZZELLA: First of all, I'd like to congratulate Marquette and their
seniors, Apiew Ojulu, Chelsea Butler, Cristina Bigica, and Arlesia Morse. I
thought these kids have really stayed together when Marquette was really
struggling at the beginning of the year. It's about your seniors keeping you
together and your upperclassmen, and they did, and they had a great run at the
end of the year, and we were certainly very focused and very poised knowing
that they would have a big challenge today.  
Our ladies were up to the challenge, and I'm proud of them. It's not easy to
win any game in the tournament, certainly not the first game. It's an
advantage to maybe sit and watch and rest your legs, but it's not an advantage
at the beginning of the game when you have a shot on those rims or playing the
court and have those nerves. Early on, we're trying to get our legs and figure
it out. But these two ladies to the left and right of me never panicked, were
very under control. The lady to the left of me is as poised a young woman as
I've coached in many years, and the lady to the right of me is as driven as
any person I've had in a long time.  
I'm blessed to have them. I'm very proud of them. Obviously 27 wins, which is
a school record, means a lot to our program, but we know we have a lot of work
to do and we're excited to play someone who's beaten us in the next game
because both these teams have beaten us. So it will take nothing for us to
focus. We will be focused and ready to go, and it should be a tremendous
challenge for us.  
  
Q. Tab, you guys got off to a bit of a slow start. What was it that kicked
in for you that got you rolling to a double ‑double performance?   
TABATHA RICHARDSON‑SMITH: Just staying positive and knowing that we are the
best team when we step on the court. Like he said from our leaders, Dee Dee
and Daisha, just keeping the team together and playing as a team.  
  
Q. Daisha, with 17 ‑17 and then your press defense really starting to faze
Marquette, how important was that?   
DAISHA SIMMONS: That was very important. That's how we got the turnaround in
the game and that's when we started to pull away. Even when our offense is not
working we've got to rely on our defense because that's what wins games.  
  
Q. This is the first time you guys have been to the Big East Semifinals
since 1996. How does it feel to be making history?  
DAISHA SIMMONS: It feels good. We don't worry about making history. We just
take it a game at a time. We just worry about that day and try to live in the
moment. We have a goal for ourselves, and it's never just to make history.
It's about taking care of that day and winning the game.  
TABATHA RICHARDSON‑SMITH: I agree 100 percent with Daisha. We try to go out
knowing that‑‑ nobody wants to go home, and today we weren't outplayed as a
team, and we knew we weren't only playing for ourselves, we were playing for
our fans, the people in South Orange and the people watching the game, playing
for our coach, and that's basically what we did, and if we keep playing like
we're playing, we'll be fine and successful.  
  
Q. Tab, you got off to a slow start, you opened up shooting 3 for 10 from
the field, and then you finished off the first half sho0ting 6 for 8 end. When
are you finding your shots ending up with 20 at halftime?  
TABATHA RICHARDSON‑SMITH: I found‑‑ I'm always confident, but just staying
confident. My two point guards giving me the ball every time down the floor,
just knowing I'm open, and looking for me. It's not just all me. I give a lot
of credit to them because without them, me going 6 for 8, 3 for 10, whatever,
it wouldn't happen. So I think them just moving the ball and finding me and
hitting open shots.  
  
Q. Daisha, you guys started forcing a turnover per minute and ended being
the first half 6 in 6 minutes. What did you guys do finally with Marquette,
were you pressing or zone switch that really helped force the transfers?  
DAISHA SIMMONS: Yeah, I think we just wanted to have an attack mentality on
defense like on offense. When we come up with that mentality, a lot of teams
can't handle it, so we just try to stay with that.  
  
Q. Coach, you take a look at this performance, and you really came out of
the gates offensively and you said it, you were having trouble finding a way
to get some sort of a rhythm, but you've talked about before playing complete
defense for 40 minutes. How important was that today?  
COACH BOZZELLA: It was. I think we joked about it, we talked about it. Our
defense hasn't been consistent lately, and that was a big thing we worked on.
We worked on our defense a lot this week because we knew if we were going
opportunity to win a championship, you have to play better defense than we've
played, and we have not played good defense in a while. Certainly I think the
kids took it to heart. We shot atrociously poorly to start the game. We were 5
for 25. Normally, we'd be down 10 or 12 points and we basically were tied
because our defense and our rebounding kept us in it. We worked on that. So to
the kids' credit, they slowly worked on it, and they did it and they
accomplished the goals.  
And obviously we're a very high‑scoring team. We're going to start to score at
some point, so if we can defend, you're going to get a score like you got
today as opposed to a score when we lost to them 73‑70\. I think the kids
learned a valuable lesson, and I think as a coaching staff I learned a
valuable lesson. I've got to focus more on defense, and we did.  
  
Q. And then just going back, you said it before on the conference call
earlier this week, Tabatha Richardson ‑Smith is an All Big East Tournament,
second team player, but I could see a fire in her eyes today, Coach, and she
wants to be on the All Big East Tournament team.   
COACH BOZZELLA: What I love about Tabatha is Tabatha was extremely
disappointed she didn't make first team. She wasn't mad at Dee Dee, she wasn't
mad at Daisha. She was made at the other coaches in the league because she
felt, you know what, I'm a first team all conference player, and you didn't
vote for me. So the best way for me to show you is to go out and play really
well, and she did. That's maturity and that's where Tab has come such a long
way. In the past she would have been sulking or upset or not taking it to‑‑
let me prove it to you. So you feel I'm not first team, so I'll pump in 31 and
11 tonight. That's a good second teamer right there. That's a good first
teamer.  
Again, she went out and had the right mentality, and with today's youth and
today's thing, it's hard to go, and I give our staff a lot of credit and I
give her a lot of credit for just channeling her anger or upsetedness in the
correct way, and she did. I was really impressed with Tab today. Her defense,
but her rebounding. She was in the there rebounding the ball tremendously and
that's a big difference. When I took over this program, Tab averaged a rebound
a game.  
  
Q. In the first half the outside shooting really wasn't there. You went 12
percent from three. How big was it to have tab that come up big in the lane
with 20 points?  
COACH BOZZELLA: Yeah, I think it's a great point. You would think Tab having
20 at half, she would have been made or four threes. She only made one, I
think, if I'm not mistaken. In fact it was our only three. That's where she's
come out as a complete player. She's rebounding the ball, driving to the
basket, doing those things and I think that's where she's developing into a
great player.  
I give her a lot of credit for it, and I give the staff a lot of credit for
working with her, whether it's film or just shooting extra with her or just
talking with her. She's come a long way.  
  
Q. Coach, Dee Dee broke her own record of single assists in a season. Once
again today, 175 is what she finished with. What is it like to see her back
‑to‑back seasons break the record twice?  
COACH BOZZELLA: Well, you know, I've had the honor and pleasure to coach some
great players, and none better than her. She didn't even statistically play
that great, but we won because we have Dee Dee Simmons on the floor. She's a
remarkable young woman, a remarkable student‑athlete, a remarkable
representative of Seton Hall. And it's great that she broke that assist
record, but I think she's more thrilled that we're playing in the semifinals
for the first time since 1996, and she's not satisfied with that, either. We
want to win a Big East regular season championship which we did, and win a Big
East championship tournament championship, and we want to advance into the
NCAA Tournament, and we've accomplished one of those three goals, and we know
we have a lot of work to do for the other two goals.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2015

  

### [Kenisha Bell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28389)

### [Carolyn Kieger](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28387)

### [Arlesia Morse](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28420)

  
_ROSEMONT, ILLINOIS_  
  

Seton Hall  77  
Marquette - 51

  
COACH KIEGER: First of all, we want to say our congratulations to Seton Hall.
Obviously Tony has done a fantastic job with the program and it's headed in a
fantastic direction. Obviously tonight they showed that they can really get up
in the passing lanes and disrupt defensively, as well. So look for bright
things for them down this NCAA Tournament for their run.  
For our team, obviously very proud of the progress we made this year. We had
our ups and downs, but we never stopped fighting and we never stopped
improving, and I just told the kids in the locker room right now that I'm
really proud as a coach that a lot of teams would have folded in those moments
of adversity, but we kept getting better, and I thought we played our best
basketball in February and some in March here, so we look for great things in
the future, and we've got to keep building on it.  
  
Q. Kenisha, what have you learned from a player like Arlesia?  
KENISHA BELL: I learned how to play more as a team and be a leader on the
court just like the seniors. They always taught us, you know, just because
you're a freshman doesn't mean you can't be a leader on the court, and I had
to basically talk to my team and bring them up when they're down, too.  
  
Q. Arlesia, to me you left it all out on the floor. What's it like to know
that in your final Big East Tournament that you really put everything out
there?  
ARLESIA MORSE: I'll just say it's a wonderful opportunity to play. I knew
coming in Seton Hall was a great team and they wanted to get back at us, and
win, lose, or draw, I was just happy that everybody played hard, and we left
it all out there. No regrets. That's what we said in the locker room, and I
just continued to play hard because once I seen the clock go to zero, I was
like, there's nothing we can do about it now.  
  
Q. To those followers of your program and this conference, if you could
leave some words, as well, to some of the younger players, Arlesia, what would
it be about your time at Marquette?  
ARLESIA MORSE: Just no regrets. Play every game like it's your last because
you never know when it'll end.  
  
Q. You talked about how the team played your best basketball in February and
a little bit in March. As a first ‑year coach, how does that feel to know you
guys improved throughout the season and were able to finish strong?  
COACH KIEGER: Well, I think it means a lot, especially for our young kids. We
have‑‑ we decided about halfway through the year that we were going to really
keep it simple and get back to the basics and work on our fundamentals and on
the discipline of things, instead of game planning as much. So we really
focused every single day on getting each individual kid better, and I think
that really showed up as a team, and we worked on our skill work, we worked on
our shooting, we worked on defensive principles, and so for our players
returning, that's going to be huge coming in for next year.  
  
Q. You talked about it yesterday that you were able to get something going
in your front court. Chelsea was able to give you that. Seton Hall was around
the glass from the get ‑go. Was that legs today, tired? What do you see on
that?   
COACH KIEGER: Well, we said it at halftime, I thought Seton Hall was tougher
than us in the paint and showed up with their offensive rebounds in the first
half. I thought we closed the gap there in the second half and responded a
little bit there in the paint, but they got their hands on every loose ball
there in the first half, and it showed up.  
  
Q. You take a look at this upcoming off ‑season and you look at the senior
class, you have to replace the senior class. What exactly is your mindset
here?  
COACH KIEGER: We've got to get to work. We have a lot to do this off‑season,
and we've got to get our freshman better. We have a class of seven or eight
coming in next year that we're really, really excited about. The future is
very bright at Marquette, and it's going to happen as soon as they get back
from Spring Break. It starts day one of training, and we've just got to get to
the point where we know this program can be at.  
  
Q. Looking at the rest of the bracket and how it lays out, how competitive
is this conference exactly? What is this conference like this year?  
COACH KIEGER: It was fun this year. I thought it was very competitive, very
deep. There's going to be some great games here the remaining of this
conference tournament. It's wide open. Obviously DePaul and Seton Hall are up
there, but Creighton's been able to knock them down. We were able to get Seton
Hall one game. There's a lot more disparity now, which is great for the league
and, hopefully as the years progress, that we're able to get three or four
teams into the NCAA Tournament.  
  
Q. Coach Bozzella opened up his presser talking about your seniors. What do
you have to say about them and what they meant for this program this season?  
COACH KIEGER: As a first year coach it was great to have a group of four that
bought in from day one, and they really helped us out with our freshmen and
they helped us, which is everyday little discipline stuff, what it means to be
an elite level athlete, what it means to be great every day in the classroom
or whatever it is. They helped us out with trying to have our young kids be
the best versions of themselves every day.

### [Alexis Harris](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28393)

### [Susan Robinson
Fruchtl](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28391)

### [Tori Rule](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28392)

  
_ROSEMONT, ILLINOIS_  
  

Providence  79  
Marquette - 66

  
SUSAN ROBINSON FRUCHTL: It was a good game. I think it was a pretty good
match‑up both ways, a lot of up and down, a lot of scoring in this, so I think
it was a fun game to watch. It was a fun game to coach. I appreciate these
guys, two of our seniors. They gave a great effort today, and as I told them,
it's tough. I've been there before, right. I always lost my senior game each
year, lost the last one of my senior year, so that's a difficult thing, so
I've been there, and I understand that.  
But they can be proud that they gave a really good effort today, and that's
the biggest thing that you can do as a player, and they really wanted this
one. I applaud them, and I thank them. I give credit to Marquette. They really
battled, made some key plays down the stretch. They got some key rebounds that
we didn't get and made some big free throws there at the end, enough to get
the W.  
I'm proud of our kids. We fought hard. We had a lot of injuries this year. We
really struggled to get a rhythm throughout the year, but we kept battling,
and I'm excited about the future of this program. I'm really ready to get to
work in the off‑season. That starts with recruiting. Ready to get to work and
get this program back in championship form. It's been a long time since the
Friars on the women's side have been in championship form, and that's where we
aim to go.  
  
Q. Tori, you scored 30 points, didn't come out on top today, but it wasn't
the result you wanted, but what has this career meant for you and what did it
mean to go out with a bang in the sense that you really had a great
performance?  
TORI RULE: It meant a lot to go out with a bang. Before the game we all just
made a goal to go out and play our hardest for the team, each other, and have
no regrets. I love PC, I love playing with my teammates. We've built a great
relationship and really become a family.  
I care so much about the coaching staff, and we just treat each other like a
family, and we just wanted to leave tonight with no regrets. It didn't go in
our favor, but I really did enjoy all of my seasons here at Providence College
with each and every one of my teammates.  
  
Q. How hard has it been for you to come back from injury this whole season,
and how have your surrounding players and coached helped you through that?  
TORI RULE: It's been hard, not so much physically because the broken finger
wasn't really anything. You lose your handle a little bit. But I really think
the coaching staff and my teammates did a really good job of helping me
through the mental side of things, and the pick‑me‑up kind of side of it, and
just telling me get back on the court, don't worry about it, we need you.  
It's just the belief factor behind everything, so I really didn't feel
anything when I was out. I really felt a part of the team and feel like I was
part of the team just as a starter or coming off the bench. Either way, they
stayed vocal with me.  
  
Q. Alexis, obviously a tough way to fall here. Marquette finding a way late.
What do you make of this game, because you guys had a 73 ‑67 lead. What did it
come down to?   
ALEXIS HARRIS: We all played tough. Everybody on the court gave their all, and
like Tori said, we wanted to just make a goal, like, nobody gives up, leave
everything on the floor, no regrets, and we have nothing to lose, so just go
for it. Everybody played their role. Everybody did their role, played tough,
and I feel like we really played together throughout the game.  
  
Q. Coach, you take a look at this match ‑up and Coach Kieger said as well,
two teams that really just played their best basketball. You're up 73‑67, what
did you feel like really went wrong?   
COACH ROBINSON FRUCHTL: Well, we took a couple‑‑ I wouldn't say ill‑advised
shots, but we just didn't finish them. We were off balance on a couple things,
and we didn't finish. The one play where I thought there was a tie‑up, I
thought Tori had called a time‑out. I saw her doing this as a coach. That's on
me. I need to make it very clear to everybody that we wanted a time‑out. I
felt that was‑‑ it wasn't a turning point, but it was a big play. I thought it
was a big play where she fell down. We had the tie‑up in the middle of the
court, I thought that was a big play and momentum shifted a little bit.  
Yeah, we put them on the foul line a little bit there down the stretch and
they're a very good free throw shooting team. This is actually one of their‑‑
shooting 73 percent is not great for them. There weren't a ton of fouls in
this game, but a couple of them were just key free throws. I thought this game
would come down to rebounding overall, whoever controlled the boards would
win, and that stat held up. They out‑rebounded us there 46‑38\. We both had 15
offensive boards, so neither coach is very happy with the offensive boards
each of us gave up, but we gave up ones where they converted, and I think that
was a big difference. They converted on their offensive boards with a lay‑up.
We got a lot we didn't convert right away. We had to bring it back out. So
those were key rebounds.  
  
Q. Was that the shot you were looking for to end the game and did you think
that was pretty clean?  
COACH ROBINSON FRUCHTL: The lay‑up?  
  
Q. Yeah.  
COACH ROBINSON FRUCHTL: It was the right action, okay. I think we need to make
a better decision. I think we could have gotten maybe a pull‑up or a kick‑out,
okay, but it was the right action. We executed the action correctly.  
  
Q. Where do your graduating players kind of leave this program? Even though
they didn't produce the results, where do they leave you?  
COACH ROBINSON FRUCHTL: Well, I think when I came in, it was a big change for
them. It was a big change for them. I think I was a lot of organization was
brought to this program, a lot of things maybe they just weren't used to, so
that was a big change. If I look back, the first book I made them read was
"Who Moved My Cheese," just to try to get them to be comfortable with change
and that that was okay and for them to accept it. I think they learned a lot
about themselves and I think they've learned and grown a whole lot at PC. I
told them, one of the biggest things if I can teach as a coach is do not
settle for mediocrity. This is not good enough. Even though we gave 100
percent effort, this is not good enough. We have to get a lot better. This
program has got to get a lot better. We all have got work to do. We all have
got a lot of work to do.  
And for the seniors this does not stop here. They've got to take their PC
education, what they learned as a Friar and impact their world, whatever world
that is for them. They need to have an impact in that world, and I think
that's the biggest thing that our students at PC learn, whether you're a
student‑athlete or not.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2015

  

### [Brianna Glover](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28399)

### [Brian Neal](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28397)

### [Aliyah Zantt](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28398)

  
_ROSEMONT, ILLINOIS_  
  

Xavier  70  
Georgetown - 67

  
COACH NEAL: Well, I guess the opening statement is I think they outshot us,
had 29 more shots than us, and it was an amazing accomplishment to win a game
when that happens. We certainly didn't play our best game throughout the year,
but the great thing for us is that we hung in there and battled and made the
plays down the stretch.  
I remember sitting at a table very similar to this last year and Georgetown
had knocked us out and we had just ended a season with a 13‑game losing
streak, and I sat down at the table, and I remember there was a big water
spill on it, and I couldn't understand why this big water spill was there, and
somehow it was the end of a grueling season. And I remember sitting there and
I remember telling the media that were there that we'll be back, and the next
time we're back, we'll be better.  
I'm not sure how much better we were today, but we played better this year,
and we've come a long way, and I'm really proud of this group.  
  
Q. Aliyah, when I talked to Coach Neal earlier this week on the
teleconference, he talked about the way that you have really grown into a big
role for this team, and today your first career double ‑double. How did that
feel?   
ALIYAH ZANTT: It feels, you know, it feels good. I just kept working and
coming and working hard every day. We lost a couple of our point guards early
in the season, in the middle of the season, so I knew that I had to step up
and fill that point guard role, and I fed off what my teammates gave me and
what I could give my teammates, and I just continued to work hard and play
hard and have fun.  
  
Q. What do you think is the biggest change to your game that has come with
the point guard role?  
ALIYAH ZANTT: I have to step in more of a confidence role because I have to
kind of run the floor out there. We've got to get into the sets and we've got
to see things that a wing probably wouldn't see or a post probably wouldn't
see. And I'm basically ‑‑ out there Coach Neal's voice because he can't always
say so much from the bench. I just try my best to see what he tells me to see
and what to look for within our sets and within our plays on defense and
offense.  
  
Q. Brianna, you take a look at the game, and Georgetown had 29 more shots
than you guys. You kept on fighting, you've doubled your win total from a year
ago. What has been the key to this season?  
BRIANNA GLOVER: Well, we knew starting with this game that it was going to go
to the last four minutes no matter what. All the games against them have, and
we just knew that we were going to have to keep grinding it out, and I think
that's a good indication of what our season has been. We just kept grinding
and grinding and grinding, and we've won some and we've lost some, but
thankfully we've won more.  
  
Q. You made Dorothy Adomako work for everything she got. What do you do to
try to contain the Big East freshman of the year?  
BRIANNA GLOVER: You've got to play them straight up try to take away what they
do best. When you play against a player like that, most likely they're going
to get theirs, but you have to make sure you stop all the other players out on
the court and help out on her.  
  
Q. The way Coach sounded to open up that statement, he wants you guys to
play your best basketball. What is going to be the key to playing your best
basketball tomorrow against DePaul?  
BRIANNA GLOVER: We definitely have to limit our turnovers. We've had 29
against them both times we've played them, so I think that's a big key, and
just to make sure we get up shots because they usually shoot a lot more shots
than we do, as well.  
  
Q. You guys went down early, 8 ‑0, especially in a single elimination
tournament, what kind of mindset do you have to have to bounce back and get in
the game?   
ALIYAH ZANTT: Well, Coach Neal always says we're going to have to grind
everything. So every team is going to have runs, this game is a game of runs.
We're going to go up by 8, they're going to go up by. It's just how many runs
you can limit in order to get down. We knew early on whether they were going
to go on run or we were going to go on a run. It's like the first four minutes
you see who's ready to play, who's ready to go. Coach Neal said you only need
to win by one. We're a grind it out team, we've grinded out many games all
season, so we just knew it wasn't going to be an easy win or it was going to
be a battle the whole entire team.  
BRIANNA GLOVER: Exactly, I agree with Aliyah. We knew it was going to go to
the last four minutes, and we just had to make sure we kept grinding.  
  
Q. Aliyah, you had a very big play in the final minute, getting the
offensive rebound after missing the free throw and then hitting those two free
throws to essentially put the game away.  
ALIYAH ZANTT: Just had to go get the ball. Coach Neal always never, like, puts
any pressure when we're on the free‑throw line. He never says you have to make
these. You miss one, he just tells you to get one. When we make our shots or
miss our shots, either way, you've just got to go hustle and get the ball.
Hustle, play, win the games.  
  
Q. Coach, it's tough to beat a team three times, and you found a way to do
it today. It took quite a play from Aliyah. Take me through what you're
thinking as she gets that rebound off the free throw, and then just what she's
meant to you guys.  
COACH NEAL: Well, first of all, on that play I was thinking time‑out, I was
screaming time‑out as loud as I've ever‑‑ we just needed to get that
possession back. But Aliyah Zantt‑‑ we could have been dead in the water a
couple weeks ago. We have three point guards who are out right now, and Urban
Meyer, he made three quarterbacks, we're on our fourth point guard.  
Aliyah, for her to step in and to ‑‑ basically be a backup 2 guard was her
role on our team all year long, and for her to step in, and the first couple
games it was a little rough, but as each game has gone by, her confidence is
soaring, what is great for her. Aliyah has never been a player who's been
great at decision-making. She's always made some flashy plays, but she's never
been one of those kids that did things right all the time, and that's the neat
thing about her is now she's still making her plays, but her decisions, her
composure, everything is so much better, and it's helping us win games now.  
  
Q. You said, I remember being with you after that loss last year and you
were frustrated and you've really been able to build something here this year.
I know you want to keep doing that in the future. What does it say about your
team?  
COACH NEAL: Yeah, I mean, it's a funny game. We had a plan, and the plan
worked really well the first two games. It didn't work so well tonight, so we
had to adjust, and basically we had to do some improvising on the fly there
and call some things we don't normally call. Georgetown, everybody is telling
us, hey, you beat them twice, but Georgetown plays us hard. Their length and
their athleticism, it's very difficult for us to score on them, and I knew
coming in that it was going to be a tough game. I just didn't think we would
ever be able to pull away, so I just tried to prepare the girls all week, and
I think that mindset helped them.  
  
Q. What's the key to limit being those turnovers going forward?  
COACH NEAL: I don't know, I'll take any suggestions. We've been working on it
all year. We turned it over like crazy the first half. I think we only had
three the second half if my math is right. We had 12 in the first half. I
think part of it was just calming down tonight. I think we were just a little
amped up. I don't know if we were nervous. I think we were just really jacked
up, and when we were playing too fast, we were shooting too fast, everything
was just hot out of our hands and making bad decisions. I think the halftime
had got there and we were able to calm down and be a little bit better in the
second half.  
  
Q. Is there ever a benefit, do you think there's any sort of benefit to
being able to play on Day One? You don't play now until tomorrow night where
you're familiar with the court a little bit.  
COACH NEAL: Play of the game is adjourned and we earned a 7 seed. I guess in
some ways we got any jitters out of the way. We should be able relax and
hopefully be able to execute some things tomorrow. I don't know, we're just
thrilled to be playing and continue on.  
  
Q. Anything that you want to key in on against DePaul?  
COACH NEAL: Well, they're the real deal and they've had their way with us all
year long, so we've got to figure out something to take care of the ball. They
play at such a fast pace and they come at you in waves and we ‑‑ it's no
secret they take a lot more shots than their opponents. They take a lot of
threes, so we've got to figure out a way to slow them down, but more
importantly we've got to take care of the ball. If we turn the ball over 29
times like we did in the first two games, it's going to be a long day. So
we've got to have our composure, execute our press breaks, and then play with
some poise.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2015

  

### [Kenisha Bell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28389)

### [Chelsea Butler](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28388)

### [Carolyn Kieger](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28387)

  
_ROSEMONT, ILLINOIS_  
  

Providence  79  
Marquette - 66

  
COACH KIEGER: First of all, that's a great way to open the conference
tournament. That was one heck of a game both ways. I thought Providence played
fantastic, obviously, Tori Rule, tip our hats to her because she was
unstoppable there for a while. I thought for us we played a very, very
balanced game. We talked in the locker room as a team, everybody made big
plays at key moments, and one thing we've been talking about all year is just
perseverance and not breaking. I'm just so proud of the team tonight. We
stayed with it, we stayed strong, we stayed tough, and we got the plays when
we needed to. It was a total team effort tonight.  
  
Q. Chelsea, take me through that final sequence where you come up with the
big time defensive play and then you're able to deliver those free throws.  
CHELSEA BUTLER: All year one of the biggest things that all the coaching staff
have said to me is stepping up and having my hands straight up. Sometimes I
have issues with fouling, so as she was getting the ball down my throat, all
that was in my head was stay straight up and move your feet. And then knocking
the free throws down, we did situations like that in practice, so it was just
rhythm.  
  
Q. Kenisha, what a way to start off your Big East Tournament career in your
first game in this tournament. You go off. What was the key to having success
for you today?  
KENISHA BELL: I mean, we all worked hard at practice the past couple of days,
trying to see what we could do to win the game. Playing together as a team is
how we won the game.  
  
Q. Chelsea, what does this say about your team, that you've won five of
nine, you're peaking at the right time?  
CHELSEA BUTLER: That's something we've talked about all year, that the best
teams peak in March, and I think that's exactly what we're doing. I think it's
very exciting to finally have‑‑ to finally show all the hard work we've put in
all year and how much we've wanted this all year.  
  
Q. Kenisha, can you take me through your mindset when you're taking those
free throws with just a few seconds left to possibly put the game away?  
KENISHA BELL: At first I was thinking in my head like, dang, I might have shot
it too soon because we always talk about if we're in a situation like that, we
want to get the last shot in. At first I was kind of shaky, like, dang, I
should have shot the ball, but it was already too late, and I knew then that
knocking down the free throws was all that mattered and leave that play in the
past.  
  
Q. One of the things about the tournament is the quick turnaround, so you
guys will play Seton Hall tomorrow night. How do you adjust to playing a game
in less than 24 hours?  
CHELSEA BUTLER: We've had practices back to back, hard practices knowing that
that's going to prepare us for this moment, so working hard as a team these
last few weeks has really gotten us prepared for it.  
KENISHA BELL: We wasn't only working on the Providence game, we worked on
Seton Hall and Providence together just to prepare for this because we knew we
wouldn't have an opportunity to be able to get in the gym the day before a
game.  
  
Q. Coach, congratulations again. For you as a first ‑year head coach, what
does it mean to be moving on to get a Big East Tournament win?   
COACH KIEGER: It's more so for the players. I'm just really proud of them,
really excited for them. The seniors just wanted to keep playing. For the
freshmen, it's a great experience. They've got four years here, and to start
it off with a tournament win is very valuable. For me that was a fun game.
That was really enjoyable and a great way to open up the Big East Tournament.  
  
Q. You're down 11 ‑4 early to Providence. What did you tell your team?  
COACH KIEGER: Stay confident, stay positive. We know this is a game of runs
and they're going to make theirs and we're going to make ours and we've got to
take that punch. We've been saying it all year we have to be resilient, and I
think we showed it tonight.  
  
Q. You had to figure out a way to get some play out of your post. What did
it mean to have Chelsea turn it on?  
COACH KIEGER: That was huge. She's been playing such better basketball this
past month, and it's really helping our team. It's really helping the other
people stay confident or other posts be confident. Even Lauren Tibbs came in
and had a huge and‑one success. You know when she sees Chelsea having success,
it pumps her up as well. Huge credit to Chelsea staying with it and playing
her best basketball of her whole career.  
  
Q. How do you grow success at a time of year like this one?  
A.Just keep building on the little things. We've said it all year that it's
about discipline, and it doesn't happen overnight, and we knew that, and we
knew this was going to be a long year of growing and a lot of change, a lot of
newcomers, and it was just a battle every day, get into the gym, work hard, be
the best versions of ourselves, and we knew down the road if we kept sticking
to the little things that we'll eventually have success.  
  
Q. You've gotten it done once before with Seton Hall. What is it going to
come down to tomorrow?  
COACH KIEGER: We've got to focus on the game plan, definitely. The second game
we played them we were very excited. It was senior night, great atmosphere,
great game, but we were really focused and we were really intense, and we've
got to play defense. Seton Hall is a high‑octane offense, a lot of people that
can score, so we've got to make sure that everybody steps up, all ten of us
come to play some defense and get back in transition and stop their go‑to
players.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2015

  

### [Natasha Adair](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28400)

### [Dorothy Adomako](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28401)

### [Dominique Vitalis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28402)

  
_ROSEMONT, ILLINOIS_  
  

Xavier  70  
Georgetown - 67

  
COACH ADAIR: Can a sigh being an opening statement? We fought. You know, we
talked to our kids about March Madness, we talked to our kids about leaving it
all on the floor, and I thought they played one heck of a game. I thought we
battled, and we battled. When Xavier got up, we battled back, and it was a
credit to Dominique and Dorothy, but I thought it was by committee.  
You hate to come in here just on this note because it fell short, but I don't
want to negate what our players did as far as giving 100 percent effort, 100
percent fight, and 100 percent toughness. You can go down the course of the
game and see where we could have probably changed a couple of things, but I'm
proud of the way our players fought.  
  
Q. Dorothy, you look at the game and it's not exactly what you wanted to
come out with in terms of results, but what can you say about just how much
you've learned throughout your freshman year about being a part of this
program and playing under Coach Adair?  
DOROTHY ADOMAKO: Tonight definitely we didn't get what we wanted, but I
learned just to fight and keep a positive attitude, even when there's
adversity, and Coach A has taught me a lot my freshman year. This is not the
result that I wanted coming into my freshman year because I always have high
standards, but that doesn't mean that I'm going to go back and start working.
It's the off‑season now, so just go back in the gym and keep working hard.  
  
Q. Coach talked about it earlier this week, about playing 40 minutes. Do you
feel like as the season has gone on, you've really come to the point where
you're playing 40 minutes of basketball, a complete game?  
DOMINIQUE VITALIS: I mean, we definitely work hard. The effort is there, but
focus, I feel as though some plays we had mental lapses, and I think that's
key. We need to focus for 40 minutes. So I definitely think while the effort
is there, we don't focus completely for 40 minutes.  
  
Q. Dominique, do you feel like there's something that you take away from
this one that didn't go right, that could have gone your way had you done
something different?  
DOMINIQUE VITALIS: I mean, overall, I believe we fought. I do agree that the
game‑‑ we wished it would have gone a different way, but at the end we fought,
but we can only learn. We continue to work hard, be humble, but we just have
to learn from this here on out.  
  
Q. Dorothy, how much have you really ‑‑ at the end of the day, you didn't
rack up all the wins but you're the freshman of the year. How bright is that
for you going forward?   
DOROTHY ADOMAKO: I mean, I have to keep working hard. I couldn't really get
the award without my teammates and Coach. All the credit is not to me. It's
definitely to my teammates and Coach.  
  
Q. Dominique, after you get the fourth foul, does that change your mindset
going into the final few minutes knowing that you're one foul away from
fouling out?  
DOMINIQUE VITALIS: I tried not to let it. I mean, I want to be as aggressive
as I was even if I had like two fouls. I do think I am conscious of it, but I
try not to let it get me out of my game as to where I'm just not aggressive
enough and I'm hurting my team because I'm not as aggressive.  
  
Q. Coach, tough play there in the final stretch where Aliyah Zantt gets that
rebound. Take me through that one.  
COACH ADAIR: You want to take me through it again? My hat goes off to her. You
know, at the end of the day, that was a winning play. That was a hustle play,
a free throw rebound. Every coach knows, box out the shooter. That's just kind
of the deal. We say it every day.  
I don't want to highlight that one play because I never want to put that on
any student‑athlete because we could go through just a list of‑‑ we get 78
shots; 20 of them are lay‑ups. That one play obviously could have changed the
game, but I think throughout the game we could have made some plays,
especially finishing around the rim. I thought we just left a lot of plays
short around the rim.  
But as a coach, first year with my players, I'm always thinking what's the big
picture, what's the bright side, and we don't have any seniors. We have five
freshmen. So the way that our student‑athletes feel right now, especially for
Dominique, who played eight minutes a year ago, she's playing 24 or 25 minutes
now, there's so many different players in different roles.  
They don't like this taste right now, and this taste is going to carry over in
our off‑season. It's going to carry over in how we prepare, and Georgetown
women's basketball is going to be a team to be reckoned with. You have to take
this and motivate and just keep moving forward.  
  
Q. On a bright spot for you in this game, who kept you around was McCormick
with several big shots. What did that mean to see that?  
COACH ADAIR: It was great. We've been just really going to Katie all year
shooting. Katie is probably one of our hardest workers, team first, and
sometimes too unselfish. Katie, you have a gift, you have a talent, and we
need it, and just for her to finish on that note is going to give her
confidence as we go into obviously postseason but in preparation for the
upcoming year. So it was great to see her finish that way.  
  
Q. Your players talked about maturity and focus. Do you think that's
something that next year really could pay off because of everything you've
learned through this year?  
COACH ADAIR: Absolutely. We will have five seniors next year. This year they
were all in different roles, and we talked about just leadership and just
listening to Dominique in the gym and in practice, when I first got here she
didn't say two words. They've taken, embraced it as juniors, and I'm excited
for them as rising seniors for how they're going to lead, what examples
they're going to set, and just what goals that we're going to have
individually and as a program.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2015

  

### [Brenda Frese](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15652)

### [Malina Howard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28439)

### [Shatori Walker-
Kimbrough](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28346)

  
_HOFFMAN ESTATES, ILLINOIS_  
  

Maryland  77  
Ohio State - 74

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by head coach Brenda Frese, Lexie Brown, Malina
Howard and Shatori Walker‑Kimbrough. Coach, an opening comment.  
COACH FRESE: You know, I mean, just a phenomenal game. When you talk about
both teams, I mean, their will to win. Hard‑fought. Neither team deserved to
lose that game.  
This team just continues to separate themselves in terms of making play after
play after play for one another. They definitely had to earn that game when
you talk about 40 minutes.  
But obviously extremely proud. It hasn't been easy when you talk about coming
in and going through the conference. And now three games in three days. But
just big plays, obviously, all around with this team. And we're going to enjoy
tonight and this week and then look forward to what's out ahead.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Lexie, could you describe the kind of shift of momentum after you were up
15 and they're cutting it to a point and the resiliency you had to keep the
lead down in the stretch?  
LEXIE BROWN: Basketball is a game of runs. Ohio State is an amazing team, and
they have an amazing player in Kelsey Mitchell. I think she took it upon
herself to assert her will on us. And I think we responded great. We didn't
buckle. We came together closer as a team. We got that big stop at the end. So
I'm really proud of our team for that.  
  
Q. Your thought process at the end, those two free throws at the very end?  
LEXIE BROWN: Don't miss. I mean, we do high pressure free‑throw shooting in
practice all the time with free throw ladder. You miss; you run. So I feel
like missing those layups mean a lot more than missing that one in the game,
honestly. But I didn't want to let my team down. I just really locked in and
just knocked those two free throws down.  
  
Q. Malina, Brionna spent a lot of time on the bench tonight with foul
trouble. Still you guys dominated on the boards with 49 ‑28 or something like
that. And you had 12. Did you feel any additional pressure to really crash the
boards hard with Brionna out?  
MALINA HOWARD: Bri is definitely a rebounder and she's a big force inside for
us. So I took it upon myself just to go after board I could, crash the boards
as hard as I could, even if I wasn't getting it on defense, boxing out my
person to make sure they didn't get it. Really dominating the boards, that was
our game plan.  
  
Q. Shatori, there's been a lot of celebrations these last couple weeks with
the regular season title and last night. Where does this rank and can you
describe their emotions of the team?  
SHATORI WALKER‑KIMBROUGH: We're happy. We're going to ride it out for a day or
two, then we gotta lock it back in. We're not done. We're not done yet. We got
two goals down, still one more to go.  
  
Q. Lexie, do you feel you've done enough to earn a No. 1 seed in the NCAA
Tournament?  
LEXIE BROWN: I feel like every team thinks they deserve a No. 1 seed. I feel
like we left it all on the court these past couple of weeks. We went through
the conference play undefeated. There's a bunch of other teams out there that
also deserve a No. 1 seed. Wherever we get seeded, we get two home games. So
we're blessed for that, so we're going to be thankful for any seed we get.  
  
Q. Shatori, Kiara came in the first half and really provided a big lift.
What did you see out of her today?  
SHATORI WALKER‑KIMBROUGH: She was phenomenal from top to bottom. Defensively
she guarded Kelsey Mitchell for us and got stops. Not only was she good today.
She was good yesterday as well. She's been doing great. It starts in practice.
She works hard in practice. I'm happy for her to see it. She translated it
from practice to the game. I mean, that was really big for us.  
  
Q. Anyone who wants to answer this: At the end of the first half last night
Kiara got a big rebound and put the ball back in just as the buzzer went off.
Bones did the same thing tonight. How much of a momentum shift was that
tonight compared to what happened last night?  
MALINA HOWARD: I mean, it was huge. It was a big moment for us. We needed the
momentum going into halftime. And I think that sparked us in the second half
when we went on and had our big lead. And I think that was really key and
really important.  
  
Q. Lexie, you guys matched the longest streak, 24 in program history. How
does it feel to be a part of that history?  
LEXIE BROWN: It's amazing. Honestly, that wasn't a goal of ours this season
coming in to have one of the longest streaks in program history. But I know
the work that everybody puts in.  
We're just having fun on this ride, and now we have no choice but to keep the
streak going. We're going to keep working hard. Work hard in practice and in
the weight room and just get even tighter and tighter as the season goes on.  
  
Q. Shatori, you talk about Kiara guarding Mitchell but you were on her some
tonight, too. 31 tonight. She was trying to pull their team back. What was it
like trying to guard her?  
SHATORI WALKER‑KIMBROUGH: It was a lot of work. It took a lot of work. And
just being locked in. But like I mean, our help side was great. It was not
just the person on her but everybody had to be locked in on the court. 31 is
great. She's a great player. But I mean I think that's it.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Brenda, you won conference titles before, how does this stack up? Can you
even compare them?  
COACH FRESE: I mean, this team is always going to stack up, when you talk
about something that I've never been a part of and the chance of making
history. They just continue, when you talk about being undefeated in
conference and then coming out here in the tournament, three games in three
days.  
And that was a really, really tough game that they had to go out and earn to
be able to win. So obviously going to rank right up there.  
  
Q. Could you discuss the poise the team had, up 15 and Ohio State brings it
back, but you never relinquished the lead.  
COACH FRESE: It's really been their mentality, their resiliency all season.
And they do, they don't get rattled. They don't get too high, too low. Game of
runs. They understand it. They connect and they lock into their defense and
the rebounding and whatever we need to have to be able to be successful.  
  
Q. I asked Malina about the sort of dominance inside rebounding. And that
was one aspect of the inside game. But you seemed to struggle getting the ball
inside to score, except off of some offensive rebounds. What was Ohio State's
zone like that was sort of preventing you in long possessions and some
desperate shots?  
COACH FRESE: Obviously they were extremely physical. They're very athletic.
Great length. I think sometimes for us the ball was sticking a little bit
tonight. Normally passes that we make that are pretty easy for us, but maybe
in terms of the pressure and that we were under.  
But credit just sticking to the game plan and trying to find other ways. We
found other opportunities on the glass in terms of trying to combat that.  
  
Q. Actually, to have Brionna Jones only play 14 minutes but still have that
rebounding edge, what does that say about this team that your leading
rebounder can suffer through foul trouble all game and still hold that edge?  
COACH FRESE: I mean, it's just this team. You talk about someone else and
steps up and continues to make plays. And to be have that moment for Malina
double‑double. And Kiara Leslie who has worked and fought all season, a lot of
these guys could have quit. But again they continue to show how special they
are as a team, why they separate themselves because they continue to fight for
each other.  
  
Q. You talked about different players stepping up and again I think it
showed in the fact that Lexie is the only Maryland player on the all
‑tournament team. You probably don't win tonight without the effort of Malina.
Last night Brene. Could you talk about how you keep those players focused and
ready to step up time after time because it's been like that all season?  
COACH FRESE: You can see why this team wins. I mean because they are selfless.
They understand they're going to sacrifice for one another and as we've
continued to kind of go through this March, you see‑‑ they just love to win.
And I think if you ask them, they love it. They're going to continue to play
for each other.  
  
Q. Same question for Lexie, do you feel you've done enough to earn a No. 1
seed in the tournament?  
COACH FRESE: I think we've shown we're tremendously consistent. I think our
body of work speaks for itself. Obviously when they get in a room I don't have
all the paperwork that they have. But for us it's never been about the seed.
It's always been about seeing our bracket and being able to advance. I mean,
last year we were a 4 seed. Worked out pretty well for us to be able to get to
a Final Four. So for us if we're a 1 seed, I think it's a compliment in terms
of our consistency, but it doesn't win us any games. We've got to be able to
come back and be ready to play.  
  
Q. Yesterday when Kiara checked in she borrowed a couple of passes. Looked
like she was a little nervous. Tonight definitely not the same. Do you notice
that difference?  
COACH FRESE: Yeah, no question. And you saw her early. She was the first
player we brought in off the bench. And we knew matchup‑wise she could give us
some big things if she was confident. And she presents easily in terms of
where she's at. But just really proud of her. It hasn't been an easy role for
her as a freshman. She was huge for us tonight.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_HOFFMAN ESTATES, ILLINOIS_  
  

Maryland  77  
Ohio State - 74

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by head coach Kevin McGuff and student‑athletes
Kelsey Mitchell and Ameryst Alston. Questions for student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Kelsey, I know you guys are both disappointed. Can you speak ‑‑ can I ask
you about the entire experience of this tournament and how much your team grew
from the start to the finish?  
KELSEY MITCHELL: I think my team grew tremendously from the standpoint of us
and the adversity, going through the things we went through and coming here
and doing something like this with a great team like that, that's all we could
ask for.  
  
Q. Ameryst, basically you guys are down 50 ‑35\. What clicked in? What
allowed you to get that back, give yourselves a chance, an opportunity to
win?  
AMERYST ALSTON: We came here to win a championship. That was the goal. And I
thought we fought really hard. We dug ourselves in a hole, dug ourselves back
out. And I'm just proud of our team.  
  
Q. Kelsey, I was blocked on the traveling call. Were you trying to split the
two to get in the middle and did you feel like you traveled?  
KELSEY MITCHELL: I'm not sure. My goal is to try to get it inside and do
something with it. Due to the time and due to how things are going, my goal is
to try to get inside as much as possible.  
  
Q. Can I add, the last ‑ditch shot, do you think that had an opportunity to
go?  
KELSEY MITCHELL: Basketball, anything goes. 50/50 chance on anything. So it
was a try. Just didn't work.  
  
Q. Ameryst, was this a difficult game basically to gauge in terms of how it
was being called?  
AMERYST ALSTON: We can't blame the refs at all. Like I said before, I mean,
there was some calls that we thought we should have got, but can't blame the
refs.  
  
Q. For you two, the amount of growth, could you feel the amount of growth
you guys made in the three days here?  
KELSEY MITCHELL: Absolutely. I think we're capable of beating any team. We've
grown so much with the things that happened to us. And like I said, I'm just
proud.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. I was screened on the traveling call. How did you see it? Do you want to
talk about it?  
COACH MCGUFF: No.  
  
Q. Essentially, again, you're down 50 ‑35\. I mean, you're unhappy enough,
you got a technical called on you. But what kicked in?   
COACH MCGUFF: I think when we started pressing. We kind of got them out of
rhythm ‑‑ they were in a really good rhythm offensively, and then when started
to bring some full‑court pressure, I thought that got them out of an offensive
rhythm and we started to get us some stops which allowed us to get in
transition and allowed us to get back in the game.  
  
Q. This group has a lot of times this year come back from kind of the large
deficits, but can you feel the growth in these three games heading towards the
tournament?  
COACH MCGUFF: Yes. Where we were ‑‑ we started in November ‑‑ where we are
now, we've come a long way. And our chemistry is really developed. Our kids
really like playing together, like being around each other. We played really,
really hard here in this tournament. We competed for 40 minutes and three
straight games.  
I think we have just a lot of confidence. We didn't have the confidence
earlier in the year. It's taken a while. A tough schedule, a tough Big Ten
schedule for our kids to believe that we can compete with anybody.  
  
Q. Again, last year, over the loss in the semifinals was the end of your
season. You have more coming. You think your kids will be eager to get back in
the gym and get back to it?  
COACH MCGUFF: No question, I think this experience will only fuel that even
more. We played three really good teams. We played really well in three games.
We certainly had a great chance and an opportunity tonight, didn't go our way.
But I think we played well enough that we'll have a lot of confidence moving
on to the NCAA Tournament.  
  
Q. Obviously another big performance from Mitchell. Just how instrumental
was she tonight?  
COACH MCGUFF: She's a great player. She's really a special kid. And she
competes as hard as anybody I've seen and probably more importantly she shows
up every single day at practice and gets better. That's why she is who she is.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_HOFFMAN ESTATES, ILLINOIS_  
  

Maryland  74  
Northwestern - 63

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by head coach Joe McKeown and student‑athletes Nia
Coffey and Maggie Lyon. Coach, an opening comment.  
COACH MCKEOWN: You know, it was just a hard‑fought tough game, really proud of
our team for fighting back. We played a great‑‑ we came out ready to play,
played as good as 15, 16‑minute stretch as I thought maybe we played all year.
And Maryland made a big run at the end of the first half that kind of came
back in the game of runs. Just disappointed. We coached this game and our
players played this game to beat Maryland.  
That was our philosophy coming in. Okay. Why are you playing tonight? And
let's go beat them and so everything we did was to try to beat them, and I
thought our kids did a great job. And I give Maryland a lot of credit.  
Terrific team, they can play inside out. And we just, we just couldn't get the
lead back in the second half. But what a great effort by these two and the
rest of our team. And great fan support tonight. It was just great‑‑ it was
great for our program. But give Maryland a lot of credit.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Nia, to start the game you had 16 points in the first ten minutes. You
were nailing shots from everywhere. Could you explain what was happening in
that really hot start to start the game?  
NIA COFFEY: My intentions were to go out there and play hard and play for my
team.  
  
Q. You guys had a stretch to start off the second half, they really
increased their lead, their offense just kind of died and it was a rare
stretch for you guys, especially this season. What was going on out there on
your end or defensively that really slowed down the offense the start of the
second half?  
MAGGIE LYON: I think, like Coach said, give Maryland a lot of credit. They're
a great offensive team. And I felt like we came out with a lot of energy in
the second half. But they were just knocking down some shots. They were
getting inside/outside touches. We just weren't knocking down shots. And that
just happens sometimes.  
It's not always a perfect game. So just give Maryland credit for their
offensive game.  
  
Q. How big were the turnovers in this contest, your team second in the Big
Ten in turnover margin but seemed like Maryland did a really good job forcing
turnovers today?  
MAGGIE LYON: We know they're a really good defensive team as well. And that
they put a lot of pressure and force teams into bad situations offensively.
And sometimes we played into that. I think that's where the turnovers came
from. But other times we kept our composure and played our game.  
We know that turnovers aren't our game and that's when we run into trouble.
And they did a good job at times forcing us into that but we tried to reign it
in.  
  
Q. In the first half you guys, there were very few fouls called on either
team. But you both fouled out and the game was called tighter in the second
half. Did it feel different out there. Did you feel like you were playing a
different style of defense, as far as it being more physical out there?  
NIA COFFEY: Definitely both teams were very physical. We were playing
physical. We fought really hard and we weren't going to back down and neither
were they. We just played hard. They started calling the game tighter so we
just had to adjust.  
  
Q. Nia, going back to the first half, was it hard not to get ahead of
yourself, when you were playing as well as you were playing, in particular,
and as a whole as a team because you guys were up by I think 11 at one point
in the first half and kind of disappeared pretty quickly after that?  
NIA COFFEY: I mean, Maryland is a great team. We never overestimate any team.
Doesn't matter who we are playing. We were playing our game. It was going
well. And they want to run. So we just had to come back, but it's a game of
runs.  
  
Q. Maggie, Coach mentioned it, but the fight that you guys put up there at
the end, how important was that as you guys look forward past this game and
into the postseason to know that you weren't just going to lay down and going
to keep fighting?  
MAGGIE LYON: I think it's super important. And I think it's been a huge
component of our season and there's been a lot of games where we're down
double digits in the second half and we came back and won those games. We knew
it that it doesn't matter who we are playing, it's about us. That's what Coach
always says.  
And there was no difference in tonight. And Maryland, like everybody said, is
a great team. But who cares. We want to go out there and we want to beat
anybody. So, yeah, I think just know that when you get down in the second half
it's possession by possession, chip away, and don't try and get it away with
one play.  
And I thought we did a great job of fighting back. And if we had four more
minutes, never know what would have happened.  
  
Q. So the team had 25 points in the first ten minutes. What changed for you,
Nia, and the rest of the team after that, because it seemed like there was
offensive dearth after that?  
NIA COFFEY: We slowed down a little bit. But we're never going to stop
fighting. It took us a while to get back into things. In games like this, that
really hurt us. But as our team, we keep fighting. We keep playing together,
and we just came back.  
COACH MCKEOWN: Just so you all know, like this team won 23 games this year.
These two are going to be one of the first teams in Northwestern history to
play in the NCAA Tournament. And you've got to understand what a great year
these guys have had. Really special. Proud of both of them.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, the fouls started piling up for you guys in the second half. Were
you trying to do anything differently adjustments ‑wise on your end to slow
that down before Nia and Maggie ended up fouling out?   
COACH MCKEOWN: We were concerned about trying to attack the basket and then
try to force them to take 3s. They took a lot of 3s. And what really hurt us
during that stretch, when we did force them to take long shots, we didn't
rebound it. Gave them second chances. And that really‑‑ that just to me was
the difference in the game.  
  
Q. You've had great scoring depth recently. You had five players in double
figures basically every game recently. Only two tonight. What was the key
tonight in Maryland limiting your scoring options?  
COACH MCKEOWN: Well, I think on any given night, we got seven people that can
probably score. So we had to look at different avenues. Nia exploded early in
the game. Alex Cohen did a great job.  
So as we move forward, I think we just‑‑ it's a matchup tournament coming up.
And when you have seven players that can score, I think we're going to have
opportunities. And we're a dangerous offensive team. We're not a great
offensive team because we have droughts. But we're a dangerous offensive team.  
  
Q. As the game started to slip away and Maryland kept putting up 3s, did you
ever think about making adjustments and running a lot of plays for Maggie to
get her open beyond the arc?  
COACH MCKEOWN: We tried. They did a good job switching out on her. They got in
passing lanes. And that's something that we try to do in transition. But she's
had an incredible year.  
And I'll say this, when you know you're trying to get her the ball to shoot
and everybody on the other team knows that, she still has been able to get
open all year and make shots. So really proud of her.  
  
Q. This is the end of your season in this tournament. You guys are still
going to play in the bigger tournament later on. How do you keep the team's
confidence up and let them know that you know you haven't beaten Maryland yet,
you can still compete against the best teams in the country and beat them?  
COACH MCKEOWN: That's our whole‑‑ that was our whole thing coming into this
weekend and then to beat Rutgers, to get a double bye into the semifinals, to
play tonight, had we gotten past Maryland we'd be playing for the championship
tomorrow.  
These are great steps for our program. So I want our players to just feed off
of that, really all the positives that have happened over the last, I think‑‑
I don't know, we're 9 and 2 in our last 11 games we were 8 and 0. Our only two
losses are to Maryland.  
So I think this has been a great experience for us. I don't think there's a
whole lot of negatives that will come out of the Big Ten tournament.  
I think we made a lot of fans nationwide, too, when you watched us play
against Rutgers and you watched us play tonight. I feel like going into two
weeks from now, we'll be ready to play. And we gotta heal a little bit. We've
got two great players that are nursing injuries‑‑ they sat out the three, four
games. Christen Inman and Lauren Douglas, we'll get them ready. This break
will probably help us there, get some rest. Some other people that haven't had
opportunities, I think, can help us, too. We've got to get them.  
So I think it's a really good opportunity for us to take some time off and
regroup. Like you saw tonight, these guys will be ready to play.  
  
Q. How do you crack a defense like Maryland going forward? They've crossed
up your offense a little bit in these two games. You have to play a caliber of
that team if you make it to the second round or Sweet 16 at the NCAA
Tournament.  
COACH MCKEOWN: You've got to do couple things. The teams I've coached that got
to the Sweet 16, to the final eight, I've been fortunate enough to coach some
great teams in the NCAA Tournament, you have to be able to defend to score.  
And I think that's where great teams that advance to the Sweet 16 or beyond,
they defend and they're able to score because they stopped the other team. And
that's really important in the tournament, my experience.  
So we have the ability to score. We just gotta get stops and capitalize. And
again it will be fun. Big Ten has been a great league for us. We just competed
in 20 Big Ten games. I think everybody in our league that is probably going to
advance, they're excited about maybe playing other people, different parts of
the country, too.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_HOFFMAN ESTATES, ILLINOIS_  
  

Maryland  74  
Northwestern - 63

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Maryland head coach Brenda Frese and
student‑athletes Laurin Mincy, Brene Moseley and Lexie Brown.  
Coach, an opening statement.  
COACH FRESE: I thought Northwestern came out, showed what a great team they
are with the first punch. They were really aggressive. Got us on the back of
our heels. The first ten minutes, I thought they really sped us up.  
I thought we needed to slow ourselves down and get our poise and composure,
led by Coffey. I thought she just did a tremendous job in terms of her energy
and her will to win.  
I thought a big difference for us was our bench play. When you talk about we
went to our bench, Lexie got in foul trouble, we were able to go to our bench
and really stretch out with our defense and with our depth and I thought that
was a huge turning point for where we're at.  
Then the second half, you know, we decided to make it interesting, I guess, to
work on special situations, late game, but again credit to Northwestern. I
thought they did a tremendous job, just not going to quit and they fought for
40 minutes.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Bones, you're down nine points, I think, in the first half and a lot of
bench players come in including yourself, what's the thought process there and
did you have extra confidence compared to how you played against Northwestern
last Sunday?  
BRIONNA JONES: We wanted possessions basically. Because at that point we
needed to value because we were wasting a lot of possessions but we also
needed value on the defensive end. That was my focus coming in. That's what
the bench came in. That's what we were focusing on when we came in.  
  
Q. Laurin, you were the only senior in the lineup in the first half. What
was it like being in on the floor with that group and mounting that coming
back?  
LAURIN MINCY: Making sure we was on the same page, especially defensively. We
needed to rebound especially. Just being overcommunicative and telling my team
to keep fighting throughout the game.  
  
Q. Lexie, for you what's it like watching the reserves get the lead back for
you, you can come in, take over in the second half?  
LEXIE BROWN: It's a lot of fun. I'm not worried I know how hard they work in
practice. They push us in practice every day. When I come out and they go in,
there's never a thought in my mind that our energy is about to dip. They did a
great job today. We didn't come out the way we should have and they were ready
and obviously it showed because we got the lead back going into halftime.  
  
Q. Brene, talk about how big a momentum shift it was when Kiara picked up
that rebound on that second shot going into shaft?  
BRENE MOSELEY: It was huge. That gave us life and we needed that, especially
for her. She needed a boost and that got us going. That was a good moment for
us, especially to be able to show her even off the ball the plays she was able
to make, even crashing. That gave us momentum and from then we just tried to
carry it out.  
  
Q. For any of you, yesterday Northwestern's point guard said nobody's going
to stand in their way. You guys read that stuff, was it any motivation?  
LAURIN MINCY: We did see it. But we were just going to play Maryland
basketball for 40 minutes. We don't focus on the other team. We focus on us.
That's what we did tonight.  
  
Q. Lexie, the team went 0 for 14 stretch, you guys did at one point in the
second half. What was going on offensively during that stretch? You guys had a
really great stretch prior to that spanning halftime. What changed?  
LEXIE BROWN: I don't know. I think that's just the flow of the games,
sometimes you're hot, sometimes you're cold but you can't worry about that. I
had no idea that we had missed that many shots we've just got to focus on
getting it on the other end because you can control our defense. Even if our
shots aren't falling we have to lock it down on defense.  
  
Q. I'm going to go in a completely different direction, Lexie. Yesterday we
had a headband. Today were you making a statement with the waistband?  
LEXIE BROWN: No, I've been wearing the waistband for a while now.  
  
Q. Laurin, your thoughts on their offensive rebounding margin, staggering,
21 ‑8\. What was going right there on the offensive glass?  
LAURIN MINCY: That was one of our game goals. We knew coming into the game
that we had to match them on the boards. Coach B and the rest of the coaching
staff challenged us for this game to outrebound them. We crashed hard, and it
showed tonight.  
  
Q. Bones, second straight big game against Northwestern, is there something
about this team?  
BRIONNA JONES: Not at all. I think I just go with the flow of the game.
Whatever opportunity I'm able to get at, take and seize it. That's what I try
to do that.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the head Coach.  
  
Q. Could you elaborate more on how reserves of the bench contributed, huge.
Margin 24 and 7 in bench points?  
COACH FRESE: It was huge. It was the difference in the game. And we've always
talked about be ready when your number is called. Obviously we had a lot of
players come in off the bench together and we've had all year two teams in
terms of the depth that we've been able to have. So just really proud of them.
Staying united, understanding that our depth can really make a difference and
it was a big part to the game.  
  
Q. Brenda, in the second half you made a similar substitution pattern with
about 12 minutes to go or so. You had Malina was the only starter and four
bench players. Was that sort of in anticipation of possibly playing tomorrow
or was it just again in the flow of the game?  
COACH FRESE: You know, yeah, it was two fold. I wanted to be able to rest our
starters if we could for tomorrow. I also challenged the bench to stay locked
in in terms of being ready again when their number was called. So a little bit
of both.  
  
Q. You talked a lot about Laurin Mincy as the only senior and her
leadership. She was the only starter on the floor during that big comeback.
What was she able to kind of do with that second unit that was so
impressive?  
COACH FRESE: You could feel her presence, her energy on both ends of the
floor, defensively getting stops and then really kind of connecting it all on
the offensive end. You could feel how much she wanted this game.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_HOFFMAN ESTATES, ILLINOIS_  
  

Ohio State  91  
Iowa - 85

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Iowa State head coach Lisa Bluder and
student‑athletes Melissa Dixon, Samantha Logic and Bethany Doolittle will be
joining this press conference.  
Coach, an opening comment.  
COACH BLUDER: Want to congratulate Ohio State. It was a great game. I thought
both teams battled extremely hard. I thought our kids maintained composure,
played hard, kept focused the whole time. I'm proud of my players' efforts out
there tonight. It should be a great battle tomorrow for the championship game.
We wish we could be a part of it.  
But obviously Ohio State is an excellent basketball team. But I think we are
as well. And I think we're going to have a nice run in the NCAA Tournament.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Melissa or Sam, either one of you, in the second half you had a seven
point lead about five and a half minutes left. What happened? It seemed like
you guys were kind of grabbing control of the contest, what happened ‑‑ what
did Ohio State do or what happened for them to come back?  
MELISSA DIXON: I think we just kind of lost personnel at certain times. Kelsey
Mitchell got a couple of open 3s that shouldn't have happened. I think it was
just a matter of losing them a little bit.  
  
Q. Melissa, you started the game shooting really well. But then as the game
winded down, you didn't really get too many attempts. Was that something that
Ohio State did, or was that just how it worked out?  
MELISSA DIXON: I was getting more open looks early on, but after I made a
couple they started to limit my touches a little bit.  
  
Q. Melissa, I know it doesn't feel as good after a loss but you moved into
top 25 for all ‑time 3‑pointers, what does that mean to you?  
MELISSA DIXON: It means a lot. It just goes back to our program and my
teammate and coaches. As always, my teammates are so unselfish and I've been
able to benefit from that, so it all goes all back to them.  
  
Q. Bethany, in regulation, seemed like you guys were a little bit lost
offensively. Then the kicked ball happened. Was that one of the best things to
happen, the moment you get the ball out of bounds?  
BETHANY DOOLITTLE: I think in that situation it was good for us because we got
the ball back and we were able to have the opportunity to get a look at the
basket with the clock winding down.  
But I think we worked hard down to the last second. And we were just fortunate
enough to get that basket at the end.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Sam Logic fouled out there towards the end of regulation. Just how much
did you miss her leadership on the floor there in overtime?  
COACH BLUDER: I mean, I think the worst thing we could have happened was go
into overtime without Sam Logic. We probably needed a 3 on that last inbound
play that we ran, because we got the 2 from Bethany to put it into overtime.  
But realistically, without our floor general, our most experienced player, our
All‑American, we probably really needed to get a 3‑point basket at that point
to win it instead of pushing it to overtime.  
  
Q. Halfway through the second half, five minutes left you had a seven ‑point
lead, you had possession coming up the floor. Looked like you guys were ready
to take firm control. What happened?  
COACH BLUDER: We had two possessions we didn't score. I think we had a
turnover on one. And we had control, I felt like, at that point as well.  
And we just kind of got into too much of a hurry. Didn't really run our
offense and worked for a high percentage shot. We kind of forced up a quick
shot, and that's not what you want to do when you have a seven‑point lead
going into crunch time.  
So we just let the pace of the game overtake us, I think, a little bit at that
point.  
  
Q. Given the season you guys had, a loss like this in the semifinal, does it
make the NCAA Tournament in a couple of weeks a little more important to end
on the right note?  
COACH BLUDER: They're both important. This is important to us. We wanted to be
playing in the championship game tomorrow night. This is very important for
us. We wanted to win a Big Ten championship. That's what my seniors set out to
do.  
We didn't do it. So that's disappointing, but NCAA Tournament is the next
step. That's the next thing. I think we're going to be a great seed. I'm
confident we're going to have home court advantage. We're undefeated in
Carver‑Hawkeye Arena. There's no reason why we should not have a good run in
the NCAA Tournament.  
  
Q. With Melissa moving into top 25 in 3 ‑pointers, how have you seen her
develop into such a prolific 3‑point shooter in her time at Iowa?  
COACH BLUDER: She's always been a good 3‑point shooter. It's not something
that she just developed into in the last couple of years. When she was a
freshman she was doing this. You don't really go into the top 25 without doing
it all four years.  
You can't make those type of numbers up in a couple of years. She didn't
become a starter until last year, but she was the sixth player of the year in
this conference as a sophomore. And she was a part‑time starter her freshman
year. Melissa works hard at it. She puts up thousands of shots. She works
really, really hard at it. I'm glad to see her accomplish this. But she's
wholeheartedly honest when she says it's all about her teammates, because that
is her to a T. She's just a great kid.  
  
Q. You mentioned last night turnovers were an issue and again tonight it
seemed at times you guys didn't value the basketball. Is that something you'd
like to see shore up for the postseason here?  
COACH BLUDER: It's uncharacteristic of us. The last two games we've had too
many turnovers, especially the first half we had 14 tonight. We could have had
a lead if we would have taken care of the ball in the first half tonight going
into halftime.  
But it's something that's uncharacteristic. We gotta get back to figuring out
why it happened the last two nights. Because it obviously hurts you in tight
games, in overtime games. You look at those turnover numbers and you look at
rebound numbers. We gave up too many offensive rebounds in the second half. We
gave up 10 offensive rebounds in the second half. We couldn't keep Hart off
the boards. Those are high‑percentage shots.  
I think the turnovers the first half, the lack of boxing out the second half
was really the story of our demise tonight.  
  
Q. Coach, could you talk a little bit about drawing up that final play which
Beth got the layup to send the game to overtime, what were you thinking
drawing up that play?  
COACH BLUDER: We had two things, two possibilities. One was for a 3 and one
was for Beth on that roll‑back. And it depended how they were going to set up
what one we were going to do.  
We took the roll‑back and had that good high‑percentage shot, put us into
overtime, but again without Sam, probably, you know, I mean she's a person
that plays every single minute for us. And to not have her for those last five
minutes, that was really huge.  
So we probably needed to get the 3 at that point.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_HOFFMAN ESTATES, ILLINOIS_  
  

Ohio State  91  
Iowa - 85

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Ohio State head coach Kevin McGuff, along with
student‑athletes Kelsey Mitchell, Ameryst Alston and Alexa Hart.  
We'll go straight to questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Kelsey, will you take us through like the last 1:22 of the overtime and
just how you saw the two 3 ‑point shots?  
KELSEY MITCHELL: I don't know if I can take you through it. But tonight was
something, one of the best days of my life as far as like learning, especially
being a freshman, being new to this I learned a lot from Iowa, who is a great
team and from my teammates. Learned a lot as a whole. And those two 3s was
just part of the game, that's what it was.  
  
Q. Alexa, they were fouling you on purpose, that was their strategy.
Basically, her hitting those hitting the 3s and picking you up what did it
mean to you?  
ALEXA HART: It meant a lot because I could've hit free throws, but my
teammates kept me up. So it was good that she hit those 3s.  
  
Q. Ameryst, again, just getting back to Alexa. You guys were in the game
because of the way that she played. But what did you see about the matchups
that made you guys go to all throughout the game?  
AMERYST ALSTON: So proud of Lex. I thought she did a good job offensively and
defensively. She was a big presence inside. And it was the difference in the
game.  
  
Q. Kelsey, one more time. You guys were down maybe seven with like four
minutes to go, four and a half minutes to go. What changed do you think that
allowed you guys to get back into the game and push it into overtime?  
KELSEY MITCHELL: Our defense. Coach McGuff said do what you gotta do, don't
let 21 catch it. Do what you gotta do so Doolittle don't get into the paint.
Do what you gotta do so 22 won't get in the paint. It was just the act of us
coming together in that timeout, and he said we need to buckle down on defense
to win the game. That's what it was. We tried our hardest and I guess it
worked.  
  
Q. My question is about the shooting tonight. 1 for 13 shooting the 3s until
‑‑ you made six of your last nine. It's the old adage in play here, just keep
shooting them, eventually it's going to go in?  
AMERYST ALSTON: Absolutely. It be like that sometimes. Sometimes they don't
fall. Sometimes they're not. But we don't let that discourage us at all. You
just gotta keep shooting and eventually they'll go in. If that's not working,
you got the ball to the side to Lex and it worked.  
  
Q. Ameryst, when you saw her open, come open those last two times did you
think, yes, this is going to possibly be good for us?  
AMERYST ALSTON: Are you talking about Kelsey? When she put that up there, I
knew it was going in. That's all that mattered right there.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Kevin, I think I'd like to start with basically going back to November
with everything that went wrong in November.  
COACH MCGUFF: Do we have to go back to November? Can we just stay in March?  
  
Q. With this game, are you kind of amazed with what you just saw and what
just happened?  
COACH MCGUFF: I'm certainly really proud of our team, because it wasn't easy
with the injuries and Raven having to be off the team. We faced a lot of
adversity and I think it would have been real easy for us to say, hey, this
isn't our year. But I think we have the right kids in our program from the
standpoint that they're highly competitive kids who‑‑ I think they had some
kind of trepidation early in the year, like, can we do it? Then we just kept
getting a little bit better, a little bit better. And we stayed on that
course. You could see our confidence start to grow and grow until we finally
got six, seven, eight, and we're fine.  
But it took a while. I think they believed, but it took a while for them to
gain the confidence to play like this. And I think that's what you're seeing.
It's just us getting better throughout the year and us gaining confidence
while we did that.  
  
Q. In this game, Iowa looked like it might have taken control about two
‑thirds of the way through the second half. And was it the timeout, is that
what changed things?  
COACH MCGUFF: You know, we went for a while there we just couldn't string
together two or three stops there. And Iowa's great on offense, one of the
best offensive teams I've played against in terms of execution and having
players fit the style of play they have. So give them credit for making it
tough for us to stay with them. But once we finally got a couple stops, in the
second half I felt like we started moving the ball better and getting much
better shots. I felt we could score enough. We just weren't getting enough
stops. I think the 3 off the inbounds play that Kelly hit was a really big
play from a momentum standpoint. This was a great basketball game. Iowa's
really an outstanding basketball team. It's a shame somebody had to lose
because you saw two teams out there really playing their hearts out and proud
we found a way to win it.  
  
Q. For Iowa, Melissa Dixon led the game kept them in 22 points, mostly
behind the arc. Is it interesting or ironic to you that you've been able to
seal it with the 3 ‑pointer after the way she was shooting?  
COACH MCGUFF: She's a great player. We had a specific plan on how we were
supposed to guard her. And every time we had any glitch in that plan, she made
us pay. She's that good in terms of a shooter. It is ironic‑‑ really, I don't
think we made any 3s in the first half, did we?  
So but we made them when we needed them. And Kelsey, she's a special player.
And special players make big plays. And she certainly did that tonight. I
would also say I'm proud of Alexa Hart, too. She had 24 points, eight rebounds
against a really good ‑‑ whether it was Doolittle or Till in there ‑‑ Iowa's
really good around the basket and really strong and not easy. For a freshman
to come in and do that is saying a lot. She had heck of a performance.  
  
Q. It wasn't really surprising that they decided to target her with a
foul?  
COACH MCGUFF: No, not really. I think in that situation, you get more nervous
that they're actually putting you there. Like if they would have fouled her in
the course of the game I think she would have made plenty. But it throws you
off a little bit. Then she makes the last one and we stepped over the line.  
It is what it is. But it was fine.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

_HOFFMAN ESTATES, ILLINOIS_  
  

Ohio State  83  
Minnesota - 71

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Minnesota head coach Marlene Stollings and
student‑athletes Shae Kelley, Amanda Zahui B. and Carlie Wagner. Coach, an
opening statement.  
COACH STOLLINGS: I would like to give credit right away to Ohio State. I
thought that they played and executed a very good game plan. And I thought
they followed their leader, the co‑player of the year, Kelly Mitchell. I
thought that she was outstanding tonight. And credit to her and their team for
just a very solid tournament performance.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Amanda, can you just talk about this Big Ten Tournament experience for
this team and hopefully if you make it in the tournament, what it will do
moving forward?  
AMANDA ZAHUI B.: I think we fought a lot and we fought hard. And moving
forward, we need to play harder and tougher, take with us what we did wrong
and build on that and take what we did right and good and build on that.  
  
Q. Amanda, your teammates had a lot of trouble getting the ball inside to
you in the first half. What was Ohio State doing that was making it so
challenging?  
AMANDA ZAHUI B.: I just have to catch the balls and work harder to get a
better position. We had some great looks. And it's not so much what Ohio State
did, it's more ourselves.  
And we've got to grow and become better at passing but also catching balls and
getting better position.  
  
Q. Carlie, you faced one of the Big Ten co ‑players of the year in Kelsey
Mitchell. What kind of challenges does she present on the court?  
CARLIE WAGNER: Kelsey has a lot of strengths on the court, obviously. She can
hit the 3 off the dribble or the catch. And she's really good at driving down
into the paint and dishing off when she's not open and stuff. She's just a
really hard player to guard but I thought we could have done a better job
keeping her in check and stuff, but she's a really good player.  
  
Q. Shae, you haven't been in the Big Ten Tournament before, in the NCAA
Tournament either. Can you talk about what this postseason experience for you
would be like with this team moving forward?  
SHAE KELLEY: I just think that every opportunity that we get we just got to
take advantage of it, going into this tournament. We were confident. We came
out, played a good first game. I think the second game kind of just slipped
away from us a little bit defensively. But just going forward, into the NCAA
Tournament, we just gotta come out with that hunger to win. And I think that's
what we'll be focusing on these next two weeks. I believe in my team and they
believe in me. I think we'll be fine going forward.  
  
Q. Shae, there was point there in the first half after Carlie hit the 3, you
were up 15 to 14, and then you guys got really cold and you cleared a lot of
turnovers. What happened to the team during that point in the game?  
SHAE KELLEY: You're going to make mistakes throughout a game. You're going to
have some slumps. The other team is going to go on runs and you're going to
turn the ball over.  
But I think our energy just defensively was the main thing. We just had to
pick that up. We did end up picking it up but we have to pick it up earlier.
We're not so much worried about the turnovers. Those are going to happen in
any game. It's just that energy on defense to force them to turn the ball over
also.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, first matchup against Ohio State, you outrebounded them by 20 but
it was more even tonight. What adjustments did you see on the glass from Ohio
State?  
COACH STOLLINGS: Well, I think a lot of their younger players have gotten a
lot better. I think they've developed more physicality. And we saw a lot
different team in terms of their physicality than we did when we played in
Columbus. So credit to them for that.  
For our young ladies, I think that we're still working through what it means
to play on this stage and to handle the increased intensity and physicality
that comes with this time of year.  
  
Q. What did you learn from some players that haven't played with this team
in the postseason environment ‑‑ Shae Kelley, Carlie ‑‑ that might help moving
forward here?  
COACH STOLLINGS: Well, I thought Shae was outstanding, both games. I thought
she really played like a fifth‑year senior and someone who is hungry
continuing playing as long as she can here in March. We're very pleased with
her performance.  
I think for Carlie, a little bit of an off night for her last night but she
comes back tonight and is pretty solid in terms of scoring. But how she gets
her shot off as well as bringing additional, something else to the table in
her defensive play and rebounding is something that we're going to try to get
her to step up here before the NCAA Tournament.  
  
Q. How secure or insecure, as the case may be, are you feeling about your
chances to get that NCAA bid at this point?  
COACH STOLLINGS: We feel very secure in getting an NCAA bid. You never really
know until selection Monday. And we realized that. But we feel that our
tournament resumé is extremely solid with the 23 wins, where our RPI is. We
think we're certainly a tournament team.  
  
Q. Given the fact that you guys have had some very inconsistent performances
lately, what do you need to clean up the most before you move on to further
postseason play?  
COACH STOLLINGS: I think the obvious one is that we have to defend better the
entire game. We're doing a good job in spurts. But consistently for a
40‑minute period we've not been solid. The scoring piece is going to come and
go some. And if we're 70 and up this time of year, we're okay with that
offensively. But defensively we cannot be giving up 80‑plus points in March
and really expect to have great success.  
  
Q. I know Mikayla got hit in the head early there. She came back from that.
Your team doesn't have very much depth. So obviously at first a little
concern. How big was it for her to come back and just finish the game?  
COACH STOLLINGS: I think it shows her toughness. She's one of the toughest
kids out there. She's just going to play with great heart and high energy and
intensity, I think, is what we rely on from Mikayla, and I think her being
able to take such a hit and be able to come back just speaks to her toughness.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_HOFFMAN ESTATES, ILLINOIS_  
  

Maryland  70  
Michigan State - 60

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Michigan State head coach Suzy Merchant, along
with student‑athletes Tori Jankoska and Aerial Powers. We'll start with an
opening comment from Coach.  
COACH MERCHANT: Well, pretty physical contest, that's for sure. And I give
credit to Maryland. I thought they did a really good job coming out of the
gates in the beginning of the game, just really attacking us at both ends of
the floor, and we had some good looks I think early. The ball didn't drop as
it did in Michigan, and I think then you play a little defensive and playing
defensive against a team that can score like that and turn things up is a
little challenging.  
I'm proud of our kids' fight. We battled in and battled back and dug in and
just really, really proud of our effort today. It just wasn't enough.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Tori, there was a moment in the first half where Aerial goes out. It's a
16 ‑point game, something around there. Looked like you guys might easily
cave‑in. What was the determining factor to try and fight and battle back even
though the odds were against you there?  
TORI JANKOSKA: I think we have that fight in us all year. And whenever we get
down or it's not going our way, at some point we're going to flip a switch and
turn it around and get it back to within striking distance. And when Aerial
came back in, brings us energy on defensive end, offensive end, so we were
able to cut the lead before half.  
  
Q. Tori, how difficult was it with their length for you to get good looks on
the perimeter?  
TORI JANKOSKA: I mean, it was pretty difficult, because you never know how
long they are. I didn't get a hand up and easily contest a shot. I think in
the first half that affected my play a lot and I wasn't being as aggressive.
In the second half, started taking it in using shot fakes and doing things so
their length didn't affect me.  
  
Q. This run of the season, what does it feel like in your legs right now,
you've been through this together, you survived it?  
AERIAL POWERS: I'm happy we survived it and everybody's healthy still. But I
guess it did kind of tire us out. My knee's feeling it a little bit. A little
bit older that I am. But I'm happy that we pushed through. And we still were
able to give Maryland our all. We just came up a little short.  
  
Q. Aerial, there were about three or four different spots where it looked
like it was going to be a blowout. And why didn't that develop?  
AERIAL POWERS: Because we don't give up. And our fight, we just have amazing
fight in us. And every time we saw like them kind of surpassing us, we come in
the huddle and we talk, hey, stop, we need three stops and three scores. We
need to cut this lead right now, cut it right now. We did it throughout the
whole game. We just couldn't take a lead.  
  
Q. Could both of you talk about how talented those guys are individually
especially?  
TORI JANKOSKA: Well, they are ranked four or five in the country. I think they
got a pretty talented squad from their starting five to the five that sit on
the bench. They bring in reinforcements and wear people down. They've got a
great point guard, two bigs that play. They have all five spots that are just
really talented.  
AERIAL POWERS: To go with what Tori said, they are talented, having two big
bigs affects anybody you play. But I feel like we still, even though they are
a good team, given what we had, we did pretty good, I think. If we had a
couple more things going for us, I think we would have won the game. I'm not
giving them I guess too much. I'm a little upset. They're good, but we could
have got them if we were healthier.  
  
Q. How soon do you guys start focusing on the future, and how much rest do
you need? I don't know if the WNIT is something you guys will do or not but
how much time do you take off and how excited are you for next year, how much
has it derailed you, I guess?  
AERIAL POWERS: I mean, I love basketball, right? But after a season like this
you kind of do need some time off to get your mind together and to get your
body back to 100percent. Especially because we've been playing so many minutes
due to our injuries. But I really don't know what timeframe I should give you.
So I don't know. I guess whenever you feel fit to get back on the court.  
  
Q. Aerial, Maryland's defense, that turned you into a high volume shooter. I
think you were 6 for 24 today. Was that as much to do with Maryland's defense
and their length as it was with just kind of being tired, having to put games
together on back ‑to‑back days? And for Tori, same thing, couple times at the
top of the key you were trying to shoot over somebody that's 6'5", Brionna
Jones 6'4". Did that affect your shot or were you tired from coming back to
back?  
AERIAL POWERS: I feel like the first half I did okay and I guess their length
didn't really bother me too much. I felt like the second half I was kind of
forcing things, trying to get things going, because the deficit, we cut it
down and it went back up. So in the time, it's the second quarter. So time is
not on our side anymore. And I feel that's what made me turn into a volume
shooter like taking too many shots is what you're saying, right?  
TORI JANKOSKA: I don't think we're out there playing tired you've seen me and
both Aerial diving on the floor, getting after loose balls, so I don't think
you can say that we're tired and we're not going hard and their length is
affecting us just because we're tired. We're out there and getting after loose
balls, getting offensive rebounds.  
It's not necessarily that much longer than every other team we've played. We
played a bunch of teams in the Big Ten that are just as long. She has guards,
people that are guarding her that are that are a lot bigger than her. It
wasn't just that we were tired. I think we were just trying to help out our
team. I think if she has open shots she should be able to take them, the same
for myself.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Will you guys play in the WNIT, do you know what you'll do with that?  
COACH MERCHANT: We haven't even thought about it. We're eligible for it,
obviously. But I think we're honestly, we're just trying to manage what's
going on right now a little bit. I know we'll meet. We've talked about it a
little bit. I know we're eligible and there's been discussions, but right now
I'm not sure where we're at, with 100percent. I haven't really talked to the
players about it yet.  
  
Q. You survived this season and I know 29.8seconds left Tori goes down for a
brief second. You survived it without any additional ‑‑  
COACH MERCHANT: My first question was, Do you feel like anything's broken?
She's like, No.  
  
Q. Could you talk about your sense of getting through this and what you feel
right now for these guys and this team?  
COACH MERCHANT: I told them I've been doing it 20 years, I've been a head
coach, and I've never been a part of a team than this one. We've won a couple
of championships, I've won several championships actually if you go back in
the day, big seasons, cut down nets, watched amazing performance. I've never
seen a team with this kind of heart and determination and only have seven of
them and two of them are walk‑ons and a couple freshmen. And the hits that
just kept coming.  
And honestly, I've never been more proud of a group than these guys. And I
think there's a reason why our team finished strong. And even when we lost
some games, and we were right there. It wasn't like we lost the two Iowa at
home and we had the close one with Nebraska, Michigan, Northwestern. We
couldn't finish sometimes with the depth issue.  
But the thing that I think helped us down the stretch was that we had
opportunities for other kids to get more comfortable on the court. I think
early on it was just Tori, Aerial and at times Becca. And I think I call them
the complementary players, I guess, you have to call them that because Tori
and Aerial are your all‑conference players. The other kids finding their
niche, finding ways to hit shots when left open or make a play, whether it be
defense or offense. And I thought our complementary kids got better, which
helped Aerial and Tori down the stretch and allowed us to finally finish some
games that maybe we were unable to do earlier in the season.  
  
Q. What were you thinking when you saw Aerial go diving for that loose ball
and rolling over and calling timeout?  
COACH MERCHANT: Oh, how much I love that kid. How much I love her passion. I
mean, really I wasn't thinking about injuries or anything like that. But I
marvel at her competitiveness, her passion for the game, laying on the line.
Her and Tori are probably the two kids I've coached in my career that have
probably the highest amount of competitiveness in them.  
So whether you're down 16 or she's having a tough night, I mean she didn't
score the ball very well tonight and she's finding ways to dive on the floor
for loose balls.  
And I just had a big smile on my face. I don't know what the score was at the
time, but I just was very proud of how hard she's willing to play for her team
and for the university and for the coaches.  
  
Q. When you came to Maryland, after kind of got run out of the gym at
Xfinity Center, you said you thought it was the one game during the season
that the team really just kind of either ran out of gas or didn't put forth
the kind of effort. You mentioned before that you were as proud of this team
or prouder of this team's effort than you have been with any other team you've
coached. The last two games with Maryland have been pretty competitive. Was
that something that the team found inside themselves to motivate them to be
more competitive, or was that something that the coaching staff led them to?  
COACH MERCHANT: I would give credit‑‑ I think it starts with these two guys
that were just in the room. I think when your best players are your most
competitive and passionate people, I think it just permeates through everybody
else. They have a standard that they're playing to win every game. I went in
every game, with the exception of at Maryland, after that game I was really
disappointed in our effort. Aerial played incredible in that game. I think she
had nine offensive rebounds, 26 points. She played really, really well. But
everybody else just kind of watched her do it. It was the first time that I
felt like nobody stepped forward and put forward the effort.  
I would give credit to those two kids. I don't think it's anything else than
their will and their drive. Every time we step foot on the floor, I didn't
care who we were playing, I felt we had a really good chance to win the game
because those two kids bring it every night and they make plays at both ends
of the floor.  
So I don't know, I really give them most of the credit, quite honestly, in
fact, all the credit.  
  
Q. Given the last two days, what do you expect going forward from Lexi
now?  
COACH MERCHANT: She really came on down the stretch. She showed exactly what
she can do. She's a really good shooter. Can hit that open shot. She makes
some great passes. The area she struggled the most, like every freshman, Tori
was the same way, Tori was an awful defender as a freshman. I had to hide her.
Even on the bench I felt like I had to hide her.  
Lexi is one of those kids that found a way to think the game and it caught up,
the rules, the principles, the philosophies that you have have to match up at
some point where it becomes instinctive. And for Lexi, the defensive side of
the ball was a struggle and it affected her confidence in every part of her
game. It's not hard to figure out when you can't close out against a Grand
Valley player when you start the season and get beat that there's a bit of a
panic button you hit. So to watch her do that and go through a BCS season and
get better and better‑‑ I'm excited about Lexi. She has the size and the
passing, the IQ. She's gotten better. This offseason will be big for her from
a strength and quickness perspective. She has to get a little bit thicker and
stronger in the weight room. But I'm really excited about her future.  
I thought she was a big reason why we were able to win some games down the
stretch. No question about it. She was big for us yesterday, obviously.  
  
Q. Wanted to ask you a little more about that future. Those two players are
back, obviously. Is there value in what transpired this year for them, for all
of you guys moving forward? And just your overall thoughts on next year.  
COACH MERCHANT: I definitely think so. I think those two kids really learned
how to be leaders through adversity. As much adversity as a team could face,
quite obviously. They had to do it in a way‑‑ Aerial and Tori are feisty
people, very aggressive. When they have something to say, they're going to say
it.  
And they learned how to figure it out along the way that speaking different
languages to different kids is really important in leadership. And Aerial
would come at somebody because she's so competitive and it would send them to
a place where they couldn't perform. She figured out exactly how to do that.
Tori was the same way. So I think from a leadership perspective, there's no
question that that helped. I think they started playing better together.  
They've always played okay together and well together, I think this year down
the stretch they really learned to play with each other, for each other, those
two kids. I'm excited about next year, obviously we'll get Hines back‑‑ when
we lost her I knew it was going to be an uphill battle, because you just can't
manufacture what that kid brings to the table.  
Those two bigs right there would have helped to have Hines. I think it hurt
Becca's game this year not to have Hines. So having her back, we have a great
point guard coming in, actually two point guards. But a great point guard out
of California coming in. We have some depth there as we've added another one.
Tori's now played it. We almost have three point guards which we struggled in
that department. So I'm excited about that.  
And we'll have some depth and athleticism and quickness with the kids coming
in. So it's exciting to add into what we already have coming back.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 6, 2015

  

### [Kahleah Copper](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26572)

### [C. Vivian Stringer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16227)

  
_HOFFMAN ESTATES, ILLINOIS_  
  

Northwestern  62  
Rutgers - 57

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by head coach C. Vivian Stringer and
student‑athlete Kahleah Copper. We'll go straight to questions for the
student‑athlete.  
  
Q. Kahleah, when you were dominant in the first half, scoring 12 of your 14
points, but in the second half Northwestern stepped up their pressure and
their blizzard collapsed in the key, what was different defensively that
caused you to struggle on the offensive end?  
KAHLEAH COPPER: I think they came out more aggressive but I had to do other
things to get my other teammates involved and that's it.  
  
Q. Kahleah, as you take this game out of the equation, how has your
experience in the Big Ten overall been this first season?  
KAHLEAH COPPER: The Big Ten has been fun for me. It's been very competitive
every night. I think we had to come in every game knowing we had to compete
and I can really appreciate that from the Big Ten.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, despite the loss today, do you feel comfortable that you'll have a
good seed coming into the NCAA?  
COACH STRINGER: No. I don't know. I don't know. We just try to take it one
game at a time. I don't even worry about that. I don't have a clue.  
  
Q. With the foul trouble in the first half, did it change your defensive
game plan at all in the second half because you had a lot of players that were
very close to fouling out?  
COACH STRINGER: I think that you would know if‑‑ I think based upon the score,
when we were able to take switches, you would have to know that we were very
pleased with the way we were playing defense. But it does create a problem. It
does create a problem. And we had to take people out and when you take people
out, they started to get really happy and things changed. I liked the way we
played defense, and I know that it's good.  
But definitely with the foul situation as it was, it was difficult to sustain.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_HOFFMAN ESTATES, ILLINOIS_  
  

Northwestern  62  
Rutgers - 57

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by head coach Joe McKeown and student‑athletes
Maggie Lyon, Ashley Deary and Nia Coffey. Coach, an opening statement.  
COACH MCKEOWN: Great second half by us. And really proud of our team, the way
they responded at halftime. We had struggled. Rutgers really beat us up the
first ten minutes of the game. I thought we did a good job coming back the end
of the first half. But the second half I just felt like we played, once we
took the lead, I felt we played with a lot of poise and made big plays.  
In March, whether you win by one or ten, you just want to win and move
forward. And I think we played with some urgency in the second half. And
really proud of our team.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Ashley, your defensive pressure in the first half was huge. You didn't
attempt a shot in the first half, you had four steals in the second half. You
were so active in the open court. How big was the ramping up of your defensive
pressure to get you all on a run that would eventually win a game?  
ASHLEY DEARY: I thought it was important because it got them flustered. They
weren't really sure what to do. It rallied us as a team to get transition
points and get back on the boards.  
  
Q. Nia, you played in this tournament last year so you had that experience,
but you still had a slow start tonight. Was it just because you didn't get to
play earlier or just nervousness or anything like that?  
NIA COFFEY: We have our good days and bad days. I just had a slow day. I have
my team to back me up. So we played again, that's why we got the win.  
  
Q. Do you think the fact you beat Rutgers by 20 points just last week played
a role at all in the start to the game?  
MAGGIE LYON: I agree with what Nia just said. I don't think so. I think it
might have changed how they started the game, but I think that they came out a
little stronger.  
We didn't play as much energetic basketball in the first half. But I think we
have a whole team to call us out on it and hold each other accountable. I
think that's what the second half really drove us to get that lead is just
kind of playing together and knowing that we were better than what we were in
the first half.  
ASHLEY DEARY: Definitely, going into the halftime down, that was the
motivation, we beat them before we knew we had it in us and we had to get
together and be disciplined and go back to the basics.  
NIA COFFEY: Rutgers was a very talented team. They play really hard. So we
knew better not to overestimate them because they were going to come out and
play hard. We had to match that. We had a slow first half. But we brought it
back the second half. That's what mattered.  
  
Q. Rutgers had a lot of foul trouble in the first half. They had three
players with three fouls going into halftime. When you made your halftime
adjustments, how much did it go into your mind that with them in so much foul
trouble you could be a little more aggressive on the offensive end?  
MAGGIE LYON: I think that it definitely‑‑ I don't necessarily think it changed
our game plan because we were in a little bit of foul trouble as well. I think
the game was called pretty tight.  
Especially with a physical team, a really good defensive pressure team like
Rutgers it's going to happen like that. But I think that just‑‑ I think what
we were focusing on more in the second half was our defensive pressure and we
knew the shots would fall and we knew that if we executed our offense and
played our game that things would turn around.  
  
Q. What kind of confidence do you have in making a comeback, with what you
guys have done this season?  
NIA COFFEY: We know what we're capable when we play together and we play
disciplined we can go really far and we played really well, so we have to make
sure we maintain that mental stability and we'll be successful.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the role that having all those free throws in the
first half played for you guys to keep you in the game?  
ASHLEY DEARY: I think it was really important because it kind of got them out
of their sync and they had to drop back into a zone. So it gave us motivation
to just keep attacking and do what we can to get to the rim. If we're not
knocking down shots, we can at least hit it at the line.  
  
Q. Ashley, your thoughts getting a crack at Maryland six days after you
played them last?  
ASHLEY DEARY: I think we're excited. I think we're ready for revenge. I think
we're going to come out a whole different team and just energetic. Like we
want to win the Big Ten championship. That's our goal. There's not going to be
a team that's going to stop us from that.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, is this an example of Nia's maturity level that she can play
through the mistakes or the slow start today?  
COACH MCKEOWN: Yeah. She's a great player. She's had an incredible year,
whether she's a sophomore or a senior, she's just done everything to put us in
this position in so many ways. And she got in a little foul trouble but came
back in the last five minutes and rebounded the ball, made a big bucket.  
So, you know, she had 35 points against Iowa. She had 17 rebounds in the game.
You're not going to be able to do that every night in our league. So I think,
one thing she's doing is just learning where her shots are coming from, how to
play when defenses are designed to stop you. And that's I think the biggest
growth I've seen in her.  
  
Q. You had five players in double figures tonight. How pleased were you with
the balance that you all showed on the offensive end especially in the second
half?  
COACH MCKEOWN: A lot more poise in the second half. I thought in the first
half we were a little, we shot it quick and maybe forced some things. But in
the second half I thought we did a much better job running our offense. Forced
Rutgers, I think, to have to guard us with hard cuts and got the ball inside a
little bit.  
So it was just a rugged hard‑nosed game.  
  
Q. Ashley had a stretch when you guys first took the lead where she scored
eight straight points for you guys. Could you talk about how important that
was and just about her playing in general for the game?  
COACH MCKEOWN: Got us in the open court where Rutgers in the half court
defensively is one of the best teams in the country. So it helped us to get
buckets at the rim. We talked about that at halftime. We've got to get some
things at the basket. We were playing a little bit east/west.  
We wanted to be more north/south. And I thought that really opened some things
up. And just was able to get us some confidence on the defensive end, because
you gotta score. We scored and then we got a stop and scored and got a stop
and that was important.  
  
Q. Facing a talented team, a coach that's got 950 wins and you're down 15
points in the first half, you still have that kind of confidence you guys are
going to come back and win this?  
COACH MCKEOWN: I think our team feels that way and our coaching staff. So we
just felt like we needed to clean‑‑ we talked about at halftime just cleaning
some things up. I'll tell you, Maggie Lyon made a couple of big plays at the
end of the first half and that really helped us because we were struggling.  
We got it, I think, I want to say 32‑27\. And that was important, because
Rutgers had control most of the first half up to that point. We made that
little run. Even though we went in down 10 we felt like we had momentum. And I
thought that was really important.  
And it gave us a little window coming out.  
  
Q. The team that's as strong as Rutgers and their ability to come back on a
consistent basis. How important was it once you got that lead to 10 points in
the second half to be able to keep everybody to keep the pedal to the floor?  
COACH MCKEOWN: I thought we did a great job defensively. And we rebounded in
traffic, too. Like being back on the beltway and not moving. But we did a good
job of rebounding in traffic. And that was important.  
  
Q. Can you talk about how important it was for the team to continue to keep
scoring when Nia went to the bench for that long stretch in the second half?  
COACH MCKEOWN: Yeah. And I thought Lauren Douglas hit a big jumper. Alex Cohen
made big plays. People stepped up. Maggie, Karly. So I thought we got real
good, even though she's‑‑ Ashley had the ball a lot she also found ways to
score. That was important. Because Rutgers they score quick. A couple times
they scored three or four seconds from the out of bounds. And we did a better
job, I thought.  
So we're pretty balanced. Like one of our strengths is we're balanced. But I
don't want to play without her.  
  
Q. Just your thoughts on getting Maryland again the second time in less than
a week. Is there anything maybe strategically you want to change without
giving away the game plan?  
COACH MCKEOWN: You know, thank you for that article. It touched a lot of
people back in the DC area. They're a great team. There's a reason they're
undefeated.  
I think for us it's an opportunity, again it's one game. The winner goes into
the finals. So I think we'll be loose. I think Maryland in the second half of
the game last week, you know, just showed why they went undefeated.  
They had a stretch where they really capitalized when we couldn't score; they
scored. And we gotta stop those runs. We just can't let those runs happen. But
they're a great team. But it will be a fun game. I'll tell you, our kids are
competitive.  
  
Q. With this being only your second win in the Big Ten tournament in your
tenure here at Northwestern, how important do you think it is as a confidence
builder for this team, not just this year, but also going forward?  
COACH MCKEOWN: Do you count double byes as wins? I don't know. I guess not.
But those things‑‑ as you build a program, we played a great game. I'll tell
you, last year we played as about as good a game there is in the tournament
against Ohio State.  
They turn around the next day and beat the No. 1 seed by 30. In these
tournament games, you never know. But again you've been around our team. Our
goals are really high right now and competitive.  
So I think we came into this tournament like let's go play, we're
Northwestern, and I think being a 4 seed gave our kids a lot of confidence in
a 14‑team league. And that's never happened before, too. So we'll see.  
These guys are capable of anything.  
  
Q. A lot of turnovers in the early part of the first half but you all
secured the ball pretty much the end of the first half and entirety of the
second half. How important was it for you in making your comeback to be able
to take care of the basketball and keep everything under control?  
COACH MCKEOWN: Rutgers was getting out. They were getting layups at the rim.
And I thought we stopped that, we did a much better job in the second half.
And we gotta do the same thing tomorrow because Maryland is capable of turning
people over and scoring in transition off their defense. So that's going to be
important for us.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_HOFFMAN ESTATES, ILLINOIS_  
  

Iowa  74  
Nebraska - 65

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by head coach Connie Yori, Tear'a Laudermill and
Emily Cady. Coach, an opening statement.  
COACH YORI: That first four minutes of the game was some of the most fun
basketball of the season. And I think both teams settled in, and Iowa is just
good, they're a really good basketball team and they've got scorers at all
spots and they're hard to guard. And I want to compliment our team for playing
a little undermanned for the last ten games or so and competing really hard
against a really good basketball team. Congratulations to Iowa and there are a
team that's playing really, played really well all year. They've got good
players, well‑coached. But I also want to compliment our team on what we did
today.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Just you can answer this, seemed like you're trying to post the paint in
the second half because you can see that you guys were trading buckets and
then things were starting to level off where Iowa started to pull away. What
were you all saying out there to each other about the pace of the game, trying
to get back into the game?  
TEAR'A LAUDERMILL: We were just telling each other to keep calm. There was a
time we sped up a little bit. But I was telling everybody just keep calm, it's
going to come to us, our shots are going to fall, we came together. We were
trading buckets, but we scored again and we just had to play good defense.  
  
Q. Emily, what's it like playing a team like Iowa you've played so many
times, the seniors that you've matched up against those exact people and how
did that play into the game?  
EMILY CADY: It's always fun to play Iowa, always a grudge match. We always
battle hard against each other no matter what. And it's good competition, and
it's just really fun to play them.  
  
Q. Melissa Dixon leads the nation in 3 ‑pointers how did you try to limit
her, she ended up with just one?  
TEAR'A LAUDERMILL: We all know Melissa Dixon is a very nice shooter but game
plan for everything is pretty much to limit her shots. And our plan was just
to cut her down getting easy looks, gets that one shot off keeps on going. I
think we did a good job limiting her view to get 3s off.  
  
Q. Emily, how do you think this team will respond in the time before the
NCAA Tournament to get ready and how do you want to see this season
continue?  
EMILY CADY: I think we have a lot of practice time and a lot of rest time. It
will be nice to get back in the gym and work on our shots and work on our
defense and get some of the newer kids like the freshmen who haven't had as
much practice as like a senior and get them into practices and hopefully we
can become a better team through the time.  
  
Q. Connie, what was the game plan for Melissa? The nation's leading 3 ‑point
shooter.   
COACH YORI: Well, we've‑‑ I think we know Iowa really well. And they know us
really well. So the game plan is not to leave her. We do a pretty good job of
not leaving her and not giving her open looks. The one 3 she hit was right off
the start of the second half. But the thing that challenges you with Iowa is
that it's not just about Melissa Dixon. They've got great scorers‑‑ any one of
those starters can score double figures or could get 15 on a given night or
more. So that's what challenges you.  
So if you put your full focus on Dixon, well, you're giving something else up.
So we historically have done a pretty good job in guarding Iowa, considering
we've done a pretty good job. I think Iowa, I think what makes them better
this year is that I think they're a better defensive team than they were.
They've always been a really good scoring team.  
And that hasn't changed. But I think now defensively they're that much better.  
  
Q. What did you tell the team at halftime once you realized that you guys
were trading buckets, you got a little bit closer, what did you tell them in
preparation for the second half?  
COACH YORI: You just gotta keep playing every possession. That's what
basketball is about. You play for 40 minutes and you play every possession
like it matters and just compete.  
And I thought, like I said earlier, that first four, five minutes of the game,
through the first media, was really high level, high paced. And everyone
settled in. And we got‑‑ we didn't make as many shots later.  
But we're down a very important person in our program. But I'm just with our
kids, I just keep telling them just play every possession, work as hard as you
can defensively.  
But on the offensive end there were times we got impatient. I wish‑‑ there
were some possessions I wish we had back.  
  
Q. Does it complicate things that there's multiple people that can hit 3
‑pointers for them at any time, I guess?   
COACH YORI: Their spacing is so good. And therefore Doolittle goes 7 for 10
from the field because she gets one‑on‑one in the post. I mean, you go double
or you're leaving‑‑ you're taking your chances and leaving a really good
shooter wide open, perhaps. And so Bethany gets singled a lot that's because
of the spacing she has with the guards she plays with.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_HOFFMAN ESTATES, ILLINOIS_  
  

Maryland  70  
Michigan State - 60

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Maryland head coach Brenda Frese along with
student‑athletes Lexie Brown, Shatori Walker‑Kimbrough and Brionna Jones.
Opening comment, Coach.  
COACH FRESE: I thought our start was really, really key. And it was something
that we really stressed. When you see in these quarterfinal games, when you
haven't played a game and you've had that double bye, just coming out
aggressive.  
I thought our strong start was really, really impressive. Probably one of our
best 40‑minute games defensively. And then I thought offensively trying to
wear them out, our depth was a huge factor when you talk about playing ten
players in the first half, being able to go 11 players through this rotation.  
And obviously our floor general, I thought Lexie played one of her best games.
When March hits, this team gets excited in terms of raising their level of
play.  
  
Q. Lexie, for you, how much of a (indiscernible) did you make to get started
quickly today given your last game against Northwestern?  
LEXIE BROWN: I don't know. I just wanted to do whatever it took to get us to a
hot start. And that just happened to be me hitting shots. If it was me
distributing more, locking down on defense, I would have done that.  
But I was getting open looks and I just shot them with confidence.  
  
Q. Shatori, the game looked pretty physical out there, and you picked up a
fifth foul. Can you just kind of talk about that, vis ‑a‑vis some of your
experiences in the ACC tournament last year?  
SHATORI WALKER‑KIMBROUGH: Coach said it would come down to physicality and she
said they wouldn't be able to match ours. It came down to who was being
physical. Unfortunately mine was illegal, and I had five fouls. But the team
did a great job. Our depth really showed today.  
  
Q. Brionna, was there a point in the second half where you could tell you
were wearing them down, maybe later in the second half?  
COACH FRESE: I thought when we were able to go back to our press‑‑ I'm sorry.  
BRIONNA JONES: I think, like she said, we started pressing them and they
started turning the ball over early. And I think that gave us the confidence,
and then they were losing confidence, and we just built on that and kept
trying to wear them down.  
  
Q. Shatori, I wanted to ask you about guarding Aerial Powers and the
challenges that presents. Can you talk about her game a little bit?  
SHATORI WALKER‑KIMBROUGH: She's a phenomenal player. When we were looking at
her in the scout, she did everything. She posted up. She was a great 3‑point
shooter. She went to her pull‑up. We basically had to go to her tendencies,
which were very little of her tendencies. Everybody, we just did a great job,
tried to keep fresh leg on her from Malina and me and Mincy and Kiara.  
  
Q. You were on top of the key a little bit when Jankoska was shooting from
the perimeter, could you tell she was struggling out there?  
BRIONNA JONES: I don't think she was struggling that much from the top of the
key. But I think just my length sometimes bother her a little bit. But she hit
big shots, too.  
  
Q. Lexie, your seven steals, was that a function of maybe some tendencies
you saw on their part or were they getting tired and their passes weren't
zipping as much as they might be if they were?  
LEXIE BROWN: That was just us playing great team defense. We were sliding in
our help side. I was getting the steals, being in the right place at the right
time. I thought our ball pressure was great today. We flustered them. Like we
said before we were just trying to get them worn out. When you get worn out
you don't think of your passes as much. I credit those steals to the team
defense also.  
  
Q. Lexie, on a completely different note, you want to talk about the
headband?  
LEXIE BROWN: My sparkles, do you like them?  
  
Q. I like them. They made you take them off at the beginning of the game
there was a little exchange there.  
LEXIE BROWN: I made it through warm‑ups with those. I thought I was going to
be in the clear. But first possession, she found them.  
So she said they didn't match the white, because this is silver obviously. But
I have black and red, so when we have black and red head bands I'll have team
sparkle. Hashtag team sparkle. I'm trying to bring it and start a movement
here.  
  
Q. Lexie, the trophy, can you explain that?  
LEXIE BROWN: Oh, of course. Well, you see I have this. Tori has her glove.
This is the charger award. So after every game Coach B hands out awards. I
took a charge today so I got the charger award. That's what that is.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Brenda, you mentioned earlier about defensively they had one field goal
in the first ten and a half minutes, what was working for you there
defensively?  
COACH FRESE: I thought we were really aggressive. We came out with a mindset
to really lock in. I thought our aggressiveness in the press was really
important for us. And then in the half court, we were very communicative. We
made them have to take difficult shots.  
  
Q. Today Lexie was the only player in double figures in scoring, which has
sort of been uncharacteristic of the team. Do you want to talk about that? Was
that just kind of the flow of the game, or was Lexie just really in an
attacking mindset?  
COACH FRESE: I definitely think it was the flow of the game. Both Laurin and
Tori battled foul trouble most of the game. It was a physical game. Lexie was
able to be aggressive getting to the rim. And you see the eight, nine points
that were spread around. It's by committee. And I thought, I mean tremendous
job with Kristen coming in, first tournament experience. Just having the depth
that we had was critical to our success today.  
  
Q. You started talking about going to that press in the second half. Is that
because you could tell they were getting worn out and you wanted to end it
right then?  
COACH FRESE: You just knew they were going on tired legs. Having played them,
this being our third time, it was a big part for us the last time we played
them when we went to the press in the second half. We were able to break it
open.  
So obviously wanted to be selective when we were using it. But it was an
important part to our success.  
  
Q. You guys had a decent contingent of fans here. Do you prefer to see this
the same week as the men's tournament, so that they would be down the street
and you'd have a whole maybe another select ‑‑  
COACH FRESE: That is fun. Having been an assistant in the Big 12. We used to
do it that way and you would obviously get a lot more fans. But I do enjoy
being a week earlier so you have the week to kind of rest yourselves in terms
of getting ready for the NCAAs. But I'm really proud of our fans. You talk
about some of these distances for the teams are three‑hour car rides.  
To look in the stands and you see the passionate fan base that we have, to be
able to have to fly here, drive here, says a lot in terms of the passionate
fans that we have.  
  
Q. At one point in the second half, after a couple of steals, when got the
lead out to 50 ‑31, you came off the bench and you were pretty excited. Do you
want to talk about what stimulated that? You sort of jumped out on the
Michigan State called a timeout?  
COACH FRESE: Just energy. Sometimes when you're going through it, you can get
fatigued. But I felt like we could separate at that point. So just kind of
really wanting to layer it with as much energy as possible.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_HOFFMAN ESTATES, ILLINOIS_  
  

Iowa  74  
Nebraska - 65

  
MODERATOR: We're joined by Iowa coach Lisa Bluder and student‑athletes
Samantha Logic, Kali Peschel and Bethany Doolittle. Opening comment from
Coach.  
COACH BLUDER: Good way for us to start the tournament play. We talked a lot
about rebounding and defense and I think we did a good job in both of those
categories today. Outrebounding them. And I thought defensively we did a
really nice job. We had some really good bench play today. I thought Kali
Peschel came in and did a great job for us.  
Claire Till, I thought she came in and got eight rebounds for us. Also forced
a couple of charges, took a couple of charges. So that was really nice to see.
We made our free throws down the stretch. Always good this time of year.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. I understand it's only the quarterfinals, but certain victories mean a
little more than others. Can you talk about the significance of this win
against the opponent?  
SAMANTHA LOGIC: Yeah, obviously Nebraska has taken us out the last three years
of the Big Ten Tournament. So you keep that in the back of your mind. And just
trying to change the tides on that. We did that during the regular season. And
so we tried to carry that over into the tournament here just so we can keep
our tournament run going.  
Obviously, though, that's a really good basketball team out there, and Coach
Yori always has them ready to play.  
  
Q. Bethany, you get into foul trouble a little bit like you did tonight, is
it hard to not want to play tentative and try to kind of keep yourself
reserved or is that even something you think about?  
BETHANY DOOLITTLE: Sometimes that can be difficult but I just try to play
through it, be as physical as possible and keep my hands straight up and try
to play through it as much as possible. But it's definitely something that is
in the back of your mind when you're out there, just try not to get that third
foul or something like that. But obviously it didn't really work out tonight.  
  
Q. Samantha, when Bethany went out with the fourth foul about nine minutes
left, you guys only had like a seven ‑point lead. At that point in the game
you seemed to kind of take over, made some plays on both ends of the floor,
just kind of kept the team together. Talk about what was going through your
mind, what was going on in that stretch there.   
SAMANTHA LOGIC: I don't think anything too different. I mean, Kali and Claire
came in today and just played so well when Beth had foul trouble. We have so
much confidence in them every single time they come out on the floor.  
They played some huge minutes for us. At that point maybe you try like look
for your shot a little bit more just because the size difference probably with
Claire in there a little bit. But whatever works in our offense. It works the
same whether Beth is in there or not. It's just a little more significant to
get it in the post when she is because she's such a tough matchup. But
defensively try to bring energy every single time. I think it just happened to
be at that time when she was out.  
  
Q. Kali, you don't take many 3s but it seems like whenever you do, all
throughout the season it comes at some important time and you don't miss many.
How are you so confident in those positions?  
KALI PESCHEL: I was coming off the bench, I know my role is to get in there
play defense and get rebounds and hit that open shot. It's always going to be
usually late in the shot clock when somebody has to put a shot up. I credit my
teammates so much. They do a great job finding me in those situations and my
defenders in the paint doubling onto them. They do a great job finding me.
It's always nice when the ball goes in the hoop.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, I think they hit something like the nine of their first 11 shots.
What were you able to do after that defensively, specifically the last 10 to
15 minutes of the first half?  
COACH BLUDER: I mean, both teams came out and shot the ball really well. So
thankfully we were shooting right there with them. But when teams come out and
shoot crazy, you gotta remind your players, too, that it's going to level off.  
I mean, statistics are there for a reason. It's going to level off sooner or
later. I thought that we did a better job this time defending them than we did
last time, especially on that flare screen in their offense.  
Again, I think the boards were huge for us. They've outrebounded us the last
two times. So it was important for us to get those boards.  
  
Q. Just talking about Kali, from your perspective, how big has she been
throughout the year, just seems like she has a clutch 3 every week or so.  
COACH BLUDER: You ask that question and she said‑‑ her answer I thought she'd
say, Because I shoot thousands of them all the time. They shoot thousands of
those shots. We practice those shots over and over and over again. It doesn't
surprise me that she's confident shooting it. She's put in the work. And if
you put in the work you should be confident and step up and make them like
that.  
So I thought she did just a great job. And obviously it was huge for us in the
first half, her hitting those 3s.  
  
Q. I kind of stay on the same question. But just what her play meant during
that stretch. On both ends of the floor. It wasn't just offensively, when Beth
got the fourth foul.  
COACH BLUDER: Sam Logic is such a good player. You don't coach that. It's a
mentality that she has. It's between her ears. She knows the game so well. She
always is looking ahead. Her insight is so good.  
And I agree with you. I think there are times‑‑ and I think this last part of
the year she's taken it up another notch. I believe she has. She doesn't know
that she has. I think she has. She's more confident, I feel like, or maybe
she's not more confident, maybe she's more at ease in taking her shot. Before
she always wanted to distribute to everybody else.  
And I think in the last part of the season she's been using her offensive
skills a little bit more.  
  
Q. Seems like the whole team really started to attack the rim and get
aggressive after Beth went out with the foul trouble, is that something that
you guys talked about before or it was something you had to adapt to the
situation?  
COACH BLUDER: We attacked the rim because they had a lot of foul trouble. We
were just trying to take advantage of that as well.  
  
Q. There was a period in the second half when they stripped the ball from
you guys like two or three times in a row. Did you change anything at that
point. Or just tell them to stop doing that?  
COACH BLUDER: Told them to stop it. It was really that. It was really, Calm
down. We're going a little bit too fast. I thought we had too many forced
turnovers in the first half. Our feet got happy. We needed to calm down, slow
down, I think we were getting too anxious in those situations. And I felt we
gave the ball to Sam in some awkward positions in outlets in that situation,
in the second half.  
But Sam got her back to the sidelines so she could see the floor a little bit
better after that. We calmed down, I think, and took care of that. That's the
one thing I'm unhappy with is the turnovers. For us that's a lot of turnovers.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_HOFFMAN ESTATES, ILLINOIS_  
  

Ohio State  83  
Minnesota - 71

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Ohio State head coach Kevin McGuff and
student‑athletes Kelsey Mitchell, Shayla Cooper and Ameryst Alston. Questions
for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Any of you, did it come up that they had outrebounded you guys by 20 in
Columbus in the first game, and was that a point of emphasis in this game to
possibly do better, and how did you do better in this game?  
SHAYLA COOPER: In scouting, we really focused on rebounding and putting a body
on them, because when we're watching film, we just saw them getting a lot of
second chance and third chance points and scoring. Coach put an emphasis on
putting a body on them, making contact, and hitting the board.  
  
Q. Kelsey, how much did the play of Shayla off the bench and Alexa in
working against Amanda, who is a large person, really lift the rest of you
guys?  
KELSEY MITCHELL: Well, start off by saying Amanda is a great player, a great
big. And for Shayla and Alexa to deal with her for 40 minutes, I salute them
big time.  
I just‑‑ I wouldn't be able to do it. So to see them do it and to be
successful at it, I think it was a great thing for us tonight.  
  
Q. Ameryst, you've only got the eight kids, seven sometimes. And you didn't
have a great game in this game. But there are more pieces now than there were
maybe two months ago to get you through those kinds of games, aren't there?
And how do you think that Shayla and other people did in this one?  
AMERYST ALSTON: Absolutely. No, I didn't have a great offensive game at all.
Kind of took on a different role, trying to really, I don't know, just guard
the post.  
And my teammates, they was definitely there to pick me up. And I thank them
for that.  
  
Q. Shayla, how do you guard Amanda Zahui B.? What do you have to do? What's
the process?  
SHAYLA COOPER: It was a long process. I started with trying to push her off
the block, try to get her somewhere where she wasn't comfortable. At times it
worked. At times I got sealed in.  
But my teammates were there to help me and dig in on her. So that helped out a
lot. But I mean, she's a great player. She finished the game with a
triple‑double, but we got the win.  
But it was just a lot to deal with and I had Alexa and Lisa to help me out as
well, so that helped me out a lot.  
  
Q. You guys just played Iowa and you played them twice this year, but are
you thinking about them at all yet, or does that have to start tomorrow
morning, Ameryst?  
AMERYST ALSTON: We're going to celebrate this win a little bit but I don't
know. This game is over and I will say that we will begin to focus on the next
game. So we can capitalize on that.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Kevin, again the rebounding, the last game was just the thing. What's the
difference in the game? And this game I think they showed early that they
really, really intended to go in there to both Amanda and Shae Kelley, and
your kids just looked like from the get ‑go they were digging and not allowing
it. Was that the game plan?  
COACH MCGUFF: Yeah, we were much better, obviously, on the boards. That was
the difference in the game the first time around. But the rebounding and
defense go together in that we got them a little more off the block and in
different positions which made it a little bit harder for them to get
offensive rebounds.  
We contained the ball a little bit better. Which means our post players didn't
have to help and get out of position to where they couldn't block them out on
shots. Overall, I think we were much better defensively with our rebounding,
and that was the difference.  
  
Q. If you're going to go to the pressure you put on your guards, that seemed
to affect their offense pretty much throughout the game, and that was part of
it then, too?  
COACH MCGUFF: I think Cait and Asia did an excellent job not necessarily
turning them over. We did get turnovers, but pressuring them, taking them out
of their rhythm offensively. If you watched them last night versus Purdue they
really got in a good rhythm there in the second half. That was one of the
things you wanted to do was try to do make them work a little harder to
initiate offense.  
  
Q. You guys started off not shooting great but then you started turning them
over and that started leading to some transition stuff and some second ‑chance
stuff, too, really. But again, that's off the defense, too, though isn't it?  
COACH MCGUFF: We got some turnovers and we were able to get some points in
transition. I think in general we started to get the pace of the game the way
we wanted it. We got some easy baskets and Alexa really did a great job
running the floor.  
  
Q. Is this kind of an old school game, like a lunch game?  
COACH MCGUFF: It was. Like our post players, you know, as I said, Amanda Zahui
B. and Shae Kelley are two great post players and our kids had to work really
hard. We knew we weren't going to limit them. They had 25, 23 respectively.
But we wanted them to work for everything they got. And I think we did do
that.  
  
Q. And you also got ‑‑ again this is a game where Ameryst didn't shoot it
well but she gave you other things.   
COACH MCGUFF: She didn't. She's always great on the defensive end. And she was
tonight. She always keeps the ball moving. She makes the extra pass. She's
provided some great leadership. And for us to be able to win the game and her
not play as well as she usually does on offense is a good sign. And also
hopefully a sign that she saved some of those for tomorrow.  
  
Q. Kelsey, I think started the game 1 for 6 for the field and winds up with
29 points. I think that's kind of par for the course this year?  
COACH MCGUFF: That's Kelsey being Kelsey. That's why she was the Big Ten
Player of the Year.

_HOFFMAN ESTATES, ILLINOIS_  
  

Nebraska  86  
Illinois - 71

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Nebraska head coach Connie Yori and
student‑athletes Natalie Romeo and Hailie Sample.  
Coach, an opening statement.  
COACH YORI: Well, those first 30 minutes, I'm not sure we could have played a
lot better offensively. That first half. I mean we did a great job sharing the
ball. We made shots.  
You look at our starting lineup, and we shot a high percentage. I just thought
our unselfishness‑‑ but I also thought our intensity was just outstanding. We
got on the floor for loose balls. Illinois is a team that really scraps.  
And we had to match and exceed that intensity. And I think we did. We're a
team that scraps, too. I thought we got a lot of loose balls in that first
half and that led to extra possessions for us. Led to some fouls for them,
too.  
Obviously foul trouble hurt them. But I thought we were aggressive. And we
were the aggressors most of the game up until the last ten minutes when they
slapped on their ‑‑ ten or 12 minutes ‑ their full court press and we didn't
handle that particularly well.  
But the way I'm looking at it right now we're playing with house money. We got
a good win here. And now we got another matchup with Iowa, which is the 11th
time we've played them in our seniors' career, which is pretty unusual.  
But that's not going to be easy. But I just thought, I just want to enjoy this
moment with this group of kids, because I thought that was‑‑ I thought they
executed very, very well.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Natalie, did you realize at one point in the game that you had the same
amount of points as like the Illini did?  
NATALIE ROMEO: No.  
  
Q. And you're out there shooting you had 26, was it close the first half
when you had those three points you had five in the first half, I believe?  
NATALIE ROMEO: I was just shooting. I was open, my teammates got me the ball,
I found the open look and it felt right.  
  
Q. Hailie, when the game was over how well did you feel like you had played
as a team in that game?  
HAILIE SAMPLE: I thought we played really well as a team. We were all clicking
tonight on the offensive end and the defensive end. We talked really well and
we actually executed the game plan pretty much perfectly. So I think we played
really, really well.  
  
Q. Hailie, you and Emily and Allie all in double figures. How much did
getting Illinois' post players in foul trouble help that?  
HAILIE SAMPLE: That was pretty huge. It was good to get, their two post
players out because they're pretty good scorers inside and outside, and also I
mean they're shot blockers. If we got them out of the game, it was a little
bit easier to go inside for us.  
  
Q. And Natalie, since you've been in the starting lineup I guess the last
eight games now you've had some games like this and games you struggled from 3
‑point range. When did you maybe feel like this could be one of those big
games?  
NATALIE ROMEO: I don't really think about it like that. If I'm open, I'll take
the shot.  
  
Q. Hailie, you guys shot 64percent in the first half, 61 for the game. What
allowed you guys to be so effective offensively?  
HAILIE SAMPLE: I mean, we worked our zone offenses all year long and we've
played against a lot of teams who have played zone defenses. So I think that
we're fairly comfortable in it and I mean we're pretty used to it. So I think
that it just is a little bit easier for us.  
  
Q. Hailie, what do you think about another chance to play Iowa and what were
those two previous losses, how did you handle those this year?  
HAILIE SAMPLE: I mean, I'm really excited to play Iowa. It's always a fun
matchup. They work really hard. We work really hard. And we're two teams that
have played each other a lot over the years. And two senior classes who know
each other pretty much inside and out. So I'm really excited.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. The way Natalie played, how important was it for her to maybe be on from
3 ‑point range and tonight and hit all those?  
COACH YORI: We said before the game, somebody's going to have to hit some
perimeter shots. Whether it's T or whether it's Natalie. Those are the two
most logical candidates for us. And we said going into the game, gotta make
some perimeter shots. I think that's what you gotta do against Illinois, the
way they play.  
You gotta take care of the ball but you also have to make some perimeter
shots. And we've been inconsistent shooting the ball from the perimeter.
Obviously when you shoot it like that, you look like you know what you're
doing as a coach.  
So tonight it looked like I knew what I was doing as a coach. But making shots
is a big part of the game. And they play their couple different zone defenses
and you gotta be able to hit perimeter shots against them. Natalie opened it
up and I thought, I also thought their foul trouble, you mentioned getting the
ball inside their foul trouble enabled us to get the ball inside. And they had
to play more zone and we kept hitting shots. The combination of their foul
trouble kept them in the zone I think longer than they might have wanted to
be.  
  
Q. The first two games against Illini were a lot closer. What were you
thinking when you saw the game kind of get out of hand at one point?  
COACH YORI: Well, I didn't really expect this. I mean, I would have thought we
could barely get over 50 the first two times we played them. And for us to get
in the mid to upper 80s means that we did a lot of things on offense well.  
And we weren't‑‑ they're a team that tries to keep you off balance because of
their changing defenses and the way they mix things. And the interesting thing
is we played this game without Rachel and the first two games we played
without Rachel we could barely get it to 50.  
So I wouldn't have expected necessarily for us to score like we did today. But
we had it going.  
  
Q. Connie, I think way back you thought Chandler might be the freshman that
would have the bigger impact. Has Natalie exceeded at times what you thought
she could do?  
COACH YORI: I think Natalie has really grown in her confidence. We knew Nat
from the get‑go, she was always playing hard. We felt like she attacked
practice in a positive way. And we figured that she would get better as the
season went on. And that's exactly what's happened.  
I go back to when we played‑‑ now she missed a good‑‑ she missed a good
portion of our season because of an injury. But one of her first games back
was when we played Illinois at Illinois. And she couldn't have played a lot
worse in that particular game.  
And now here she is basically a month and a half, two months later, and that's
what happens sometimes with freshman. Is that they get better as the season
goes on because they gain confidence and they learn the pace of the game and
they're just‑‑ a lot of times freshmen are not used to playing at this level
with the quickness and the speed of the game.  
And she's really adjusted well to it.  
  
Q. Those last 10 to 12 minutes when Illinois went into that press and made a
little bit of a run, those are all kind of Ivory Crawford led, does that fire
‑‑ almost 30 what you expected from her?  
COACH YORI: From Ivory Crawford? I think Ivory is a really great player. I've
always liked her game. I think she's super competitive. She's a scorer. She's
tough. I think she's been a great player for them throughout her career. And
she's a hard matchup because of her ability to, especially if she's hitting
shots. But she's just such an aggressive player.  
She's a kid that you hate to play against. But she's had a great career.  
  
Q. Natalie had all those 3 ‑pointers but seems like on the bench and from
you, when she drove and then got the foul, it was kind of the bigger reaction
from you and the bench. Why were you so excited when she drove the ball?  
COACH YORI: I think Natalie's got more to her game than just a 3‑point
shooter. And I think we've seen only a little bit of that. I've watched‑‑
we've seen her in practice do it. I saw her in high school do it. She can get
to the basket and she's quick enough to get by people. And we, when you're
playing against the zone, you're not necessarily going to get to the basket a
lot. But when they start pressing‑‑ it doesn't bother me when teams press,
when she's on the floor. She can handle it and she can be a good
decision‑maker. I think she's going to be‑‑ I think we've really just seen a
small part of her game. And I think obviously she's a good shooter, but I
think we'll see more from her as she grows.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_HOFFMAN ESTATES, ILLINOIS_  
  

Minnesota  82  
Purdue - 78

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by head coach Marlene Stollings, Shae Kelley,
Amanda Zahui B. and Shayne Mullaney. Coach, an opening statement.  
COACH STOLLINGS: Well, first of all, we'd like to say Purdue gave us,
obviously, a heck of a game. And we knew that they would give us their best
effort. We feel they have a lot of talent on their team and a lot of
experience on their team. So credit to them for playing quite well.  
On our end, I was very proud of our young ladies for their resiliency and
fight and for handling the big comeback Purdue made in staying strong to what
we wanted to do.  
I'm very proud of our program. It's the most wins in 10 years for our program,
with the win tonight. And just outstanding play from the three young ladies
that are sitting up here, who really carried us tonight.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Shae, just talk about when Amanda fouled out and the clutch free ‑throw
shooting that helped close the game out?  
SHAE KELLEY: I think Kayla came off the bench when Z went out and just really
stepped. Our bench players are always ready, ready to go. So I think that we
just stayed aggressive in that sense and just kept attacking and got to the
free‑throw line and knocked them down.  
  
Q. Can you also talk about that, Shayne. You and Kayla both hit some clutch
free throws at the end. The team hadn't been shooting that well from the free
‑throw line before that?  
SHAYNE MULLANEY: Yeah, the free throws were really big at the end because that
kind of was sealing the deal for the game. And we were always practicing free
throws in practice, and we know that we need to make those to win games.  
  
Q. Shae, what was it about the Purdue defense that was giving you guys such
fits?  
SHAE KELLEY: I would say it was kind of more of ourselves making our own
mistakes, just kind of rushing some passes, and we just really needed to be
patient.  
And when we were patient we got what we wanted, and I think that was just key
for us, to slow down and be poised. And then when we were, we came out on top
and scored or got a foul.  
  
Q. Shayne, could you talk about that big 3 ‑pointer you hit. What was going
through your mind at that point?  
SHAYNE MULLANEY: I was just taking what they gave me and just I knew that I
had to make that. I knew that was big. I think especially coming off two
losses, we had a lot of fire in our bellies. For this game, we had a lot of
energy coming into this game, and we knew we had to win this game, and we
wanted it really bad.  
  
Q. Amanda, what do you guys need to improve upon the most for that game
against Ohio State tomorrow?  
AMANDA ZAHUI B.: We have to lock in on defense, focus on that and just keep on
playing our own game and everything will go our way.  
  
Q. Amanda, just talk about throughout the game, you had a pretty big impact,
especially in the first half, but when you were on the bench in foul trouble,
what did you see from your teammates to keep the Gophers in the game?  
AMANDA ZAHUI B.: Can you ask that again.  
  
Q. When you were on the bench in foul trouble, could you talk about how your
team played to keep you guys in the lead?  
AMANDA ZAHUI B: Everybody played really hard, played their souls out. They
never gave up and I just trying to keep them going and everybody wanted to win
this game. We'd been talking about this. We wanted to advance and you could
really see it in everybody.  
  
Q. Shae, Purdue really came out of the gates in the second half. Did you see
a big difference between the first half and the second half for you guys?  
SHAE KELLEY: Just for us, for our team? I think the main thing we just kind
of, our defense. Our defense is the main thing, when they made that run there
in the second half, I think we just kind of got relaxed a little bit. But once
we picked it up we got to our spots a little faster and just really keying in
on Bays trying to get to her sweet spot a lot at the high post. It was key for
us to move defensively.  
  
Q. For Amanda, are you motivated at all to go against Kelsey Mitchell, the
other Big Ten Player of the Year?  
AMANDA ZAHUI B.: I'm motivated to go against any team right now. We're just
trying to win and have fun. We can't focus on awards right now. We've got too
much at stake. And just want to have fun and whoever is out there, we're going
to bring it.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. After you guys were up 18, Purdue started to make a run, what was the
message during that timeout?  
COACH STOLLINGS: Well, we just tried to keep our kids poised. We know it's a
game of runs, and we knew they were going to make one. And we were trying to
make some adjustments defensively during that time. We went a little bit long
there without scoring, longer than we like. But we did like the shots we were
getting during that time but we didn't do a good job of getting second shots.
But we just told them to keep fighting and stay poised.  
We didn't want too big of a reaction one way or the other.  
  
Q. Obviously in the second half there, when Amanda was out with foul
trouble, can you talk about leaving her on the bench as long as you did and at
some point you felt like Purdue was getting back in the game and she had to
get back in there?  
COACH STOLLINGS: Yes, we didn't have a particular time in the game in which we
knew we were going to put her back in. We were just trying to fill our way
through it and we reached a point there where our entire staff agreed it was
time for her to go and certainly we didn't want her to be out at all.  
But I thought that for the shape we were in, we came out okay with it.  
  
Q. It was not the most consistent performance for your team. What do you
want them to take out of this and what do you need to change for tomorrow?  
COACH STOLLINGS: Well, I'll take out of it the 82 points. Still a high scoring
game for us. Defensively I think we have to stay a little bit more consistent
and tightening up what we're doing.  
We play multiple defenses and I thought we lost some coverages there to start
the second half. But it's a constant chess match, and they adjusted a little
bit and we needed to adjust a little bit quicker to what they adjusted to.  
But I think as you look at tomorrow I think our kids are excited about that
game. We obviously beat Ohio State on their home court earlier in the year and
a game in which Amanda was out in foul trouble quite a bit. So I think she in
particular is looking forward to the game tomorrow night and hopefully staying
on the court.  
  
Q. The problems that Bays and Clemons gave you tonight, why do you think
they had the success they did inside?  
COACH STOLLINGS: Well, they're very talented players. And you know Purdue is
extremely well coached. We expected nothing less, and we knew that they were
going to go‑‑ they would be looking for interior passes. And they played us at
home last time. I believe they scored 48 points in the paint. We knew that
tonight would be no different in terms of what they were looking for.  
And I thought Whitney had to work for some of those shots. But she is just
that talented. And she hit a lot of contested shots, I thought. And they're
very good. With Clemons I thought we let her get a little too deep at the
basket, too deep at the basket. I would like to shore that up a bit don't like
them to get that deep in there on us. But two very talented young ladies.  
  
Q. The free ‑throw shooting, seems like when your team was under pressure,
they shot it better from the free‑throw line and for Kayla to come in in a
situation like that and hit those free throws when she did, talk about that
performance.   
COACH STOLLINGS: Kayla's been solid for us down the stretch. We call her our X
factor. And she was very key when she came in. She got a couple of key
rebounds for us as well as hitting those free throws. But she's very capable
in those moments, and she likes those moments.  
And she knew that we needed her and she just stepped up for us.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_HOFFMAN ESTATES, ILLINOIS_  
  

Michigan State  69  
Michigan - 49

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by head coach Suzy Merchant and student‑athletes
Aerial Powers, Tori Jankoska and Lexi Gussert. Coach, an opening statement.  
COACH MERCHANT: I'm proud of our team. I thought our intensity was really
good. And really, really proud of the fight and the effort they had on both
ends of the floor. And just feels good after the game to be smiling. At least
to be the ones smiling, right?  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Lexi, what happened to you in the first half?  
LEXI GUSSERT: I guess I just came off with confidence. We played them last
time I think I shot 1 for 10 in the triangle and two and that sat with me for
a long time. Pretty mad coming into the game, to be honest with you. Took my
anger out on them, I guess.  
  
Q. You guys look like entirely more confident team than last time. And they
didn't. What changed and how much did those two losses do with you guys?  
AERIAL POWERS: I guess it was coming off of our last wins, we had a lot of
confidence going into the game today. They had some losses coming into the
game. We were hyped about it.  
And coming off the two losses from previous in the season, that really amped
us up to be ready to kick some butt today. And we came out on fire.  
  
Q. Tori, did you see this coming at all?  
TORI JANKOSKA: Well, yes. But I mean we're a different team than we were the
past two times we've played them. We've been a different team for the past
couple of weeks.  
And we've had a lot of anger since the last two games, like Aerial said, and
we're a totally different team. I thought we came out and proved that. It's
not going to be one or the other, it's not going to be two different teams
every time we play them. I thought we came out with some fire and took out our
anger, like all of us did.  
  
Q. Tori, there was a moment in the second half you guys got the game in
hand. You're exhausted and trapped and you call a timeout and kind of bent
over. And you were smiling kind of. Could you tell me what the exchange was at
that moment?  
COACH MERCHANT: The play before that she was so tired but she called the play
for herself and she scored. Then she comes down the second time and can't get
it so she called timeout. I was laughing because she was so exhausted she
needed to come out. But that's what I was laughing about because my girl
called a play for herself. Wasn't too tired for that. The pressure, though,
got to her.  
  
Q. Tori, anything to add there?  
TORI JANKOSKA: I was just tired. I came over, they were trapping me. I'm like
aaah, nope, timeout, sorry, I was really tired, she's like, that's all right.  
  
Q. This is the third time you've beat Michigan in the Big Ten tournament
now. What is it about the tournament that gets you a win?  
AERIAL POWERS: I guess it's just how much this game means. If you lose, you're
out of here. So that also gave us another reason to kind of‑‑ I don't know‑‑
come out on fire. And when you're in situations where you win and you stay or
you lose and go home, you give it your all every single game.  
  
Q. Tori, you mentioned you guys were a different team. In what way are you
different now than before?  
TORI JANKOSKA: I just think everybody has improved tremendously from the
beginning of the Big Ten season. Everybody was playing us or starting with the
Michigan game last time we played them they went triangle and 2 and today Cara
hit big shots, Lexi hit some big shots and Becca hit some threes. So that made
them out of their triangle and 2 and they really had to play us man. And we
had an answer for defense they threw at us. I think it was important that we
had everyone fulfilling their role and stepping up and hitting shots.  
  
Q. You guys looked like obviously winning is fun, but you guys looked like a
team that's having in this late what's been a very difficult season. How has
that happened and how are you guys kind of withstood this playing your best
basketball now?  
LEXI GUSSERT: I think it has a lot to do with all of our attitudes. We've all
had a really good attitude. It starts with the coaches. They believed in us.
No one's given up. Like Tori said we've all just been playing better. Puts a
smile on all of our faces.  
  
Q. Coach, last time Coach in East Lansing you said you were a little
disappointed with how your team wasn't able to shut down both Flaherty and
Thompson and also Goree with Becca Mills on the inside. What was different
this game and you guys kind of shutting those two shooters down and also
blocking Goree out from the inside?  
COACH MERCHANT: Anyway, honestly that was part of the game plan. It sounds
simple, but the kids that bothered us the most in the past, Flaherty had shot
50percent, averaged 50percent from the field against us and 62percent from the
arc, which is unacceptable.  
So we talked about really having a little more urgency. One‑on‑one
accountability. We track it. We chart it. Defensively, it's something that we
do. And so we just haven't done that good of a job on her, as well as
Thompson.  
Thompson sort of had her way with us almost every time we played that kid,
even last year. And then Goree, she's just a handful. You have to push her off
the block and play behind her but get her out of her comfort zone a little
bit. You can't let her bury you deep and keep her off the boards. In the past
we haven't always done that. I thought Becca and Kennedy, both, in particular
Becca, but certainly Kennedy came in and did good things for us and gave Becca
some time there.  
But those three kids have killed us. And those were a big focus, not that‑‑
Shannon Smith is a great player, too. But she works a little more off the
bounce. We kind of know certain things that she does. So we were giving her
cushions but the other three kids are hard to guard because you have to be
able to guard the arc and handle a bounce and it makes it difficult when you
have a triple‑threat scorer. And we haven't done a good job.  
I was proud. Tori had Flaherty most of the time and we kind of moved around a
little bit. I thought Anna did a really good job on Thompson and Cara Miller
came in and did some good things there as well.  
  
Q. Was it Becca mainly with her defense on Goree? What was different this
time with her than before?  
COACH MERCHANT: She didn't let her get in the paint. That was the big thing.
Kept her off the boards in the first half. Didn't do as good a job in the
second half. But I thought she did a good job both those guys were meeting and
greeting her before she had a chance to get a piece of the paint on duck‑ins,
power post‑up and when she would push back we did a much better job of
releasing and getting around quickly enough so that she wouldn't bury us deep.  
But she can go over either shoulder. She can handle a little bit. They don't
really put her on the perimeter much. I think she's actually pretty good. I
think we might have struggled a little bit if they would pick and popped that
kid a little bit, because she can shoot that shot. But she is really a handful
on the block.  
And Becca just did a better job fighting duck‑ins and meeting and greeting,
and we've tried to double a little bit in the past because she hasn't done
that good of a job or Kennedy hasn't done that good of a job. And when you
double off them they have shooters and you're in trouble. The only kid you can
really go off a little bit is Elmblad but then she dives and she can get
around and they do a good job of finding her underneath.  
So really it was a one‑on‑one game with those three kids. You mentioned the
other two guards and Goree. Those were the three kids we had to guard
one‑on‑one and have great accountability for.  
  
Q. You've been tough on Becca a few times for not making plays in big
situations, the senior. I mean she made shots maybe the biggest game of her
career to this point.  
COACH MERCHANT: She came out of the gates really strong. Did a great job
defensively. She rebounded the ball. I was proud of her because, as a senior,
you certainly don't want to go down to anybody at this time of year but you
certainly don't want to lose to your arch rival. She's a Michigan kid, and
it's just the standard that you set. And I was really proud of how hard and
aggressive she came out, because she was not like that against Purdue. She
really struggled against Purdue. But had a great game against Rutgers.  
So Tori mentioned it. I think the complementary players, if that's what you
want to call them, I don't know, everybody besides Tori and Aerial I think
have been playing better, playing with more confidence and playing
aggressively. Becca is one of those kids that tends to fluctuate sometimes.
And today I thought she stayed the course and did a good job finishing, being
strong, rebounding, defending, doing what she had to do to help us win the
game.  
  
Q. You lost to these guys twice. Beating Michigan, not losing a third time,
how important was that to you?  
COACH MERCHANT: Huge. I mean, yeah, I mean I didn't sleep. But I said this to
Coach Dantonio when he came to our practice yesterday. It's like if you
understand what it's like to be a head coach of any sport at Michigan State,
for example, you know last year we won the Big Ten title. And I felt the exact
same way.  
I mean, I couldn't sleep. I was worried about the game. It's a high stress
game. And you have to understand that. That's part of the deal. That's what we
do. That's what we get paid to do. But it means something to I'm sure it means
something to her, I can't speak for her, but I know for me it means
everything.  
There's two losses on our schedule that I just, I don't like, I don't even
like to think about. And again here we are, playing them for I think the third
straight time in the Big Ten tournament. And multiple times.  
So even though we didn't win the league this year, I still felt the same way.
It is what it is. It's a great rivalry. And it means something when you're a
Spartan and you don't want to lose to the Wolverines, period. So our kids were
pretty motivated and like Coach Dantonio said you wouldn't be in the position
you're in if it was okay with you.  
  
Q. You've done this with a limited roster all year but not back ‑to‑back.
Are there legs to come out and what do you think about tomorrow and trying to
pull an upset?  
COACH MERCHANT: Yeah, I mean, we've done a really good job, I think, managing.
I think that's the reason I think our team is doing this, because we're smart
enough to figure out how we got to manage their energy. Doesn't mean we're
going to win or make every shot that kind of thing. But I think you've got to
give your kids a chance. You've got to prepare them. You've got to know
exactly what you have to do to take away their strengths. You have to mentally
get them ready and they've got to go play the game.  
The one thing, though, our kids are used to playing a lot of minutes anyway.
Like where other people can sit kids late in games or if they're up, like we
only have seven people. So you have to put five of the seven out there.
There's only a couple of people on the bench you can put in there.  
So they're used to logging those minutes. We've never done it necessarily back
to back a lot, but we did it Baylor/Syracuse and we came out and beat Syracuse
after a tough and emotional loss to Baylor. So our kids have done it one other
time.  
I don't know, they're warriors. They're tough. I don't know what will happen
tomorrow. But we'll be prepared and ready to go. But it is a concern. I mean,
you're right, it's a good question, because you're right.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_HOFFMAN ESTATES, ILLINOIS_  
  

Rutgers  63  
Indiana - 52

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Rutgers head coach C. Vivian Stringer along
with Kahleah Copper, Briyona Canty and Betnijah Laney. Opening statement,
Coach.  
COACH STRINGER: We're happy to be a part of the Big Ten Tournament, and I was
really appreciative of the way our team played. We played with a great deal of
heart and enthusiasm and played together. So we're going to have to do that
throughout the tournament. And I think that probably the WNIT run is going to
help us, I'm hoping, at least.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. How did it feel to get that first Big Ten tournament win under your
belt?  
BETNIJAH LANEY: It was great. And especially for it to be a team effort,
everyone played well. We were balanced across the board. We had a few players
in double figures. We had Briyona with ten assists. Great to have Rachel back
and be a full team effort.  
KAHLEAH COPPER: Yeah, just going off what Betnijah said, it was good to have
good players step up, especially Briyona with the ten assists. And it was good
to have the support from the band come, and it just played a good part in us
getting a good one.  
BRIYONA CANTY: Just what they said.  
  
Q. Coach, it was a tough against the Northwestern, a tough game against the
Wildcats, what does the team have to do to prepare for the next round?  
COACH STRINGER: The first thing we have to do is get an ice bath and recognize
the things we've got to do better. Northwestern is an outstanding team and
Joe, the coach, has done a great job. They're very confident and played
extremely well against some of the best competition in the country.  
So we know we have our work cut out. We wanted to rest our starters today a
little bit. We're going to have a tougher time, but I think with the addition
of Rachel, should make for a little different scheme, so I've got to give some
thought to that. I just deal with it one game at a time.  
  
Q. Rachel made her return on the court after going against Michigan State.
How did it feel to have her out there today?  
BRIYONA CANTY: It felt great to have her back me dishing and her with the ball
on the court. Makes it easier, my job easier anyway.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, student‑athletes. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, is it harder or easier to prepare in these kind of tournament
games where you have such a short window?  
COACH STRINGER: You can imagine that it is harder. But on the other hand, you
have to‑‑ it's extremely important that you're fundamentally sound and that
you make little tweaks. And that's what happens. And again I'm happy that our
team had an opportunity to play the number of games as they did for the WNIT
so they're not totally shocked.  
And, of course, having to play today and then backing this up with the game
tomorrow. And every other day, that's going to be tough. But we've got to rely
on the fundamentals of how we play this game.  
What you saw today was a little different for us because we generally don't
play five guards. But it's because Betnijah, as well as Esse are extremely
bright, they convert from being a 2 guard to a 3 guard playing as a 4 or 5.
For those who know basketball we're talking about inside play. And that's
major. They knew the patterns. We were able to run certain things. That's the
reason why we were as effective, I think, defensively as we were.  
  
Q. Coach, you've played IU three times spread over three months. Did you see
any improvement or change in the team, from December to now?  
COACH STRINGER: Yeah, Coach should be given a great deal of credit, and those
players. Let me tell you something, they just played a tough game last night.
And I think that anybody knows that to recover before 24 hours, and that's
basically what they did, is tough. They're always coming back.  
And, yes, they played with a great deal of heart. They execute well. They've
got great skills. When we write all the things they do on the board, then it's
clear that everyone, just about everybody is shooting at the 3‑point range.
Coach does a great job of keeping them positive and pumped up and they're
rebounding, playing hard.  
I have nothing but praise for them. And believe me, we had to put our team on
high alert, because what our statement was that we were particularly
vulnerable with this game, because anytime you play someone three times in a
year, you have to be greatly concerned about that, because there's kind of a
lackadaisical kind of approach.  
And believe me, I was really trying to fire everybody up. So this team,
Indiana, did a great job. And Coach has got a great future with them.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_HOFFMAN ESTATES, ILLINOIS_  
  

Rutgers  63  
Indiana - 52

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Indiana head coach Teri Moren and
student‑athletes Larryn Brooks and Tyra Buss. Coach, an opening statement.  
COACH MOREN: Well, we're disappointed that our season has come to a close here
in Hoffman Estates. But I want to give our kids credit. Again, I thought there
were moments where we could have easily have given in this afternoon to a team
that was probably a little bit more rested, more athletic, bigger.  
They made a few runs at us, and we had an opportunity to give in. And just
didn't feel like our kids were ready to quite give in. So their toughness that
they showed‑‑ we just didn't make shots from the outside. We figured we were
going to have to have the day we had yesterday, scoring at least, or making at
least 10 to 11 3s in order to give ourselves a chance at the game. And we shot
it poorly from the outside.  
We did outrebound them, which was a statistic that we always look at. And
we're proud of the fact that we did that. We kept our turnovers low. But at
the end of the day we just didn't have enough bullets in the gun to walk out
of here with a win.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Tyra, what exactly happened on that play when you went down, and how did
it feel coming back?  
TYRA BUSS: There was a loose ball, I think me and No. 1 fell after it she fell
on top me of me, my ankle. I don't know what happened exactly, but it didn't
feel good. And I wanted to do whatever I could to get back in the game,
because I wanted to do whatever I could to help the team win.  
So Mr.Rob, our athletic trainer, he really got me, needed‑‑ taped my ankle
tighter. I got back in the game. It felt a lot better playing.  
  
Q. As the season comes to a close, what are your thoughts overall on the
season, when it's been a long season, a lot of close losses, how would you
kind of summarize the season?  
LARRYN BROOKS: First, you never want the season to go over. It really does
suck to go out like this, because you do feel like you could have made some
different plays out there. But overall, the season, I think we've had a lot of
mistakes. And we've just learned from those and we're just going to move on.  
I mean, last year we didn't have a Big Ten win in the tournament. And then
this year we had‑‑ last night we had the win against Penn State. We'll keep on
moving forward, and the next step is to try to get into the NCAA.  
  
Q. For either of you, you guys couldn't get shots to fall at any point in
the game. At that point what was kind of the thought process on how you would
try to stay in the game?  
TYRA BUSS: Just getting high percentage shots. Trying to get into the post.
And definitely our shots weren't falling from the outside at first so we were
really focused on attacking to the basket. I thought we did a pretty good job
attacking and finding an open teammate. Like you said, we didn't knock shots
down at first, but I thought we did a better job of attacking and getting to
the free‑throw line.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, first season down as IU head coach. You also often talk about
progress. How much progress did you see from when you took over to right
now?  
COACH MOREN: I think we've made incremental progress. And it's probably our
takeaways, after about 48 hours of really reflecting and having some
conversations with our staff and our players, I think I'll probably have more
takeaways.  
You know, outside of the Ohio State game, and maybe Michigan State, and a poor
performance at Michigan, there were three games in the Big Ten that really
stick out as poor performances.  
Other than that, there was some really good moments for a very young team. I
reminded them, 98percent of our scoring comes from freshmen and sophomores. So
without question, the future is bright.  
We feel like we have some players that are going to be joining us next year
that are going to give us the depth at that 4 and 5 spot we lacked all year.
We have great guard play. We have the ability to knock down open shots.  
But each kid individually, now the challenge becomes getting in the gym and
improving your game. And all of us have to self‑evaluate, me included, in what
we could have done better, and getting better.  
And so that will be the challenge moving forward, with every one of us that is
part of this staff and team, getting better.  
  
Q. Today record shot, I think near 50percent from the floor. I don't have
the exact stat. But how much was it your guys' defense and how much was it
just them hitting shots?  
COACH MOREN: I think they hit shots early on. I thought probably the first six
or seven minutes of the first half, they didn't really get into any kind of
offense, other than they were just downhill, either laying it up or getting
short jumpers.  
So give them credit. We know this is a team that's not going to take a lot of
3‑point shots. They're going to really rely on their athleticism, second‑,
third‑chance point opportunities. Putting the ball inside. Transition.  
And I thought we did an okay job. When you turn it over or you take a 3, and
we take a lot of them, long rebounds, long shots, long rebounds, easy run‑outs
for them, which lead to layups.  
And so that was what we were trying to limit as best as we could, just the
run‑outs.  
But Coach Viv does a tremendous job, and she's a Hall of Fame coach. And
that's a really good basketball team that we got beat by today. So I don't
want to take anything away from the fact that they just made shots.  
  
Q. You talk about trying to find the things that were the positives and
carry them into next year. If you had to say something, what were some of the
main positives you're going to take from this season?  
COACH MOREN: I just think the experience. We were playing with young kids.
Freshmen and sophomores. New system. New coach. New staff. The transition
happened late in August.  
So there were a lot of things that we kind of had to‑‑ a lot of firsts for all
of us. And so I think the experience that we all gained from a coaching staff.
We got a snapshot of what the Big Ten looks like. Our players, the experience
that they got, game in, game out.  
One of the things we have to do a better job of is in our scheduling next year
is our preconference schedule has to be tougher. It has to prepare us for Big
Ten play.  
And moving forward, we want to challenge ourselves, and we want to have to
embrace the idea of going up against some of the best in the country, in order
to play in this league and be at the top of this league, win a championship
and get into the NCAA Tournament.  
  
Q. Could you talk a little bit about Tyra's toughness today, just coming
back from the ankle injury and getting to the free ‑throw line quite a few
times?  
COACH MOREN: She's a basketball player. You know, I mean this kid scored over
4,000 points in her high school career. And she's probably had to experience
playing through injury before.  
And that obviously says a little bit about who she is as a person, as a
basketball player. Her character. She was wanting and willing to do anything
she could to help her team this afternoon.  
And I thought that she does a lot of great things. I wish our guards would
have‑‑ our other guards would have attacked, similar to the way she was doing.
I think that probably would have helped us. Her getting to the free‑throw line
was huge.  
But she did. She showed toughness today that we had to have. So give her a lot
of credit, as a freshman, for showing up today.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_HOFFMAN ESTATES, ILLINOIS_  
  

Nebraska  86  
Illinois - 71

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by head coach Matt Bollant and student‑athletes
Amarah Coleman, Ivory Crawford and Jacqui Grant.  
COACH BOLLANT: Give Nebraska credit. I thought they were great at the start of
the game. Came on edge and made a bunch of shots and Romero especially start
of the game but their four seniors I thought led really well and started the
game with a great level of intensity and passion and we kind of got knocked on
our heels and responded one time and cut it to 20 to 15, and then they stepped
up, made some more plays. And I just didn't feel like we looked quick and
athletic against Michigan defensively and today we looked a step slow. I'm not
sure what the hesitation was or why that was. But we just didn't guard very
well at all. And that was disappointing but give Nebraska credit because I
thought they played great throughout the game.  
  
Q. Ivory, at the end of the game, even down 20, almost 30, seemed like you
were still pushing and trying to fight and get back in it. Is that just how
you wanted to end it?  
IVORY CRAWFORD: In every game I want to give my all and lead by example, even
don't matter what the scoreboard is, just keep fighting.  
  
Q. How tough is it to see your Illinois career end like this?  
IVORY CRAWFORD: I mean, I just gave my all. I'm not really so disappointed. I
love my team and everything. And I'm just grateful that I'm able to play on
that court and everything after injury and everything.  
  
Q. Amarah, you knocked down some 3s early and had the jumper going and
attacked the basket pretty well. How do you feel you played during your first
Big Ten tournament game?  
AMARAH COLEMAN: I feel pretty good about how I played. But at the end of the
day it's a team game, it's not all about me. So we needed to come out and play
defense as a team and we didn't do that.  
  
Q. Amarah, defensively what do you feel like maybe the team could have done
a little better?  
AMARAH COLEMAN: Like Coach said, we were a step behind and we just needed to
be more proactive on defense.  
  
Q. Jacqui, foul trouble for you and Chatrice how frustrating was it where
you couldn't be out there?  
JACQUI GRANT: Especially at the end when we see Ivory fighting. I've told you
plenty of times we wanted to do this for Ivory because all the things she's
done for this team and all the seniors and coaches. I'm really proud of Ivory.
And yes it's frustrating, but it's me and Chatrice's fault for putting
ourselves in that type of situation. Again, being a step behind hurt and
that's kind of why we got in those foul troubles or into foul trouble. And it
stinks, that's for sure. We definitely wanted to be out there with Ivory.  
  
Q. And for Jacqui, Nebraska's bigs hit a lot of mid range jumpers, is that
something you were expecting from them?  
JACQUI GRANT: Yeah, I mean we knew they were pretty good inside, in the
15‑foot range and we just didn't get out there fast enough. We were a step
behind and we weren't proactive and that hurt us, that really did.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Matt, obviously the way Ivory fought at the end, is that what you've just
come to expect?  
COACH BOLLANT: Yes, that's one of Ivory's greatest qualities she keeps
fighting and keeps battling, and she did that throughout the second half. I
wish we would have had more step up and play with her to make those plays and
give us a chance to be in the game.  
But Ivory doesn't hang her head. She moves on from one play to the next and
handles coaching and does a good job of continuing to play.  
  
Q. When Romeo's been in the starting lineup the last eight games, she's had
games where she played like tonight and had games where she didn't make many
3s. I guess what maybe did you see where she was able to get all those to
fall?  
COACH BOLLANT: I thought she did a great job of doing her work kind of before
she got the catch. She shot them really quick. And we didn't do a good job of
finding her early, especially when she kind of got her confidence going and
they passed the ball really well. Give them credit. I think they're one of the
better passing teams in the Big Ten and move the ball extremely well and just
did a good job of finding her, making the extra pass and I think that's one of
their best qualities.  
  
Q. All three of Nebraska's bigs in double figures. Obviously Chatrice and
Jacqui on the bench defensively left you in the hole.  
COACH BOLLANT: Yeah, frustrated with just our ability to see kind of what was
happening. I felt like we were just a step slow and got some fouls, and
because of that I'm not sure what the reasoning for that was, but we just
weren't very good to start the game defensively and kind of got ourselves in
the hole with fouls and it's hard to be aggressive and come out of it and that
gave us problems throughout.  
  
Q. Bounce back from that first early deficit got down 10 and within 5, what
did you think it was going to take to maybe have to do it again?  
COACH BOLLANT: Every time I kept talking about the defensive end trying to get
stops and being more proactive and moving on the flight of the ball. Seemed
like the ball would move and we would move instead of getting five defenders
moving on the flight of the ball. Looked like we were having trouble seeing
what was happening today. Maybe a little shell shock that first half. Part of
that was Nebraska coming out and making some shots early, but we looked shell
shocked a little bit defensively in the first half.  
  
Q. One more, because of foul trouble, have to play Kennedy more and she
stepped up ‑‑ five points, five steals, some rebounds. How important will
these minutes be to her next season?   
COACH BOLLANT: I grabbed Kennedy in [practice the other day, and obviously
graduate Brittany and Ivory, and she has the opportunity to step up and play.
She has all the tools to be a good player. I thought all of her takes were
good. She had two of her 3s go in and out, and she was really active. I was
proud of her effort.  
I felt like she kept fighting even though she missed some shots. And she was
really active defensively and had five steals. Good to see that from Kennedy.
I think she's got a chance to be a really good player.  
  
Q. After you cut the lead in the first half to about five points or so ‑‑  
COACH BOLLANT: 20‑15.  
  
Q. 20 ‑15\. What did you tell the team once Nebraska started their hot
shooting?  
COACH BOLLANT: I just kept‑‑ we kept trying to switch up defense, what we were
doing. Just trying to be more proactive and kind of see. And they would make a
pass and we would move, trying to get them to move. When the buzz defense
works well and our zone is when all five are moving on the flight of the ball.
And we struggled with that today.  
We did that really well against Michigan and had done that pretty well against
Purdue and some other teams. But today in the Big Ten tournament we didn't do
that.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Coach Sharon Versyp and Whitney Bays and Liza
Clemons. Coach, an opening statement.  
COACH VERSYP: If we could play with this much heart through the season that
would be great. But we also had pieces that didn't fall together the entire
year. I'm just proud of these two seniors, how hard ‑‑ their heart and their
fight got after it. And this is how we play Purdue basketball. We got back to
what we needed to do with the defense, sharing the basketball, 24 assists on
25 makes.  
What it came down to for us was they got a lot of offensive boards.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Whitney, what was the difference between these two games? Today you guys
get down by 18 and fight back like that. Just what was it about this week that
kept you guys at it?  
WHITNEY BAYS: You know, we're a young team. And sometimes it takes tough
losses to learn things. But just the heart. That's what it was. That was the
difference. The skill set has been there, you know what I mean? All these
things we're seeing. Everybody can shoot. It's been there all along, but just
the heart and effort. That's all it was.  
  
Q. Liza, your emotions right now?  
LIZA CLEMONS: It does hurt to know that this is my last game to be with my
teammates. I've said it: Basketball is all I've known for a long time. But I'm
really proud of the way my team fought. We came in as underdogs, and like you
said we're down 18, and to know that we fought hard to come back and we almost
had the game, I'm really proud of my teammates for that.  
  
Q. Whitney, what was the talk when you guys got down so big there in the
first half. What were you guys talking about amongst each other?  
WHITNEY BAYS: Just chip away at it, honestly. Get stops. We kept bringing back
games that we had previously played in. We can do this. Just believing.
Getting stops. And talking about who we need to stop and what's the opening on
offense and things like that.  
But basically just going back to what I said before, just getting everybody
riled up and the heart and the effort.  
  
Q. Whitney, eventually what will be your message to the players that are
coming back?  
WHITNEY BAYS: Just keep playing. Have fun and enjoy. We talked about it in the
locker room. I told them to remember this feeling. It's not a good feeling.
Nobody likes to feel it. But learn from it. It will make you play harder.  
You have these tough losses, but it gives you the experience and you grow. And
I think our team stepped up huge. Nobody thought that we were going to do what
we did in the tournament.  
And everybody stepped up. Everybody played hard. Just remember this feeling.
Don't let it happen next year.  
  
Q. Liza, you guys had to try and manage the fouls the best you could down
the stretch. What was that like to have both you and Whitney in foul trouble
and know you had to stay in the game but knowing you needed stops too?  
LIZA CLEMONS: It was very difficult for the simple fact we knew we had to be
physical but we couldn't be as physical because the way the game was called.  
But we definitely just had to keep playing, no matter what, try and get the
stop, do it straight up. Hopefully they miss. Either way, box out and keep
going. We still had to play hard.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. What has to change going into next year?  
COACH VERSYP: You know, three things. We gotta be the best‑conditioned team
and because of a lot of different things we couldn't do that. We have to be a
tougher team throughout the year. And third we have to play for each other
every single second and every single moment.  
  
Q. Is that latter point something that you guys found a little bit more this
week that you didn't have as much over the last month and a half?  
COACH VERSYP: I think it was always there. But when you have as many injuries
as we had, we didn't know who we were going to have from game to game. It's
difficult. You don't know what starting lineup you're going to have. You don't
know if you're going to have six players or seven players.  
And that doesn't make it an excuse, but we never could get in sync. So that
was a good portion of it. And then when you lose as many close games as we do,
you lose that confidence.  
And we weren't able to overcome it on the floor a lot.  
  
Q. What do you need out of the returning players in the offseason?  
COACH VERSYP: Everything. They're going to be shooting obviously over 50,000
shots this summer. They have to work on their bodies, minds, emotion.  
We just have to take it to obviously a continued other level, because we're a
little bit behind because we've got such a young team. We've got four or five
young ones coming in as well. So we've got to have great leadership.  
I think you can always have good leadership, but you gotta have great
leadership and that could be in any facet -- conditioning, academics, weight
training. But we have to get stronger. We have to become more physical. We
have to become tougher. We've got to want it.  
  
Q. Do these two games sort of help with that message that you have to play
more like this than that?  
COACH VERSYP: Yeah, I thought‑‑ you know, it came together a little too late,
you know? But, yeah, it was enjoyable these last two games, really getting
after it and executing on both ends of the floor.  
So when you play like that, and that's what the seniors said: You need to
carry it over into next year. You need to springboard it and remember this
feeling because it hasn't been the season that any of us wanted.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_HOFFMAN ESTATES, ILLINOIS_  
  

Michigan State  69  
Michigan - 49

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined head coach Kim Barnes Arico and student‑athletes
Nicole Elmblad and Shannon Smith. Coach, an opening statement.  
COACH BARNES ARICO: I thought Michigan State played really well tonight. They
made shots early. And I thought we got a little bit tight. We couldn't get
anything to fall.  
And we always felt like we were battling back from a position of being down,
because we were. Powers played extremely well for them in the first half. I
thought we forced some turnovers. We did some good things in the second half.
But we really couldn't get out of the shooting slump.  
So even when we forced turnovers and got shots we weren't able to knock them
down. Credit to Michigan State, they played really well.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. This is the third straight year you guys have lost to Michigan State in
the Big Ten tournament. Do they just have your number in the one account, in a
big tournament like this?  
SHANNON SMITH: They just played well tonight. Each year is a different year. I
think they just played well tonight.  
  
Q. Nicole, it seems like in the previous two matchups your defense was
focused on neutralizing everyone except for Powers, everyone was not scoring
very much. What was different today about their offense or your defense?  
NICOLE ELMBLAD: You know, we went in really kind of keying on them as well.
And you gotta credit Michigan State. Their kids, their players really just
knocked down shots and kind of took us out of that defense and really just did
a good job themselves.  
After halftime you guys came out with a 5‑0 run, what did you guys talk about
in the locker room during then and what did you want to change your focus
going into the second half?  
SHANNON SMITH: Just staying positive and just work hard. When you work hard,
good things will happen. But like Nicole and Coach said, credit to Michigan
State. They played well.  
For either of you, do you think today's game was more of just a mental battle
more than anything?  
NICOLE ELMBLAD: I think anytime you get down big in the first half, you kind
of really have to battle yourself mentally. But unfortunately we weren't
hitting shots and they were. And I guess once you kind of get, dig yourself in
a hole it is kind of a mental battle to stay focused and really keep playing
hard.  
What would you attribute, like, the final outcome to? Because obviously in the
past few games Michigan dominated. So what's like the main thing that you
think went wrong?  
SHANNON SMITH: I think all five players on their court played well for them. I
mean, they just played great team basketball. We weren't able to get stops.
That's what happens.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. I've heard coaches say beating a team three times in one season is
hardest thing to do, especially when it's a rival because there's a lot of
motivation on the other side that can't be created on your own side. Could you
talk about that a little bit?  
COACH BARNES ARICO: I always knew about the Michigan/Michigan State rivalry.
But I didn't know how great it was until I became the coach at Michigan.  
And we think‑‑ and I think it's been proven‑‑ that it is the greatest rivalry
in college sports. And there is always fire between our two teams. And it's
always a tremendous game.  
And for the most part, Michigan kind of hasn't been on the winning side of
that a ton. Michigan State has always had one of the best programs in the
country. And Michigan really hasn't been at that level.  
For us to be able to beat them twice this year was a great accomplishment for
us. It just seems like we always have a matchup with them in the Big Ten
Tournament, which is kind of a bummer. Suzy said to me before the game our men
have had a matchup in program history and it was for the Big Ten championship.
Mind you we've played them eight times since I've been the head coach here.
And that's three seasons.  
So I think I wish we didn't have to play them. I think it's a great rivalry,
but we beat them twice for the first time since 2001. So we're trying to beat
them three times for what would that have been the first time in program
history? Yeah. So that's pretty difficult. Michigan State was fired up about
losing the first two contests because that's something that they're not really
accustomed to doing.  
And I'm sure they were ready to go. They really played well tonight, though.
They shot the basketball extremely well. We didn't. And they really took
advantage of those runs that they made.  
  
Q. Cyesha Goree only five points I think it was the lowest scoring output
this season. What were Michigan State's bigs doing to shut her down?  
COACH BARNES ARICO: You guys watched the game. I thought she missed a ton of
easy shots. I don't know if they did too many other things than they've done
before. I mean Cyesha has been really successful against them in both of the
first two contests, and today she really couldn't get her shots to fall like
she did the first couple of times.  
She missed uncontested shots. Contested shots. Free throws. I mean, she seemed
to miss every opportunity that she was getting. And it's kind of a bummer for
her to have that as a senior against Michigan State tonight. But she's had
such a tremendous season for us this year, I don't want this to take away from
the year that she's had for our team.  
  
Q. Does it get harder to defend when you're not making shots because you're
so frustrated on that end of the floor. Seems like especially the start of the
second half, you made that early run and you had some energy and then as you
missed more shots it just got harder?  
COACH BARNES ARICO: Yeah, it was unbelievable. One of my assistants said,
well, our shooting can't get any worse in the second half, and actually it
did, which is incredible. And I think our kids really tried to fight. We tried
to come out in the second half with some fire and with some fight. But it's
incredible. Kids are funny. And as much as you want them to feed off coaches,
you always want them to feed off defense. That's what I preach every day. They
feed off making big shots and making plays and we couldn't get one of them to
fall.  
And it's a shame that it had to happen tonight. And we came in shooting the
ball pretty well. Had a week of or a couple of days at least of getting some
shots up, getting some extra shots up. We felt pretty confident about that.
And it just didn't go our way.  
  
Q. You touched on some of the mental aspects of the game already. With
Cyesha and with Siera and Katelynn shooting 3 for 16 do you think frustration
came into play there?  
COACH BARNES ARICO: The funny thing about Kate, and she's a baby, she's a
freshman. So she's learning. Her success in her mind is based on her making
shots. And that's what we're trying to emphasize as a coaching staff. But you
know, this was the big predicament, I think, from a coaching staff.  
We subbed Danielle Williams in, and we had a lineup, I think it was Danielle,
Jillian, maybe Bird. Might have been Madison and maybe C. And Michigan State
went four minutes without scoring. Pretty good, right? Right.  
But all of our scorers weren't in the game, too. So that's the catch. When we
put our scorers in, they were giving up points on the defensive end and they
weren't making shots tonight. So that's what kind of dug us a little bit more
of a hole. So I think Katelynn, she does get super frustrated and she believes
that if she's not making shots she's not contributing.  
And I think she just needs to get better at being able to do other things for
us and believing that she's contributing without her just making shots. Siera
didn't make shots either. But I thought she really tried to do a good job on
the defensive end.  
She did a pretty decent job at times on Jankoska. It was just a bad night for
us, when they're shooting the ball well, we're playing well.  
  
Q. Thompson had 15, 16 points in each game you played against State. And
then five today. Talk a little bit about that a little more.  
COACH BARNES ARICO: Well, I mean, if you say her‑‑ I haven't even looked at
the stats‑‑ but you told me that ‑‑ Cyesha had five and Siera had five. That's
not a good sign for us.  
And in the Illinois game, the game we're coming off before that, Cyesha didn't
have much and, yeah, and Katelynn didn't have much. Right. So I mean, if those
guys aren't scoring for us, it's tough for us to be successful.  
  
Q. Why do you think that Nicole had a bit of an off game? She ended the
first half without any rebounds. And it seemed like Jillian and Kelsey
Mitchell kind of came in to clean up for her and had meaningful minutes.  
COACH BARNES ARICO: I think teams know she's such a great rebounder that they
really block her out and really make her a point of emphasis from the point of
rebounding. They did a great job of blocking both her and Cyesha out in the
first half.  
But speaking of‑‑ I said there weren't very many bright spots. But if I can
take one thing from tonight, it gave us an opportunity at times to play with a
lot of our younger kids, being Jillian, Madison, Siera, Katelynn and Kelsey.
And I thought they all provided really good minutes at times. So as much as
devastated by the loss of our senior group and really super concerned about
next year, it was great to see those kids step up and give great minutes.
Jillian did a really good job and I thought Kelsey gave us a spark as well.  
  
Q. I think Michigan State was coming into the game with a three ‑game
winning. You guys had just lost to Illinois. Did that have an effect on the
game?  
COACH BARNES ARICO: Michigan State was playing really well. They've been
playing a lot better. I think the last time we got them and we had talked
about this earlier in the week, their other three in their lineup were really
not producing the numbers that they are.  
They've since that time have gained a ton of experience and played a ton of
minutes and have really worked on being more confident and comfortable. And
No. 24 came out tonight and just knocked down shots from the get‑go.  
So I think they have continued to improve as a team. And their kids that were
inexperienced the last time that we played them are really more experienced
now. And they're playing with a lot of confidence. I think they're playing
with a lot of confidence. They have one of the best kids in the country on
their team.  
If you have a kid at any time can make plays like she made plays tonight,
they're pretty tough.  
  
Q. You already understood the Michigan/Michigan State rivalry. After today
do you understand it maybe a little bit more?  
COACH BARNES ARICO: I said a minute ago, you know, three years ago when you
look at Michigan/Michigan State, I knew of the rivalry. When I got here three
years ago, the senior class, Jenny Ryan, really taught me and showed me what
it meant to play against State and what that really meant. And I had mentioned
earlier, for so long, we had been the underdog. And we had been the one that
could never really get that win.  
And Michigan State has always been a top 20 program. And Michigan has never
been there. We've always been the one trying to catch them, catch them, catch
them. And now this year, being the first year since 2001 that we have beaten
them twice in a season, was incredible for our program. But definitely
motivation for their program.  
And I'm sure that's something that they probably‑‑ that hasn't happened since
those kids were little kids, since their players were small. So I'm sure
that's something that that has been on their mind. I mean, Lexi Gussert came
out and had a career night tonight. She's a Michigan kid that grew up knowing
about this rivalry, probably lives and dies Michigan/Michigan State game. So
for her it's a credit to her and what she did to have such a great game
tonight.  
But the rivalry is to me and to the University of Michigan and I'm sure to the
people at state, it's the greatest in college athletics.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_HOFFMAN ESTATES, ILLINOIS_  
  

Purdue  58  
Wisconsin - 56

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Wisconsin head coach Bobbie Kelsey and students
Cassie Rochel and Jacki Gulczynski. Opening statement, Coach.  
COACH KELSEY: Obviously disappointed in not being able to win the game. I'm
proud of the kids. They worked hard. It wasn't our best game. We missed a lot
of easy shots and Purdue was aggressive. When you lose a lot the last couple
of games like they have, I told our kids they're going to be hungry to get
this win. They came out and they scratched and clawed and we did too. But just
kind of came up short.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Do you know if you got it off before the light went on?  
JACKI GULCZYNSKI: When I felt it come off my hands, I didn't think I got it
off. So my teammates came and ran at me. I was kind of like taken back because
I didn't think I got it on time. And then when they took so long to
deliberate, all right, maybe I did.  
But, you know, it's upsetting. It's a tough way to lose. But, you know, we
take a lot out of our career we've had here and couldn't be more happy to say
I've played for this university.  
  
Q. What was that moment like when you're waiting, could be the biggest
moment of your career or your career could be over and it just seemed like it
dragged on and on.  
JACKI GULCZYNSKI: It took forever. You know, you think they would have been
able to figure it out within a couple of minutes. But Coach was telling me to
relax and in that moment you don't know what's going to happen. Like you said
our season is just hanging there. So we're all disappointed. But I know that
this team can go far next year. And I'll be right there to cheer them on.  
  
Q. Cassie, it seemed like you had things going. You had a nine ‑point lead
and then it frittered away down the stretch. Could you tell what happened?   
CASSIE ROCHEL: It's all kind of a blur when you're in the moment and you just
take every possession one at a time. I think they kind of broke down and
started hitting shots. We were kind of not taking the best shots. We were
getting kind of a little too upbeat and like I said I think they were just
hitting shots and we weren't taking advantage of the open looks we were
getting. So just came down to that.  
  
Q. As you're watching, did you know that shot was going in?  
CASSIE ROCHEL: I was praying and, like Jacki said, at that moment all you
could do, you're just sitting there, we just prayed. We asked God. But it
wasn't in his plan, like Jacki said, we're looking forward to next year to
cheer these girls on. Coach Bobbie's going to do great things with them.  
  
Q. Cassie, you're probably not aware you set a Big Ten record with seven
blocks tonight. Single game record. What was working for you, there especially
on defense?  
CASSIE ROCHEL: I've been in foul trouble a lot lately within these last few
games in the first half and had to sit. So I think it was more just me telling
myself I need to be patient. And Coach always tells us great shot blockers
they jump late. They're patient. They don't jump early and let the offense get
into them get those fouls.  
So I didn't want to sit on the bench any longer than I had to this game. Every
game counts. And so I was really paying attention to my timing and stuff on
defense and I think that really helped.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Did you have any sense of the timing whether it was going to go your way
or not?  
COACH KELSEY: I'm like Jacki, my first thought was it looked a little late,
but I've been in this game before with another institution. It was right off
the fingertips. It was literally off the fingertips in our favor. So we had to
wait, too. And it's like oh my God, did it go in, did it not. Would have ended
a season not going to a Final Four. It can go either way. And at least you get
a shot off.  
I thought we went too soon on our initial play. It was 26 on the game clock
and on the shot clock. When Dakota started going late, no, wait, you want to
get the last shot. Once you start going, you gotta go now. You can't pull it
back because then they get skittish and get all crazy.  
And then at the end there, where we kind of picked up a little bit, not to let
them just go clear down the court, I was hoping everybody else would get back
and Nicole would just be right on the ball. But kind of got spread out a
little bit and I think Wilson went right to the basket.  
But again these kids are learning how to win. And I can call all the plays I
want to, but they've got to execute them. And we didn't have very good
execution. We just didn't.  
I mean, Purdue got all kinds of tips and every loose ball they got. It's part
of being aggressive. You gotta be aggressive. This game is not for
non‑aggressive people. You're not going to be very successful.  
  
Q. This is the second straight game that you've had a really good shooting
first half, kind of struggled in the second half. Unfortunately, you didn't
have the cushion, I guess, like you had at Penn State?  
COACH KELSEY: Yeah, they have some shooters that you gotta pay attention to. I
know they hit a big 3 later in the game. And our shots just weren't falling.
We had some nice looks to people, just off their hands and butter fingers. And
other than calling the play and they've got to execute it and‑‑ Nicole had a
nice pass to Cassie. She finished that shot.  
She had a nice reverse layup but they're going to key in on her. Jacki
struggled on offense. I don't think Jacki scored at all. That would have been
a big 3 for her, not able to score the whole game and hit the game winner.  
It just wasn't meant to be. But we're proud of them. They worked hard. And we
had a rough season. But at the end, you can see why we were in every game,
because these kids play hard.  
And the more we can get some more shooters, some more people that can create
off the dribble, that would open it up a little more for others to get nice
open looks.  
And Dakota struggled, too. She just struggled the whole night with
decision‑making but she hit a big shot. Her shot was the go‑ahead shot. So it
just wasn't meant to be for us.  
  
Q. You referred to it after, if she hits that shot, Wilson goes length for
the court, you were never able to stop her. Was that just the defense
breakdown on your end, do you think?  
COACH KELSEY: Probably. I mean, when you hit a shot, people tend to relax. You
gotta be on it. And if one person relaxes or three people relax and two others
are on it, then I can't really remember where Wilson was and who was on her,
but I tried to just get up a little bit just to keep them from getting a full
head of steam. You can slow them down just a little bit.  
But, again, you can stop that 100 times, do it one time and they score.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_HOFFMAN ESTATES, ILLINOIS_  
  

Indiana  68  
Penn State - 63

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Indiana head coach Teri Moren and
student‑athletes Larryn Brooks, Tyra Buss and Amanda Cahill. Opening comment
from Coach.  
COACH MOREN: We're just real excited about the fact that we'll be playing
tomorrow. As I said to our gang, just really happy for them and the way they
responded this afternoon.  
I thought Penn State, when they started to make runs at us, we responded. In
the past, at times, not always, but in the past there have been moments where
we've hit the panic button and haven't responded in the way that we needed to
to win a basketball game.  
And I thought that our kids just did a tremendous job of just showing some
toughness, especially down the stretch. These three kids, I thought, played
tremendous‑‑ I thought Larryn had tremendous leadership.  
Cahill was just great all afternoon. And then Tyra does what Tyra does, and
that's keeps the defense honest. Happy collective for our group. But it took
all of us and more than anything I'm just really pleased with the way we
played this afternoon.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Tyra, Amanda, you guys are freshman playing in your first Big Ten
tournament, you both had big games tonight what was it like coming out on the
stage and having that kind of performance?  
TYRA BUSS: We came out and we told each other we weren't going to be nervous
playing out there. And I thought we came out with a lot of confidence, and we
got a good start, and I just think we kept‑‑ we did good with our game plan
and I thought we played very well tonight.  
AMANDA CAHILL: Definitely. I thought it was a really good opportunity and
experience. And it was just really fun to get out there with my teammates and
give it our all. And we're happy to keep playing.  
  
Q. Amanda, can you talk about trying to stop the post, especially Candice
Agee, and did you make adjustments at halftime doubling down on her or
anything like that?  
AMANDA CAHILL: That was our game plan, we were giving up some size. We just
wanted to really crowd the post. The zone helped a lot and my teammates were
great on digging in and we just tried to move our feet and get them out of the
paint.  
  
Q. Larryn, yesterday you told me that you were looking for this team, you
knew last year in the Big Ten tournament to play each game like it's your
last, did you see that tonight?  
LARRYN BROOKS: Definitely did see that tonight. Definitely did see that
tonight. That was the main thing going in. We just wanted to play every game
like it was our last. Like Tyra said, everybody gave it their all. We laid
everything on the floor tonight, and that's all we could ask for.  
  
Q. Any of you can answer this. How important was it to hit shots early? I
think you guys were shooting over 50percent in the first half. How important
was that for your confidence?  
AMANDA CAHILL: Well, the past couple days in practice we've been shooting with
the ball we were going to be using today. I think that was nice. It's a little
bit different than our usual game ball.  
And I think we've just been getting in the gym lately and getting shots up. So
that was there to prepare us for today.  
  
Q. For any of you, how was the atmosphere tonight?  
TYRA BUSS: It was a great atmosphere. I appreciate all of our fans that came
out, the IU fans. They were great supporting us and it means a lot for them to
make their way down to Chicago to watch us play.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Same question as before, the team has pulled out close games throughout
the season. What do you think made the difference tonight?  
COACH MOREN: Cahill hit it on the head. It was the ball. I just think that, as
Larryn alluded to, I think one of the things we shared with them today at film
was that it's been 2009 was the last time that an Indiana team had won the
first game of championship, of a tournament play.  
And as we challenged them, you know, what better motivation than just that?
We've been in a lot of tight games this year.  
We just came off a brutal road trip out east, as you guys know, our beat
writers, last four out of five have been on the road. And I was just happy. I
thought our toughness, we talk about toughness. It's kind of a buzzword that
everybody throws out. But I think we had to have that.  
We got in late on Monday night. We had really one day of prep. I thought the
kids were focused on what we were trying to do, and that was keep Agee at bay
as well as we could, knowing we were going to give up some height.  
So just give our kids credit. I just think they played with some resilience
tonight. Toughness, I thought Larryn, again‑‑ they just didn't want to be
denied. And just really proud of the way that all of them, not just the three
of these guys, but all of them responded.  
  
Q. You guys had the tournament in your home state last year. How does the
atmosphere compare in Chicago to in Indiana?  
COACH MOREN: Unfortunately, I can't really speak to that. I'm a new coach.
But, again, like Tyra said, our fans have been tremendous throughout the
entire season. And they've been cheering hard for a team that might not have
gotten the results throughout the season like we wanted to, and that's wins.  
But we feel like we've made incremental progress throughout. And there's been
some nights where we haven't shown up the way we want to and then there's been
like this last road trip with Maryland and Rutgers, where we showed up and
made it interesting for both teams.  
And so credit our fans, again just with their efforts, their commitment to
Indiana and our women's basketball team and coming out. There's a lot of
family, but there's also some fans that just love Indiana women's basketball.  
  
Q. At the beginning of the second half, it took you guys a while to get
going offensively but you got three or four stops in a row. Talk about the
defense's performance?  
COACH MOREN: I thought the defense's performance, we had to. And I can't
remember the stretch completely, but they helped us. They turned it over a few
times. We really thought we were getting good shots. They just weren't going
down.  
And we needed that to happen. But as we move forward with our program, this
program's going to be ‑‑ the cornerstone is going to be defense and rebounding
the ball. And it's good that we can go back and kind of refer back to, hey we
were getting good shots, it didn't fall but this is what you did to keep your
lead.  
You defended the way we talked about. You stuck with the game plan. And so
that will go a long way with this group. We're still a work in progress trying
to get them to understand that there's going to be nights that our shots don't
fall, we've got to be able to hang our hat on something and that's the
defensive end.  
  
Q. You guys played Rutgers less than a week ago. How do you try and carry
this success over to face Rutgers again?  
COACH MOREN: That's the nice thing about just playing them; that our prep,
what they'll remember, our players should still be pretty fresh, fairly fresh
in what we know that one of the things we didn't do a tremendous job of and we
didn't do a great job tonight was rebounding the ball.  
They're clearly more athletic than we are. They're bigger than we are. And so
we have to go in with the same focus. We got a lead there in the first half
and just couldn't keep it because we turned it over 18 times. So I can tell
you this, the discussion going into our game plan first and foremost will be
valuing the ball, taking care of it, and that's one of the things, when you
look at the stats, they didn't overwhelm us in any category other than the
fact we just turned it over.  
  
Q. Jess wasn't up here but she had 15 points, all 3 ‑pointers she's become a
big part of the offense. Can you talk about how much she's improved?   
COACH MOREN: Her improvement, the experience she's gotten obviously is going
to be big for us, down the stretch.  
I think Karlee has given us great minutes. She had 18 against Maryland.
Tonight she didn't shoot it great but you can never count Karlee out because
she's such a great shooter. But Jess had a bank there with the shot clock
running down. I think she had another one in the first half, shot clock
running down. This is a kid that spends time in the gym.  
She spends time after practice, before practice, very committed to being a
really good Big Ten player, and as you mentioned it, we need her to continue
to shoot the ball well for us, because of our lack of size. We gotta be able
to stretch out the defense as well as we can. But part of that is being able
to knock down open shots.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_HOFFMAN ESTATES, ILLINOIS_  
  

Purdue  58  
Wisconsin - 56

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Purdue head coach Sharon Versyp along with
Ashley Morrissette and April Wilson and Whitney Bays. An opening statement,
Coach.  
COACH VERSYP: Obviously an extremely exciting game. Both teams didn't get to
the foul line very much. And we were behind and our kids kept fighting and
fighting and fighting and we've been in about seven or eight games like this
when it was this close.  
And these kids just really willed themselves to a victory tonight. And I know
it always comes down to the last shot. It happens with us all the time. And
we're very blessed and fortunate, but want to give Wisconsin a lot of credit.
They played a great basketball game and made us really work.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. April, you have had personally several chances at the end of games to hit
a shot and haven't come up in those. But today you did. Just what's it feel
like to finally get one and get in a situation and break the losing streak?  
APRIL WILSON: It's a good feeling. And it's good to finally win. But
last‑second shots are going to happen and you're not going to make all of
them. You have to let it go and watch film and then try to correct it.  
  
Q. Whitney, just the win, after the ten ‑game losing streak and to have that
kind of lifted right now.  
WHITNEY BAYS: You know, people can say what they want about our season. But I
think we faced almost every way to lose possible. And I think that has really
helped us. We've lost in overtime. We've lost by 20. We've kept it close and
then lost.  
So I think all throughout the year we competed but now it's starting to really
pay off and we're working harder and it's a clean slate. We're a team with
nothing to lose now. So we're the most dangerous?  
  
Q. April, they hit that jumper with nine plus seconds left and you get the
ball. What are you thinking there when you're coming up the court?  
APRIL WILSON: I wasn't really thinking. I know I got the ball and Whitney told
me to go, so I went and it paid off.  
  
Q. To close the game down the stretch you were down nine with about eight
minutes to go, is that just those lessons again that are coming out that you
guys went through the last month and a half?  
WHITNEY BAYS: Yeah, definitely. And just communicating and locking down on
defense. I thought our defense was really great today. We were talking. We
were communicating and we came out with the energy like we talked about all
season that we needed to have. And we closed with the same energy.  
So I think that really helped us to get the win tonight.  
  
Q. Ashley, you had like primary responsibility on Bauman most of the game
and after a fast start she kind of slowed down. What were you trying to do to
take her out of the offense?  
ASHLEY MORRISSETTE: She's a great shooter. We were trying to make everybody
else on the team score or allow them more opportunities. But we couldn't let
her get the ball and score.  
  
Q. Ashley, what did you feel like the difference was in the last four
minutes today compared to some other games where you guys have come up just a
little short?  
ASHLEY MORRISSETTE: I thought the hustle was great in the last‑‑ the whole
game, but definitely in the last four minutes, everybody was getting on the
floor. Everybody was going after rebounds. The defense definitely won it for
us today.  
  
Q. Whitney, that last several minutes, while they're reviewing the replay,
what was that experience like for you waiting and waiting and waiting?  
WHITNEY BAYS: I don't think I can say it on the mic (laughing). But a lot of
praying and just looking at my teammates. It's kind of funny because, like, in
those moments you kind of reflect back on what's been going on with the
season. And just seeing my teammates, you know. It was hard. And you look at
the other team and you see how bad they want it.  
So it made winning even better. But we worked really hard throughout the
season to get this win. And our coaches, they prepared us to the best of their
abilities for this game. And we executed and did everything right today. Well
not everything, but you know close enough.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Sharon, what did you like about what they did the last four minutes?  
COACH VERSYP: The defense. Executed every play that we needed. We got really
good shots. But really just executed and kept attacking and getting fouled and
getting to the foul line and being able to stop the clock and set our defense.  
So, you know, like Whitney said, it felt like they were very strong‑willed
today and really followed the game plan and executed it exceptionally well.  
  
Q. What do you think this means for April to be in this situation and to
deliver like she did tonight?  
COACH VERSYP: I mean, any player that can go down and score and at least get
those two points, we've been put in those situations, not just April, it's
been a lot of players. It just helps their confidence. And this one was for
someone special that's in heaven right now.  
  
Q. I'd imagine you had a decent angle on the final shot there. What did you
think when it went up and what was it like to wait there a couple minutes?  
COACH VERSYP: I knew it was in but I thought the ball was still in her hand. I
was right there. I saw the red. And it looked like‑‑ I mean, it was close. But
they didn't have many angles to look at.  
And no one made a call. The official didn't say it counted. They didn't say
anything. But it was definitely in when it left her hand. But I felt like the
light was on.  
  
Q. Just to get a win, you guys just haven't experienced this kind of emotion
in a long time. Just to finally get a win.  
COACH VERSYP: You see the emotion in the locker room. We've been through 100
of these this year. Last year, we were able to be on the other side. This year
we haven't. It's a tough conference.  
And so you appreciate it. You appreciate this one for a long time. Until
tomorrow night when we got to get ready to play another one.  
  
Q. I'd imagine you had a timeout at the end. But after April got the ball
and headed up court, did you just feel like she had a good angle there?  
COACH VERSYP: She was going. Every other time I called timeout we never
scored. So I just tried something different. They couldn't set their defense.
And everybody said we have one more timeout. I've done it before. I'm, like,
nope, she's just going to go all the way to the hole. Whitney obviously told
her to get it and go. And I told her to keep going. Because if they foul
you're going to get to the foul line. Sometimes those timeouts, they get their
defense set. I just went with a gut feeling and felt April was going to be
able to make that play.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

### [Sierra Moore](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28296)

### [Coquese Washington](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18021)

  
_HOFFMAN ESTATES, ILLINOIS_  
  

Indiana  68  
Penn State - 63

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by head coach Coquese Washington, Candice Agee and
Sierra Moore. Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Candice, what can you say about how you performed in the forward today?
You were getting a lot of shots down. How did it feel to be getting the ball
so much?  
CANDICE AGEE: I think that it was something that we know to do and something
that we've found that is we get better shots off in the paint. So not that it
was a surprise to me. Something that we work on, something that we try to
focus on doing is getting the ball inside and out.  
  
Q. Sierra, what can you say then today what your fight was that second half
rally, what can you say and what you guys had in your hearts through the
second half to try to battle back?  
SIERRA MOORE: I mean, we're a very competitive team. So we always come out
fighting, and we're going to fight to the end, whether win or lose. And I
think that's what we had and we just came up short.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, what can you say about the growth we've had this year with the
team. And maybe the battle that the team had today in this game?  
COACH WASHINGTON: There's certainly a lot of learning, a lot of lessons that
we'll take away from this season, this game, the Big Ten Conference play.  
We've got the majority of the team coming back next year. So a lot of these
lessons and the growth we saw over the course of the season is something we'll
build.  
  
Q. What can you say about Kaliyah Mitchell, having a double ‑double today.
She did pretty will. What can you say about her efforts today, as well as
Candice Agee's?  
COACH WASHINGTON: We had some good efforts out there. The thing is Indiana has
a very balanced team inside/outside. And when you've got a balanced attack
like that, it makes it, it challenges your defense and the way that they
balance that attack, driving and getting into the paint as well as their
ability to shoot from the outside, that was tough for us to defend today.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

Boise State  66  
New Mexico - 60

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Boise State.  
Coach, some thoughts on today's game.  
COACH PRESNELL: First I'll say to New Mexico congratulations on a great year.
I think they won 15 of their last 17 games, had really improved defensively,
have a lot of talent. I know they'll be back next year.  
Real excited for our group. It's been a long few years. I want to thank our
administration for seeing us through some pretty rough points, pretty rough
times.  
Excited to get to this moment in our fourth year in the Mountain West.  
I thought Yaiza was terrific. She kept calling the same pick'n roll over and
over and over. Brooke has been all in. It's been a great run. They're Boise
State believers, both of them, and we're excited about the win.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll now take questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Talk about what this win means to you.  
YAIZA RODRIGUEZ: I mean, it's really hard to be here. I don't know, I was
thinking about my parents, that they cannot be here watching me. They need to
wake up at 5:00 in the morning and watch my game online.  
About the team, we worked so hard to get this win and we got it, so... I was
just happy for my teammates, too.  
  
Q. Thoughts on being able to win this game. It was kind of like a road game
for you. Whenever New Mexico made a run, you had an answer.  
BROOKE PAHUKOA: Yeah, I mean, they had an amazing crowd. Even when we're at
home for them, it's crazy. They definitely are good enough to have that many
fans, so it was a fun atmosphere to play in.  
I thank the New Mexico fans for coming, it was awesome. There's not many
chances we get to play in front of that many people.  
It was a special opportunity. I mean, we were playing our best basketball.
This was probably the best game we've had as a team. That's what you want at
the end of the year is have that championship game be your best game.  
  
Q. At what point did you feel comfortable the game was over?  
BROOKE PAHUKOA: Never. New Mexico is way too good to ever think that. With 10
seconds left...  
With a team like that that does not give up, plays aggressively, you can't
think that.  
  
Q. The other day you said your plan was to leave on Friday with the
championship. You made that happen. You got really emotional at the end there.
What's going through your head as you hit the floor?  
YAIZA RODRIGUEZ: My friends, the first thing. I want to call them, but they're
sleeping right now, so I don't think I can do it.  
Then my teammates. When we lost in New Mexico, we had a team meeting. I think
after that meeting everything change. Now we're here. Yeah, we are leaving to
Boise with the championship, so...  
  
Q. Whether it's men, women, you see that picture climbing the ladder,
cutting down the nets. What was that moment like?  
YAIZA RODRIGUEZ: I told Sha, Sha, I never do this. How I have to do this? Tell
me.  
Because in Europe usually you cut all the net and you take it. That's why with
the championship, I like, Sha, help me. Help me. We were fine.  
BROOKE PAHUKOA: It was an awesome feeling, having your friends and family down
at the bottom watching you, your teammates who you had 6:00 a.m. workouts
with, fought all summer to get through horrible workouts, that song. Just to
be able to be with everyone you love, representing a university who you have
so much passion for. It was awesome. Probably the best feeling I've ever had.  
  
Q. This season as a whole, this team has talked a lot about a lot of ups and
downs. Looking at it in hindsight, how wild of a ride has it been for you?  
BROOKE PAHUKOA: Like I said early on, there were a couple games where we lost
in the season where it's still haunting us a little bit. That number one goal
on the top of our pyramid that Coach P has talked about, too, is finish. It
feels so good to finish. That was our number one goal. You have to
giveandtake. Part of the game is losing some games you shouldn't have. Happy
we won the one that counts, so...  
THE MODERATOR: We'll dismiss the student‑athletes at this time. Thank you,
ladies.  
We'll continue with questions for Coach Presnell.  
  
Q. You mentioned there's been ups and downs a lot this year. To be able to
put it all together at the end has to be rewarding.  
COACH PRESNELL: I'm really proud of them. We haven't done very much grinding
out. We kind of made that a point of emphasis. We did have a team meeting down
at New Mexico after we played pretty flat.  
We had a little more urgency the rest of the year. I didn't know what would
happen. We were ahead all but 14 seconds at Fresno State last week. They got
right back up and got going.  
I'm really proud of them. They're a great group to coach. You never have to
worry about anything on Sunday morning, somebody doing something stupid.
They're really great people. I can't tell you how happy I am for them.  
  
Q. Ever since you won the WAC back in '07, to go through a lot of things out
of your control, injuries, things like that, to be able to do this here today
for you and the program, what has that meant?  
COACH PRESNELL: I have the administration to thank, too. They hung in there
with us. We had 21 knee surgeries. Sometimes kind of felt the depth a little
bit. I was always encouraged by my superiors, always believed in me. So I'm
very appreciative to Christina Van Tol and Mark Coyle.  
It's a great feeling to get to this point when someone believes in you, then
you do.  
We're thrilled to be in the Mountain West Conference, and we're thrilled to be
a part of Boise State.  
  
Q. During timeouts, what was your group like, especially as New Mexico cut
that deficit?  
COACH PRESNELL: We were trying to manage substitution with all the foul
issues. D hasn't played trail post but four or five minutes the whole season.
We had that going. We had a protocol. I go in and talk, then Cody is going to
talk about the next out‑of‑bounds play, Sunny is going to talk about the next
play. We have an order about how we do it, be businesslike, give them a
straight feel instead of being real emotional.  
They respond to that. Yeah, we just kind of grinded it out and never stopped
believing.  
You know, we let them get it down to five, but never let them get all the way
back into it. I was really proud of them.  
  
Q. Going to the NCAA tournament, it has to be a dream come true. How far has
the program come? What was the difference this year, besides staying
healthy?  
COACH PRESNELL: I don't want to sound like bragging, but I think we have some
really good pieces. We hadn't put it together. We finally put it together.
Camille Redmon is out there six foot that plays around the rim. Deanna Weaver,
she struggled a little bit today, but she's done a lot for our program. She's
a tremendous athlete.  
Brooke Pahukoa, my assistant did some great recruiting. She's Miss Washington
basketball.  
We had some really good pieces. We came out of getting embarrassed pretty good
down in Albuquerque and have played pretty well since.  
  
Q. Yaiza's play late in the season, had to take a bit of a different role,
coming off the bench, how did she handle that?  
COACH PRESNELL: Yaiza has done a nice job. She had some adversity early in the
season. Probably lost a starting spot to Tonishia until about mid‑season, then
kind of won over it and has run with it.  
She's played so much basketball. The whole tournament atmosphere is a big deal
to her. She's played in three World Championships and two European
Championships for Spain. She's really fired up when there's any kind of
tournament. If we were in a Thanksgiving tournament, she'd be fired up. She's
done a really nice job for us.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much, coach.  
COACH PRESNELL: Go Broncos.

_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

Boise State  66  
New Mexico - 60

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by New Mexico.  
Coach, some thoughts on today's game.  
COACH SANCHEZ: I first want to congratulate Gordy and Boise State. They played
a tremendous game. Had a great season. They definitely had the pieces in place
to win this conference. They did a great job.  
My hat is off to them. They did a terrific job. They took us out of what we
wanted to do. Yeah, that's a tremendous team.  
They're going to represent the Mountain West Conference very, very well.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll now take questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. 19 offensive rebounds for Boise State. Were they doing something
different, catching you off guard?  
KHADIJAH SHUMPERT: I would have to say that it's not just the post, it's a
team effort. All five people have to box out.  
With that being said, I think they went hard and they went for the boards. We
know next year coming into it, we have to work harder, can't give up boards.
That's something we talked about as a team we needed to do and didn't get
done.  
  
Q. You shot just 30% from the floor. Why do you feel like you couldn't get a
rhythm offensively this game?  
ANTIESHA BROWN: I think Boise State did a terrific job of taking us out of our
offense. We just weren't cutting very hard. We weren't making contact on
screens. They just out‑played us. They took us out of our rhythm. We just
didn't hit 'em back.  
  
Q. They had some opportunities in the second half to extend to 13, 14,
really put you guys away. You did keep bouncing back. Was there any point in
the second half, or the whole game, that you thought maybe it had slipped
away?  
ANTIESHA BROWN: The only thing that could make me believe that it was done was
whenever the buzzer went off.  
There's no way there's a point in the game that I believe we lost it. We've
come back from far worse deficits in our games. I didn't think it was over
until the last buzzer.  
KHADIJAH SHUMPERT: I'll also agree with Antiesha. If anything where there was
a time where we were like we really need to get it together, it would have
been the first half. Because the first half is where we ended up digging that
hole.  
The second half we were clawing our way out the whole time. I think me and my
teammates worked hard in the second half to come back.  
  
Q. This tournament is over obviously. Are you two players hopeful there will
be another game?  
ANTIESHA BROWN: Absolutely.  
KHADIJAH SHUMPERT: Most definitely. Basketball never stops. That's my
mentality. Ever since we were young, we've always played. I don't see it being
done for any of us.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll dismiss the student‑athletes at this time. Thank you,
ladies.  
We'll continue with questions for Coach Sanchez.  
  
Q. The 19 offensive rebounds. How big a factor was their second ‑chance
opportunities?  
COACH SANCHEZ: We got to yell shot and box out. They were mostly long
rebounds. That's the guard. That's not necessarily the post play. Guards stood
and stared instead of boxed out. If you don't box out initially, the ball goes
over your head. Three‑point shooters, you're going to have rebounds. That's
what happened initially. Bounced over our head. They got too many second
chances. The two factors were that and eight for 22 from the three‑point line.  
If you look at the rest of the stats, everything else is pretty even. We're
not a three‑point shooting team. We did manage to get a three. We ran that
play for Josie so she could bank it in. I thought that was a pretty good play
for her. I'm kidding really (smiling).  
You know, you have to credit Boise State. Every run we made, they responded.
Good teams do. It was a great game, it really was. I just wish we would have
played better obviously. But it was a good game.  
They got the best of it today.  
  
Q. They did have the 19 offensive rebounds, but only 10 second ‑chance
points.   
COACH SANCHEZ: Right.  
  
Q. So they didn't gain the advantage in points. When you're having to defend
on a possession three shots, did that wear you guys down a little bit?  
COACH SANCHEZ: I don't know if it wears you down. It takes ticks off the
clock. When you need that precious time, you don't get an opportunity to go
down and score, they get the possession for a minute, or a minute 30. One they
got four offensive rebounds. That really hurts.  
Even if you get a stop on that, they still took time off the clock. It's time
we needed there at the end of the game. That hurt a little bit.  
  
Q. You only shot 30% from the field, never got into an offensive rhythm. Why
do you think that was?  
COACH SANCHEZ: It's tournament time. We played them three times. They shot
36%. We know what they're running. They know what we're running.  
We had some good looks, they didn't go down. We had some layups that didn't go
down. Our effort from the free‑throw line was good, 89%. We got to the basket.  
You wanted to shoot a little bit better, and we didn't.  
I'm proud of this team. This is just a tremendous group. They exceeded
probably everybody's expectations but ours in that locker room because we
wanted some special things this year, and I think we got it done.  
But we're not done yet. It's got to be something to build on because I don't
want to come to championship games anymore and lose.  
  
Q. How about Antiesha's performance. Every time you needed a bucket, she
gave it to you.  
COACH SANCHEZ: Look at both of them. Khadijah was 17, 11 for 11 from the line.
Antiesha started out, I think she had two points in the first half. She got 21
in the second half. She tried to put the team on her back and will this team
to win. That's why she's a senior. That's why she's a leader. That's why she's
going to be playing beyond college.  
Hopefully we're not done yet. There's still maybe another tournament we can go
win. But I think those two performances were exceptional today.  
  
Q. You've already alluded to today's effort. You told me yesterday
regardless win or lose today you would be content with what this team has done
this season if you knew they left it on the floor. Do you feel they left it
out there today?  
COACH SANCHEZ: There's no question. We made some mistakes, missed some
assignments. But in terms of their effort, there's no question I think they
left everything on the floor. I told them in the locker room, I'll live with
the results if you do that.  
They never gave up. They never quit. It's like Antiesha said, we have the
philosophy if there's still time on the floor, there's still time you can win
the basketball game.  
You keep coaching, then the buzzer went off, and that was it. There wasn't a
point in time where I thought we were going to lose, there just wasn't. We've
had that mentality all year.  
But you have to credit Boise State. They had a heck of a game. They played
well. They have a great team. Like I said before, they're going to represent
the Mountain West Conference very, very well.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much, coach.  
COACH SANCHEZ: Thanks.

_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

Boise State  76  
San Jose State - 67

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Boise State.  
Coach, just some thoughts on tonight's game.  
COACH PRESNELL: First I want to congratulate San Jose State on a great
tournament run. I have great respect for them and their coaching staff, the
way they handle themselves and the way they play. They play a unique style of
basketball that really gets in your head.  
I thought our kids handled themselves. We had a couple points at the beginning
of our shoot‑around about having poise and then grinding it out. I thought
those were the two key points. I thought we had poise, handled the storm, then
hung in there and kind of grinded it out.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. To be able to put together that sort of a game, what did it mean to you
as a freshman?  
SHALEN SHAW: It means a lot. It means I did my job. I did everything for my
team, yeah.  
  
Q. Playing through injury and toughing things out at the end, what went
wrong and what allowed you to get back out on the floor to contribute?  
BROOKE PAHUKOA: I landed funny on my ankle. It's okay now. It's a little sore.
It's a little swollen. I did not want to be out but my team stepped it up big
time and had a huge run when I was injured. It was comforting knowing I could
stay out. I was out for a couple minutes there. They let me recover and get
better before going in. That was awesome.  
  
Q. What makes San Jose State such a challenge to defend and what did you do
tonight to negate that?  
BROOKE PAHUKOA: San Jose is a really good team. They like to run the ball.
They like to pressure you. We're more of a composed halfcourt team.  
When we have a point guard like Yaiza who can read the floor really well, it
makes it easy for us.  
San Jose is always up in your face. You have to grind through their runs
they're going to have. Great three‑point shooting team, so that was tough,
but...  
  
Q. The three ‑pointer you hit, then you had a driving layup, took over there
late in the game.   
SHALEN SHAW: I was just looking to score, looking to get ahead for my team,
get to the basket.  
  
Q. When you're running that hot, do you keep asking for the ball?  
SHALEN SHAW: No.  
BROOKE PAHUKOA: She will never do that. We wish she would, but...  
SHALEN SHAW: I've been trying to do that more, but not usually.  
  
Q. How about the position you guys are in right now? At the start of the
season you couldn't have asked for anything more. One win away from an
historic moment for Boise State women's basketball.  
BROOKE PAHUKOA: When we started the number one goal we had was finish. We have
this big pyramid. It says: Finish on the top. When we were down during the
season, when we lost some games we shouldn't have, it was tough for us. We
knew the final goal was to make it to the championship here and then hopefully
make it to the NCAA. It feels great knowing that number one goal we
accomplished.  
  
Q. Talk about what Sha has brought to the team this year.  
BROOKE PAHUKOA: I mean, if you guys try to think about where she'll be next
year or her junior year, you don't know. You have no idea. I don't think Coach
P knows. I don't think even Sha knows. She has all the potential in the world
to be the best player this conference has ever seen. Plus she's pretty cool.  
She contributes in so many ways. She plays every position, wherever we need
her. It's not likely you can get a player like that, that can play point
guard, the post and can defend, too, which is huge.  
  
Q. When you came to Boise State, did you imagine being in a position like
this where you have a chance to play for a championship?  
SHALEN SHAW: Of course, I did. I chose this team for a reason. That was our
plan from the beginning. That was my plan. That's basically the reason I came
here. They're a great team and I love my family.  
  
Q. As far as your goals are concerned, have you put in focus that the men
are seeded No.1, now you're in the championship game, how sweet it might be
for both of you to pull off a title? Is there pressure there?  
BROOKE PAHUKOA: I mean, the saying that has been going around is, Why not us?
We're Boise State, too. We try to focus on our team, what we can accomplish.
We always knew we could.  
But we have, the football team is amazing. Our men's team is amazing. But
we're amazing, too. We knew that. We just wanted to show people.  
Why not us is kind of a thing. We try to focus on us, though we're very happy
for all of them.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll dismiss the student‑athletes at this time. Thank you.  
We'll continue with questions for Coach Presnell.  
  
Q. Obviously huge game for Sha. Maybe this is her best. What does she bring
to the table?  
COACH PRESNELL: First of all, I don't know how in the world she doesn't make
the freshmen team this year. We certainly nominated her. She's certainly good
enough, that's for sure.  
I told her, I kind of drilled her at halftime, They don't have an answer for
you. Hardly anyone does. There's not 6'1" people that can dribble, shoot the
three, guard the post, the perimeter. She played point guard in high school a
little bit.  
She's just kind of multidimensional, we place her wherever we want. Those are
hard to find in women's basketball. There's a little bit more of those in
men's basketball that are multidimensional. On the women's side, you grow up
as a post if you're tall. She's developed her skills and we are fortunate to
have her.  
  
Q. Your thoughts on this moment and the game you will play in two days?  
COACH PRESNELL: We're just excited. Like Brooke said, we built a pyramid on a
retreat up in McCall and the finish was at the top of it. We've had some ups
and downs. Obviously it's fun to be in this moment. We've been here before a
few years ago. But it's been a challenging year because of up and down.  
But I thought we had the best pieces, but we'll see. We got another game to
go. We'll see.  
  
Q. I think about five minutes left, you're trailing by one. Sha hit a three,
a couple big buckets. What was the difference down the stretch?  
COACH PRESNELL: We were talking about that in the locker room. A lot of people
contributed. Our kids got going when Camille just murdered the ball on a
blocked shot, just hit it. Everyone kind of got fired up and loosened up a
little bit.  
Sha, we ran a slip screen for her for that little lob. We thought they were
overplaying a little bit. Then she had a wide‑open three she nailed. She kind
of got loose and got some rhythm.  
We were very, very fortunate to win. It was a team win, like I said. I just
have great respect for San Jose State in every way from their administrators
down to Jamie, who was with me for three years. Really love them.  
  
Q. You mentioned San Jose State being a challenge to play against. What is
so difficult about them?  
COACH PRESNELL: They're extremely athletic. They've committed themselves to
shooting the three. So they're never out of the game. They focus very much in
the backcourt with their defensive pressure. We felt if we could have poise,
we could score in the front court, especially with our post players.  
But they're difficult. They kind of get in your head a little bit. They switch
from the matchup zone to the man. Kind of get in your head.  
Yaiza has played so much basketball all over the world and I thought she
handled herself really well, too, with the pressure.

_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

New Mexico  64  
Fresno State - 53

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Fresno State.  
Coach, some comments on tonight's game.  
COACH WHITE: Yeah, first congratulations to New Mexico. They played a great
game, came right out of the gates knocking down some shots, shooting 46% in
the first half, just really limiting us. I thought they played physical. Their
defense really kind of threw us off there a little bit at first. I thought we
were forcing some offense.  
But when you look at the game in general, we stayed with them rebounding.
They're a nice rebounding team. That was one of our goals. You got to know
where Brown is. She's a nice player. Obviously a reason for all conference.
Shumpert, I thought they did a nice job on her. She's a nice, physical five.  
Just turnovers. They've kind of haunted us lately. But overall I'm proud of
the girls. I thought we cut that lead. It was 36‑37\. Felt like we had an
opportunity to go ahead at that point. Just kind of we had some multiple
turnovers that create chaos for us.  
Other than that, I mean, it's been a joy to coach these two obviously. I
inherited them. I'm grateful for it. They've been staples for our program this
year. It's been nice to work with them.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Would you say it was a poor offensive night for you guys or a great
defensive effort by New Mexico?  
ALEX SHEEDY: I think there were things we could have improved offensively. But
I think obviously there were times when we exploited their defense. I'm not
sure how I would answer that question.  
I think it was just a matter of toughness and making shots.  
  
Q. Specifically early in the game because you went a long time without
getting a field goal. I should have made that clear.  
ALEX SHEEDY: Yeah, uhm, I think it just comes down to toughness. We had a lot
of open shots that we didn't knock down. We missed about seven million layups.
Yeah, we made some mistakes and needed to hit some more shots.  
I don't know if that was great defense or just bad offense. I don't know.  
  
Q. How important was it to tune out the noise? It was definitely a pro New
Mexico crowd.  
RAVEN FOX: I think we were just trying to focus on ourselves. I mean, we had
fans there, too. We weren't really worried about the crowd that much. Just
trying to focus on ourselves.  
  
Q. Alex, I'm assuming you're hoping to play, hoping there's another game,
maybe not the NCAA, but women's NIT?  
ALEX SHEEDY: Yeah, obviously this is a disappointing end to our season in
conference. But we want to advance in conference play, something we haven't
done before. So as disappointing as this loss was, we have things we can aim
for now. We have new goals we can set. We can hopefully get some games in the
NIT or something.  
This may be the end of conference, but this isn't the end for us. We're hoping
we can continue to get some wins and do maybe something else we haven't done
before.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll dismiss the student‑athletes at this time. Thank you.  
We'll continue with questions for Coach White.  
  
Q. How much was the crowd a factor? This was a real partisan crowd.  
COACH WHITE: Well, you know, we heard 'em. You know, they were loud. For me,
just being in the Mountain West, I've seen how New Mexico travels. We were
ready for that. We knew that was going to happen. We talked to our kids about
it.  
I think the biggest thing, 'cause in playing there, it was really fun. I don't
know that it was as intimidating as it was fun. It's just that we can't hear
each other a lot, whether it's even them talking to each other or me kind of
trying to call a play. I think that a little bit.  
Also, you know, they do a good job of cheering at the right times. We tried to
use our timeouts to kind of, you know, keep them down. But New Mexico made
some great plays. That's going to happen. We've got some kids that haven't
really played in a lot of these games. Other than Alex Sheedy, I mean, a
little bit from Mo, a little bit from Furr, some Rov. Those other kids, we
could tell, you know, it's a bigger stage and we've got to get used to that.  
  
Q. What did you think about what Alex was saying about getting some games
and doing something you haven't done before?  
COACH WHITE: I have a lot of respect for the NIT, been in it multiple times. I
know that the Mountain West has been successful in it. Obviously Wyoming won
it a couple years ago. Well, let's see. They won it just after I left.
Hopefully that's not the reason (smiling).  
So they've been successful.  
It's another way, also, 'cause in a year we're going to have a really young
team. We lose five seniors. It's another way to get your kids experience in
the post‑season. We'd love to do it in front of our home crowd.  
  
Q. Second half was a bit different than the first. A quick start for you in
the second half. What were some of the things you told your team at halftime
in order to start scoring more?  
COACH WHITE: Well, again, that first half, and credit to New Mexico, they hit
some really hard shots, big jumpers. We just said, Hey, we came back from a
nine‑point deficit. We've been down before, we can come back again. It's got
to be one possession at a time, but it starts with defense. That's what we
challenged them with.  
I thought we did a good job rebounding. It's just we didn't knock down some
shots. It was physical. We weren't getting some of the seams that we got the
other night. I think when you don't get what you got, then sometimes you
struggle a little bit to find that second option.  
  
Q. Would you say that despite the loss it ended on a good note, especially
offensively?  
COACH WHITE: Well, yeah, I thought we did a good job right there towards the
end. I mean, I would like to keep that score close versus having to come back
and come back, you know, come back eight points or ten points. When it was
36‑37, I felt like we were one possession away. I felt like that multiple
times this season. It's one of those things we've got to work on. Obviously it
comes on the offensive end.  
We crawled back defensively, but I felt like offensively we never really
turned the corner. We got some openings and we got some stuff to the rim, but
I think it was just a little bit too late.  
  
Q. Are you able to put the season as a whole, your first year, into
perspective?  
COACH WHITE: Yeah, this talk after this game is never one that you plan. But,
you know, there's a feeling of success. I mean, we've had some challenges.
We've come through those. We've had some great successes in a couple wins
where we won on the road. We beat Oregon. We had the 13‑win stretch. We had a
great run at home.  
If you look at it from my perspective, we were two overtimes away from maybe
being first in the league, coming in first. I mean, I feel very good about it.  
For these kids, especially kids like Ray and Alex to go through three
different coaches, to have had the success they've had, even continue to do
it, I think it's been a joy to coach them. As a new coach you're always
worried about how they will respond. But it's been a great group of kids. I'm
really, really proud of them. In all areas of their lives, academics,
basketball, all of it.  
It's been a great first year for me ‑ so far, it's not over.  
  
Q. At the start of the second half, the first 12, 13 minutes you were able
to clamp on them defensively. New Mexico then found their rhythm offensively.
What changed in the timeout?  
COACH WHITE: I thought we did a good job of getting back into it with their
pressure. I thought they broke through that pressure, got a couple fouls. They
were physical all night. I'm just going to say the No.11 kid, she's a
difference maker. It wasn't all necessarily in shots, but when she got that
open shot, they knocked it down. She was physical. She forced us to catch a
little bit deeper.  
Shumpert did a nice job. She went one for seven. Then I can't say enough about
Brown. She's got one of the best jump shots in our league. I would say, I
mean, athletically she's one of the nicest players that we have here. She's
done a great job. She's played really mature and gotten better throughout her
career.  
My hat is off to them and we wish them all the luck in the world.  
  
Q. Physical play in the game. Incredibly chippy. Speak to that.  
COACH WHITE: Anytime the game is physical early, the chippiness is bound to
come. Then all of a sudden you're looking at a team that's never lost in the
Mountain West tournament, not lost in a tournament in the last seven years.
They don't want to lose. We don't want to lose. Neither does anybody.  
All of a sudden I think it just got a little bit emotional and chippy, but I
don't think it was cheap at all.  
Our kids, they're going to go for it. They're going to win it until the buzzer
sounds.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.

_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

Boise State  76  
San Jose State - 67

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by San Jose State.  
Coach, some thoughts on today's game.  
COACH CRAIGHEAD: Tremendously hard‑fought game by both teams. Boise State made
plays down the stretch. Hit shots when they needed to. We didn't have as much
in the tank to answer.  
But extremely proud of our players and our team, and these seniors right here
who have carried us. I'm really going to miss coaching them.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. After a remarkable run and exciting two days, what do you take from this
and what did you say to your teammates in the locker room?  
REBECCA WOODBERRY: We just encourage each other, told each other we did a good
job and fought during the game and everybody put out good effort.  
TA'REA CUNNIGAN: You know, you don't want to let the younger ones see you with
your head down. Especially we do have a younger group coming in. We have some
sophomores, some juniors and a couple redshirts as well.  
Just telling the juniors who will be seniors, you know, when the time comes
around again, just be ready, have the same drive and have the same fight.  
  
Q. With the expectation so high with some of the other teams, you being able
to do what you did leading into today, what did you learn about yourselves and
about your teammates?  
TA'REA CUNNIGAN: You know, after having kind of not the season we wanted to
have, being able to come to the tournament, piecing things together, setting
new school records, being a part of this is a great feeling.  
Not really discouraged right now. More so excited that we made it this far,
especially when people said that we couldn't. Just enjoying the feeling right
now.  
  
Q. I know the game just ended, but can you reflect on the four years you had
at San Jose State.  
TA'REA CUNNIGAN: It's been a great four years. I'm really, really glad that I
chose to come to San Jose. Accomplished a lot of things personally and also as
a team as well.  
I decided to come to San Jose to turn a program around and to be a part of
something greater than myself. I feel like I definitely was able to accomplish
that being here. Even with the coaching changes, I was glad. I was sad to see
them go, but glad to see who came.  
Just really appreciated everything that was done for me. Just glad of the
things that I was able to give back to San Jose as well.  
  
Q. Looked like it was a tough day shooting from the outside. Like yesterday,
teams were manning up on you. Was that the case today?  
REBECCA WOODBERRY: You could say that. I think we struggled on spacing
sometimes. But, yes, they were playing me pretty tight, as usual.  
  
Q. This game looked like it turned in the last four minutes. They started to
score inside, get passes inside. What were the defensive breakdowns? Seemed
like most of the game you were in control.  
TA'REA CUNNIGAN: I would say playing three games back‑to‑back, that's pretty
challenging, especially after playing the No.1 seed being the second game.
Just a little bit of fatigue just kind of at the end, you know, got the best
of us.  
  
Q. During that late surge they had, did it kind of become surreal when you
started seeing them take a page out of your book from the last two days?  
TA'REA CUNNIGAN: Not necessarily, you know, because we didn't have anything to
lose going into the game. It wasn't any pressure going into this game. We came
in as the eight seed. We came here ready to battle, ready to fight despite our
seeding.  
I didn't see it as them taking anything away from us. I just watched my career
come to a nice conclusion.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.  
We'll continue with questions for Coach Craighead.  
  
Q. As tough as that loss had to be to swallow, especially with it coming
down to the end, you have to be proud of the effort they put forth and the
excitement they brought to the building the first three days of this event.  
COACH CRAIGHEAD: Definitely. They've battled from the first tip we had. I
think it was a long week for us. I thought that they stayed sharp and focused
on the first two game plans. You could see some mental fatigue today at the
end, thought there were some breakdowns.  
But, man, they sure gave it everything they had.  
  
Q. Coming in as the eight seed, there's a big challenge there facing the
number one seed. What did you learn about yourself and about your program?  
COACH CRAIGHEAD: About the program itself, I've always felt like we were a
scrappy team, that we kind of underachieved in the conference this season. We
probably felt like we were a four seed and really underachieved throughout the
year.  
So in coming into the tournament as an eight seed, we didn't care who we
matched up with. We thought we could beat anybody. Boise State had more in the
tank tonight. They made plays when they had to make plays. They're a very good
basketball team.  
As a coach, I'm pretty young in my career. I've been in these moments before.
Just I learned a lot about my players that are returning, how much I can
challenge them, what we're going to try to accomplish next season and in the
future of this program.  
We got to send off our seniors on a very high note. They feel very good about
how their career is ending. That's not always the case. I feel really good as
a coach for that.  
  
Q. Even though the season ends 20 minutes ago, is this something to feed off
of, to already start getting ready and use as a motivational tool for the
younger players?  
COACH CRAIGHEAD: Definitely, I didn't want to overload them after the game. In
the same moment that you want them to be excited about the win, you have to
let them feel the loss. There's some hurt feelings in that locker room.  
We'll get back to San Jose and just let them enjoy the rest of their time here
and just together as a team. Those younger kids, they know. They watch. They
saw the older kids. They want to make sure when they finish this thing it's in
the NCAA tournament at some point wile they're here.  
  
Q. A lot of shots that went down the last two days didn't go down today it
looked like by inches. Is it tough to keep the ladies motivated when they were
making the shot yesterday?  
COACH CRAIGHEAD: There's no lack of motivation in those guys because they
still had the guts to take the shots. You don't want to make excuses. That's
not what I'm doing here. But obviously when you miss by inches, you can just
see the fatigue.  
Then obviously if you make those shots, maybe the adrenaline and the emotion
carries you through to the end of the game.  
Boise State did what they had to do. We give them the credit.  
  
Q. It also looked like in the second half there were some missed free throw
opportunities to push the lead out or cut the lead down. Is that, again, the
fatigue?  
COACH CRAIGHEAD: Yeah, I mean, I would think so. At the same time it's a big
moment that they're in. There's more nerves. You're playing in the semifinal
game, two games away from the NCAA tournament you've probably been dreaming
about since you were a little kid. It's all of it combined.  
I think when Ta'Rea started struggling in the first half, our players watch
her, and they watch her closely. She was frustrated at times. I just tried to
remind her to have fun, don't worry about this.  
  
Q. The last three games that you won, it seemed like the bus ride over to
the arena, the ladies were laughing, joking. The bus ride over today was dead
silent. Do you think they finally realized, Hey, maybe we can do this, they
got a little bit nervous?  
COACH CRAIGHEAD: I didn't think we started the game tight at all. I actually
didn't. I thought we got tight at the end when we saw it slipping away from
us. They were focused.  
When we got into the locker room, I heard chatter. I sat up there thinking,
Why are these guys are so quiet? They were goofy, no matter what.  
It's tough to do what we were trying to do at an eight seed. There's quality
teams in this tournament, in this conference. We already knocked off number
one.  
  
Q. Now is one of the goals to get in that top five and avoid three games in
a row?  
COACH CRAIGHEAD: That's always got to be the goal. I mean, that's always got
to be the goal. That extra day helps. Especially today we couldn't press. I
was looking at them and I thought we needed to pressure. I think we would have
just given up baskets if we would have tried to do that.  
  
Q. You're losing a lot of scoring with T and with Becca. Were you happy to
see Aniya stepped up? Tonight didn't have a great night with nine points, but
the game last night, you have to find some scoring. Is it good to see that she
can step up and play that, too?  
COACH CRAIGHEAD: Absolutely. It's really good to look around the conference
and everybody else is losing people, too. We lose people, everyone losing
somebody. UNLV loses players. Boise State loses players. We all lose players.  
They've been tremendous scorers. Becca in just two years has really climbed
the charts from the three‑point standpoint, and Ta'Rea obviously is huge. But
we'll be fine.  
  
Q. Talk a little bit about Riana Byrd. Didn't have a ton of points tonight,
working on the rebounds, rejecting six shots ‑‑  
COACH CRAIGHEAD: I thought it was seven.  
  
Q. She played the same way against Colorado State and didn't get the
recognition. How did she play in this tournament?  
COACH CRAIGHEAD: I've been asking her to be our defensive anchor in the
halfcourt for weeks. She really stepped up over the last two weeks. She's been
great. She snatches defensive rebounds. She blocks shots. She's a calming
effect for our players when she's on the court because she's a pretty headsy
basketball player, knows what's going on.  
  
Q. This team struggles at home. How important was it to go on the road, win
three in a row, play Boise State down to the last second, how much confidence
does that give the team going ahead?  
COACH CRAIGHEAD: I hope it gives them confidence. You hope that's a growth
thing and we don't take a step backwards. It's a long season still until we
get back to that place. We have an off‑season. You want to see programs take
steps in the right direction and that's definitely one.

_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

New Mexico  64  
Fresno State - 53

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by New Mexico.  
Coach, some thoughts on tonight's game.  
COACH SANCHEZ: Yeah, I'd first like to congratulate Fresno State, Coach White.
She's an unbelievable coach. Her team is very, very good. Alex Sheedy is
definitely the conference Player of the Year. She's a very nice player. I
think we got a pretty good one here on my left too.  
I have a lot of respect for her and that team. It was a great game for the
fans. It was what you expect out of a two and three seed.  
You know, like they say, it's on to the next.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. You've had a hard time this tournament the last couple years, but now
you're going to the championship game. What are your thoughts?  
ANTIESHA BROWN: I think it just shows a lot about our team. We're very
determined this year. We have a pretty good group of girls this year and we're
willing to do anything and everything for each other.  
Our coaches have been great. Our scouting reports have been in‑depth to know
what we're doing to get prepared for the games.  
It shows a lot of our characters. We had a couple growing pains in the
beginning of the season. It's nothing that we couldn't handle and it just
shows off in the end.  
BRYCE OWENS: One thing that got us here was our confidence in each other. Once
we built that throughout the year, that's what got us here. I think this is a
really great game to go into the championship game. I think once we get this
day's rest, once we get our minds collected, get back together, we'll be fine.
I think as a team we're doing great.  
  
Q. In the second half the offense kind of stuttered a little bit. Talk about
the offensive series that helped push you over the top in this game.  
ANTIESHA BROWN: We just had to slow down a little bit. We had to play our
game. I think we got a little bit rattled in the beginning of the second half.  
But like I said, it wasn't anything we couldn't handle. We had to recollect as
a team. As the five on the court, we had to make some decisions on the court
to slow down the pace and recontrol that control of the game.  
BRYCE OWENS: Adding onto that, once we got into the media time‑outs, 30‑ and
60‑second time‑outs, I think it was a chance for us to recollect and refocus
on what we needed to.  
The best thing about that is we weren't rushed at any point in time in the
game. I think we stuck to our game plan and to our game, and that's what works
for us in the end.  
  
Q. Offense wasn't producing, but your defense was playing strong. How
important was that to not let them take the lead?  
ANTIESHA BROWN: Defense will always win you games. That's what we focus on as
a team, defense, defense, defense. We knew if we held them in the 50s, yeah,
we would have a good chance of winning the game.  
I think just slowing them down, slowing down Sheedy, slowing down their
guards, because they're very quick, they can get the shot off. Just slowing
them down was our key focus. Defense was our focus of the game.  
BRYCE OWENS: I think we take a lot of pride on defense. Defense is definitely
what won us the game today.  
  
Q. You open up a nine ‑point lead, the place is going nuts. They score
eight. Bryce, you hit a three. You open it up a little bit. Was there any
point where you got tight and how much did all those close back and forth
games you played the last few weeks play into it down the stretch?  
ANTIESHA BROWN: It just shows our growth. Coach said it best yesterday,
whenever we had a close game with SanDiego State. We've been in this position
so many times. It's time for us to grow and be the experienced team we've been
working on.  
Last year we didn't close out those close games. A lot of us learned from it.
We have a very experienced team this year. We took that and ran with it. I
don't think we were ever panicked during the game. Because it is a game of
runs. Fresno State is a very good team. We had to just control the pace all
over again.  
  
Q. It was real physical last night. Seemed like you got in their head, you
collectively. They were talking to the refs a lot. Was it more physical than
you expected?  
BRYCE OWENS: Are you speaking about tonight?  
  
Q. They were talking to the refs, to each other. They were frustrated.  
BRYCE OWENS: I think this was definitely a physical game. Probably not the
most physical we've seen all year, but very close. We were expecting that, so
we knew we had to get physical back with them.  
We talked to the refs, they talked to the refs. It was kind of a back and
forth thing.  
  
Q. Do you think you got in their heads at all as a team?  
ANTIESHA BROWN: I'll give credit to Fresno State. I don't think we necessarily
got into their heads. I just think we showed up today and played our game and
executed well and we won.  
  
Q. With Boise State you split in the regular season, talk about the
matchup.  
ANTIESHA BROWN: It will be a good one. We split with them in the regular
season. Boise State has a really good team, good in the post play, good
guards. I think we match up with them very well.  
If we just execute and play our game, not get too frustrated and stay
together, then we have nothing to worry about.  
BRYCE OWENS: I also think that we have to stick to what we've been doing. We
can't stray away from our game plan, how we've been playing as a team. We have
to stick together, play hard, play smart, play together as coach says every
single day. That's our key, our game plan. We have to execute, execute,
execute on offense and defense. I think it will be a great matchup on Friday.  
  
Q. A lot of Lobo fans here tonight. Did it feel like a home game out
there?  
BRYCE OWENS: Definitely. I was just saying as we were walking up here, it felt
like we were back at the Pit. Definitely great to hear that we have the fans
behind us.  
ANTIESHA BROWN: They call it Pit West for a reason. I think the fans are the
most loyalest in the country. They're wanting us to bring a championship home.
Because our guys are out now, they're rooting for us harder and harder. We're
trying not to let them down.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll dismiss the student‑athletes at this time.  
We'll continue with questions for Coach Sanchez.  
  
Q. How does it feel to be back?  
COACH SANCHEZ: It feels great. Especially with our fan base, especially with
how much we've grown as a team. I put an easy schedule together early with
Stanford and DePaul and Texas A&M.  
Last year we got beat up with it a little bit. This year we grew up with it.
Sometimes, like I said before, the journey is a lot more fun than the
destination. The journey's been a blast and it's not over yet. We're playing a
very, very good opponent. We just played a very good opponent.  
The Mountain West is no joke. We're going to be a very good conference. You
look at all the teams and who's coming back, it's going to be a fun conference
for a while.  
It feels good behind our fans to be back in the championship game. We haven't
been here since 2008. For me personally, it feels great.  
  
Q. I asked the ladies about the last seven or eight minutes where the
offense found a rhythm. What changed from the start of the second half?  
COACH SANCHEZ: I give Fresno State a lot of credit. They had a good spark in
the second half. They took us out of some things we wanted to do. We were
rushing our shots. They were physical with us. They're a very good team.  
I mean, there's no blowouts in March. We knew they were going to make a run,
and they did.  
We just settled down. The three by Brea Mitchell was huge. That was really
good. She had another good game today. Probably should have given her more
minutes. Alexa Chavez played well. Then Bryce comes down and hits a three.  
We just made the right runs at the right time. Sometimes it just works that
way.  
  
Q. Were you expecting as physical a contest with them today?  
COACH SANCHEZ: Oh, yeah, they're good. They're good. Smith in the post is
good. Sheedy in the post is good. Raven Fox is hard to guard. Collins is hard
to guard. They're a good team.  
Nobody wanted to go home today. They had a great game plan against us. Like I
said, we were just fortunate to come away with a win, hopefully get our legs
back and get Boise State and make it a great championship game.  
  
Q. How key was your defense during the period of 37 ‑36?  
COACH SANCHEZ: To hold a Fresno State team to 53 points is very good. They
didn't shoot as well as they'd like to. I mean, that's almost impossible with
a team like that.  
Shots didn't fall for them. They had some good looks. Sometimes it just
happens. I thought our defense was really good. We stuck with our game plan.  
Sometimes things just go your way. It did tonight.  
  
Q. To delve deeper into the physicality of the game, at one point it looked
like Antiesha stepped up to the bully, took it upon herself to be physical
right back, didn't step back from their bigs or anybody, countered their
physicality while everyone else offensively charged.  
COACH SANCHEZ: She's a leader. She's led this team the entire year. Like I
said, we've gone through our ups and downs this year. She's just taken this
team a lot of times on her back and has done that.  
It was good to see us punch back. I mean, we needed to. They were very
physical. They had their way with us a few times. They had a great game plan.  
Like I said, sometimes things just go your way. It was our night. It was a
great basketball game. It was a great game for the fans. Two very good teams
playing against each other.  
Like I said, we were fortunate to come away with that. Fresno is a good team
and they've got a terrific coach.  
  
Q. Obviously it was deny and then double when the ball went to Sheedy. It
got physical. I was impressed with your girls' composure. Talk about the
defense and their composure.  
COACH SANCHEZ: I don't think anybody lost composure. I don't think Fresno
State did either. I just think they were trying to survive and advance as
well.  
We know their best players. They're a good team. But Alex Sheedy is just
tremendous. She's the key. We did a pretty good job. She's 10 for 10 from the
free‑throw line. That kid finds a way to get it done. Toni Smith hit a lot of
jumpers against us at our place. We wanted to limit that. She's awful good in
the post.  
Alex Furr is a nice shooter. We limited her a little bit. Collins and Fox can
just get to the rim. They have good handles, good instincts. We didn't stop
them a whole lot. I think we fouled them too much. Fox showed you why she got
the award she got.  
Fresno State, us, Boise State, San Jose State, we had four teams left that
could win this conference, win the tournament. We were just fortunate enough
to do it.  
  
Q. To win that tournament you have one more opponent now. Talk about what
it's going to take.  
COACH SANCHEZ: Man, they're awfully good. They read each other well. They
shoot the ball extremely well. You saw that tonight when they made their run
against San Jose State. They're very confident. Their posts are very good.
Weaver is a nice player. They've got an excellent coach.  
For us, we have to lock down on defense again. We have to make sure, like
tonight, that we don't let their shooters get open looks. We have to run back
in transition.  
They really handed it to us at their place. We were up 35‑30, then the wheels
kind of fell off. It's a good team.  
We've just got to play hard and play smart and play together, you know, just
hope for the best.  
  
Q. Craig always gets a big reaction when he sports the cherry. You have the
turquoise. Any chance you might sport the turquoise again?  
COACH SANCHEZ: No. I think I sweated through this. Being a native New Mexican,
watching those old Lobo teams play, the Phil Smith, Abney, the Michael
Coopers. My dad and I used to watch the Norm Ellenberger show all the time.  
The turquoise is still part of our culture and tradition. I found this
somewhere online. Thought I'd wear it. It was good luck. Hopefully I'll have
some clean clothes tomorrow.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much, coach.  
COACH SANCHEZ: Thank you.

_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

San Jose State  64  
Colorado State - 55

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Colorado State.  
Coach, some thoughts on today's game.  
COACH WILLIAMS: Well, San Jose, they were terrific. We knew going into this
basketball game that we were going to have to play well to beat them. Their
last two games they've scored 99 points. So they surely had our respect.  
They played well today, both ends of the floor. Just not a good day to have a
bad day. We had a bad basketball game. Give San Jose State credit.  
I'm proud of my basketball team. This has been a good group. This one game
will not define them. Tough way to go out today, though.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll now take questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. As coach mentioned, you knew you would have to play well against a team
that scored 99 points in two straight games, yet they come out with a
different game plan, slowing things down. Did that throw you off a little bit?
Did you expect them to run ‑and‑gun?  
ELLEN NYSTROM: I mean, we know they're a good basketball team, so... We had a
good game plan, too. We just didn't make our shots.  
  
Q. Anything you can do to explain what happened in the first half for you
offensively? I think it was the worst shooting half all season for you.  
GRITT RYDER: No. I think, as coach mentioned, at halftime we kind of got the
jitters out, we thought. Sometimes that happens when tournament play comes.
Sometimes the first half you get nervous.  
As he said, it's very unfortunate to have a bad day like that.  
  
Q. Seemed like you needed one or two more stops in the second half. They
kept answering with every bucket.  
GRITT RYDER: Yeah, I think San Jose State did a great job at making plays when
they needed to, where we lacked it a little bit.  
I think holding them to, I don't know what the end was, but like we hold them
to way below their season average. So it wasn't necessarily the defensive end
of the floor there was a problem.  
  
Q. Ellen, how much of what happened in the first half was the way they were
defending you versus just shots not falling? Were they defending you a lot
better than maybe you had seen other times or was it just a bad shooting day
all around for you guys?  
ELLEN NYSTROM: I don't know. I don't know. I mean, they were good defensively.
But we know they can be good. They played probably their best game this year.
So, I mean, we had a bad shooting game.  
  
Q. I know it's tough right now, but how shocked are you to lose the first
game here after last year especially?  
ELLEN NYSTROM: Yeah, this is not what we expected. What's done is done.  
  
Q. How critical was that run they had at the end of the first half?  
GRITT RYDER: I think it was important for them to get on that run. I don't
know. It sucks for us.  
It happened a couple times this year. We seemed to have a problem with that
coming out again at the second half.  
But, again, like if we, I don't know, played better from the beginning, we
never would have had problems with that. It wouldn't have made a big
difference.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll dismiss the student‑athletes at this time. Thank you,
ladies.  
We'll continue with questions for Coach Williams.  
  
Q. Coach, is it surprising to you to get beat by them the way they beat you,
considering the pace they like to play usually?  
COACH WILLIAMS: I don't know. I don't know if the pace was a whole lot
different. I know the score was. It didn't feel like that to us the first
half. We felt like they sped us up and we played a little too fast, but the
score certainly didn't indicate that.  
But they were good defensively. They played us like we would probably play
ourselves, to be honest with you.  
But with that said, I mean, look at the looks we had early on. We missed
layups. We had the ball right in front of the rim a number of times with our
post play. Jamie had a couple really good looks early from the corner. We had
some things, I thought, that would have calmed us down. We needed to make some
baskets early.  
  
Q. Ellen, obviously in a losing effort, but she set a record for rebounds in
a game. Talk about her effort.  
COACH WILLIAMS: I mean, extremely competitive young lady. She's I think the
best defensive rebounder I've ever coached. Everybody was trying to win the
basketball game. Although it didn't look pretty at times, that's what we were
trying to do.  
She really competes on the glass. She's a very, very good defender. Proud of
her effort. She keeps fighting.  
  
Q. How tough is this two years in a row win the regular ‑season title and
not be able to advance to the NCAA tournament because of what happens here?
That's got to be a little bit frustrating.   
COACH WILLIAMS: Yeah, I mean, it is. I mean, I think that's why our kids are
so extremely disappointed, because they won a regular‑season title last year.
They had a shot to go to the NCAA. Didn't quite get it done in the
championship game. Played in the NIT tournament. That was great progress for
our group.  
But they knew the one thing missing on this team's résumé was that NCAA
tournament. That's why this group is, you know, and rightly so, disappointed.  
But, yeah, you're that consistent, you win the league title two years in a
row. That's a 12‑week grind. You win it two years in a row, and you don't get
to represent your league.  
Today we weren't the best team, but the last two years we've been the best
team in our league. But that's how March Madness is set up.  
But I feel for our kids. You know, as a coach, I mean, you want it so bad for
those kids. You want them to meet their goals. Came up short.  
  
Q. Do you think the fact that the season is largely defined by just this
week had a lot to do with the way they started, silly turnovers, missing some
really easy baskets?  
COACH WILLIAMS: Yeah, I don't know. You watch all these tournament games. That
beginning, you know, when you first get on that court, those first few
minutes, that nervous energy. It's kind of who can get settled down the
fastest.  
We never really did. We never really could get that game calmed down. Our
decision making was really uncharacteristic. We told our kids at halftime,
We're fine. All things new. Let's just go play Colorado State basketball. We
can win this basketball game.  
Just uncharacteristic performance. Bad day to do that.  
  
Q. Do you think it helped them any that they got that game yesterday to get
a little bit familiar with the surroundings, the environment, the fact that
it's a conference tournament? You want a bye, but at the same time that's
almost harder because you don't get the game to get settled down.  
COACH WILLIAMS: The key word is 'settled down'. It's important in a
tournament, again, to get settled, settle in.  
Yeah, they were more settled than we were. That was obvious. But we were in
that situation last year, you know, where we played an 8 seed and had a really
close basketball game. It's just we knew it was going to be a hard game.
That's a hard ask. They're coming off a really big win. They've been on the
court. They've got that tournament vibe going. We've got to catch it. And we
never did.  
  
Q. How much did it disrupt your offensive flow having to take Elin out early
when she got that second foul?  
COACH WILLIAMS: She's a very good driver. She's long defensively. She's
important to what we do offensively. So, yeah, that foul trouble did hurt us.  
I thought Alana came in and did a nice job. She got a lot of nice touches
where she's capable of scoring it, just had a tough first half finishing. At
San Jose she had 20 and caught the same spots and just converted. Tonight,
tough shooting night.  
  
Q. One of the girls had mentioned, the way she said it, Yeah, we didn't
expect it. You win at your place, their place, you're the No.1 seed. Any
chance the first 10 minutes you got caught overlooking this team?  
COACH WILLIAMS: No, not even close. You don't win two league titles by
overlooking anybody. This group respects everybody that we play.  
So no to your question.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much, coach.  
COACH WILLIAMS: Thank you.

_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

Fresno State  74  
Wyoming - 66

THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Fresno State.  
Coach, some remarks on tonight's game.  
COACH WHITE: I was pleased on how we started the game. I think it's always
nice, Alex had three threes right there in the first 10 minutes.  
Defensively I thought we struggled a little bit with some of their motion
stuff. They run it really well. Obviously Marquelle Dent, nice player, just to
be able to handle the ball.  
I was pleased with our only eight turnovers. We've been averaging a little
more than that. Forcing 14. Also down the stretch, I just thought we did a
good job. Mo did a great job down the stretch of attacking the basket, drawing
some fouls.  
I thought defensively we were a little smarter, got a couple key rebounds to
kind of push us over the top.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll now take questions for the student‑athletes.

Q. Was this Wyoming team different than what you had seen during the regular
season?  
ALEX SHEEDY: No, it wasn't any different. I think they played pretty similarly
when we were at their place.  
They're a good team. They have players that know what it is to win, so they've
got some great shooters. I think that the difference is that we just wanted it
more down the stretch.  
I think they're basically the same team they've been all year. They're pretty
tough, so I'm glad we got the win.

Q. Mo, was it just a matter of being part of the team and contributing as much
as you can?  
MORIAH FAULK: I just wanted to do whatever my team needed me to do. I came in
the game, followed the game plan. Wanted to get the win for my team. Whatever
I had to do I was willing to do.

Q. What was the pivotal point to that 14‑0 run you went on?  
ALEX SHEEDY: I think Q getting that charge was pretty big. She gets pretty
pumped up. Everyone feeds off everyone else's energy. I think the fact we all
got up, connected in that way, got positive and aggressive after that, I think
that was part of it.  
Generally we feed off each other. After we hit that three, as I said before,
we wanted it more down the stretch. I think that showed.

Q. Alex, did you expect the game to be this competitive?  
ALEX SHEEDY: Yep. Yeah, the tournament is always competitive. Wyoming is a
great team. We faced them I think this is the second time in the tournament.
We had a really competitive game at their place where it came down to the last
four seconds. We knew coming into this game it was going to be tough.

Q. It's tough to beat a team three times in one season. Did you experience
anything that this team was coming to play?  
ALEX SHEEDY: No, we were more focused on us. Honestly, it hadn't even crossed
my mind about that three times per season thing. I think at halftime we really
came together, made the decision, you know, that we wanted to win this game
and we were going to.

Q. Have you started to think about facing New Mexico tomorrow?  
MORIAH FAULK: Yeah, we've thought about it. But like Sheedy said, we're more
focused on us. If we do what we have to do, I feel like we're able to beat any
team.  
More just focused on ourselves, and whoever we are facing in the next game we
feel like we can get the W.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.  
We'll continue with questions for Coach White.

Q. At what point in the second half did you feel was the turning point?  
COACH WHITE: Well, Mileto hit that three, it can go one of two ways, to be
honest. I felt like our kids were in a zone, in a zone defense. Alex Furr came
to me and said, Coach, can we go to 51, we can do it. 51 is our man stuff. She
said, We can match.  
We had gotten hurt a little bit in the post matching. She said, We can do it.  
You know, that's a kid that's played for six years. She's been in every
championship possibly that we've had. You don't tell her no.  
We let them go back. Then right after that, Q got that charge I think it was.
I think that really did give a lot of energy because we were struggling
stopping Dent. When she got that charge, I think that really showed that, Hey,
we can stop her, turn around and come back on the offensive end.  
Then Mo attacking the basket. They were in zone at the time. I thought Mo did
a great job attacking the basket and getting some rebounds.

Q. With their big three, if you were able to shut Woodward down, how much did
that play a role?  
COACH WHITE: For them to have only made two threes, is that right, I think
that was huge for us. That was our goal initially. We gave up some twos on it.
But we took out those players that can really hurt you.  
Mileto obviously showed she could step up. Keeping them down at the
three‑point line was really key for tonight's win.

Q. We know you hate turnovers, especially when they're against you. Wyoming
went on a run in the first half. What was it that you told the team to get
them out of that funk, maintain their focus?  
COACH WHITE: We felt like we were‑‑ they weren't forcing those turnovers, we
were creating those ourselves by forcing it a little bit.  
Feel like we were rushing our offense. We talked about slowing our offense
down and continuing to run our offense. You saw Bego and Toni take a couple
high‑post shots. We wanted to continue the offense and get a little movement
in the offense. I felt we were a little stagnant in the offense.  
Defensively they're a good team. When you have that many good shooters, it's
really hard to cover everybody. I feel like they communicated really well. We
switched off on some shooters.  
I felt like if we could stay close in the first half, I was not upset with the
tie at halftime, I felt like that was where we needed to be. We had a second
half to change a couple things and come out strong.

Q. You touched after the game about Mo coming up big late. Your bench had 26
points, theirs had zero. Why was your bench so effective in this game?  
COACH WHITE: Athleticism, speed. I mean, Raven Fox is as quick as they come.
She found a couple lanes to the basket, I'm not sure how. She got through. We
spread the offense a little bit so we could drive a little bit more. That's
obviously been our strength at times.  
She found some seams and got to the rim.

Q. You probably didn't get a chance to see the game before this one, but New
Mexico won on two missed last shots from SanDiego State. What are you
expecting tomorrow?  
COACH WHITE: Their same stuff. They have been playing really good. They've
been playing good team basketball. They move the ball well. They have multiple
people that can score.  
Our challenge is going to be identifying how their individuals score and
matching up with them defensively. We always talk about the defensive end
first anyway. Then rebounding, defense, and then continuing to attack the
basket. I think that's something that we definitely have to have.

Q. Fresno State's largest lead was with a buck 14 left in the game. Is that
something you like to see?  
COACH WHITE: Absolutely. We've had those great first halves and some trail‑off
second halves. Especially right now, that's the most important time to go on
those runs.  
We had some situational stuff late. Again, we played with a guard‑oriented
lineup tonight, which is good because we haven't really done that all year.
That was nice to see.  
Wasn't impressed with our failing the three‑point shot. They could not be
impressed with it themselves.

Q. Why the guard‑oriented lineup?  
COACH WHITE: Because Wyoming has a similar guard. Jordan Kelley, when I worked
at Wyoming, she came from our camps from about 10 years old up, and she was
always a guard. We knew we could match with them if we played more guards.

Q. Fresno State has never lost a Mountain West tournament game. This is your
first experience here. What was it like?  
COACH WHITE: It was fun. I've been at the Mountain West. I was with Elaine at
Utah and Joe at Wyoming. So this is familiar for me. Being in Vegas is
familiar.  
It's fun. You know, every team is a different team. As much as the tradition
is what it is at Fresno State, this is a special team. I wasn't here obviously
in the past years, but this team really wants to win. They've really come
together in multiple ways. We have players that haven't played a lot, haven't
been in these games a lot, so we're leaning on some of those older players.
But those players that are younger are excited to be here and glad that
they're getting those opportunities.  
So it goes without saying, we don't have to say much about that, we want to
win because our goals are big. That's all we have to say.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much, coach.  
COACH WHITE: Thank you.

Fresno State  74  
Wyoming - 66

THE MODERATOR: Coach, your thoughts on tonight's game.  
COACH LEGERSKI: I thought it was a great game. Both teams in the first half
were able to get five‑point leads, and nobody was going to blink. Really
played well.  
When I look at it, we talk always about winning four‑minute segments. I
thought Fresno State made a couple more plays down the stretch in the last
three minutes of the basketball game that dictated the way the game was going
to be finished out.  
When you're down by six or seven, things are very difficult to get baskets by,
we had to do everything we could. I thought we were able to do that.  
I think the two young people sitting with me here, Marquelle and Kaitlyn,
played as well as they played all year. Kaitlyn defensively was just
relentless tonight. That's on top of playing basically 40 minutes last night.
And Marquelle is very difficult to handle in transition. She's worked hard to
improve her halfcourt game.  
So to play 80 minutes in a 24‑hour period, I really tip my hat to what they
were able to get accomplished and give us an opportunity to advance.  
I give Fresno State credit. They made some plays down the stretch that I wish
we could have had back.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.

Q. Marquelle, in the second half Fresno drew a charge on you. There were a lot
of plays there, but that seemed to change the momentum. Did you think that
changed the momentum?  
MARQUELLE DENT: I think so. Coach talks about there's not one play that just
dictates the rest of the game.  
I mean, they made a lot of good plays in the second half. We just didn't
really answer, so...

Q. Kaitlyn, what do you think the difference was offensively?  
KAITLYN MILETO: They're a very physical team. I think they just kind of
tightened that up on us. It was difficult for us to move and set screens and
stuff like that.

Q. Marquelle, how aggressive were you trying to be?  
MARQUELLE DENT: I think that's the biggest thing for me, is trying to get to
the basket, trying to find Kaitlyn and Kayla standing on the side to knock
down open shots.  
Fresno is a really good defensive team. I had an opportunity to get to the
basket.

Q. I know it's not your decision, but if post‑season basketball comes up for
this group, is that something you will embrace and something you'd still like
to do?  
KAITLYN MILETO: Absolutely. Especially as a senior, you want to keep playing
as long as possible. Putting on a Wyoming jersey, there's no other feeling
like it.  
If we can continue to play, we'll take our opportunity. If not, I love these
girls the same and I've had a great career here.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.  
We'll continue with questions for Coach Legerski.

Q. When the charge got called on Marquelle, I know you didn't like it. Did
that seem to take a lot of the steam and momentum away from your team at that
point?  
COACH LEGERSKI: I thought there were a couple plays down the stretch. They
grabbed an offensive rebound and had a second opportunity to put them up four
with three minutes to go. You have to give them credit for getting that
rebound.  
Then, like I said, whether it's a charge, block, there's plays like that all
the time. But as we look at it, one of the things we always talk about is
there are plays in any basketball game where you have to step up and make the
play.  
I thought that was the difference in the basketball game tonight. I thought
early on, Jordan Sibrel may have played the best basketball of her career
tonight, which for Jordan I'm very happy for. Then I thought Jordan Kelley,
once again, when you take a look at our roster, I have two four players
sitting on the bench in warmups, street clothes.  
We've had to use Jordan from a two forward to a four player. At four foot
nine, she's so undersized, but her heart is tremendous. For her to get a
double‑double, as I say, you look at our minutes, it's high minutes for the
two games.  
So there's a lot of things down the stretch, Fresno making extra plays.

Q. Seems like with Marquelle you seem to expect these performances throughout
the season. How aggressive was she throughout this game?  
COACH LEGERSKI: Marquelle may be the biggest competitor we have on this team.
She shows up. When she doesn't play well, like she did yesterday in the first
half, she comes back with 17 in the second.  
For her to get 26 tonight, she really stepped up and played. I like the way
she pushes the basketball. She can get to the basket. She's improved her
shooting ability. And I can't say enough about what Marquelle's meant to this
team. She is the leader of this group and she makes this team run and operate
the way Marquelle can.  
So give her a great deal of credit.

Q. You mentioned Jordan Kelley. Seems almost similar to Fallon last year. How
do you explain the results she's able to get given her size?  
COACH LEGERSKI: I think you hit it right on the head there. There's a great
desire for her to succeed. Even in that locker room after the game, she was
somebody who spoke up. I've said all along, she's kind of the glue that holds
this group together because she just does so many different things for this
team.  
As I said, tonight I thought she did a tremendous job. She has four assists,
she has a double‑double with rebounds and points. Once again, another young
lady that plays high minutes because of our situation.  
Couldn't be more proud of what Jordan's accomplished. Very happy for her to be
newcomer of the year, especially when everybody knows of the number of
surgeries that she's had on her shoulders. She missed a whole season. Had to
sit out with her transfer. It was almost three years before she was able to
step back on the court.  
I know she thought about giving basketball up. There's a great story there for
somebody who hung in there because of something that she loves. I think she
plays that way, too.

Q. I know it's not in your control, do you think post‑season will come for
this team? Do you deserve it? How do you feel about the chances of post‑season
for this group?  
COACH LEGERSKI: You know, post‑season is something other people decide for
you. You can try to put yourself in the best situation possible.  
When I look at this team, I'm proud of the fact that we had so many close
basketball games where we lost in January. We sat at 2‑5 in the conference. We
were in 10th place.  
This team could have checked in, but they didn't. They ended up winning nine
of their last 11. Came in here with a big game last night. Hard‑fought game
tonight.  
So when I look at it, we probably didn't accomplish enough to get to
post‑season play. But that's on us to try to do better that way with some of
the games. Seems the benchmark is 20 wins. I'm happy this group was able to
find a way to get a winning season because they were so far down. When you
lose the number of games we lost, it tests your spirit to pick yourself back
up and keep competing, and they did.

_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

New Mexico  57  
San Diego State - 56

THE MODERATOR: We're joined by SanDiego State.  
Coach, some comments on today's game.  
COACH TERRY: Tough one for us. I want to credit New Mexico because they played
a tough game. They're a hard team to play because not only are they athletic,
they have great shooters, they play extremely hard for 40 minutes. It's 40
minutes of hellacious basketball. They're a hard matchup because they play so
hard.  
I was really proud of our kids because I felt that they matched their
intensity. It wasn't a pretty game I think on either side of the ball. But the
effort, intensity was really fun to watch.  
I hate for us to have to end the way we did because we put ourselves in a
great position to win this game with our defense. These kids have been working
extremely hard, have battled through injuries, had battled through adversity.  
I just hate for us to lose, but proud of the season we've been able to put
together. I thought we got better as the season went on. We need a couple more
weeks, then we'd really be playing our best basketball.  
Our senior group with Erimma, Desi and K.J. are going to be missed. They've
put a lot into this program. I thought they played their hearts out tonight.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student‑athletes.

Q. In terms of this being a game of runs, how New Mexico went on one to close
the first half, you coming out in the second, back and forth. What sort of
things can coach tell the team at halftime for the way you came out?  
DESI CULBERSON: If you've watched us all year, we normally start the second
half off kind of slow. I think we made a specific effort to not start off as
slow as we normally do. We wanted to punch them in the mouth first, as we did.
I think we could have punched them a little harder. We wanted to start off
faster than we normally have. I think we were successful in that.  
AHJALEE HARVEY: Obviously with a team like this, they're a great team, they
have a great coach. We knew that it was going to be close. With the runs they
had, there were crucial mistakes we made with turnovers and rebounding.  
I think with those mistakes, if we were to eliminate them, it would definitely
be a different outcome.

Q. Can you touch on the last 42 seconds. What was the game plan? What went
wrong?  
DESI CULBERSON: It couldn't play out any more perfect. We got a layup as a
buzzer beater. That's basketball at its finest there. We just got to convert
and make it.  
AHJALEE HARVEY: To piggyback on that, I think we executed pretty well, being
able to create off of our screens, dishing it out to open players, like Desi
just said. We were just short of a basket.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.  
We'll continue with questions for Coach Terry.

Q. In your opening statement, a tough way to lose. What do you tell your
players in the locker room after this?  
COACH TERRY: I told them that I was proud of the fight. I told them in the
beginning that we need to have less quit in us today. They really put out a
great effort.  
Again, we made mistakes. I mean, both teams did, to be honest. We gave
ourselves a chance to win at the end against a very good team. That's all that
we were playing for. We knew it was going to be a dogfight. We just missed
that last shot.  
I hate it for them. I do. I hate it for them. We've been in a situation where
we've had to struggle and fight this year. We had a very tough non‑conference
schedule. This league is getting better and better. Every night you have to
bring your best effort.  
Again, I thought we grew as a team over this season as the season progressed.
We're playing good basketball right now. I hope this carries over to next
season.

Q. At the end of the first half you managed to cut it back a little bit, then
punched them in the mouth at the start of the second half, as Desi said. Talk
about the first series, how you were able to come back.  
COACH TERRY: We weren't happy going into the locker room. We felt like we gave
them too many transition buckets. That's what they do. We knew that. They did
a great job running on us. I thought they outplayed us in the first half, just
played harder than we did.  
We had a long conversation about the effort it was going to take for us to get
back in this game and win this game. Like Desi said, we have a tendency to
start slow. They made a concerted effort to come out fast. We held them to 22
points in the second half, eliminated those transition points. That gave us a
chance to cut into those leads and eventually gave us a chance to win.  
I think the key was really the offensive rebounding. They did a great job on
the glass in the second half, gave themselves second and third opportunities
to score, which put a lot of pressure on our defense.  
We would play pretty good defense for 25 seconds, they get the O board, then
we have to guard again. That's the type of coach Yvonne is. They play tough.
They're relentless on the boards. That's what's gotten them the success
they've had this year.

_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

Boise State  64  
UNLV - 46

THE MODERATOR: We're joined by UNLV.  
Coach, just some opening remarks on today's game.  
COACH OLIVIER: I think it's hard to end on this kind of note. I really
actually enjoyed this group of players. We had one run in the season. I
thought this team was always going to pull it out, they were always going to
find a way, get it done.  
Today I thought our defense was better than it's been in the last couple
games. We played good defense. Held our opponent under 35% from the floor. But
we just offensively couldn't get it going.  
You know, I thought Redmon had a really good game. She was a strong force
inside.  
But with that said, great group of seniors. Super proud of them. They're
leaving this program as young women, and they're going to be very successful.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll now take questions for the student‑athletes.

Q. Dani, they switched man coming out the second half, made a point of
emphasis of defending you. Was it frustrating with the effort they made
against you?  
DANIELLE MILLER: It's not frustrating. I feel like, you know, kind of comes
with the territory, being one of the top scorers in the conference. I feel
obviously the teams are keying in on me.  
Just got to be smarter with the ball. Had four turnovers.  
So, you know, I just feel like we could have, you know, executed down the
stretch a little better. It starts, you know, with seniors. I'll take the
blame for myself. I felt like I could have been a lot smarter down the stretch
for us and our team.  
Obviously, with being the top scorer in the conference, I feel like I'm
creating a lot of attention. I just got to find the open man, try to see a few
of my teammates down the stretch. Just came up short, so...

Q. You were up two, then they hit a 10‑point run to the half. Did you start
pressing in the second half? Was it just a matter of maybe you started trying
too hard?  
ALANA CESARZ: I don't think you can ever technically try too hard. I don't
know. We just kind of had to try to press towards the end because we were
down. I don't think anyone was trying too hard.  
But I think maybe sometimes we'd do a little too much, but I don't think we
did that tonight. I don't think we adjusted well to the defense the second
half, and like Dani said, executed well.

Q. You came out making four of your first seven shots, you were on fire. When
they switched to man, they keyed on you. How frustrating was that?  
ALANA CESARZ: It's a little frustrating not getting the clean shots in the
zone. It was a really smart move on their part to switch. I knew going into
the second half they were going to switch to man.  
Don't get as clean of looks. But, like I said, it was just smart on their
part.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll dismiss the student‑athletes at this time. Thank you,
ladies.  
We'll continue with questions for Coach Olivier.

Q. When they went on that 10‑0 run late in the first half, what were they
doing different? Were you thinking of a change in the game plan in the second
half knowing you had to switch things up?  
COACH OLIVIER: I mean, teams have been doing that to us. They play a little
zone, play a little man.  
I thought they both said what we talked about. We have to execute better. When
teams do that, we got to make sure we set better screens, have to be a little
more patient.  
I actually thought in the second half we did a good job attacking them early
on, and we were getting foul after foul after foul. We didn't really do
anything with that, you know.  
We, I want to say, picked up five, six quick fouls. We were saying to keep
attacking. We thought if we could attack, we could get to the free‑throw line.
You have to make your free throws if you get to the free‑throw line. We never
got in a groove.  
It takes a toll on your defense. If you can't get it done on offense, it takes
a toll on your defense. If you can't get it done on defense, it takes a toll
on your offense. Those droughts killed us all year.

Q. Talk about how crucial it was to get 14 trips to the line, but you only
made eight of them.  
COACH OLIVIER: I thought we got to the free‑throw line at a critical time
where we needed to get those baskets, then we could do some things different
defensively.  
I mean, we're a team that attacks the basket. We've done that all season.
We've done a really good job of getting to the free‑throw line more than our
opponents. There's some games we don't take advantage of that. If you don't
make your free throws, it's almost like a turnover.  
Alana was on fire at the beginning of the game, got some clean looks against
their zone. When a team goes man, I mean, it's just a different game. They
were very physical. They started pushing, just being more physical with us. I
didn't think we adjusted well with that.  
But we did at times, because then we started attacking the basket. You have to
make your free throws before attacking the basket.  
It was a rough game. We never got on a roll, on a run offensively,
defensively. We held them under 35% from the field. That's pretty good defense
for us.

Q. Were you surprised at all with how well Boise State rebounded?  
COACH OLIVIER: Well, you know, we're actually a good rebounding team. I feel
that we are. They beat us twice this year on the boards. We split with them in
the season. Obviously they beat us at home, we beat them at their place.  
But they beat us both times on the boards. We talked about that.  
The other thing we talked about before the game was that it's tournament time,
so the refs let you play a little. It was a little more physical. We got to be
ready for that. Let's hit them before they hit us.  
Again, I don't normally point out opponent players. But I thought Camille was
very aggressive and springy. I thought she was the difference in the game,
just her rebounding efforts.

Q. Talk a little bit about Rodriguez, eight rebounds also.  
COACH OLIVIER: Yeah, she runs things down. We talked about that for the three
days we prepped. She's a little go‑getter. We think of those balls as 50/50
balls because she usually runs down the longer ones. It just wasn't our day.
Too many times this year it wasn't our day.  
Hopefully the players that are returning understand all this. You can't wait
for tournament time and think you're going to step it up because it's not
going to happen. You can't wait for the season to step it up 'cause it's not
going to happen.  
You got to be ready to go the first non‑conference game. It's a long season.
You play 30 games.  
For us, we have a young team. A learning experience. It's hard because these
three seniors and Bri Charles included, they were special in so many ways.  
I really felt that we were going to get it together and go on a little run,
so... Disappointing.

Q. With the way the season ended, do you think that had some carryover effect
today? It looked like when you couldn't buy a shot in the second half, it was
wearing on the players a little bit.  
COACH OLIVIER: Yeah, uhm, I didn't think so. Before the game we had a good
mindset, a very refreshing, positive mindset. I think the seniors have a lot
to do with that. The young ones do. The freshmen, I mean, they're good.
They're going to be really, really good. We have a good mixture of
upperclassmen and new players.  
I didn't think so, to be honest. I didn't think so. I thought we were flat,
which was weird to me because it's tournament time. I get all fired up when I
hear the bands. The electricity in Thomas& Mack I absolutely love. Vegas in
tournament time, there's nothing like it. I've been in a lot of tournaments in
my career.  
Mountain West Conference does such a good job with the basketball tournament,
such a big event. Everyone takes so much pride. I just felt like we were going
to step up and do what the Mountain West does. Thought we could have competed
a little better.  
Again, we're a team. If things don't go our way, we get a little down about
it. You can't do that in life. So it's a life lesson.

Q. Except for last year, a series of one‑and‑outs in this tournament.  
COACH OLIVIER: I know.

Q. How frustrating is that?  
COACH OLIVIER: I can't even go there. Again, I think I have a group, a really
good group, of people. I think my coaches work incredibly hard. I have a great
staff. I have a very supportive administration. I truly believe UNLV has it
going on. We got it going on. Now we got to get it right.  
I know people think it's our home court. It's really not. I think that's the
hard part. I had players going to classes today. I had players that missed
shoot‑around because they had a lab. You know, I think that's hard for UNLV.
It's probably hard for the men.  
Sometimes it's good to be in a hotel and you're just doing your own thing,
you're in your own little pod. I think that part is hard.  
But I love that it's here. I love what we do. I love what the Mountain West
does. I think they do an incredible job. It's better than any tournament that
I've ever gone to. We've got to figure this out and not be one‑and‑done
because it's really, really old.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.

_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

New Mexico  57  
San Diego State - 56

THE MODERATOR: We are joined by New Mexico.  
Coach, just some thoughts on tonight's game.  
COACH SANCHEZ: First, I want to congratulate SanDiego State on a terrific
year. I have a lot of respect for Stacie Terry, I think she does things the
right way.  
I credit them. They took us out of a lot of things we tried to do. That's a
very good basketball team. That's a very good coaching staff.  
What a great game for the fans. This is what tournament time is all about. Our
fans were terrific. I give them a lot of credit for creating an atmosphere
like the Pit. We were fortunate. We were fortunate to come away with that.  
Now it's time to see what's next.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student‑athletes.

Q. A lot closer game than the two regular‑season games. What was the
difference they did to make this one closer?  
ANTIESHA BROWN: I mean, it's called March Madness for a reason. You can't look
back on what you've done in January or February. You know, it's a completely
different season. Every team starts out 0‑0\. I just think we can't take
anything for granted. We can't look back on what we've done a month ago and
what they've done a month ago. We're both two completely different teams.  
I think we came into the game with that mindset knowing we could possibly face
anything, so...  
BREA MITCHELL: Coach told us before the game it was going to be a grind, there
are no blow‑outs when it's tournament time. We knew it was going to be a
grind.

Q. You had a hard time last season closing out these close games. You
rectified that. What is different about closing out games?  
ANTIESHA BROWN: We've grown up. We've worked on things. We've taken every
lesson that we possibly could from last year.  
Our freshmen got an amazing chance to go to Italy with us, kind of learn the
pace of the college game. I think that is what helped us out, building that
team chemistry, not looking down on each other or any of our opponents. We
stick together, do what we have to do, get stops on defense, execute on
offense, close out games.  
We have to know time, score, situations, but we can't panic.

Q. Seemed to be a game of runs. What were you told at halftime to possibly
prepare for coming out the gates?  
BREA MITCHELL: Halftime we just wanted to focus on defense and rebounding,
just keeping the energy high. Runs are going to go back and forth.  
The team that rebounds and plays the best defense and works the hardest
usually comes out with the win.  
ANTIESHA BROWN: SanDiego State, they're a long, athletic team. We know this.  
They got a lot of drives to the basket, more than what we wanted, in the first
half. We had to contain the drives. They were getting a lot of points in the
paint. Most of them were layups.  
Whenever we tried to kind of slow them down a little bit on that, it kind of
worked in our favor. Other than that, we had to execute our end, rebound, run
the floor, push it if they were getting a little tired and fatigued, because
they have one game over us. You know, just do what we can.

Q. Seemed to be a physical game. You got 12 second‑chance points to one for
them. Do you feel from a physical standpoint, were you expecting it to be that
physical, and how did you do in the physical game?  
ANTIESHA BROWN: We really didn't know what to expect. Like I said, it's March.
Our posts did a fantastic job of staying mentally in the game and physically
in the game. They got beat up a lot. SanDiego State posts, those are some big
girls. They're very strong, they're very athletic. Our posts took a lot of big
hits for us. That's a sacrifice we make for each other. We're willing to run
through a wall for each other and I think the posts took a big load off of
that.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.  
We'll continue with questions for Coach Sanchez.

Q. Would you expect anything less than a tight game?  
COACH SANCHEZ: I told them at the end of the game, I said, You guys have done
this all year long. We've won close games. We grew up a little bit. I grew up
a little bit.  
It's a fun and a very, very special group. I told them that the last timeout,
there were 14 seconds left, 14.3, I said, You guys have won games like this
all year long. You can't expect anything less. Get out there with confidence,
scramble around, do what you need to do, it will go your way.  
We were very fortunate. It's a very good SanDiego State team we beat.

Q. Can you talk a little bit about Cherise's play coming home. Almost like she
set the tone for you.  
COACH SANCHEZ: Cherise has been like that all year long. We went and played at
Wyoming, she scored the first six points. We were a little stagnant in the
beginning.  
Cherise is, and is going to be, a phenomenal player. She's even a better
person. She's long, confident, she can handle the ball, shoot it, take it to
the basket, like you saw. We were very fortunate to get her out of Las Vegas.
I'm glad she's wearing cherry and silver because I definitely wouldn't want to
play against her.

Q. I can't imagine you could overlook anything with the season you've had.
No.1 seed loses earlier. You're coming off some awards, some recognition.
You're in an unfamiliar place of getting a lot of attention and praise after a
slow start to the season. Did you worry about overlooking an opponent a little
bit?  
COACH SANCHEZ: No. We know better.  
We were picked ninth. We were 1‑7 at one point. We know better than to
overlook anybody.  
Your opponent played on this courtone time and we hadn't. That's a little
nerve‑wracking. The first game of the tournament, this was our first game, is
always a tough one.  
I look back at the history. I've been at New Mexico 15 years, SanDiego State
one. I've been here the whole time. You see that first game. I remember when
Colorado State beat Utah the year that everybody wanted to change seeds and
brackets, everything like that. It happens. It happens.  
When you see as much basketball as we've seen, you don't ever overlook
anybody. You just have to stay focused, play. You're going to have games like
this. You just have to be ready for them.

Q. Since you've been around the program so long as an assistant and now head
coach, how does this compare to some of the other teams you've been around?  
COACH SANCHEZ: It's hard to compare. It really is. Each team was so unique.
We've had some very good teams here. We've had some very good players here.  
This team is built like some of those teams being long, being athletic, having
an inside presence, having an outside presence.  
It's really hard to compare some of those teams. I think, like I told them
before, they have a chance to be a special team. Our journey has been
fantastic. Sometimes you don't want to get to the destination because your
journey's so much fun. We're still on our journey. Hopefully we can be on it
for a while.

Q. I know this game just happened, but in your processing will you have a
chance in the next few minutes to think about tomorrow's opponent? How do you
match up with Fresno State or Wyoming?  
COACH SANCHEZ: They're two tough teams. They're two difficult teams.  
Fresno State is just very good. They've got an inside game, outside game.
Sheedy and Smith are phenomenal players. Collins does a great job of forcing
tempo and getting to the hole. Huff [sic] does a great job if she's hitting
threes, they got Fox off the bench. That's a really good team.  
The week before we played Wyoming, I saw them beat UNLV 99 to I forget what it
was. We had just lost to UNLV. I'm like, Oh, great. I know what they can do
with Woodward, Dent, and Mileto. Rader can get in there if you let them throw
lobs.  
It's two different teams in some respects, but we've got to be ready for
anything. We'll sit and watch. Trust me, on the way here, I've already
processed it, figured out what we need to do, not do. Kids will get back and
get some rest. We have to be ready for tomorrow. This is going to be another
great game with Fresno and Wyoming. We'll see what happens.

Q. Cherise starts quick, Tiesha. Alexa Chavez seemed to be one player
throughout the game that came up with big plays. Talk about her game.  
COACH SANCHEZ: Alexa does that all year long. She's kind of a silent assassin.
She had eight rebounds, seven points, three assists, zero turnovers, two
steals. She's always in the mix of everything. There could be three or four
black jerseys, then you see little Alexa battling her tail off. She's done
that for us all year. Her and Khadijah both. It was very, very physical. They
had to do what they had to do to get in there and get rebounds.  
On their ball screens, she's the one that had to help off Fort and all those
quick guards. Harvey had a great game. She's a nice player. Alexa did a nice
job of trying to contain it.  
Like I said before, we played a very good SanDiego State team.

_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

San Jose State  64  
Colorado State - 55

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by San Jose State.  
Coach, some thoughts on today's game.  
COACH CRAIGHEAD: A great defensive effort from my team when the offense wasn't
clicking. A very good basketball team that we just beat in Colorado State. We
also out‑rebounded them. We won a different way than we normally win. I'm just
so excited and proud of this group. I can't wait to keep coaching them.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. In the first half your defensive effort really sort of took precedent to
what is normally an explosive offensive game. Is there a point that it all
kind of clicked for you?  
TA'REA CUNNIGAN: Yeah. I mean, in the second half. In the first half, we just
kept telling ourselves, We'll win any way we can. If it means it's going to be
an all‑defensive game, we'll take it. We were having a tough time in the first
half with our shots falling. We didn't let that concern us, just focus on
defense.  
  
Q. Your offense scored 99 points two straight games, then it slowed down in
the first half. Second half out of nowhere it started picking up. Once that
happens, what kind of confidence took place and momentum for you, especially
playing against the No.1 seed?  
ANIYA BAKER: No, we just decided to play together, play hard. Coach always
asks us to push the ball. We just try to have fun, set the pace and keep it
there.  
  
Q. It was 19 ‑16 with two minutes to go. You hit some shots. Seemed to me
that was the turning point. You controlled the game. How big was that? It
looked like it was the same thing you did yesterday.   
ANIYA BAKER: So big. Coach JC has a lot of confidence in us. She always gets
on us, but it's all for the best.  
Once she has that much confidence in us, then there's no way we can't succeed.
It's just fun to play together.  
  
Q. Tea, it seemed like down the stretch it was clutch shot after clutch
shot. You came out in the start of the second half and scored the first seven
points for the team, down the stretch it was a lot of the two of you. How
critical were those shots?  
TA'REA CUNNIGAN: They were huge because we know they were going to come out
looking to go on a run. They're a great basketball team. They can really shoot
from all five positions.  
We just wanted to make sure that we just stayed solid on defense and kept
moving the ball on offense to get the best look we could.  
  
Q. What was the defensive plan, to try to stop the penetration and the kick
‑out?  
TA'REA CUNNIGAN: It was to try to stop everything. Like I said, they're a team
that they can score inside, they can score from the outside. The one through
five are solid shooters.  
We just wanted to play solid defense, help, and be ready to close out on solid
shooters.  
  
Q. You're a team that's known for scoring points. Is there a certain amount
of pride in showing people one day you can score 99 points and another day you
can grind it out?  
ANIYA BAKER: Pretty much, yeah. That's what we try to do. We just try to play
together, push the tempo, play together. No matter what happens happens. No
matter the score, we just want the win.  
  
Q. How much did it help you to have gotten a game under your belt on the
court and have a chance to play?  
ANIYA BAKER: It really helps a lot. We're trying to win as many games as
possible. Our main goal was the championship. We weren't stopping because they
were the No.1. We were playing together, hard and having fun.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. We'll continue with questions for Coach
Craighead.  
  
Q. Yesterday we talked about how after such an explosive game, you're going
to have to sit back and maybe reassess how you may approach this game. What
sort of things did you think about pregame, as the game progressed did you
make some changes or adjustments or just go with the flow?  
COACH CRAIGHEAD: We lost to Colorado State on the road by 20, then by 10 at
home. We thought we started to figure them out a little bit.  
They're a really good basketball team, the best team we've played this season.
We thought that we could maybe take away a few things defensively that we
didn't at home. We didn't play them that long ago.  
We switched some of their handoff dribble‑drive action, that allowed them not
to get into the corner and into the paint. We really tried to stay home on
shooters and not hold off. We thought if they got hot from the three‑point
line, it could be a really long night.  
Our defensive effort was huge. Offensively, they send four back on the shot
they take, so transition‑wise it's really difficult. But we hit huge shots
when we had to. We stuck with the game plan that we had from the tip. Play
solid defense. We were going to have to play defense to beat these guys.  
We're good enough to compete with everyone. We can mix it up, like everyone
has said.  
  
Q. You were on average to score 38 points for the ball game. Was there some
shocking moments from you, any concern with how slow the pace was going?  
COACH CRAIGHEAD: No concern because it was tied at 16‑16\. I sat them down in
the timeout. They looked worried offensively. We get worried because we rely
on our offense.  
I said, Why are we worried? It's a tied basketball game, it's like we just
tipped off. We went on a run. When they saw the ball go down a few times at
halftime they were all pumped up. They knew they had to play 20 more minutes.  
We talked about there couldn't be an ounce of doubt in us that we were going
to win the basketball game. They gutted it out offensively and defensively.  
  
Q. Is this the biggest win for this program in maybe history?  
COACH CRAIGHEAD: I would think so maybe. Yeah, absolutely. Haven't been here
that long. A pretty big win. This conference is a tough conference. To take
down a team, I mean, they only have three losses, they were undefeated last
season. Sorry, four. We didn't count the one at home. We thought we won
because we only lost by 10.  
They're hard to guard defensively, they have shooters, a post inside, can hurt
you in so many ways. It's huge. We're not done, though. We're going to keep
playing, keep battling, keep competing.  
  
Q. Talk about the first half defensively. That's about as bad as they've
played offensively all season. They shot under 20%. What were you doing to
them to make them shoot that low?  
COACH CRAIGHEAD: We really try to take away the things they got the last time
we played them, which is the penetration inside. We kept leaving shooters when
we played at our place. We thought if we could stay home on 5 and 14, it would
take away some offense. We didn't rush out on kids that wanted to drive and
get into the paint.  
We had a good game plan. I said before the game, Players make plays and
execute game plans. We can say a lot of things in the locker room and in
practice, but they've got to go out and execute, and they did.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much, coach.  
COACH CRAIGHEAD: Thank you.

_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

Boise State  64  
UNLV - 46

THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Boise State.  
Coach, just some general thoughts on today's game.  
COACH PRESNELL: I was really proud of our players. I thought they were
physical and aggressive. I thought they did a great job of rebounding the
ball. When we played them and got beat in Boise, they were very physical
rebounding the ball against us and we really struggled. I was really pleased
with that.  
I thought our coaches, Coach Sower did the scout and Coach Smallwood with our
different defenses for Miller, I thought, was outstanding.  
It was a great team win for us. It's a great win because it's our 20th win of
the season. We're excited to win and advance.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student‑athletes.

Q. The rebounding, how big of a focus was that for you?  
MIQUELLE ASKEW: It was huge. We've been talking about that for the last week.
It was on the scouting report. We've been practicing it. It was a huge key to
this game.

Q. How did it feel to put together a game like that in this tournament? How
big was it for you to win this game and get rolling?  
YAIZA RODRIGUEZ: I think it was a great game. Last year we came here, were
expecting to win. We had only the first game.  
So I think we change our minds this year. Right now as a team, we know exactly
what we want. We want to leave Friday with the championship, so...

Q. The defensive effort as a whole for this team today seemed like it was
good, even when you were struggling to get baskets offensively.  
YAIZA RODRIGUEZ: Well, in defense, it's one thing that the team has been
struggling a little bit. But it's the championship tournament, so we want to
win.  
So we're going to do whatever it takes to win. I think, like, everyone's going
to help each other. In defense, we know exactly what we need to do now.  
I know, like, I'm going to have help from my teammates. So defense is going to
be the most important thing for our team to win a championship.

Q. What can you say about your team when they don't shoot particularly well?  
MIQUELLE ASKEW: Because we all rebound. We've been working on defense. We know
where we're supposed to be. We're trying to do the right thing.  
It doesn't necessarily take everyone to be 20‑point scorers, as long as we all
play together and play well.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.  
We'll continue questions for Coach Presnell.

Q. When you look at Yaiza's stat line, flirting with a triple‑double the whole
night, to have that from a girl that is 5'5", impressive?  
COACH PRESNELL: Yeah, she's done a nice job in her career here. She was
freshman of the year last year in our conference. She's played so much
tournament international basketball. She's been on the Spanish 16, 17, 18,
last year on the 20. In the summertime she's playing a lot of basketball at a
very high level.  
Tonight I wasn't surprised, but I was excited for her. The eight rebounds,
we've already given her a bad time about that. She's very clever. If you don't
pursue the ball, she'll get it. She'll get the ones that don't come right to
you.

Q. The defensive effort, there were stretches where the offense couldn't seem
to buy a bucket. What worked so well tonight for you?  
COACH PRESNELL: I think the last three or four minutes of the first half, we
got some confidence. The hoop had really shrunk on us. We created some
separation.  
Defensively I thought then we kind of settled down. We've had such a point of
emphasis in the first five minutes of second halves that we've played poorly
all year. I thought defensively our kids knew what they did. We switched it
up, we went from zone to man at the beginning of the second half to try to get
them more active. Obviously had to keep your hand up on Miller. We ran about
three different defenses the whole second half.

Q. It seems like every team has played zone against UNLV. You mentioned going
to man. Do you think you confused them when you did that?  
COACH PRESNELL: I don't know. It was more I think about us, just getting us
active in the first of the second half. We had to know where Miller was all
the time. I'm going to get her name wrong, but Cesarz tore us up up in Boise.
That's kind of why we wanted to play zone in the first half. That put her in
the high post area rather than running a pick and pop on the wing and killing
us.

Q. The rebounding again, more thoughts on how well the team rebounded today.  
COACH PRESNELL: Camille was a huge factor, had 12 boards. We don't have very
many people like her in Boise, 6'4", 6'5", that play around the rim. I thought
she was aggressive. She's one of the kids we know before the game even starts
she's going to give us everything she has. So I thought she was a huge factor.  
Then obviously you're not always counting on your point guard to get eight
rebounds. It was a point of emphasis but she still got them.

Q. For the team to be in this position going to the semifinal, the last two
years have been tough, to get this thing going a bit...  
COACH PRESNELL: Tomorrow will be an interesting game. Jamie Craighead, the San
Jose coach, was my assistant coach for three years. It will be interesting
playing against her.  
We split this year. When they beat us, they beat us good, it was hard to shake
her hand afterwards.  
But I'm excited for her. She's a wonderful person. Hopefully we'll be ready to
play tomorrow because they're playing at a real high level right now,
especially running the ball, then shooting the three. It's pretty awesome what
they're doing.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much, coach.  
COACH PRESNELL: Thank you.

### [Jerry Finkbeiner](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26597)

### [Funda Nakkasoglu](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28447)

  
_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

San Jose State  99  
Utah State - 85

  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by Utah State.  
Coach, some general remarks on today's game.  
COACH FINKBEINER: First two times we played them, played them the first time
at their place. Really a squeaker. We didn't have Funda, our leading scorer.
Got beat in the last 30 seconds. Second game at our place, we controlled the
tempo very well. Won at our place.  
I knew it was going to be a close game today. I think the first two games we
were happy with, versus this game we were frustrated with, was the tempo of
the game they totally controlled.  
I think we had a false sense of security when we got an early lead, it was
going up and down that we could play this style for 40 minutes.  
We went through a stretch of four or five turnovers, one traveling, that
changed the momentum abruptly about nine minutes to go in the first half. We
never could gain control after that.  
We made two good stabs in the second half to cut it to five. But we put a lot
of energy into it. Their kids came back and hit another three and another
three. Buried us the two times we made stabs in the second half.  
San Jose State played a really good game from the shot. I thought the second
half they shot so early. If they were to have missed those things, might have
given us an open door, but they were making them. Door was never truly open.  
Proud of these two players, Tilar Clark, led us in statistics. We're a young
team, I think it showed today in some of the decisions we made.  
San Jose State is a very scary first‑round opponent. This is the reason. If
they're on, they can beat anybody in the conference. If they're off, they
struggle.  
Today they were on. We tried. We tried to put a hand in the face. Cunnigan and
Woodberry, they had really good games.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll now take questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Funda, had to be frustrating for the effort you put in. As far as your
numbers are concerned, 26 points, leading the team, 100% from the free ‑throw
line. In trying to keep up, as coach said, in their long‑range game, did that
become frustrating and wear on you down the stretch?   
FUNDA NAKKASOGLU: I think we've had a lot of games like this. It comes down to
mental toughness, I guess. We've got to keep, you know, working on that as a
few seasons come by.  
It does get frustrating. You have to kind of let it go, find other ways that
you can score, other ways that you can transition break into what you want to
do.  
I mean, I give so much credit to San Jose and their game plan tonight. It did
wear us down a little bit, yep.  
  
Q. For a while you were effective in terms of finding the ball inside either
with a drive or getting the ball down low. You went to the free ‑throw line 27
times, hit 26 of them. Yet they still keep coming back. Tijana, their game
plan, how they were able to counter everything you did...   
TIJANA DJUKIC: I think they had a really good shot. They kept making them. We
couldn't keep our emotion up, keep our energy up. We fell down and couldn't
get it back up.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. We'll continue with questions for Coach
Finkbeiner.  
  
Q. You talked about contesting Woodberry's shots. Were you okay with what
you were able to do with that or did you lose her a couple times?  
COACH FINKBEINER: Probably the inside information, we have really good
scouting reports on San Jose State. We both came from the WAC. We know these
kids. Coach Jamie does a really good job with them.  
Our biggest surprise on how our three, four and five players didn't execute
the game plan. Even at halftime I reminded them, any three‑point shooter, if
they get the shot off, we're not playing the three‑point shooter.  
They shot 35 threes. Probably 35 threes weren't contested to the level our
scouting report had us do it. That's frustrating.  
Our three, four and five players, probably security, safety, trust in the game
plan thing failed. This isn't the first time. This is one of the weaknesses of
our team this year. Really has to do more with the upperclassmen than the
younger players, is the execution of the game plan. There shouldn't be this
many surprises, in our opinion, that they shot that many.  
Woodberry is a very good three‑point shooter. Eight for 11. That shows me
she's out of her mind or we didn't execute defensively. Probably a combination
of both. She played really well. A couple of girls on the bench weren't in the
game because Woodberry was getting shots that in our mind weren't contested
close enough.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much, coach.  
COACH FINKBEINER: Thanks.

_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

Wyoming  70  
Air Force - 48

  
THE MODERATOR: We're ready to begin with Wyoming.  
Coach, some general comments on tonight's game.  
COACH LEGERSKI: Hard‑fought basketball game tonight. Both teams were out
competing and never seemed to be a real flow to the basketball game.  
In the second half, we talked about coming out after halftime and winning the
next four minutes. And to Air Force's credit, they did that.  
Then in the next four‑ to six‑minute segment, I think they made six of seven
shots. We just matched it. They ended up getting our 17‑point lead cut down to
11.  
Then I thought Marquelle Dent's four‑point play was as big a play as there was
out there. She ended up getting that lead back up to 14 points, gave us a
little more breathing room.  
You take a look at the stat sheet, I thought Kaitlyn got us off to a great
start shooting threes. Kayla was solid throughout the whole evening. And then
I thought Marquelle's second half was tremendous. Kaylie Rader gave us a great
lift off the bench. Throughout the whole game to have four players in double
figures, we needed each and every point.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. You got off to a good start. How big was that?  
KAYLA WOODWARD: That always helps to get the lead right away. It gets all the
nerves out.  
Obviously it showed, we were a little nervous at the beginning. But we got it
together in the second half, handled their run in the second half, too.  
  
Q. In the second half they did go on a little bit of a run. Did they do
anything different? Coach said they won those first few minutes.  
KAYLA WOODWARD: I just think they're always going to fight. We knew they were
going to have a little push in the second half.  
We still played tough defense, stopped their run, I guess.  
  
Q. Marquelle, tons of assists for you guys throughout this game. How big was
it to penetrate the way you did and dish off to people around the rim?  
MARQUELLE DENT: That's huge. That was one of our biggest things we talked
about before the game is we like having a lot of assists on field goals. So
that's great for us.  
Obviously people were knocking down shots. But to penetrate and pass out to
people who are knocking down shots are huge for us.  
  
Q. Kayla, what was the focus defensively?  
KAYLA WOODWARD: We knew a few of their players can shoot really well. We had
to get out on their three‑point shot, take control of their drive.  
They have some tall girls, so we had to help out in there. Overall I think we
played some pretty good defense and stopped them.  
  
Q. You have this first game out of the way. You have a big test against
Fresno tomorrow. Do you have a game under your belt, do you feel like the
nerves and all that is out of there?  
MARQUELLE DENT: Yeah, I think so. I mean, it's nice just to get out and play.
Obviously we talked about the first half, we definitely had a little bit of
nerves. That's going to be good for us going into the next game knowing we can
shoot here and all that kind of stuff.  
  
Q. Kayla, four ‑year all‑conference honor. Two years in a row pre‑season
Player of the Year. In the end they honor somebody else. Any kind of chip on
your shoulder to come out and prove something?  
KAYLA WOODWARD: Not really. Pre‑season Player of the Year is a huge honor. If
you don't get it in the end, it's all right. I have great teammates, too. It's
nice, if we win the Mountain West championship, I think that's a bigger award.  
  
Q. I know you're an elementary school major. After four years, everything
you've been through, no matter how this season ends, what sort of lesson will
you learn and take to your major?  
KAYLA WOODWARD: I just think it's been a great ride. You learn how to just
relate to so many people. You make great friendships. It's so much fun to be
around players that are like Marquelle.  
You learn how to talk to people, be around. Teammates, you get to relate to
them, see how they play, see how they are as people. I think being an
elementary teacher, I think it's fun to see how that is, too.  
  
Q. Marquelle, how does Kayla bring the rest of the team up? What have you
learned and been inspired by her?  
MARQUELLE DENT: I think the biggest thing is she's always having fun on the
court and off the court, too. She keeps everything pretty light.  
I think that helps us a lot. We try not to get too frustrated on the court.
She's just a great leader. That's about it.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.  
We'll continue with questions for Coach Legerski.  
  
Q. You mentioned Kaylie Rader's play off the bench. Air Force isn't the
biggest team you're going to face. How big of a game is that for her getting
post play like that?  
COACH LEGERSKI: It's something throughout the whole year that I think our post
play has been very good defensively, and we're a very perimeter‑oriented team,
one specifically with the motion offense. It really helped us to have the play
of Kaylie and Jordan Sibrel.  
When you take a look tonight, the two combined, they were 8‑13, 17 points. You
look at it and go 13 rebounds. That's a double‑double out of a position.  
I thought both of them played extremely well. Kaylie gave us a bigger lift
with some of the baskets. We were able to find her in transition.  
  
Q. At one point you had 12 assists on 14 field goals. When your team is
driving like that, how important is that for your offense?  
COACH LEGERSKI: That's our game. We like Marquelle getting to the basket. When
she has that opportunity, I trust the decisions that she makes. We ask her to
make those decisions.  
In the first half I thought she showed nerves, dribbled the ball off her foot
one time, had more turnovers in the first half than points.  
But she came out in the second half and stepped up like the all‑conference
player she is. Made great decisions, was able to make big shots.  
  
Q. You mentioned that stretch where Air Force was hitting pretty much
everything in the second half. Did you change anything where you were able to
hold them off there?  
COACH LEGERSKI: What we talked about during the second media timeout is it was
a push score‑wise. We were matching them. Not to get frustrated in what we're
doing. Everybody is going to make shots, going to make a run.  
Then we changed up some of the things we wanted to do defensively with the
on‑ball screen. I thought that gave us a little breathing room.  
As I mentioned, Marquelle's four‑point play. When you take a look at it, we
missed two shots in that possession, and Jordan Sibrel gave us an extra
rebound and so did Jordan Kelley, then Marquelle hits her shot.  
Getting those second opportunities I thought was big tonight.  
  
Q. To get this first big game, get the jitters out of the way, how big was
this? What will be the challenges tomorrow night?  
COACH LEGERSKI: This team's had a tough year. When I look back at all the
close games that we lost in January, we were 2‑5 in conference play, and they
fought back and won 9 of the next 11 basketball games. So they came back. They
never gave in.  
I knew tonight was the same thing. They had to step up and be able to play.
There's going to be shaky points throughout.  
The big challenge for us is always going to be that we do not have a great
deal of depth. I have two forwards that are out for the season, one with a
broken thumb and one with an ACL injury that we really were counting on. We've
had to use Jordan Kelley, a two guard, at the four all year. We know we're
out‑manned. Yet this team doesn't give in.  
It's going to be important for us to try to get off to a good start against a
very good Fresno team and try to do well on the glass. But most importantly we
got to make shots. So a big challenge for us to come right back within 24
hours and play again.  
  
Q. Marquelle said Kayla makes it fun for everybody on the court. It seemed
at a certain point, they were having fun. They kept it serious, kept the task
at hand. How do these two leaders make it easier on you?  
COACH LEGERSKI: One of the things we talked about was to enjoy the moment.
This is the only chance you get with this group of young people to be
together. There's a different team, a different mix next season. There was a
different group last year.  
So to enjoy this opportunity that you have with your friends, your teammates.
We talked about the bench doing that as well as the players on the floor.  
You can see how much fun Marquelle has when she's out there. Anybody that can
get up and down the court like she does, she can get to the rim, she can make
shots, she finds players for assists, and that energizes everyone.  
I think it's very important never to lose sight of that.  
I always tell them, 25 years from now, nobody is going to remember if you won
or lost, but you're going to remember good times you had with friends. And I
think these two take it to a different level for this team.  
  
Q. It always helps as a coach if their point guard or team leader is an
extension of the coaching staff on the floor. Is it both of them?  
COACH LEGERSKI: It's both. They bring different components to this team. Kayla
is a shooter, a rebounder, very humble. Marquelle is a little outgoing, has a
little more fun, a little more of the flash. I think you see that with them.  
Coach Legerski doesn't have much flash to his game anymore (smiling). When you
take a look at them, I think they help this group out just the way both of
them are.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much, coach.  
COACH LEGERSKI: Thank you, everyone.

_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

San Jose State  99  
Utah State - 85

  
THE MODERATOR: We're going to begin with San Jose State.  
Coach, if we could start with you, just some remarks on today's game.  
COACH CRAIGHEAD: We shot the ball really well. That's probably the biggest
three‑point, you know, shooting night we've had since Friday, so it was great.  
When we're clicking and Becca is hitting shots, Tea is getting to the rim,
getting pull‑up jumpers, it makes our offense so much easier. It loosens the
shoulders of all of our bench players. It was a tremendous performance by two
seniors and a great team effort.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll now take questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Rebecca, you got down early, 22 ‑11\. At whatever point it just clicked
and you turned it on. At some point does it trigger in your head to take the
game over?   
REBECCA WOODBERRY: I wouldn't say to take the game over. I think our offense
moved the ball well so we were able to get open shots. It was easy to make
shots.  
  
Q. Rebecca, do you like the air in Las Vegas?  
REBECCA WOODBERRY: I like tournament time (smiling).  
  
Q. When you get started with something like that, can you start feeling it,
you want the ball?  
REBECCA WOODBERRY: Yeah, you could say that. I starts to feel good and it
feels like my next shot is going to go in.  
  
Q. Tea, it looked like you started out on Funda. Was that the plan?  
TA'REA CUNNIGAN: Yeah, it was. But I picked up those two quick ones and had to
switch to man after that.  
  
Q. Is this the time of year where you say, If I want to keep playing, I have
to take over and do what I got to do to keep playing?  
TA'REA CUNNIGAN: Yeah. Us being the two seniors, we've been here in this
position. I was here last year and it didn't end the way we wanted it to.  
Now it's just being mature and finding the ways to finish and close out games.  
  
Q. At a certain point, when you get the hot hand, you start getting in a
flow, coach just let you run with it or is there a game plan in place at all
times?  
TA'REA CUNNIGAN: We all actually have the green light, if we want to take the
first open shot, that's always been our game plan every game in. When we get
going, we start sharing the ball and moving the ball and everybody starts to
heat up.  
  
Q. Rebecca, you were down by nine. Was there ever a time you were
concerned?  
REBECCA WOODBERRY: We were focused on keeping up the pressure, not worrying
about the score, just playing our game, following our game plan.  
  
Q. What has been the key for the last couple days? Seems like your offense
has been clicking at an astronomical rate.  
REBECCA WOODBERRY: The key, like I mentioned earlier, was just for us to move
well on offense and get better spacing. We've been really practicing our
spacing in our practices, so it's helped a lot.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. We'll continue with questions for coach.  
  
Q. Coach, fairly early on Utah State was shooting about 67%, you were down
by nine. What was the thought process?  
COACH CRAIGHEAD: When we were down 20‑11, I didn't like what we were doing
defensively, so we mixed it up. We went to our matchup zone. It helped the
person who was guarding No.3, who was a tremendous player, stay in front of
the ball. We were covering the elbows in the boxes.  
I thought he slowed them down a little bit. They didn't have a great
three‑point shooting night. We could stand in a matchup zone, make them take
long shots. I thought that was the turning point. Then Emily Vann and Paris
Baird came in and boxed those kids out. Turning point of the game for us.  
  
Q. Your bigs were not in foul trouble tonight. How much of a factor was
that?  
COACH CRAIGHEAD: Were they not? I always feel like they are (smiling).  
They got to play. Jazz and Rea, I got to play them out. We obviously need our
bigs. We don't have a whole lot of them. We play a lot of teams that have more
size than us.  
I thought they did a great job in the second half, especially, of rebounding
the basketball on the defensive end and getting the breaks started.  
  
Q. Talk about the play of your seniors, what they meant down the stretch
this year.  
COACH CRAIGHEAD: The game is always tight. I never think it's over. But when
they hit a couple threes, Becca came down and kept answering, Tea got an easy
basket, I was able to breathe.  
They've been tremendous. It started for us when we had our senior game.
They're two kids that don't want their seasons to end, their careers to end.
They have tremendous basketball ability. When the two of them are playing well
together, they can be probably two of the deadliest offensive threats in the
conference. We need the two of them to keep it going if we're going to beat
the champs tomorrow.  
  
Q. Two straight games in Vegas, does that help with some confidence in going
in against a team that can play some defense?  
COACH CRAIGHEAD: Yeah, absolutely. Colorado State, they make you beat
yourself. They got tremendous talent. For us, we got to get up and down. They
do a better job probably than anybody of taking away our break.  
We're going to have to go fast. We're going to have to push the tempo and
shoot the ball really well.  
They're champs for a reason. We're just going to come and compete and see what
we can do.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much, coach.  
COACH CRAIGHEAD: Thank you.

_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

San Diego State  70  
Nevada - 48

  
THE MODERATOR: We're ready to begin with SanDiego State.  
Coach, if we can start with some general comments on today's game.  
COACH TERRY: I just want to start with congratulating Nevada on the season
that they had. It's been a tough road for them with their injuries, all the
adversity they had to face. Beat us pretty good on Friday.  
So congratulations to them on the season that they had.  
You know, I'm just really proud of the effort tonight. We talked a lot about
we're a blue‑collar team. We don't have a standout kid and we have to do it by
committee. That's exactly what we did today. Proud with the effort and proud
we could come out with the W tonight.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Ariell, down the stretch you kind of had the game in hand. Seemed like
you sort of kept your foot on the jugular, gas pedal going. Was there a sense
of revenge in your mind for the loss less than a week ago?  
ARIELL BOSTICK: Yeah, it was part revenge, part we want to keep going in the
tournament.  
We wanted to do it for our seniors. I definitely wanted to do it for our
seniors this year. We weren't able to succeed last year. Our determination was
for the seniors to go out with that. We had to keep the gas going until the
last second, so I had to keep it going, keep the tempo up.  
  
Q. Khristina, talk about the rhythm you had to sort of find with one another
coming out in the second half, then you went on a 10 ‑1 run.   
KHRISTINA HUNTER: I know halftime we really talked about how mostly we don't
come out good second half. We told ourselves that this is do or die. There is
no game after this. If we lose, we lose.  
We needed revenge. We knew we could beat them. I feel like we got into each
other, said we needed to do this for ourselves, show everybody we're about to
make it.  
  
Q. When you're going against a player like Mungedi, her size in the paint,
do you have to change anything offensively in how you operate?  
KHRISTINA HUNTER: Yeah, we have to change a lot. I know coach was telling us
keep our elbows up, pump fake. Usually it's easy to turn and score. With her
being 6'8", you have to do either a counter move or a pump fake, get her in
the air and get your body into her.  
ARIELL BOSTICK: Pretty much like she said, as a guard, you have to drive past
her. We finally figured it out and went around her, got a couple baskets.  
She scored I think 17, 15 points in the first half, then we held her to I
think 5 points in the second half. So we definitely locked her down, which we
wanted to do the whole game. We succeeded in that.  
Held her off on the boards.  
COACH TERRY: We didn't lock her down (laughter).  
ARIELL BOSTICK: We stopped her in the second half.  
COACH TERRY: No, we slowed her down. She's a great player.  
KHRISTINA HUNTER: Stopped her in our hearts.  
COACH TERRY: She's a great player. She makes us change a lot of what we do.
They did a good job of taking us out of our offense with the zone they play.
With her ability to block shots, it's tough to score. That's why we scored,
you know, so poorly down there.  
We talked about that we needed transition, we needed to get out and run. We
needed to score early because once they get their defense set, they're a very
good defensive team and she's a very good defensive player.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. We'll continue with questions for coach.  
  
Q. Coming into the game, given you had just lost to this team less than a
week ago, had to be frustrating with the injuries they're dealing with. Did
you have to change a game plan to play against the game they played last week
or did you have to change your game plan and your strategy?  
COACH TERRY: We just kind of fine‑tuned what we do. Again, we watched that
film. I watched it at least five times. The girls watched it on their own,
then we broke it down.  
We had to make some adjustments. They took us out of our postgame, did a good
job of defending Erimma and Khristina in the first game. We saw where we had
opportunities to score, where we needed to take advantage of it.  
Again, our focus tonight was to get out and run. Didn't do a great job of that
in the first half, but in the second half, trying to score early, because once
they get their defense set, it's hard to score.  
  
Q. I'm assuming that's what you told them at halftime, play their game, be
aggressive?  
COACH TERRY: We gave up too many points, 21 points, she had 15 of those. We
talked a lot about defense. I was pretty happy with our offensive output at
that point.  
But, yes, we talked a lot about pushing the tempo, controlling the tempo,
making sure we always had control of that.  
  
Q. Coming out of the second half, they scored two straight baskets. You
called time ‑out.   
COACH TERRY: I got on Khristina Hunter pretty good. I subbed her out. She
wasn't defending like I think she needed to. I didn't think our effort from
all five players was what it takes to win a conference championship. I used
that timeout to get on them pretty good.  
To Khristina's credit, she went down to the end of the bench, pouted for about
a minute, then came back and played well.  
We can't take possessions off. We're not good enough yet. We need to continue
to play hard and get it done that way.  
I didn't think we were playing as hard as we needed to to win.  
  
Q. As far as the rebounds are concerned, you out ‑rebounded them 33‑24\. On
the offensive end, they had three offensive rebounds, Mungedi got none.   
COACH TERRY: Part of that is misleading. I'm proud of that because they killed
us on the boards Friday.  
Their game plan was obviously to go inside so Mimi was shooting the ball a lot
so she didn't have the opportunities to rebound.  
Taking a kid that averages 10 rebounds and holding her to four is a great
accomplishment for us. We have to do that to win. We have to dominate the
boards. We are about to face a good rebounding team. I'm glad we came out on
the winning end of the rebounds tonight.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much, coach.  
COACH TERRY: Thank you.

_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

Wyoming  70  
Air Force - 48

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Air Force.  
Coach, some thoughts been tonight's game.  
COACH WILLIAMS: Again, I thought it was a hard‑fought game, especially where
we could have folded. But we came out, it's not our style. We came out second
half, tried to make a run on them. If we got it to single digits, we would
have felt really good.  
We're tough‑nosed, meaning we're not going to quit. They responded well right
after halftime, put some points on the board. So we did some things there,
tried to do our best to limit their looks in the paint. You try to take away
the three‑point line a little bit from a good Wyoming team.  
I was proud of the way we responded. Usually we're going to play shorthanded,
smaller, but definitely tough, tenacity, keep going at it.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. How would you summarize the game, the season? It's tough coming in
knowing you're going up against two of the top players in the league and the
game slips away. How do you keep your positivity on the court?  
LINDSEY LEWIS: You know, it's tough just always being up against the wall,
kind of knowing we're trying to scratch from the bottom.  
Honestly, it takes the whole team. It takes all our coaches, each other
motivating us every day.  
Yeah, we have busy schedules. Yeah, there's 10 things on our agenda. When you
get to practice, you got to work hard and shake off the game that was maybe
two days ago or you didn't have the greatest effort you wanted.  
You have to find it in you to keep on playing. It's short. We just finished
playing our last game. It honestly still hasn't hit me. I'm probably going to
be bawling later tonight.  
It's the feeling you have another chance to go and make a difference, play
with your teammates. You have to find the motivation within. Don't give up and
keep working hard every day.  
JIMI BLAGOWSKY: I think just to piggyback off Lindsey, it all comes down to
your teammates. It's a frustrating season when you only win two games. The
teammates we have, we're going to fight every game. We're going to be
undersized, pretty much always going to be the underdog. It doesn't stop us
from playing hard every game, fighting every game. That's all I ask from my
teammates and that's all that I can give to them, so...  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. We'll continue with questions for Coach
Williams.  
  
Q. It's been a tough season. You come in and face Wyoming off the bat with
two of the top players in the league. What did you tell them after the game?  
COACH WILLIAMS: We're proud of them as coaches and their fellow teammates.
Jimi does what she could to get back and get rehab from our trainers. That was
a bright spot. It was good to see her in uniform instead of sitting in sweats.  
We're going to miss them. They had great leadership for four years. Coming in,
trying to change program culture, being at it every day in what they're doing.  
We're very proud of them and proud of what they've been able to accomplish.
Again, never quit. Just keep coming in, coming in, doing what we ask, play
with some young players, show them how to do some things.  
They're great role models for our freshmen class. But it has been tough. You
want to string some wins together. They have great Air Force futures ahead of
them.  
  
Q. Old saying is a good parent teaches their children, but a great parent
learns from their's. For four years you're essentially a parent to these kids.
What have you learned from this group?  
COACH WILLIAMS: Tenacity. Lewis came back from a knee injury. Jimi wasn't able
to come in direct under the last coaching staff due to a knee injury out of
high school. Perseverance. Knowing this is the game.  
Jimi wants to be a helo pilot, so she's doing everything for her training and
leadership, going from a freshman whippersnapper, to last year leading us in
scoring, not the tallest, fastest, but she will keep at it. That's who I would
want in a cockpit representing us.  
Lewis is phenomenal, a good background coming back from a knee injury.  
They believed in their first recruiting visit four years ago in what we were
trying to do. We think we're getting better with each recruiting class.
They've been phenomenal leaders that way.  
They were talking about their recognition four years ago, the stuff they went
through. A good culmination. Learning a lot of perseverance. They want to be
the ones that step up and say yes to you, learning new styles, new offenses.  
I learn a lot from them from the toughness. The family is always with us,
together, all that. They're here in Vegas with them. They had a great Senior
Night with a lot of good things going on. Our freshmen are really excited to
do stuff with them.  
They're leaving that legacy of great teammates in the locker room, on the
court, and tremendous leaders for Air Force.  
  
Q. On Wyoming's two leaders, your thoughts on their play? Just the energy,
the positive energy they exude on the court.  
COACH WILLIAMS: Yeah, it's definitely there. I think there's more than two or
three. The unique thing is we've had our Air Force Classic, so they came last
year. We got a chance to break bread with our conference foes. Our players
were able to talk with them at dinner the night before we played the two
Classic games last year at our place.  
Just to get to know Joe and his staff, how they conduct business. Top‑notch
program. Marquelle has worked on her game, being able to go to the basket, now
adding that three‑point shot, which at Wyoming I believe you need to have a
three‑point shot. She stepped up her game.  
Defensive team, offensive team, they're putting it together. She's had a
tremendous year. Put a lot on her shoulders, wanted to follow in her father's
footprints.  
Kayla Woodward stepped up big‑time tonight. A full game.  
Mileto decided to get hot in the first half. We decided to pay some attention
to her. I know she can shoot the three. I think they have really three that
they try to run the offense through. Those are the big three.  
Then the game that we played during the regular season, they went inside,
which everybody does, so it's not like a new tactic against us. But we decided
to go with our big to start, Lindsey Stimeling, she responded well where they
couldn't just go at us and we stopped that bleeding.  
They do a lot of things, but it's hard to guard that motion at the three‑point
line. If they're feeling it, shooting well at the Thomas Mack, look out, they
can make a run. They're a great team, good competitors, and great crowd
support and understand that.  
But it was kind of unique last year, to get to know them and their staff. We
appreciate that. But they're tremendous.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much, coach.

_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

San Diego State  70  
Nevada - 48

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Nevada.  
Coach, if we can start with you, just some general thoughts on today's game.  
COACH ALBRIGHT: Well, I would like to congratulate SanDiego State on their
win. I think that they had a tremendous day today.  
They took advantage of some things, really are a much, much improved ball team
from last year. So just congratulations to them.  
We're a team that last year we had three guards, and we don't have any of them
now. T Moe, our kid that got the Player of the Week, tore her ACL and hasn't
play since.  
We didn't have any guards that had any experience. When you have 24
turnovers... The other night, their pressure didn't bother us.  
Emily was a post. We asked her to go to guard this year to give us some
experience in that spot. I'm really proud of her. She had seven assists today
she's a character kid, your leader, your everything.  
I think we're statistically the best offensive rebounding team in the league,
at least up near the top, and we had zero at halftime. They're in the other
locker room talking about they've got to get those rebounds.  
We didn't play well today. We know that we didn't. I'm disappointed in how we
played, but I'm not disappointed in this group. There's a huge difference in
that.  
We've had a lot of things go wrong this year with injuries and that type of
thing. They never turned upon each other, pointed fingers. Their character is
impeccable. They're great student‑athletes.  
It was certainly not the way we wanted to end, particularly after having such
a good outing for Senior Night. I thought we out‑rebounded them. We did all
the stuff we didn't do today.  
But give them credit that they scored 26 points off of our turnovers. They
out‑rebounded us. Their points in the paint were a lot.  
Mimi, congratulations to her. We're really proud. The Mountain West, there's
been a big difference between the WAC and the Mountain West. All the players
put in a lot of work. Certainly y'all didn't see Mimi her freshman year. She's
really come a long way. She'll be the first all‑conference player we have. I'm
really, really proud of her.  
Camille Williams is her position coach. She worked and worked. You can't
imagine the hours those two put in. Really, really proud of her. Defensive
player of the year. Proud of you, Mimi.  
I'm not at all worried about the rest of the senior class. They're going to be
great people. If sports truly is the reason, you get your education paid for,
you learn leadership and relationships, they're a group as good as any group
I've had in 31 years.  
On the basketball court, we turned the ball over, didn't play well today. I
told them, some wise person sometime, I don't know when, I must have learned
this when I was in my 20s, they said it was the journey, not the destination.
The destination today for all of us was very disappointing. We usually
represent our school a lot better than we did today.  
The journey with these seniors was tremendous. The relationships they formed,
how they represent the university, I'm proud of. You have to separate that
from today. There is no excuse for today. It all comes back to me. Must not
have prepared them.  
That's pretty much a long opening statement, but that's all I've got to say.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Emily, coach said the pressure didn't bother you guys just last week when
you beat SanDiego State. You played a close first half. Second half, scored
the first couple of buckets, tied the game. What happened after that?  
EMILY BURNS: It definitely wasn't our team chemistry. I think all season long
through the tough times and good times we've stuck together.  
SanDiego State, they upped their defense a lot. They put the pressure on us,
their hands were everywhere. It was us not handling the pressure very well.  
Wish we could have learned our lesson a little bit earlier, but we didn't
adjust well enough.  
  
Q. Mimi, you had a solid first half to keep your team in it. The second half
they put the clamps on you. Talk about the job they did on you in the second
half to sort of shut things down.  
MIMI MUNGEDI: They just doubled me all the time, and it was pretty hard for me
to get open. So I did what I could. They were really, really pressuring me,
so...  
COACH ALBRIGHT: That's where our guards have to step up. A lot of times we
didn't. We turned the ball over before we even tried to do that.  
We had a lot of assists to her. Guards can usually shoot the ball better and
make some shots and get to the free‑throw line. Today, what, we were‑‑ well,
we did get to the free‑throw line there better.  
Yeah, there's only so much you can do in there.  
  
Q. Emily, how are you feeling and what happened on that play where you got
hurt?  
EMILY BURNS: I was going for the ball. I'm not really sure what I hit. I hit
the middle of my shin. Just from there it instantly was pain down my entire
leg, so...  
I'm doing better now. It still really hurts. They took me back, got some
x‑rays on it. Bruise, not a fracture.  
  
Q. Emily, I know it's tough to talk about right now, but how much will you
embrace and cherish being able to play four years of college basketball for
your hometown university?  
EMILY BURNS: It's probably going to be the best experience I have in my life,
being able to stay home with my parents, my family, people all over town that
I've known since high school.  
It's something I cherish a lot, knowing that people I've known my whole life
were able to come and support me at games. They grew to love everyone else on
the team as much as I did. I appreciate it so much. I don't think I'll be able
to experience something like this ever again.  
  
Q. Emily, how challenging was this season?  
EMILY BURNS: It was probably, of my four years, the most challenging. I think
as a team, though, we handled it really well. We never gave up. I think you
could see that in our games. Even when we were down by a bit, we never turned
on each other.  
It was we're a team, and if we're going to win, we're going to win as a team,
if we're going to lose, we're going to lose as a team.  
  
Q. Mimi, reflect on the senior year, the growth you had on the basketball
court, what it meant to you go out playing like you played.  
MIMI MUNGEDI: It means a lot. Like I said, it's all thanks to coach Jane,
coach Camille gave me all the stuff. They gave me all that opportunity. I took
advantage of it. I did what I could out of it. I'm kind of sad my last game
was like this.  
I will forever be grateful to Nevada, that's for sure. Wherever I'm going to
go, I'm going to be walking with my Nevada gear. Real thankful with that.  
COACH ALBRIGHT: In November, when we had the Mountain West Media Day, I never
remember in my whole coaching career let a team talk about a championship.
They did. That's the disappointment we have. They worked all summer expecting
to do that.  
T Moe gets the triple‑double, player of the week, all that. We were sitting
pretty high, played BYU. In the championship game of their conference
tomorrow. Two‑point game. Then Emily goes down right after that. Her senior
year, she's out for almost eight weeks. Can't walk, can't practice, can't do
anything. Had surgery. The fact she even tried to come back is amazing to me.  
It's two of our three captains out. Again, that's the stuff you can't control.
I'm not whining, I'm just telling you facts. I love this team. I love their
perseverance. They stand for every good thing about sports.  
It's really disappointing. It was very hard on all of us, but we're proud of
them.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll dismiss the student‑athletes at this time. Thank you,
ladies.  
We'll continue with questions for Coach Albright.  
  
Q. Talk about what this class has meant to this program.  
COACH ALBRIGHT: Well, it's the class that got us from the WAC to the Mountain
West. It's a class that helped us come in third last year, a class I had zero
trouble with.  
I mean, they come in every day. They work hard. The improvement that they had.
They put their heart and soul into everything.  
They're all above a 3.0. They're all basically brilliant. Got two engineers in
the group. Emily will be a P.T. Aja, she'll do anything, might be the mayor of
Reno. Then Kayla joined us. She's going to represent our conference and our
school, so you want to be a coach. That program, they only take 50 people,
she's one of them.  
That's why it's so disappointing that the year ended up like it did. In a
perfect world, when you work hard, you want the good guys to finish. They're
all good gals, good women. They wear white, the white hats.  
Maybe one of them might have been late once. I don't even remember if that
happened. We just had them all playing out of position. We looked up one time,
had four posts on the floor. It just wasn't the basketball team we wanted, but
the stuff that they could control they certainly did.  
Mariah was actually pre‑season freshman of the year. She tore her ACL, too.
She was another point guard. Kelsey wasn't even a point guard. We recruited
her as a two guard.  
It is what it is. You control what you can control. But I'm really, really
proud of them, all that they represent. I'm very disappointed in today. Don't
get me wrong. I'm not saying that today doesn't matter. Today does matter. The
last four games we've been a really good basketball team, and today we
weren't. They out‑hustled us. They looked like they wanted it more than we
did. There were no adjustments made.  
You look at the offensive boards and you can tell. We don't win when we don't
rebound. But, again, give them credit. I don't want you to‑‑ I know I'm a
basketball coach. I know that winning is really what we try to do. Believe it
or not, we strive to do that. We fell a lot short today.  
  
Q. You said you had four players playing out of position at one point. Every
player has a role on the court. At times, even if they're taking over a
different position, their role stays the same. In your situation, having to
adjust so much, did it also take them out of their role, not just their
position?  
COACH ALBRIGHT: Yes, it totally did. I mean, it was like playing fruit basket
turnover against one of the quickest teams in our league.  
Again, at home, people are always quicker at home. That's a basketball fact.
People that press, teams that press, on the road, this is kind of neutral
ground, but we didn't handle the ball. Our guards had handled it so well
Friday night. They handled it so well.  
When you have to handle the ball against a press... The most interesting stat
of the game was we shot the ball 49% and lost by 22 points. How does that
happen? See how many possessions we got? Does that say 37? I feel like my eyes
are... I don't know that we played a game with 37 shots. We have to get 60 to
win, to have a chance.  
It's not the first time we've turned it over. You know, that's where, again,
Danika and Arie, they're gone. T Moe was our other point guard. Nobody played
at guard last year. I bet Danika played 36 minutes a game. Arie and T Moe, I
didn't ever take them out.  
We should have had the experience by today to handle it. But Nyasha has not
even practiced the three spot until two weeks ago. Julia the same thing. That
happened when we had to dismiss someone from the team, a point guard, our
backup point guard.  
Whatever we told them. We had a joke we were going to put Mimi at point guard,
but we never had to do that.  
Thanks to all you. You have a classy staff. We're really very proud to be in
the Mountain West. Sorry we didn't represent like we wanted to today for our
university. They really are very good to us. We have a great athletic
director. Rhonda is here. They support us, give us what we need. Ultimately
we'll keep working and see if we can represent better next year.  
I do appreciate the fact that the men's tournament and the women's tournament
is together, and y'all treat it very, very good. Really, really classy
conference.  
I'll speak for all of us and tell you how much we appreciate your
behind‑the‑scenes work.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.  
COACH ALBRIGHT: Thank you.

_IOWA CITY, IOWA_  
  

IOWA  88  
MIAMI - 70

  
COACH MEIER: Of course, huge congrats to Iowa. That was just‑‑ that second
half, their offensive performance was incredible. It was the team destined to
go to the Sweet16 the way they were playing. At one point I think they were
9‑for‑11 to start the half and it was 80‑something percent. They ended up
being 75 percent in the half and 60 percent from the three, and destiny just
started following at halftime. That's the only thing they did wrong, missed a
couple free throws. They were really moving the ball and doing a great job.  
I think the key to the game, we cut it to six there and had Samantha Logic
miss a free throw and Doolittle came and got the free throw and then hit a
jumper in our face. And that's a huge basically four‑point swing there in a
six‑point game and from that point on I think we just kind of broke. We were
holding steady and playing tough.  
I told my team, we're quite young and they have got some great experience, and
I think that showed, and that the mental toughness, they were just sharper
than us in key moments, key plays. We did something that wasn't really smart,
like get a rebound and throw it right to Iowa and they never did something
that wasn't really smart in the last ten minutes of that basketball game.  
So we are going to learn from that, because I made Jessica stay out there and
watch that celebration. I want us to be a Sweet16 team and I want us to know
what it feels like. We're not quite ready, but we've got to get mentally
tougher, and when we do, we're going to be celebrating, as well.  
But I could not have more respect; I'm joyful for Lisa Bluder and her staff,
because I know how they operate and I see them recruiting; I know what class
they operate with. I know those kids work hard. Those seniors on that team
came here with a dream and I think they can go a long way.  
If this was going to happen and we were going to lose, at least I have the
utmost respect for the program that we lost to and I'm really happy for them
and I wish them the best of luck.  
  
Q. Adrienne, did Bethany Doolittle's performance surprise you guys? Did she
do some things you maybe just didn't expect?  
ADRIENNE MOTLEY: No, I don't think we were surprised. We know that that team
is full of great players and she just had a great performance. Looked like she
had a double‑double, and she played like a DivisionI basketball player that's
trying to make it to the Sweet16.  
So I definitely have to give my hat off to her and the rest of the team but as
far as your question, no, I don't think ‑‑ it wasn't surprising at all. She's
a great player.  
  
Q. I just wanted to get your thoughts on what Coach said, that you stood
there and watched that celebration. What was that moment like for you to see
Iowa celebrate and how do you think it's going to help your team that you did
that?  
JESSICA THOMAS: Well, I mean, it hurt a little bit but somebody had to lose
today. But like Coach said, we have a lot of respect for this team. Just
watching that, and coming back next year, putting in motivation and just put
more work in and be ready to be a Sweet16 team, as well.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Iowa ‑‑  
COACH MEIER: Yeah, center, our fives, our Doolittle assignment was left center
and that was the choice that we had to make because of their perimeter talent.
We just didn't do as good of a job as we should have. And when you play Iowa,
you have to break some of your basic fundamental defensive habits. You haven't
over‑help and in the first half we over‑helped and Doolittle was recipient of
dump‑offs and cleanups on the back side.  
So then we tried not to help off of her but basically three of them get a
couple threes. But it's hard to break some habits and stuff that our fives
have been doing all year, and we tried to do it in one day in, one practice.
But I think that her offensive rebounding is something that's no excuse for;
that wasn't over‑help. That was just, we didn't put a body on her on the free
throw line. And her then her under sub (ph) shot was something we wanted to
take away. So half of her points you can put on me and the other half we
didn't execute the game plan.  
  
Q. Iowa was 18 ‑0 at home this season. Could you talk about the atmosphere
today and did that factor in at all? How did your team handle this
environment?  
COACH MEIER: I would like to invite the entire Iowa fans to come to a home
game at Miami. It's really nice and warm. And I'll give them all free tickets
and I'd love them to come cheer for us, because it is a huge factor, it's an
amazing impact on the game.  
I told the refs before the game that I heard a rumor that when you get an NCAA
bid and you get on someone else's home court that they give you an extra
time‑out. So they went and checked the book, but that's not true (laughter)
but I needed one. I ran out of time‑outs. The crowd had a lot to do with
having to run out of time‑outs because they have tremendous fuel.  
It's really warm, I mentioned; nice weather. (Laughter).  
  
Q. I wanted to get your thoughts on that stretch without Mot when she was on
the bench with the four fouls, how difficult was that?  
COACH MEIER: Difficult. I'm going to live with that one for a while. It was
difficult, and when I went to go put her back in, it was a defensive
possession, so then I had to take her‑‑ I didn't want her to go back in on
defensive possession. So I was trying to get her in where we had the ball in
offense, and I probably wasted maybe two offensive possessions going that
because it's not smart to put her in when you're on defense.  
But we unraveled a little bit. It really was, I think the back‑breaking play
that made us lose our composure was that offensive rebound by Doolittle on
that little shot when we had done everything in the world to cut that game
back to six. Mot was out when we were cutting it, so, you know, I could have
put her back in that moment, would have been my decision.  
  
Q. You were talking about the crowd. It's a hostile crowd but is it still
good for kids to play in front of a big crowd even though it was the other
team's crowd?  
COACH MEIER: That's the thing; unfortunately, the NCAA, I think I've played in
a neutral court once. Every time we get a draw at Miami, we've been at
Gonzaga, we've been here; it's definitely a disadvantage for the team.  
But I think more of a disadvantage is to play in an empty stadium and I'm a
big fan of the first round‑‑ they earned it. Iowa earned it. They had a great
season. If I want to cry in my soup, I've got to make my team better and we
have to get a Top‑4 seed. And that's what I need to do instead of complaining
about getting a disadvantage on someone's away court.  
But I do think that extra time‑out rule might be something we should propose
(laughter). But they earned it and I have no regrets. We should have won more
games in the regular season and we wouldn't have been in this position.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_IOWA CITY, IOWA_  
  

IOWA  88  
MIAMI - 70

  
COACH BLUDER: I am almost in disbelief right now, not that we did it. We knew
we were going to do it. We felt great about it. But just the way it happened.
Our great crowd, I mean, our crowd was amazing today. To go 17‑0 on our home
court this season, with these‑‑ excuse me, 18‑0‑‑ see, Sam's always correcting
me. 18‑0 on our home floor and with this group of four seniors has been so
special.  
You know, we beat a really good Miami team. Katie is an excellent coach, very
talented team, a team that did great things and beat some really good people
during the year. But four people in double figures, we shot the ball well
again. That's kind of our M.O.  
I'm just really, really proud of our team and proud of all of our Hawkeye
fans, too. They just came out and we want to share it with all of them, we
really do.  
  
Q. Could you recognize even within the first two possessions that you were
not going to get any open looks, pretty much all day, unless you created them?
How difficult was that once you saw that because that really limits what you
can do on the arc.  
BETHANY DOOLITTLE: Yeah, they did a really good job of just knowing where I
was at all times. But the beauty of our team is there's so many different
threats on our team that if they are going to take away my shooting; that I
have four other teammates that are going to have wide open looks. You can't
take away everything on our team and if they tried to take away that, then
other people are going to be open.  
  
Q. Sam, what do you think Bethany Doolittle looked like today?  
SAMANTHA LOGIC: A stud. I mean, simply put. She just played one of her best
games I've seen in a really long time, if ever. We just wanted to keep feeding
her and keep going to her and if she didn't do it, she got the O‑board and she
got it herself. We play like that, and then you combine it with like she said,
four other people on the floor that can spread you out and have so many
offensive weapons, it's going to be tough.  
  
Q. Sam, it's no secret that this has been a goal. Coach called this a
mission since day one this year. How does it feel to finally make it?  
SAMANTHA LOGIC: Unbelievable. We are really excited. I think it has not even
completely hit me yet. We are still playing, like Coach said, 18‑0 on our
floor, going to the Sweet16 is something we've wanted to do since we've gotten
here. Obviously it took four years but we're happy to do it right now.  
  
Q. Bethany, was this your best game?  
BETHANY DOOLITTLE: I mean, with the circumstances at hand, I think it was
pretty good outcome for us. I obviously don't want this season to be over, and
ending on this note at home is great, 18‑0\. So I think we just wanted to keep
going and I wanted to play hard for my teammates and play hard for the crowd
that came out today.  
  
Q. What is it like for a starter when you see, I think the three players off
the bench combined to go 7-for-9 from the field. What's it like when you see
that support coming off the bench?  
SAMANTHA LOGIC: It's huge. We flow, we have that much confidence in them every
single time they are on the floor. Kali played huge minute; Lexi have played
huge minutes. Chase was in there for five, but I mean, she had six points.
It's just huge. We're so happy for our bench.  
I mean, they come in and work their butts off in practice every single day and
not just those three. The other six that didn't get in, they come in and work
so hard making us better. So I mean, it's really nice to see them reap the
benefits of that because they deserved it.  
  
Q. For Beth, did you think you were going to get ‑‑ you had shots from
pretty much all over the floor. Was that where you thought you would get shots
today?   
BETHANY DOOLITTLE: I don't think you can ever kind of predict where you're
going to get shots but I just tried to take what was given to me and my
teammates found me in the right places and I tried to get positions so they
could get out better passes into me.  
So it just kind of worked out in our favor today. But that's what you look for
in this kind of energy‑‑ or this kind of environment, and the energy we get
from our crowd here. We got the best for what we were given in the game.  
  
Q. For all three student athletes, how will you remember this day with this
crowd with the stakes this high?  
BETHANY DOOLITTLE: It's something we'll never forget. The crowd that came out
today, our friends and family supporting us, this group of girls; our awesome
coaching staff, just seeing everybody in the center of the court after the
game smiling, singing, dancing everything together, is just something that
will be in my memory for the rest of my life. I can't wait to keep it going.  
SAMANTHA LOGIC: Yeah, I think she said it all. We've had that much support so
often since we have been here. It's just awesome to go out and win our last
game in Carver, and with those stakes so high, getting to the Sweet16 and
finally reaching that goal.  
MELISSA DIXON: Yeah, like the other two said, we are going to remember this
forever. We are so happy, especially with the huge crowd that came out; and to
play our last game in Carver and to make it to the Sweet16 is pretty special,
and we're going to remember it forever.  
  
Q. In the last eight minutes of the game, this team was at it's very best,
wasn't it?  
COACH BLUDER: I think we were pretty focused. I think the last three minutes
took forever and I thought this team was incredibly focused; that last ten
minutes, I thought we played very good basketball and we shot the ball well.
And when you shoot the ball 75 percent, you're going to be hard to beat.  
You know, we didn't shoot well from the free throw line. I was ready to have
us quit shooting free throws and start shooting threes because we're shooting
better from everywhere. Uncharacteristically from the free throw line not
doing a good job. But I thought we played very well during those closing
minutes.  
  
Q. So much of your success has been driven by the senior class. Can you
touch a little bit on the growth of the people that will be back in the
program next year and how much they have contributed to this run, too?  
COACH BLUDER: Well, I think our bench was really good today. The three women
that did get in today, Kali Peschel, people don't realize she's the second
best three‑point shooter on our team. She's the second best free throw shooter
on our team. She's coming in and doing great things. I think she's playing the
best basketball of her career right now.  
Chase Coley, she's automatic. She has got the best left hand I've ever seen.
We need to get her a little stronger over the summer, but we will. She
obviously played well. Lex came in and did some great things for us
defensively, took care of the ball.  
And then the other six players, as Sam said, that didn't get into the game
today, that worked so hard every single day and don't get the glory; and to me
they are the heros. Because you come to practice, and you give everything you
have to practice without the reward of getting in, which is everybody's
ultimate reward, that's hard work. That's mental toughness right there.  
  
Q. Coach Meier said that, I think I've got the right place in the game, they
cut the lead down to six, it was 69 ‑63, and Sam missed a free throw and then
Bethany got the rebound, and then she scored on a 15‑foot jumper. She said
that really sort of turned the game around. Was that indicative of the kind of
game Bethany played?  
COACH BLUDER: Well, I thought Bethany was outstanding, and you know, she was
pretty humble up here, but she's so capable of that. I told her over and over
again, I have so much confidence with the ball in your hands, and we really
challenged her to rebound today and she did it.  
She came out; and how important were those six offensive rebounds, and
especially the one I felt like when she missed and got it on rebound and put
it back in, that was big. But I mean, when you're getting down to now you're
playing against such good competition, it's about possessions, it's about
taking care of the ball and rebounding and today we out‑rebounded a pretty
good basketball team by nine.  
  
Q. Coach Meier said she was happy for you. She says you do things the right
now. These kids have been here four years and you've been doing this for about
30. What does this mean to you?  
COACH BLUDER: Do I look a lot lighter? I think there's a monkey off my back. I
feel like I might look a little bit lighter right now. You know, we've been
there so many times, and just not been able to finish it.  
This year, coming into the year, knowing that the Top‑4 seeds were going to be
hosting; and we started talking about it right away, how it was a different
year. It was a special year with the experience that we had returning. We had
so much coming back.  
This group had been there. They had been there before and it's time to be able
to finally do it and to do it on Carver Hawkeye Arena floor, it's a good
feeling. Quite probably has not sunk in all the way for me yet. I'm just so
happy for this group of seniors and Kathryn Reynolds in there with it, as
well. She's going to be a heck of a lawyer and I told her yesterday, she's got
one thing left to add to her resumé, she's a Sweet16 basketball player and
today she did that for us.  
  
Q. In the first half didn't shoot all that well ‑‑ did you notice something
they changed defensively that allowed such a drastic change in the second
half?  
COACH BLUDER: They really spread out. They were trying to take away the three
in our opinion. But again, if you take away the three, that's fine. We were
smart. We didn't shoot a bunch then. We didn't try to make a bunch of threes
that weren't there and I thought was really important because sometimes we
really want to make those threes.  
We only shot nine today and we made five of them, great percentage but what
that does is opened up the middle. It opened up things for Beth. It opened up
drives for other players. We always felt as a team, you take away one of our
weapons, we've got a lot more.  
  
Q. Question on fouls, especially the first half, Miami was really racking
them up. Did you and the rest of your staff get a sense of, just have to lean
on them a little bit and eventually that foul trouble will decimate their
offense; we saw some of that when some of their top players ran into that. Did
you get a sense it was going to work out if it stayed like that in the second
half?  
COACH BLUDER: We felt like when their centers got in foul trouble, we really
tried to isolate them with Beth because those two players are really good
rebounders. And we wanted them out of the game.  
And we felt like Beth had the upper hand inside, and I thought we did a really
good job of iso'ing those post players and being able to get them out of the
game.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Lisa. On behalf of the NCAA and University of Iowa,
we want to thank you guys for being here all weekend and hopefully you'll see
us in Oklahoma City.

_IOWA CITY, IOWA_  
  
COACH MEIER: Whoever made this tournament, these four teams, offense, offense,
offense, so unbelievable games yesterday. Unbelievable ball movement, great
coaching, and so you know, you game plan for a Washington team that you just
can't believe how talented they are on the offensive end and their ability to
make plays and make shots and how they put the ball in the right player's hand
at the right time.  
And then you win that game, you celebrate for about half an hour, and then you
start watching Iowa and you're like, my God, all right, well, here's another
team that knows exactly where the ball should go, plays at a serious pace.
Everybody takes gutsy shots on their team.  
I think that's the thing I love the most about them is that they have such
guts, and the dagger shot doesn't just come from one person. I mean, Dixon's
dagger (ph) is pretty darned impressive. But there's a lot of people on the
team who will take the big shot and step up. Yeah, nobody backs down; nobody
hesitates.  
So the bags under my eyes are well earned, and we've got a lot of work to do.
But it should be an awesome game.  
  
Q. Iowa has been an average to below average team rebounding this year. Is
that something you feel that you can exploit tomorrow?  
JESSICA THOMAS: Every game, we've got to come out and make sure we put a body
on everybody on the rebounding end, that's defensive, offensive. We see Iowa
has a lot of size in the paint, so as a team, it's just going to be a total
effort of beating every board, boxing out and getting our run‑outs.  
ADRIENNE MOTLEY: I agree with Jessica. They have a great amount of size, and
just making sure, like she said, finding a body and securing the rebounds.  
I think every game, that's pretty much the game plan, so can't say this is a
specific game where we focus on it. I think every game we should focus on
that.  
  
Q. For both of you, Iowa has not lost at home yet this season. To be able to
come in here and have to face that kind of environment, how prepared do you
guys feel for that, especially with what you guys were able to do in the ACC
this season?  
JESSICA THOMAS: I feel like you go back to the game we played Louisville at
home, it was a crazy environment. I mean, we are back in it. Hopefully we can
take that, come together as a team and just take on whatever comes in front of
us.  
ADRIENNE MOTLEY: I think any away game in the ACC can be comparable to playing
here. Playing at Duke‑‑ I think she forgot about, we played at Cameron; again,
playing at Louisville, playing at Pitt, playing at Carolina last year. I think
we do pretty well with playing away games. But we just have to focus and play
Miami basketball.  
  
Q. Obviously Katie touched on watching some of the film already. What have
you guys seen about what Iowa can do and the pace? Again, it's going to be
more basketball which you like, but what have we seen from Iowa already?  
JESSICA THOMAS: On the offensive end, they can score from anywhere on the
floor. You know, they have threats in the post, they have threats on the
perimeter, and they have a shooter that ‑‑ in particular, Dixon, but you know,
they have got shooters all around the perimeter. So we've got to lock down our
defense and make sure we take every stop serious.  
ADRIENNE MOTLEY: Again, they can shoot the ball ridiculously well point‑blank
period. They are a great‑shooting team and we just have to be grounded on
defense. We can't play lackadaisical. We have to know where our man is at all
times.  
Coach was saying we have to hold our own pretty much this game. I know we have
been relying‑‑ not relying, but we have help side, or rail as we call it, but
this game we really have to hold our own on the defensive end.  
  
Q. With Iowa's ability to score, do you plan to try to get into a track meet
with them and try to out ‑score them or do you hope to shut them down as best
you can and make it more of a defensive game?   
COACH MEIER: Great question but we're not going to give the game plan away
just yet. (Laughter).  
  
Q. You talked about Iowa's guts. Could you expand on that?  
COACH MEIER: Well, it's the games you watch, and who hits the money shot, who
is their gamer, what are very going to do. You watch the Big Ten Tournament
and they run an out‑of‑bounds play beautifully executed and it's Doolittle.
And then they run must‑shot (ph), they are going to run Dixon off some
screens.  
And then Samantha Logic is responsible for half the team's points. I mean, if
you literally break her down, she has 15 points in a game, she has nine
assists in their conference games; and half of those assists are
three‑pointers so you're talking about 20, 21 points right there. So you're
talking about 36 points from one player.  
So obviously it starts and ends with her, but then she puts the ball where it
needs to go in those moments and has every ability to find‑‑ she makes some
passes that you don't see a lot of females be able to make, because of her
strength, because of her balance. You might choose who you might leave open
and I think she's probably going to be a step ahead of most coaches in that
category. She's going to find what you leave open.  
  
Q. Just to get back to the environment that you guys are going to face
tomorrow; here a couple years ago, what do you think some of the older players
have taken from that, and obviously the ACC experience you hope everyone can
use tomorrow.  
COACH MEIER: I said this my first press conference here. The crowd is a smart
crowd. I mean, they are a disruptive crowd. They know when to get loud. They
celebrate a dag (ph) for three as well as any crowd does in the country.  
We love it. I love it for women's basketball and I love it for Lisa. I mean,
she's built this program and she's a great, great lady and she deserves this
kind of support. So I'm happy to be here. It's not going to be a negative for
us, but it did‑‑ it can be very rattling, especially when they go to some of
their traps and stuff and you're trying to communicate with your players.  
I remember that from two years ago, we were here, and players are far away
from you, you're trying to communicate and they are throwing some traps at
you, and so we have to prepare for that, as well.  
  
Q. Does the offensive preparation that your folks had for Washington, does
that translate into what you have to accomplish here today?  
COACH MEIER: For what we needed to score? Yes, I'm glad we scored 86 last
night (laughs) because there are some obvious ways, philosophical choices that
you have to make in playing Iowa. If one of them is okay, don't yell at your
defense too much, just score on the other end, don't have that hangover,
that's definitely one of them. They are great. They are going to score. So we
do have to answer with some points, as well.  
  
Q. Considering how the last week of the regular season went, I think I saw
that yesterday they needed that; they needed to see that they could put 86
together; that it wasn't just Mot. How much did they need that just to be able
to see that they were back on track and to feel like they were playing good
basketball after those three tough, tough losses, which were also good
basketball.  
COACH MEIER: In the ACC tournament, our first game against Virginia, we had
great looks; we didn't hit them, but our defense held. I thought the Notre
Dame game is actually where we freed ourselves up, got our dandy back, got our
pace back. And when you do that against Notre Dame, you feel good about losing
against almost anybody.  
And forget about them, I needed it (laughing). I missed them. It's nice to
have them back. No, they are a great group and they will do whatever you need
them to do. But I thought last night, our offensive balance, Motley was very
impressive but throughout the game; maybe you noticed or not, I thought
throughout the game: Oh, my God, Mot's on fire. She was hitting very rhythm
shots. I thought it was a quiet 30, if that ever has happened before.  
But I know Shelly Woods was being aggressive on the offensive end; and Nicole
Sterling kept us in the first half; and Jessica Thomas with a bit of foul
trouble coming off the bench and giving us that spark was huge. You know, I
see it every day in practice so it's just‑‑ you're right. Showing up in the
game and a big stage like that was huge for us.

_IOWA CITY, IOWA_  
  
COACH BLUDER: Good to be here today. Obviously love playing in the second
round.  
You know, right now, I think coming into this year‑‑ Patrick, our unbelievable
SID gives me all these great facts. He told me, I think there's only 20 other
schools in America that have made it to the last two straight NCAA second
rounds, and now we're in our third year of doing that. So I'm sure that number
is going to go down. And it's great to be here but I don't think it's any
secret that we want to go farther; that we would love to be playing next week.  
We know that Miami is a great team and they have the same goals as we do. I
feel like home‑court advantage is tremendous. I think we are going to have a
great crowd here tomorrow at 11 o'clock and I think they are going to help us.  
Our seniors have been great leaders all year for us and they are going to do
it again tomorrow. And I'm excited about the game. I think it's going to be a
great game. And we'll hopefully be pretty excited tomorrow at this time.  
  
Q. Is it fair to say that this is the best opportunity for advancement that
you've had in your four years?  
SAM LOGIC: I think on paper it is. You know, being the higher seed on our home
floor the last two years here, we've been eight and then a six, playing a
really good three seed last year in Louisville, probably deserved to be a
little higher than that.  
On paper, yes, but as you've seen in the men's tournament, and now in the
women's a little bit more, numbers really don't matter. It's just how you go
out and play. So we are not looking at numbers and how good of a chance we
have. We know we are going to have to execute and play a really great game
tomorrow.  
ALLY DISTERHOFT: Yeah, just what Sam said, it's the NCAA Tournament now and
anything can happen. You have to be ready to go on any given night. I totally
agree. Seeding doesn't matter at this point. You have to come out from the get
go with that intense mind‑set and that's what we plan to do tomorrow.  
WHITNEY JENNINGS: This is my first year in the tournament but on paper we are
the team that's supposed to win. We feel good that we're back in Carver and
17‑0 and just looking to build on that tomorrow afternoon.  
  
Q. With how you shot from the outside in the second half, how much of a
boost of enthusiasm did you feel from the crowd yesterday? We saw at key
points in the game you or Melissa would pop from the outside in the second
half; was that a nice boost to get at certain points when you needed it
against American?  
ALLY DISTERHOFT: Our fans have been amazing all throughout the year. We talk
about it all the time. There's nothing better than running out of the tunnel
to 10,000 screaming fans, whether it's hitting a big shot or passing it to
Beth, Sam, Melissa, whoever, for a wide‑open shot and hearing that the fans
are up, that's a great feeling.  
So we really hope that our fans again come out and support us tomorrow. They
make a huge difference in the game. They are influencers and they have done
great things for us this year, we really do appreciate it.  
  
Q. You've been at this for a long time, 15 years at high with a, in your
mind; this your best opportunity to break through and get to the Sweet16?  
COACH BLUDER: You know, I think it is. Again, I think the women explained it
really well up here. You know, on paper, definitely; but you come into a game,
and depth‑‑ Miami is a talented team. They are athletic, they are quick, they
are good outside shooters. They are well coached. We know it's going to be a
battle and this time of year, it's a lot of times, it's who gets hot: Who gets
hot at end of the year; who playing with that confidence; who has got the
emotion on their side.  
And so all those things come into play, and I think less important are the
seedings, especially when you get into the second round, and more important is
who is believing in them and their team at this point.  
  
Q. Does it get to a point where with a team like this, where you can almost
‑‑ I don't want to say being hands‑off in practice, but you know that they
know what the mission is. You have enough leadership on this team where you
can make smaller tweaks as the season goes on. Has it been like that for you
this year with this crew?   
COACH BLUDER: Well, this team, the leadership is amazing with this group. And
it comes in so many ways, not only in them directing each other on what to do
but also just in what they are saying in the locker room and how they lead by
example. And so all those different ways, it's been a great group for leaders.  
But I wouldn't say it's been hands‑off, but certainly they have needed less
guidance than other groups.  
  
Q. For what you need to do for tomorrow ‑‑  
COACH BLUDER: They are really good outside shooters. I mean, they are smooth.
I mean, Motley, she is a really good offensive player. I mean, she has 30
points last night against Washington. Her jump shoot is smooth and she is
very, very good with that.  
They are an excellent defensive team. They scored well over their offensive
averages last night but defensively, they are holding people well below their
averages, and so that's I think probably the thing that bothers us or worries
us the most as coaches is just making sure that our offense can run smoothly
and we can take care of the ball.  
  
Q. Maybe keep them away from the three point line and funnel them a little
bit further inside on offense?  
COACH BLUDER: Well, they get to the free throw line a lot, obviously because
they put the ball on the floor so well. You know, we definitely don't want to
get into foul trouble against them and draw fouls trying to defend their
drives.  
But if you defend their drive well, they will take out their three‑point
shooters, and they have got a variety of three‑point shooters, as well.  
  
Q. How does this Miami team compare to the one you played two years ago and
how does this matchup compare to the one two years ago?  
COACH BLUDER: I think there was only two seniors on the team that are the same
from that squad.  
They had a big center last time and she was a presence. She was really one of
those immovable girls. I think their inside game is a little different. I'm
not saying it's less effective. I'm just saying it's different. I think they
have more balance now than they did, and I think they are just a little bit
more‑‑ they are better shooters than they used to be.  
  
Q. Even though they are an 11th seed, they did beat Notre Dame. Is that
something that you can use to kind of get everybody's attention?  
COACH BLUDER: Yeah, and our team knows that. But they have beat Syracuse; they
have done their job all year long. I really don't know why they were an 11
seed to be quite honest because like three of their losses are a total of five
points. They have been right there with everybody.  
And so this is a good basketball team from a good conference. You know, again,
we're going to have our work cut out for us. But I think home court; I think
we're on a mission; you know, Sam Logic, I think she's pretty hard to defend.  
I think you look at her on film and you watch Melissa's shot on film, and you
think, yeah, that's pretty good, that's a pretty quick shot. But until you
play against it, you don't know what it's like.

_IOWA CITY, IOWA_  
  

MIAMI  86  
WASHINGTON - 80

  
COACH MEIER: Well, I don't know that I've ever coached a game where the other
team had five players in double figures and we won. But that had to be one of
the funnest games to coach in that I've had in my career, and it had to be
awesome for the fans and for television.  
I think there were 13 or 15 ties in the game. The players were just making
plays. It was just a beautiful women's basketball game. I thought well
executed by both teams, and just‑‑ I think when I watch it on film, I'm going
to have even more film. I just thought it was amazing. And it's not like
nobody choked or there was some all of moment. Everything was just really
positive. Both coaches were really positive with their teams and players made
plays.  
There were some awesome young people out there playing with toughness and
guts, and I got two of them to my right here and they carried us. They were
unbelievable. But I will say that if I had a third up here, I would have
Michelle Woods, because her defensive effort on Kelsey Plum was as fine an
effort as you're ever going to watch.  
  
Q. To be able to come into the NCAA Tournament and to put together the game
that you had today, I watched a little during warm ups and it looked like you
were in a zone. Did you feel going out there that you could do something like
what you did today?  
ADRIENNE MOTLEY: I woke up from my nap after pregame and was like, I feel
pretty good right now. Just going out there and getting a feel for the court.
I know Coach asked mehow I felt out there, and I was just like, it feels good.
I just had this kind of feeling today, and it just so happened that we came
out here and we executed and I was just hitting shots. That's basically what
it is. My teammates were setting me up and just talking to me as they usually
do. Today it just felt different. Like I said, just a different feel.  
  
Q. (No mic).  
ADRIENNE MOTLEY: No. I don't think so. It was just we really needed this game
and we worked so hard for it. I think everybody realized that when we play
hard and when we come together, great things can happen.  
  
Q. As Coach said, you've always prided yourselves on your defense and what
Michelle was able to do today; can you tell us what you were able to do with
Kelsey and maybe talk about Michelle's performance in particular?  
JESSICA THOMAS: Shelly's performance actually is what motivated us. You see
her going so hard on the backcourt and pressuring Plum, one of the best
players in the Pac‑12‑‑ not the best, but you see that happening, in the
backcourt, you're just, well, we've got to do our part. You're working your
tail off, we've to do our part in the back. Just came down to big rebounds,
big stops, big steals. All glory to Shelly; she played really well.  
COACH MEIER: If game time was 11:00, what time was the nap? (Laughter) All
right, go to bed.  
  
Q. Would you elaborate on what your student athletes had to stay?  
COACH MEIER: Yeah, looking at it, I think we got 66 of our 86 points from our
three starting guards, and yet that's not what we are going to talk about.
It's going to be their defensive effort. Jessica was being humble, too, but
she did, there's a lot of pressure on our guards to defend today and the fact
that they defended with such passion and energy.  
And then we had 66 of our 86 points, that's got a lot to do with weight room
and conditioning. We had the ten days where we really needed to get back to
who we were. We were kind of limp towards the end of the season and now we're
fresh again.  
  
Q. Mike talked yesterday about the pace, and your girls talked about the
pace being an advantage. Those practices, that conditioning that you guys did
in that ten days, if you could put into words what you saw out there and the
difference it made.  
COACH MEIER: The last thing I said at halftime when we were walking out is,
nobody's tired, nobody's hurt and nobody needs a sub. You just have to keep
this mentality. There's nothing to wait around for anymore. I said, spill it
out there on the court, spill it out there, you have to, and that's what they
did.  
There's times I thought in the first half, I thought our pace was really the
reason why‑‑ we had a great defensive stops at the end of the half, I think
maybe 2 for 17 they went and 0 for their last 9 they had not had a field goal.
I do believe that was our defense, it was the result of our offense's pace.
Our defense did hold but I thought we had an advantage there.  
  
Q. Adrienne also had the big game against Notre Dame.  
COACH MEIER: She is somebody that her pull‑up when she goes to shoot it, the
person on the bench is counting, they are already writing two as soon as she
elevates, it's just so consistent. If we get ourselves in situations where get
her teammates move the ball properly and we can get her in what we call
downhill a little bit, she's really hard to guard.  
And that Notre Dame game and this game, I thought it was‑‑ they did a great
job. She didn't start with the ball a lot but she sure ended up with it a
little bit.  
  
Q. A big play, Davenport got the rebound after the missed free throw and
kept the possession; can you just talk about that play?  
COACH MEIER: It was huge. It was really huge. The game was never‑‑ when they
took that five‑point lead, we've had a lot of close games. We've had a lot of
big‑time players make big‑time plays in our face and some are heartbreaking,
sometimes we are the ones making the plays. So we have been through it and I
thought nobody got rattled. I thought that was huge.  
But it's funny, because part of the pregame speech, I said, you know, you have
the confidence; you have enough big wins, you have the resumé, but you also
have the pain. You have the pain of some of these losses. You have the pain of
a missed box‑out. You have the joy of getting an offensive rebound on a missed
free throw, and we have won a game that way, too, and then it happened again
today with Erykah. That was the joy part that we really love. It was a huge
play by a freshman.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll let Coach get on with the business of getting prepared
for Sunday. Thank you.

_IOWA CITY, IOWA_  
  

MIAMI  86  
WASHINGTON - 80

  
COACH NEIGHBORS: Really want to thank the University of Iowa and the NCAA for
treating us first class. Our message to these three kids here when she showed
up at Washington four years ago was that the NCAA Tournament is a very special
thing. It took us four years to get here.  
But I can tell you that they have been treated in a first‑class manner; that
it was everything we had built it up to be and even more. So thanks to Iowa
for hosting, they are doing a great job and NCAA for treating us tremendously.  
Congratulations to Miami. They were tremendous this afternoon. I thought their
players did exactly what their players have been doing all year long. I
thought Michelle Woods really led her team, and Motley did the scoring and
they all just rebounded and really played a good game.  
All the credit goes to them. We were just standing back there in the media
room thinking that that was one ever our better games that we played. They got
us at our best and they beat us and our congratulations go to them.  
  
Q. Talia, looked be like down the stretch you needed one more bucket to get
over the hump. Was that the case ‑‑ you had some good looks, if one of those
shots would have gone.  
TALIA WALTON: Through the course of the game, coach always said you don't know
what play it is that's going to be a determining factor from flip to buzzer. I
think a lot of shots in the first half we missed, we normally make, the whole
team. But I think we fought really hard, and it was nice at the end of the
stretch for a couple of those to go down.  
  
Q. Maybe a little hard now but can you sum up your Washington career and
being able to end it in the NCAA Tournament, and just all you've gone
through?  
JAZMINE DAVIS: To sum it up, I would say I'm really proud of us. I'm really
proud of how we played tonight and I'm just glad that I have the opportunity
to play with such great women on this team. It made me a better person on and
off the court, and those are the moments and memories that I'll cherish and
take on with me.  
AMINAH WILLIAMS: It's been just an amazing ride starting from my freshman year
and ending at my senior year by going to the NCAA Tournament. I'm just really
thankful for the opportunity.  
  
Q. There was a lot of talk coming in about the pace in which Miami played
and in Coach said it looked like the video was faster, had been speeded up.
What was your thoughts going through it how quickly they can play and how
quickly they can move up and down the court?  
TALIA WALTON: Coach didn't exaggerate. They are extremely fast. They have a
lot of good players, good guards that can push the ball and keep the tempo
going the entire game and that works to their favor. They executed very well
tonight.  
So they were extremely fast, I would say that, as opposed to going back and
forth, back and forth with them, it was tiring. But you just fight through it
and big credit to them.  
COACH NEIGHBORS: You know, those three kids there‑‑ Talia is a redshirt
freshman, so she came in with those kids did. Their first day on campus was
one of my first days on campus. I was an assistant coach then.  
Y'all cover this game enough to know that in today's society, when things get
tough, sometimes a lot of kids don't stick it out. They transfer; they look
for the easy road.  
This group had about three or four chances to change and break apart. They
went through two coaching changes while they were there. One on their way to
campus. We had ups and downs and they could have at any point in time taken
that easy road and done what a lot of student athletes over the last four
years have done and they did not, in fact, they stuck together and they raised
the level of play at the University of Washington and expectations at the
University of Washington, and they will leave a legacy that's going to take a
long time to really supplant.  
  
Q. You talked about this being the best game you played all year. What would
have been the thing that would have made it a victory?  
COACH NEIGHBORS: Yeah, I think we could have made a few more plays. The first
half, we got some really good shots. At halftime maybe Kelsey and Jazz were
one‑for‑seven. Those numbers may be a little off, but I think that's pretty
close. I think we were a little nervous, and it's to be expected.  
Again, when we built this up for four years like we have, we were all nervous
mand it took some of us a little bit longer to get over it. If we could have
shaken the jitters off a bit earlier, that could have been the difference. It
was a one‑possession game down there so with he had to start fouling.  
Really proud of our kids for fighting back when we got down double‑digits to
go back and take the lead. We probably could have made a play or two more, and
maybe come up with a tough rebound. There was a couple times we got stops and
instead of being a rebound to go in transition, it turned into a jumped ball
and we had to defend on the out‑of‑bounds play.  
So I don't know that we were‑‑ that we executed the best that we have all year
but it was really, really close and they certainly took our best effort and
were able to win.  
  
Q. After they missed a couple free throws and the freshmen came in and got
the rebound ‑‑  
COACH NEIGHBORS: That was the one I was really specifically talking about.
Still a one‑possession game at that point. We could have gone down three.
Instead, she gets that rebound and it changes the complexion of the game.  
We work on that an awful lot, and you know, you can have the best technique in
the world and sometimes the ball just doesn't bounce your way. So I can live
with a couple of those but that rebound was a huge play for them. And I
thought it kind of turned the momentum. It maybe took a little bit of fire out
of our kids.  
I think our kids still thought until that rebound there was plenty of time and
a chance; but you could see the difference in their eyes when you brought them
out. We were having to go offense, defense at the end and when that offensive
group came out, there was a little bit of look in our eye like, that was our
chance, and you nailed it right on the head. That was a good observation.  
  
Q. Their early shooting, were you comfortable with the shots that Plum had,
maybe just didn't go down?  
COACH NEIGHBORS: Absolutely. We need to play fast. You hear it talked about a
lot in the Tournament, it's all about match‑ups. I would have preferred a team
that wasn't used to playing at the pace that we are. I think they probably
were really excited about the draw because they knew we wanted to play fast.  
I'm okay with it. And I think 99 times out of a hundred, a lot of those shots
go down. Just a general statement, too. Anybody that over the last few years
says women's basketball is not entertaining to watch, they didn't watch that
game. There were only ten turnovers combined by the two teams. Had to be a 90
possession game, up‑tempo, very athletic. I thought it was very well played.
And I hope a lot of people got to watch it and we'll continue to support
women's basketball because it's a great game.

_IOWA CITY, IOWA_  
  

IOWA  75  
AMERICAN - 67

  
COACH GEBBIA: Seeing kids cry in the locker room is never an easy thing. I'm
so proud of them; they have never been here before. They have never played in
front of so many fans before cheering against them, and yet throughout the
entire game, they thought. And if you told me we were going to shoot 44
percent from two, 43 percent from three, and 87 percent from the line and
lose, I would have been shocked by that.  
I just think that this group represented American University extremely well
and the Patriot League extremely well. Had three great seniors that have led
us all year.  
Iowa is a terrific team. They just shot better than we did, which, credit to
them, playing on their home court, home crowd, ready for the Tournament, you
have to give them credit. But I'm just so proud of this team because they were
able to keep it close the entire way.  
  
Q. You guys got behind by ten or 12 and then cut it down 69 ‑64 and had two
possessions where you had 3‑pointers. Anything in particular that you were
trying to get out of those possessions against Iowa's zone, it was tough to
get shots it looked like.   
JEN DUMIAK: Yeah, it was tough getting shots. They are long, probably longer
than most teams we've faced this year, especially in our league. We were just
looking for an open shot, honestly, just a bucket. Ari was on fire. I think
one of her rimmed in and out.  
We just wanted to score, really. Obviously they didn't fall and they were
critical possessions but that's the way the game goes.  
  
Q. Ari, you seemed to have the really hot hand today. What was it about
Iowa's defense that let you get such great opportunities?  
ARI BOOTH: I had a lot of space pretty much, and if you give me that much
space, I'm going to shoot it. Again, I was getting great screens from my post
players and I just felt good about it, had a clean look and was able to shoot
it.  
  
Q. Following up to that, what happened in the second half? It took a really
long time for you to get another basket. Were they just a little more
cognizant of your position?  
ARI BOOTH: Yeah, they started pressuring me a little more and getting their
hands up as soon as I caught the ball, so I had to either dribble or pass it.  
  
Q. It was a big crowd, kind of noisy. Did it cause any trouble as far as
setting up the plays or directing the whole offense?  
JEN DUMIAK: Not so much in the first half, but definitely in the second half
when it got loud in their zone, we were trying to call out plays. We have hand
signals but I'm not the best as using them or remembering them. So that's kind
of a problem.  
But yeah, I mean, it was great playing in front of the crowd, even though they
were rooting against us, it's just a great atmosphere. For us seniors we've
never really had that. To kind of go out with that, it was really nice.  
  
Q. If I may, as a senior, can you explain for the group the journey, the
experience this week, the game today from your perspective as a senior?  
ARRON ZIMMERMAN: Women's basketball has never done that before, so that was
just the start to an amazing experience. Got a chartered jet here, just
something that so many people on our team have not ever had before. Most of us
have never had it before. Just an amazing experience‑‑ thank you.  
It was just a lot of good things that we didn't even know that we would be
getting and it's just been an awesome experience. We were so happy to play
today. Just wanted to come out and give them a game, and we can go out saying
that we did that.  
COACH GEBBIA: Jen, getting her three that she made, that was her 100th of her
career ‑‑ so I was really hoping that was going to go in.  
Jen's Patriot League Player of the Year, Scholar Athlete of the Year, First
Team Academic All‑American; what she's done for our program has been amazing.
And as a head coach, you don't know if you'll ever coach another kid that can
do both extremely well.  
So Jen, I'm going to miss you a ton, and I appreciate all the effort and
energy you put in. She's really bought in. I don't know if most of you know,
but she changed from a two guard to a point guard this year. So she's actually
playing out of position‑‑ but maybe not. Looking back, I wish I would have
last year put her at that position. She's been terrific.  
I think people that come in in the future can look at Jen Dumiak and say, I
want to be like her, I want to play like her. That's a compliment to her and
the effort and energy she's put into her game. Thank you, Jen.  
Arron has been‑‑ Arron's had an interesting senior year. Arron has not scored
as much as she has in the past, at least from last year to this year but she's
done so many intangible things for us. We've said it before‑‑ she finally
showed up today. She's been struggling and been shooting the three a ton in
practice, and it finally paid off for her at a big time. That's what seniors
do, they show up when they need to show up, and I feel so proud those two
because they were able to do that.  
And AB is called the 'Silent Assassin' for a reason. She's probably the
quietest kid on the team, but at the same time she's got a bold confidence
about her and you guys got a chance to witness that from her tonight, and I
expect big things from her next year when she comes back. So really proud of
the group and I'm just glad we could make it a game.  
  
Q. Arron, wonder if you felt like Iowa just wasn't quite aware of your 3
‑point shooting prowess, and as you were able to get loose a little bit more
as they were concentrating on Ari. And what was the discussion at halftime?
You have a tie game at that point.   
ARRON ZIMMERMAN: Shooting‑wise, I probably wouldn't have guard me at the
three‑point line, either. I have not been shooting well. But I hit fire and
just had confidence in my shot and kept shooting.  
At halftime as long as we were down by a few or tied or up by a few, we felt
confident going into the second half. We've been a second half team and we
were just ready to come out and compete again.  
We knew the second half, they were going to come out ready to go. Maybe they
were a little surprised by us in the first half. But second half, we knew we
were going to have to come out strong and knew we were going to have to battle
and that it was going to be another 20‑minute battle. I think they hit some
big shots and we did what we could, but it was a game.  
  
Q. Why does Booth not start?  
COACH GEBBIA: That's a good question. Well, you know, we did start her earlier
in the year one game. Just seems like she plays better coming off the bench,
so that's why we went to that.  
We started our freshman, who pretty much was a little scared today I think.
You know, since we had started that freshman, Emily Kinneston, we've been on a
win streak. So it's kind of like a superstition and we also know AB likes to
come off the bench and light it up. That's probably why. She'll probably start
next year. We'll see.  
  
Q. The NCAA went back to this top seeds hosting again and it got the crowd
they were looking for. Your kids seem to indicate playing in front of a crowd
is big, even though it might be to your disadvantage.  
COACH GEBBIA: Yeah, I think that's a great point. I've been to the NCAA
Tournament several times, and I've had the opportunity to do both: To play on
a team's home floor and a neutral site location. I watch the men's tournament
and I see how many upsets there are because all those games are at neutral
site locations, yet I know they still get crowds.  
But I said to my team when I walked into the locker room, I said, if this was
a neutral site location game today, there's a good chance we could have won
this, because maybe they don't shoot the ball as well. It's disappointing, but
I will never take away the fan support that Iowa has. It's impressive.  
Like I said, I've been to many tournament games and never played in front of
this many people in a first round game. I've enjoyed it. The people are
friendly here. I really like them; they are very nice.  
Yeah, it's tough. If I had to pick my poison, I'd probably choose neutral
sites.

_IOWA CITY, IOWA_  
  

IOWA  75  
AMERICAN - 67

  
COACH BLUDER: Just want to congratulate American on a great year. I thought
they played very, very well. I think coach has done a tremendous job in two
years getting that program to the NCAA Tournament. They came here on an
11‑game win streak. I thought they played outstanding, did just a great job,
so congratulations to Megan and American on a fabulous year.  
Proud of our team's efforts, five people in double figures, I love that. We
shot the ball well, especially from three‑point range and from the free throw
line. Hit our free throws down crunch time when we needed to.  
I also want to thank the crowd that came out today. I thought they were just
instrumental. You get down to crunch time and you have a great crowd behind
you; I thought we used the home‑court advantage today, and that was really
nice to see. Hopefully we'll get a great crowd at 11 o'clock on Sunday.  
  
Q. What happened there at the beginning of the second half where you finally
took control of the game?  
SAM LOGIC: I think we got a couple more defensive stops. We want to push out
in transition, and you know, really attack the paint so we can get some
threes, and I think Al shot the ball really well today for us, which really
spreads the floor.  
So we had to get those rebounds, though, and get some stops so that we can
push, and we were getting stops on defense in order to get that so they
weren't getting their points. But we just turned them into ours.  
  
Q. Melissa, they came out in the first half and were shooting ‑‑ set the
place on fire. Did you realize with them shooting from the outside that you
guys might need you to equal that?   
MELISSA DIXON: Yeah, we knew that American was going to be a really good team
and they have a lot of great players. But shooting is something that is a
strong point for us every game, and we did really well at that tonight.  
  
Q. Everybody always said they take it one game at a time and don't look at
the seedings or whatnot, but was there a point where you thought, we're in an
actual battle here; was there a point to say, okay, we need to focus even more
than we already are?  
SAM LOGIC: Yeah, I don't think we ever overlooked them. I thought we did a
really good job in practice, knowing that they run their stuff well; they will
run the shot clock down as much as they can, and they will be disciplined
throughout that.  
I think they hit a couple more threes than we originally probably scouted for.
They got some open looks towards the end being patient. That was just
something we had to fight through.  
So in that sense maybe you had to focus a little bit more but it wasn't
anything that we didn't expect. But they just did a really good job of hitting
some threes, especially in the first half.  
MELISSA DIXON: We knew once the game started, seeds didn't matter anymore.
Everyone is going to play their best game in this tournament, do‑or‑die. So we
were prepared for them to play their best game and we knew that from the
start.  
  
Q. Defensively in the second half, your zone seemed to really bother them,
even though they had shot the ball well from the outside in the first half.
What were you doing that was causing them such problems?  
SAM LOGIC: We moved on the pass a little bit better. I think when you can
contest shots and contest the ball, just so it slows down a little bit from
moving so quickly, and getting not open shots or being able to reverse the
ball really fast; we did a good job of that, and I think we did a little bit
better boxing out in the second half, too.  
Sometimes they get an offensive rebound and will run it again so you're on
defense for about 50 seconds and then hit a three in the first half. I think
we limited that in the second half, too.  
MELISSA DIXON: We were really aggressive in the zone. We were getting some
deflections which were leading to steals and stops. Our zone has been good for
us all year and we are good playing zone.  
  
Q. What would you say was the biggest surprise playing against American?  
SAM LOGIC: I don't think anything they really did surprised us. I think our
coaches did a really good job on scout. Like I said before, I think they
probably hit a couple more threes than we probably thought. But credit to
them, they are a good shooting team and we didn't think they are not going to
hit any.  
But they hit a couple more than we anticipated, and we gutted it out and we
are going to take everyone's best shot in this tournament and we are going to
take any kind of win right now.  
  
Q. Do you have any specific examples being the fifth seed today, 14th seed
coming into your building? What was your message to the girls about the
ballgame today, and was there any motivation from the downfalls of some other
teams that have been in this situation?  
COACH BLUDER: Absolutely not. I did not want to bring that up one little bit;
that there had been so many upsets in the men's side of things. So we didn't
talk about that whatsoever.  
  
Q. Bad time to be a three seed, but at least you survived with that. Don't
want to be negative but is there anything that you think your team needs to do
better? I know maybe it's too early to scout Miami, but that you need to
sharpen up for Sunday?  
COACH BLUDER: Absolutely. We need to do a better job on the boards than we did
tonight. We need to do a better job in transition defense than we did tonight.
You know, I always find things we need to work on, but definitely those things
we need to do a better job with.  
  
Q. What do you think changed the second half around?  
COACH BLUDER: Melissa got open for some threes and I think that is just great
momentum for us when we can get those threes going. I think that was a big
deal for us.  
You know, in the first half, I thought Booth really kept them in the game. I
think‑‑ you ask somebody, what's the surprise, that would be the sun surprise
for me. I thought she overplayed what she usually does, and so to me she
really kept them in the game. But she had 14 in the half and only three in the
second half. So our players did a much better job identifying her in the
second half. And I'll take credit for the first half, letting her loose,
because I didn't have them prepared for her enough.  
  
Q. Third consecutive season round of 32, is there a different feeling in
Iowa City heading into this year's tournament than the last year here?  
COACH BLUDER: You know, it feels good to be‑‑ I think there's less than 20
teams that have accomplished that in the country. Been to the third round
three years in a row. So we are very proud of that.  
Does it feel differently? I think it does because of the senior leadership,
because of the experience we have in our team and because they have been
around so much. Today was their eighth NCAA Tournament game and Sunday will be
their ninth NCAA Tournament game. I think that experience really helps.  
Again, I can't say enough about our crowd today. I thought they were
outstanding. I thought they were loud. I thought they helped us. It really
felt like a home court and we are really going to need that Sunday.  
So I thought they were outstanding, and I think that's one thing different in
the NCAA Tournament, you don't always get a home court. Certainly nice to have
that three years in a row. But this year I think our expectations are just a
little different. We know Miami is a great team. They have the upset today.
They have played extremely well. We'll probably talk about them a lot more
tomorrow.  
  
Q. How big was Whitney Jennings today?  
COACH BLUDER: I thought Whitney played very well. She came back‑‑ we gave them
a little time off, and I thought she came back with a kind of different
attitude. I think our little Logansport girl went back to the berry bowl (ph)
and got a feel back for what it feels like to put the ball in the hole. She
was so successful as Miss Indiana Basketball, and I thought she all week has
played very, very well and tonight I thought she did, too. Again, five players
in double figures, I love that.  
  
Q. What do you know about Miami so far; 86 points today. How do you slow
them down?  
COACH BLUDER: Again, I don't know a whole lot about them, and again tomorrow
at our press conference, I'll be able to talk a lot more about them.  
Again, upset today, great for them. I know that they have beat a No.1 seed,
Notre Dame. They beat a No.2 seed, Florida State. Obviously they are a great
team from a really good conference. And so we know we are going to have our
work cut out for us on Sunday. Hopefully again home court is going to help us
out a little bit.  
  
Q. Sam alluded to the fact that they ran the clock down quite a bit. They
seemed to have an uncanny ability to hit shots at that point. Was that
something you were ready for?  
COACH BLUDER: We felt they were going to be patient: Push when it was there;
patient when it wasn't there. And that's good basketball. That's excellent
basketball. And they had a good game plan, and they stuck to it and those are
kids you like to coach that really believe in your game plan and go out and
perform it.  
You know, I thought they were very confident, especially Jen with the ball in
her hands as the clock was going off, going down there at the end.  
Yeah, they hit probably more end‑of‑shot‑clock shots on us than I've seen all
year.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Lisa.

## March 19, 2015

  

### [Suriya McGuire](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28727)

### [Katie Meier](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23619)

### [Adrienne Motley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28316)

  
_IOWA CITY, IOWA_  
  
COACH MEIER: We are thrilled to be here. We returned to Iowa City and we are
thrilled to be in the tournament first of all and we had some nervous days
there, and wither in a mind‑set we are very, very grateful but when you give
Miami an opportunity, we are going to take it and we have been opportunistic
all season. So we are in a great mind‑set, great game, and our kids are
excited, but hungry, and we want to prove something here.  
I'm always very, very happy; I think this is one of the classiest athletic
departments and institutions in the country. They run such a great tournament.
When we saw Iowa City again, people said, oh, no, we are like, no, it's
awesome there. Great crowds, great support and special environment.  
We are happy to be here and have a heck of a matchup in Washington. I think
this is one of the more exciting first day games in the whole tournament,
Miami versus Washington. Good scoring from the backcourts on both teams and
the physicality and tempo. So I think a lot of TV sets should tune into this
game.  
  
Q. What's the challenge you face on the backcourt with Davis and Plum,
what's the challenge they present?  
COACH MEIER: To be honest, I remember watching one of their games and hearing
that Davis was their all‑time leading scorer. She's great, 2,000 points.  
Kelsey Plum and I are very familiar with each other. We did USA Basketball
together and spent some time with Luana (ph); I believe her mother is the one
that brought me hair dye on the last day of the World Championships because my
hair grayed out a little bit trying to get that Gold Medal. Katie Plum came by
the hotel and gave us hair dye.  
Pretty familiar with Kelsey and her ability, but yeah, their backcourt is
phenomenal. Mike does a great job of giving them space and room I think we
have very similar offensive philosophies.  
THE MODERATOR: Can you comment on the experience of participating in the NCAA
Tournament?  
SURIYA McGUIRE: It's a great experience for me. I know it's what I really
wanted for my last year, playing with Coach, this is my third time being in
the NCAA Tournament, and like she said, it's just an opportunity we are ready
to take on and I'm just excited to play tomorrow.  
ADRIENNE MOTLEY: I agree with Suriya. It's just a great first experience for
me and something I definitely want to look forward to and keep going to it in
the previous seasons. Just play our hearts out, because a lot of teams don't
get this opportunity. So just focus on living in the moment.  
  
Q. Would you like to comment specifically on the two young women?  
COACH MEIER: I love them, and it's really obvious what they mean. Suriya's
journey here and having this reward being her journey is phenomenal. But I
think we are in the mind‑set of continuing to play and continuing this journey
and having a very, very forward, positive mind‑set.  
But when you coach and you have successful teams, and I've been blessed the
last couple years at Miami to be able to be in this tournament four of the
five; but each year isn't about me. It's about this particular group and their
particular journey and their rewards.  
And these two to my right absolutely deserve this. You'll see how hard they
play. You'll see that we don't hold back on emotion in our program, and that's
fine. We are going to show you who we are. We are going to give you our
hearts. We are going to fight and claw and do whatever needs to be done. We
are going to celebrate, and we'll do whatever it takes, so these two will
bring that out in me and I think I bring that out in them.  
THE MODERATOR: As a University of Iowa staff member, I appreciate your nice
comments. But is there any particular advantage having been in Carver‑Hawkeye
Arena so recently?  
COACH MEIER: I think so, the crowd‑‑ it's a real positive crowd, too. We've
played some in environments this year in the ACC, but the Iowa City folk are
awesome people. They are real positive. And so they cheer, they know
basketball like crazy. You hear some comments, I remember scouting the game
before, and being like, my God, these fans are smart. Like they were saying
high‑level kind of things. I thought, wow, they know what they are doing here.  
It's fun. And listen, as serious as this is and how much of a business it's
becoming and everything else, there's pure joy in our program and I think
there's joy here in Iowa City so we are happy it matched up again.  
  
Q. Does Washington remind you of anybody, comparable to anybody in
conference play that you've seen?  
COACH MEIER: In a way, a little bit Virginia I thought presented a lot of the
same‑‑ we just recently have played them. The backcourt talent of Notre Dame
we have matched up with, too.  
But when we are watching film on each other and I'm sure Mike is saying the
same thing, we run a lot of the same stuff. We have a lot of the same
concepts, so in guarding and not having the scout team because we had to leave
on Tuesday and everything else, okay; we had to play against each other. It's
pretty familiar.  
ADRIENNE MOTLEY: I have to as far as Virginia, just having two big guards, and
their post players that can shoot the three, too. So pretty much everybody on
the floor is vulnerable just like Virginia, you have to bring your P's and
Q's.  
SURIYA McGUIRE: Like Adrienne said, their guards remind me a lot of Virginia's
guards, their ability to take anybody one‑on‑one is very much the same. Their
posts are very diverse. They can shoot and they can post up, but to have the
ability to pass the ball ‑‑ as a guard; so I can just say that Virginia is
very tough.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST & 2ND ROUNDS: IOWA
CITY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+%26+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+IOWA+CITY)

  

## March 19, 2015

  

### [Jazmine Davis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24833)

### [Mike Neighbors](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28339)

### [Kelsey Plum](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28340)

  
_IOWA CITY, IOWA_  
  
COACH NEIGHBORS: Very honored to be here. Really excited about our bid to play
in the NCAA Tournament. Proud for Jaz as a senior who came four years ago when
our program was not really considering be played in the NCAA Tournament, and
she's led us here along with Aminah Williams, another senior. Talia Walton
came in with that class.  
With the infusion of some young kids, Kelsey included, very excited to be part
of this tournament and we know we have a tremendous opponent in Miami in the
first round and we are excited to be in Iowa City.  
  
Q. Wonder if you can discuss the impact Kelsey has had on your program in
two years.  
COACH NEIGHBORS: She came in freshman‑ready to make an impact. She didn't come
in expecting to get her feet wet and kind of get acclimated. She came in ready
to play and we needed that, because we had this class I just mentioned, with
Jaz, Aminah and Talia sitting there waiting; and we needed the infusion of a
player that came in confident, that came in ready to compete.  
And she gave us just that. These kids that I mentioned first, welcomed here
with open arms and really blended in to a cohesive group over a very, very
short period of time.  
And that's really hard to do, and it really says a lot about the kid to my
immediate right who is our school's all‑time leading scorer and at that point
in time had been taking the bulk of the offensive load on her shoulder.  
For her to come in and mentor a young player, develop her into the leader that
Jaz had been for us, was tremendous. And as a result, I think Jaz has had her
best two seasons, as well. Her leadership, her distribution, command of the
offense, and making everybody else on the floor better has just really
continued to grow. You can see that in the growth of Talia Walton, another
player that has had a tremendous season for us, a very consistent season.  
But Kelsey's insurgence into a team of kids that had developed a pretty good
identity was the difference in us playing in the NIT Tournament and the NCAA
Tournament.  
THE MODERATOR: What can fans expect to see on the floor tomorrow from the
Huskies?  
COACH NEIGHBORS: If we play like we're capable of, we're very efficient. We
don't turn the all over a lot. We are one of the top teams in the country in
turnover rate. We don't normally turn it over a lot but we are playing a team
that tries to turn you over a bunch.  
So you should see a team that's very hard to guard. Everybody I talked to when
they prepare for us say that we are really difficult to defend because we can
really space the floor. We have got a lot of weapons. We are not just one‑ or
two‑dimensional. We have a lot of kids that can really score, and we play
pretty fast. That's a little unexpected kind of when you look at our team
pictures. You don't really expect that.  
So I think we are a little bit‑‑ it's kind of a surprise. It's fun. I think
that makes it fun. That's the reaction I get from a lot of people who see us
for the first time, and hopefully you'll see that tomorrow.  
  
Q. Jazmine, what does it mean to you to be back in the NCAA Tournament as a
senior?  
JAZMINE DAVIS: It means a lot. I would say it just means, one, it's our motto.
It's something that we stand by. And we put a lot of hard work into this and
we stuck together through a lot of adversity as a team, especially with the
coaching changes. We just got together and we are one.  
  
Q. Kelsey, what's your reaction to being in Iowa City and participating in
the NCAA Tournament?  
KELSEY PLUM: Just to add on to Jaz, this team's been through a lot the last
couple years, and I just think it shows the resilience of our team. We've had
some ups and downs, but we've been able to stick together and we're really
excited to be here.  
  
Q. What kind of team do you think see at your opponent? What can we
expect?  
COACH NEIGHBORS: I purposely said I'm going to stay away from the term
athletic, because I think that sometimes it doesn't accurately label this
team. They are very, very skilled. They make shots. They create shots. And
they do it at a really fast pace.  
I accused our video girl of showing me the film and speeding it halftime
because I thought it was not accurate, but that was realtime. So it took me a
minute to adjust to that. They are very, very skilled and they do it with a
pace that can be uncomfortable if you allow it to be.  
So we know that we have got to use our momentum and our craftiness to use that
against them, but it's a tremendous challenge.  
We have a few teams in our conference that play that way but it's not really
the way our conference is set up. We tried to schedule a couple non‑conference
games in Texas A&M and Florida State that play that way and we had good
success against those two teams, so hopefully we can carry that over.  
I want to echo what these two guys said and just briefly hit on, I think this
group right here is a real good example for a lot of people out there to stick
together when times of tough. Jaz's group, particularly, had four different
coaches impact them at the college level, some recruiting, some coaching. And
in our climate of college athletics right now, a lot of kids would have left
and none of those kids did. Jaz, Aminah, Talia, they stuck together and they
embraced this group that came in.  
There were many opportunities for them to not stand up and face adversity, and
I think in our climate of our athletics situation today, that's too easy to do
and I'm really proud of this group to be able to have stuck together and be up
here representing the NCAA Tournament.  
  
Q. New arena, new environment, I know in talking with players it takes maybe
a shoot around or two to get a feel for the court, the shooter's eye, things
like that. How long does it take or is there more made of that from the
player's perspective?  
JAZMINE DAVIS: For us, I think we got well‑adjusted to the court yesterday. We
are fine. We are used to being in different environments. It's a court; we
play on basketball courts every day, so it doesn't really matter. We're fine.  
COACH NEIGHBORS: Jaz, we're not playing in the practice gym tomorrow.  
JAZMINE DAVIS: We're in Iowa, it doesn't matter. (Laughter) doesn't matter.  
KELSEY PLUM: As long as the rim is ten feet, I think we're okay. The ball is
round, we're fine.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

### [Shaquilla Curtis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28739)

### [Jen Dumiak](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28738)

### [Arron Zimmerman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28737)

  
_IOWA CITY, IOWA_  
  
COACH GEBBIA: We are excited to be here. This is American University Women's
Basketball's first time in the NCAA Tournament. So these young ladies, these
seniors sitting in front of me have done a terrific job in leading this team
to their first‑ever title.  
Being in the Tournament for the first time is an exciting time, a fun time,
and we are just happy that we get to play a terrific Iowa team who has been to
the Tournament several times and they are very talented and a smart time, and
we just look forward to the challenge of being out there and hoping to make a
game of it.  
  
Q. Could you just describe Iowa, what problems they present for you?  
COACH GEBBIA: Iowa, because they are so well balanced, I think one through
five, they all can score. They shoot the ball extremely well from the
perimeter, and they have a terrific center in Doolittle, great young lady, who
is a tough person to guard inside. It kind of stretches our defense out a
little bit and we have been working a lot on our defense all year.  
So not being able to help off as much as we would like to presents a problem
for us, and having to contest all threes that they are going to take. With the
heady point guard who is a terrific player and their senior leader, it's going
to be a challenge for us to stop her in transition. We have a lot of things to
figure out and work on. But again, we are excited for the challenge.  
  
Q. Could you compare Sam Logic with Jen? They have remarkable similarities,
both academically and on the court it seems like.  
COACH GEBBIA: Yeah, that's the first thing I think we said to Jen when we
started watching film on Iowa was that, you know, her counter part at the same
position, basically plays the same way in that they both kind of run the team.  
They run the team's tempo. They both like to get into the paint. They are both
big on getting the assist, as well as scoring. Just their feistiness and their
heart that they bring each and every day; they both go 100 percent every
possession, both ends of the court. So there's amazing similarities.  
And then off the court, I know the Logic kid is an Academic All‑American, and
Jen is a first‑team Academic All‑American and Patriot League scholar Athlete
of the Year. It will be interesting to watch those two go at it from a mental
perspective, as well, because a lot of the game has to do with decision making
and that side of the ball, so I'm excited to see how Jen competes.  
  
Q. I would like each student athlete to take an opportunity to speak briefly
about what it means to compete in the tournament.  
ARRON ZIMMERMAN: It's just an amazing experience so far. We are so happy to be
here, especially our senior year. It's something we have wanted since I
started playing basketball, we thought about coming here. Didn't realize how
hard it would be when I was that age.  
But as I worked through college and things like that, it's just awesome to get
here and nice way to end my senior year, so keep going.  
JEN DUMIAK: Yeah, I have to just to piggyback on what Arron said, I think we
first so hard to get to this point. Obviously the Patriot League, you're not
going to get an automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament.  
But we worked so hard: And then everything you work for in high school, and
then to college, just to get to the tournament and this point. So it's just an
honor to be here and we are just excited for the opportunity to compete and
play.  
SHAQUILLA CURTIS: To piggyback off of them it's really exciting. I know me
personally, I'm really, really excited. But like everyone else, it's about
working hard and getting in, and like Jen said, we don't have no automatic bid
to get in if we didn't win the Championship. But, I mean, we are here and
trying to play.  
  
Q. Coach Bluder earlier talked about the tremendous momentum you're bringing
into the tournament. I think she mentioned you had won 11 games in a row and
there's not a loss on your schedule; you have to go back to January. So what
does it mean to be bringing that kind of positive momentum into the
postseason?  
COACH GEBBIA: I think it's important because I think our team has generated
confidence over the last ten, 11 games, in themselves, with each other, with
our defense, and just being able to kind of control the games that we have
been a part of.  
That's going to be our biggest challenge tomorrow is can we control the tempo;
are we going to let it get out of control. We have worked on that. And I think
part of that has to do with the seniors and their leadership and the chemistry
of the team. The chemistry has grown throughout the year, which helps I think
any team as you go through the second half of the conference season and into
the postseason.  
I just love how this team bonds, how well they get along and how much they
care about each other. It's fun as a coach to watch it happen and just see
their faces and see how excited; every little thing from this point on is
exciting for them. You know, popcorn is the locker room is exciting; the
little things they don't know about until they get here.  
So like I said, it's just exciting to see this group come together at the
right time.  
  
Q. A lot of fans supporting Iowa, is that going to be a challenge with so
many fans for Iowa?  
COACH GEBBIA: I'm sure it will. I'm sure it will be loud and stuff here. We
have played in front of some crowds. We played at Maryland this year and there
was a lot of people there; another Big Ten team that's really, really good.  
We've had those opportunities but we talked about being able to do hand
signals and looking over to the bench more and making sure they know what they
are in. Might be a better question for them than me.  
  
Q. For Jen and Shaquilla. Can you just talk about what responsibilities the
guards are going to have to slow Iowa down, because they are going to try to
run, run, run the whole game.  
SHAQUILLA CURTIS: Well, first in transition, stopping it early, and then
making them play in the halfcourt.  
Also just playing a consistent‑‑ having a consistent offense and running
through our reads all the way through sometimes, and get the easy bucket.  
JEN DUMIAK: Yeah, I think the defensive end starts with Gurley (ph) picking
the ball up, giving Logic a hard time, bring the ball up the floor. Kind of
slowing it down and not letting her bet in the paint.  
But on the offensive end, it starts with me and I need to kind of understand
the game and how the game flow is going, and deciding when we can run and when
we need to slow it down and pull the ball out and run a halfcourt game. I
think both of those tasks kind of fall on our shoulders.

_IOWA CITY, IOWA_  
  
COACH BLUDER: We are very, very excited to be here, and I know everybody is
this time of year. But I think this year is special for us for a number of
reasons.  
One is we earned the right to play at home. We have been very happy to play at
home the last two years, but this year we had to earn it. We talked about that
at the beginning of the year, and it's really nice to see that happening this
weekend. Another reason why it's special is because of the three women that
are up here with me. These three have been just a big part of our program the
last four years and they have put in so much hard work to put themselves into
this situation.  
And so very excited for these three women, extremely, extremely talented
athletes.  
We know American is a great basketball team. They have not lost the entire
month of February or March. You have to go back to January to find a loss on
their schedule. They have won 11 straight.  
I think Megan Gebbia in two years has done a great job with the basketball
program at American and bringing them to their first NCAA Tournament. I'm
hoping that experience, the home court, will help us, because we understand ‑‑
you know, very good scorer in Jennifer Dumiak; they have a great three‑point
shooter in Zimmerman, and we know it's going to be a very, very good
basketball game tomorrow. I mean, they are holding opponents to 57 points, so
a very, very good defensive club.  
  
Q. Does American remind you of anybody that you've played, some team that we
could figure out?  
COACH BLUDER: I'll probably take that because I've seen more than they have.  
This goes back a long time, but these guys remember playing Marist last year
in the first round of the NCAA Tournament. Megan came from Marist, she was a
long‑time assistant coach there.  
They run a lot of the same things, and they are very good at reading switches,
reading screens, making you pay for not staying in your stance and having a
mess‑up basically on a screening situation, and they run a lot of unusual
screen action.  
So I know it goes back a year, but these guys remember preparing for that game
very well.  
  
Q. What sort of defenses do they like to play?  
COACH BLUDER: Almost all‑player.  
  
Q. You guys are 16 ‑0 at home this year. Just talk about what it's like
playing in Carver and to have a chance of playing potentially two more games
here.   
BETHANY DOOLITTLE: Yeah, we are obviously really excited to find out we were
hosting like Coach said. It was something that we really set our goals to at
the beginning of the year, being a Top‑16 team in the country, being able to
play in front of our fans at Carver.  
Obviously it's been our best year at Carver, and we just want to look to
continue that and obviously that starts tomorrow and can't look too far ahead
obviously. We are just excited and we love playing in front of our fans.  
  
Q. Playing a couple of the same opponents as American, does that help in
preparation?  
COACH BLUDER: Not really, because those opponents were so early in the season.
We have two common opponents. We both beat Gonzaga; we both lost to Maryland.
Again those are both in their non‑conference season, and both so long ago, I
don't think it really affords either team much advantage.  
  
Q. Melissa, what sort of ‑‑ have you guys watched much film at all on these
guys?   
MELISSA DIXON: Yes, we have watched film on American.  
  
Q. What sort of things do they like to do on perimeter defense?  
MELISSA DIXON: Defensively, well, they play all‑player, so we'll be ready for
that. They just play really good defense. So we'll be ready for that on
Friday.  
  
Q. It's been so long since you've played. How have you handled that? You
don't get breaks during the year; does it seem longer than a week and a half
or whatever it has been?  
BETHANY DOOLITTLE: I think last week we just focused on ourselves a little bit
because we didn't know who we were going to play. I think that was pretty
beneficial in our preparation for this game on Friday.  
I think we have been having pretty energized and focused practices, just kind
of focusing on our skills as a team, defensive, and rebounding like we have
been focusing on all year.  
So I don't think it's been a long time. It doesn't feel like a long time
because we've been practicing the whole time. I think that just will help us
out in this game Friday.  
  
Q. For Sam, this is kind of an unusual position for Iowa. You guys are
expected to win and you're expected to advance to the Sweet16. How do you sort
of handle that mentally?  
SAMANTHA LOGIC: I mean, I don't really think that our team really cares about
what other people expect of us. We set our own expectations for every single
game.  
So whether we are seeded three or six or eight like we have been our four
years, we go into every game expecting that we have a chance to win playing
well enough.  
So that's the way you have to approach it; just thinking what we have to do
and not really worrying about what other people are expecting you to do.  
  
Q. Their leading scorer, I don't remember her name right now, but she's a
guard. Can you sort of describe her game?  
COACH BLUDER: Yeah, she's a point guard. She is very, very effective when she
gets into the paint. She scores, really with great ease when she gets in
there. She scores from all different areas: Three‑point penetration; free
throw line, she's over a 90 percent free throw shooter. She shoots the most
free throws of anybody on the team. But, when she gets into the paint, she's
pretty deadly. We need to make sure that she stays out of the paint.  
She's really the key to the team. In my opinion, she's a big key to their
offensive success.  
  
Q. Can you comment on ‑‑ Sam just touched on it, but how important it is
that this is another game, despite the seed; how important is it to keep your
preparation the same as it's been all year?  
COACH BLUDER: Yeah, we've really tried to keep our preparation the same but
it's hard to say this is just another game.  
And I almost don't want them‑‑ I want them to understand, this is special.
This is a great opportunity for us to be playing in a national tournament on
our home court.  
It's not just another game. It's a very important game. It's a special
opportunity and we want to take full advantage of that opportunity to play at
home and to play again together for another game.  
But our preparation as far as getting ready for the opponent and the amount of
focus that we've spent in practice on them has been about the same as every
other game.  
  
Q. Earlier today, Coach Meier from Miami had some very kind words to say
about both the University of Iowa's athletic administration for their ability
to stage events, and how intelligent the fans at the University of Iowa are
about the game of basketball. Can you expand on that a little bit?  
COACH BLUDER: First of all, I think our administrators have done an
unbelievable job getting ready for this event.  
The last two years, we knew we were going to host and we had a year to prepare
for that, and that's a lot different than having four days to prepare for an
event of this magnitude and still making every athlete and every coach feel
special and feel like it is a national tournament.  
Kudos go to our administration, for not only getting ready but also for
embracing it; for wanting to have it here. We have the National Swim Meet
going on at the same time. This is incredible for us to have to stage both of
these events, and then to want to do it. It's amazing.  
So our administrators have done a great job.  
As far as our Hawk fans, I know it's a Friday tomorrow. I know it's during the
workday. I honestly believe they are still going to come out and support us.
They have been great. We had almost 10,000 in our last game and they have been
absolutely tremendous in supporting this team, and especially this group of
seniors.  
I think everybody realizes, you know, this is the last time you may see this
group on this court, and that's pretty good incentive to get out and support
us, no matter what time of the day it is and no matter what day of the week it
is.  
I'm pretty sure they will show up. I hope they will. They have been so
important to us all year and they know it, so I'm hoping that they will be
here tomorrow at 1:30.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_TEMPE, ARIZONA_  
  

Arizona State  57  
UALR - 54

  
JOE FOLEY: It was a great game. You know, somebody is going to win and
somebody is going to lose, but to have three seniors to show their character,
I can't say any more. It wasn't because we quit. Those guys, both teams played
with their hearts, both teams played their guts out. Somebody like I said is
going to win and lose, but I'm so proud of coaching these three seniors. This
has rejuvenated me in coaching. It makes me feel like there's kids that really
care, and it's a great feeling.  
  
Q. Gault, what changed in those last nine minutes of ASU's place or your
play to let them back into the game?  
TAYLOR GAULT: They were just determined. We never gave up, we just let little
things slip our minds, and they just came back and won.  
  
Q. Ka'Nesheia, you did such a good job of any time they started to get
something going to answer with a basket and turn them back. Was there one play
in particular that was just kind of overwhelming and you couldn't, that got
the crowd going or whatever?  
KA'NESHEIA COBBINS: No, I can't really point out just a single play. They had
their run. We didn't give up. We tried to hang in there, which we did, but no,
I can't pick out just a single play.  
  
Q. Ka'Nesheia, you went down in the second half midway through I think with
your right ankle. Was that something that ultimately ended up bothering you in
that last nine ‑minute stretch?   
KA'NESHEIA COBBINS: No, I just had a cramp.  
  
Q. Taylor, can you just speak on your start, just the first half for you
guys? I think you got up 12 in the first half and were up nine at halftime.
What was working for you and what was the feeling in the locker room there?  
TAYLOR GAULT: We just were doing what we've been doing, just had a lot of
energy, just were determined to have a good focused mind. We had our runs, but
their run just happened to be the last three minutes of the game.  
  
Q. Taylor, how proud are you guys to be part of that senior class that went
far in the tournament, was able to get Coach Foley's 700th win, a couple
bounces away from making a Sweet 16?  
TAYLOR GAULT: I'm very proud of my teammates and proud of Ka'Nesheia and
Kiera. We're just tough. Ka'Nesheia is just so tough for even being out there
because her ankle, and Kiera has given this team so much, and we're all just
so proud of each other. We don't have anything to hang our heads about because
we fought and we never gave up, and I couldn't ask for better teammates.  
  
Q. Taylor, when they made that banked ‑in three at the end of the shot clock
that got it within three, what was your reaction to that play, just kind of
the moment and how it got the crowd going?   
TAYLOR GAULT: Really the crowd never really bothered me. I really just shut
them out. I think most of us actually did. But the fact that it went in, I
think it was just a lucky shot. I mean, we were there, so it just went in.  
  
Q. Coach, what did you do, especially in that first half, where they were
pounding the post and you guys were playing really good defense, contesting
all their shots in the paint?  
JOE FOLEY: Well, I think they just wore us down. We had a lot more energy that
first half and of course they kept rotating. We knew they were going to and
they just kept pounding and pounding, and we just wore down. We didn't get
some block outs when we needed them, when they missed shots, free throws. We
knew they were going to‑‑ I felt like they were going to pound us the whole
game with their size, and that was the difference in the game. We just didn't
have enough energy to stay with it.  
  
Q. I think not long after that banked in three, was that possession where
they scored and the foul and they got the ball back. How deflating was that
and what did you see on that play?  
JOE FOLEY: Well, I thought that three they banked in, I thought that was the
difference in the game. If she hadn't made that shot and we get the rebound,
then it might have been a different outcome. That was huge right there.  
  
Q. Kind of the same question I posed to Taylor. How proud are you of this
group that was able to have a record ‑breaking season for you and a couple
bounces away from the Sweet 16?  
JOE FOLEY: Well, Ka'Nesheia didn't get to play last year so I didn't know how
she was going to come back. Kiera really went into a slump early in the year,
didn't play very well, and Taylor, until this year, defense didn't really mean
a whole lot. Three seniors, as I just got through telling you, watching three
seniors mature like they did the last three weeks of the season and care about
each other so much and come together and play so hard, that's what coaching is
all about. I mean, it was amazing what they've done in the last month of
basketball, and that's what you want out of your seniors. It's a great example
for our young kids, but to see three seniors lead like that and play like that
and to show the courage that they've showed, I mean, it's just unbelievable to
coach that right there.  
  
Q. Ka'Nesheia did a good job on Hempen for about 35 minutes. Was it the
cramp that limited her or she got kind of wore down like the others?  
JOE FOLEY: I think we wore down just a little bit. We don't have the depth
that they had and we are playing on their home floor and the home crowd picked
them up. It's a huge advantage. It's great for women's basketball. I'm not
complaining. I think it was a great atmosphere, but that helps. If we'd had a
crowd picking us up when we were down a little bit to give you that energy,
then you make a big play or something good happens for you, that's the
difference in a game. It's fun, and like I say, our kids‑‑ I couldn't ask any
more from a bunch of kids than what we got these two games and what we got
last week. I can't tell you how much respect I have for our basketball team,
and I have a lot of respect for them. I knew Arizona State was going to be
tough. I knew they had good kids inside, and we did a great job on the
shooters, and we cut down their driving opportunities, fast break
opportunities, and you look at the score, 54‑57, that's our kind of game
against good teams. If it gets over 60, we struggle sometimes. We gave
ourselves a good opportunity on the road, and you can't ask for anything more
than that.  
  
Q. I know you have confidence in your team, but for about 35 minutes you
outplayed a top ‑10 team on their floor. Was anything that happened tonight
kind of more than maybe what you thought coming into tonight, and does that
make this just a little bit harder?   
JOE FOLEY: It was such a great game. We played so hard that I'm not going to
take anything away from the game. I thought it was just a great game. Like I
say, I felt like we got a little bit tired, we missed some shots, we drove the
ball well, got to the rim, missed some shots. If they go in it's a different
story. That's what I'm saying. We wasn't standing back and throwing it away
and all that. We just missed some shots and they missed some shots early and
they made some shots late and got some offensive rebounds. It was just kids
playing their hearts out. To me either team has got to respect each other when
you walk off that floor. I respect the heck out of Arizona State, but I sure
respect our team, too.

_TEMPE, ARIZONA_  
  

Arizona State  57  
UALR - 54

  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: Wow. I just want to start off by first of all thanking
all of our Arizona State staff and the NCAA. It was amazing to get to host,
and everybody, Rhonda Bennett and everybody, Cheryl from the PAC‑12 office,
thank you guys for an amazing experience. It obviously made it a little bit
more amazing because of these young ladies over here and their ability to just
stay tough and stay with things.  
You guys like the movie Elf? That's a great movie, isn't it? Well, you know
how they have to believe, right? I think our fans believed, we believed. We
just all believed, and before you know it we're banking in 40‑foot threes and
finding a way to win. Just really happy for this team. They've worked so hard
all year long, and just very excited to keep playing, keep coaching them.  
  
Q. Elisha, was that bank ‑in three the biggest shot of your career?   
ELISHA DAVIS: Yes, it was. Believe. That's all that was running through my
head, believe, and that was God, though. That's why that went in. That was
God. Yeah.  
  
Q. What happened in the first half? You guys were 6 of 28 from the field.  
PROMISE AMUKAMARA: I think we just needed to take our time on the shot. We
were getting‑‑ not wide open but contested two‑footers and we just needed to
take our time and make those shots. But we knew we were going to make them in
the second half, so that's what we did.  
ELISHA DAVIS: I would just say I needed to do a better job as a point guard
that the floor was spaced and we were in our correct spots before even
starting the play, and just knowing that if you look at your point guard and
see if I'm antsy and nervous and not really on point then that's going to feed
into my teammates, so I just have to do a better job as a point guard in
making sure our plays are set and making sure we're executing to get better
shots.  
  
Q. For Promise and Sophie, what was so hard about guarding their motion
offense?  
PROMISE AMUKAMARA: I think the hardest part was just defending all the
screens. They set weak‑side screens, strong‑side screens, and it was just kind
of defending them because right when you get a screen you're getting another
one. It really tested our communication and our ability to defend screens off
ball.  
SOPHIE BRUNNER: Yeah, kind of what Promise said, the screens were really
tough, just knowing when to be in help and when not to be. Just getting
caught, I got caught in no man's land a couple times and gave up offensive
rebounds which wasn't acceptable. We had to adjust to them the second half and
adjusted and started boxing out a little bit better, but just glad we
finished.  
  
Q. Elisha, you had a rough night shooting. You looked like you were a little
reluctant to shoot the ball later in the game. Was that the case?  
ELISHA DAVIS: As you seen in the first time when we had four seconds left on
the shot clock and Katie gave it to me, I wasn't ready because I wasn't
expecting it but after that I was just like now or never, like what is this,
you've missed 10, hopefully you make the 11th one so you never give up. And my
teammates and my coaches believed in me and they said it's going to fall, it's
going to fall. It's a really tricky shot for that to be the only one that
really fell, but I was glad that it did.  
  
Q. Promise, was it ever in the back of your mind late in the game that this
could be your last game as a Sun Devil?  
PROMISE AMUKAMARA: No, not at all. We've always battled back from tough games,
so I knew that we were going to click and finish this game out strong. They're
a tough team, but I've got to commend our team, like I feel like we're
tougher.  
  
Q. How big was it to go 13 for 15 on free throws throughout the game and
Katie's two huge free throws to almost ice it at the end of the game?  
SOPHIE BRUNNER: I just think it's really important because recently we just
haven't been shooting free throws consistently well, so coming out today and
making our free throws made the difference in the game, and because we weren't
shooting well in the first half and that's what kind of kept us in the game,
and in the second half things started clicking, but free throws, like you said
with Katie's free throws, kind of pretty much kept us in the game and almost
won us the game.  
  
Q. Sophie, after Elisha made her shot, you and Kelsey made several baskets
down there low. Do you feel like you kind of wore them down at the very end of
the game?  
SOPHIE BRUNNER: Yeah, definitely, because they were definitely keying on the
guards more because they knew that Kelsey and I were just going to go and
clean it up. They just kept doubling Katie and we just happened to be open and
see each other, which was great. We just have a good connection in that sense.  
  
Q. Elisha, you said that was the biggest shot of your career. Was that the
biggest blocked shot of your career at the buzzer?  
ELISHA DAVIS: It's very interesting, just from all the close games that we've
battled back in or close games that we've gave up leads and we just had really
close games we had to have, we had to have faith, that's what our culture is
about. So just having those games and knowing we have to get this stop, we
have to get this box out, we have to get whatever we have to get. I was just
very, very focused on following my player and just being there, and because I
felt comfortable doing that because I got a lot of deflections in the first
half and a little bit in the second half, I just kind of put my hand up and
the ball went to it. Yeah, I'll say I'm very excited I was able to get that
and not foul, but I'm just more excited that our team was actually able to
finish. Our defensive collectively did not have anybody iso them or not have
communication and things of that nature.  
  
Q. Promise, you guys held Taylor Gault to only two points in the second
half. What were you doing to do that?  
PROMISE AMUKAMARA: I think it was just a whole team effort. We were
communicating on defense a lot better, and I thought I did well of getting
over screens and just following her, staying with her, just making it
difficult for her to get open and catch the ball.  
  
Q. Promise, you took a shot to the eye on a rebound. Was there ever any
doubt that you were going to come back in the game?  
PROMISE AMUKAMARA: No, I knew I had to come back in. I had to come back in.
The doctor gave me some eyedrops and I was fine.  
  
Q. I'm just wondering, how big of a boost was the crowd for you guys at the
end of the game?  
ELISHA DAVIS: Yes, it was beautiful. Our crowd was beautiful. It just felt so
good to have so much support and to see that not only our teammates and
coaches believed in us but also all of our supporters and people that have
been there since day one. You know, so it's just very good to see that even
some of the students came out when they could have just gladly clapped us off
from being at home or seeing if we won or not. So to see that big crowd it
gave us that energy like we can't let this down and we can't let our
administration down for doing so much for us to even have this game and host
us. That crowd were a part of that win just as well.  
  
Q. Charli, you've been around this game for a while. One of the most
incredible comebacks ‑‑  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: Are you trying to say I'm old?  
  
Q. I'm not trying to say that. One of the more incredible comebacks you've
seen?  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: Yes, yes. We've actually been in this situation for
those of you who have been with us through the season. That's what we talked
about at halftime. Especially the last half of the season. We had a lot of bad
halves offensively. We got in there, took a breath, just said, okay, just slow
down. Really a lot of times we start talking about our defense but we were
turning the ball over so much we couldn't even set our defense, and when you
factored out those turnovers in the first half, they only scored 10 points on
us. So we felt pretty good. We just needed to take a breath. And a ton of
credit‑‑ I don't want to play that team again. I don't. I mean,
Arkansas‑Little Rock is good. They're legit, and I thought they played an
amazing game. It was really something like both teams deserved to win. So I
just want to say that. My hat's off to them.  
And we've been able to come out, but it's up there. That game ranks up big
time.  
You know, in our deep runs into the tournament we've usually had a game like
this in the first or second round. In '07 we struggled to score‑‑ we basically
beat UC Riverside as a 3 seed in the first game and we had a one‑possession
game with Louisville. Like you said, I'm old. There's been a lot of games, and
just so proud of this group for staying with things and finding a way.  
  
Q. What was your reaction after Lee Lee hit that shot?  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: I joked about the Elf reference, but we did feel the
crowd. They were standing, they were into the game, and I feel like we're a
feel team. We feel each other. You know, I was elated, okay. I was just
elated, because now that they're gone‑‑ Katie was supposed to get the ball to
Sophie on an iso. She gave the ball to the wrong person and it got deflected,
so now I took a timeout to set something. We didn't set up the 40‑foot bank in
the timeout. I'm just going to confess that. That was all them. Now we're down
to two seconds and Katie didn't feel like she could make the pass, she gives
it to Lee Lee, and ‑‑ Elisha Davis practices deep threes. We always have some
of our better three‑point shooters, like she probably did not quite that deep,
but probably maybe two feet in from that, she probably shot 30 of those
yesterday in practice and some in shoot‑around. But for those types of
situations. Kylan Loney we used to shoot from the Wells Fargo all the time,
and it's amazing when you get to that situation and then just have confidence.  
  
Q. I know you've had bad first halves this season, but are you sitting on
the bench wondering if you ever are going to make a shot in this first half?
Were they just rushing their attempts because you got good shots?  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: We did, and that's what you feel good about as a coach.
If you're getting good shots you're fine. I mean, the turnovers were
frustrating, but the missing of the good shots I was okay with. Big game, just
a little tight, and again, we've‑‑ down the stretch the last three or four
weeks of the season, we had way too many halves like that for those of you
that come every week. You know, it was familiar territory, so in that sense
they didn't panic. They were okay.  
  
Q. In those nine minutes was it just that you were making more shots or was
there anything else you noticed from your team?  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: Well, we certainly were making‑‑ we shot 54 percent in
the second half, so we came out and I think played Sun Devil basketball and
did a much better job. We got the ball inside, and I think someone referenced
did we wear them down, and I thought we did because in the first half they
were‑‑ we passed to the post and they were coming and looking to strip. By the
end of the game they weren't helping each other at all, so we had one‑on‑ones
and obviously Sophie took advantage of that. They wore down a little bit,
Katie got free for some good looks, and that's what‑‑ and I think our team
kept working hard to get their good looks.  
The biggest difference was just taking care of the basketball. It's hard to
score when you don't get a shot up.  
  
Q. Same question I had for the girls. How important is it as a coach to see
the girls hitting free throws the entire game?  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: Well, I mean, you hit on something huge. One, that we
didn't foul them because we were very disappointed in our first game. We gave
Ohio 21 free‑throw attempts, and that's not us. We really work hard to not be
in the bonus either half and we've done a great job of that all year long. It
was one of our big areas of emphasis going into the season. All the best teams
can play great position defense, no matter how good and athletic you are, so
that we did a great job of, and for us to step up and make those free throws
was‑‑ I mean, especially when you're not making field goals. You had to take
advantage of it. And Sophie Brunner has struggled a little bit and for her to
step up with that level of confidence just shows you how tough these kids are,
and we probably couldn't have scripted it better to miss that one and get the
rebound and be able to pull it out.  
Just the rebounding off the free throw, and boy, we've talked about that, too.
Everybody is watching the men's and women's tournament. How many games have
been decided by a rebound off a free‑throw attempt? I know at least four that
I've been watching. It was great hustle by Kelsey and our team.  
  
Q. You touched upon this in the last answer, but how do you practice not
fouling?  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: Well, we just work on our defense, and we play great
position defense. We move our feet, and we call fouls in practice. If you
foul, you come out of the game that you want to play, and you don't foul. When
we played Notre Dame in the second round last year, that's when you really see
it. Like if you can't guard a great team without fouling, and I think for us,
we wore them down and they did foul us, and we were able to stay tough and
keep working. Now, they got some good shots down the stretch, don't get me
wrong, but the fact that we had the discipline to not foul them has been a
great strength of this team all year long. It's discipline. It's just
discipline.  
  
Q. What do you tell the kids at halftime, and also, will you be bringing
back any of the former players to talk to them before the Sweet 16 like
January or anyone?  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: No, I think Bree is still in Brazil. We had a lot of
former players here at the game and we always invite them in the locker room.
We're going to be turning around and leaving here pretty quick, so I don't
know if I'll have an opportunity for that. Well, again, I kind of alluded at
halftime that I just tell them to take a breath. We just needed to slow down
on offense, take our time. We felt really good about our defense because they
were just mainly scoring off our turnovers, not off our half‑court defense. We
had a few adjustments, and to make our transition defense was pretty tragic
for stretches. We weren't getting to the ball. We weren't getting anywhere,
and they ran it right up our you know whats. But we adjusted. We adjusted like
this team does. I've mentioned that a lot. I mean, they're just really
coachable. Joe Foley was funny before the game, we were talking, he's like, I
love this time of year. They listen to you because sometimes you're in the
grind and they're tired. But this team, they've listened to us, the coaches,
all year long. They've been just so respectful, so coachable, so mature about
things, and hopefully we've had a few good things to say and it's helped them.  
Yeah, we've been pretty good at evaluating and adjusting at halftime. Good to
see. And that's to their credit.  
  
Q. You guys faced a Little Rock team that had three really versatile,
experienced seniors. What was the biggest challenge in trying to defend those
three?  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: Well, when you're playing against seniors in March, just
the banking of the three from the non‑shooter, you know, just the stepping up
and doing things that they haven't done all year because they're just willing
it in because they don't want their season to end, and I thought they did
that. They just stepped up and made plays, and some of those plays I don't
think are plays that they always make. You know, and that was our concern.
That's always my concern. I look at who are the seniors. Who are the seniors
and how big a role are they playing, and all the great teams, usually the
seniors are the ones that do step up in this time of year for sure.  
  
Q. Can you just give us an early ‑‑ some early thoughts on playing Florida
State next?   
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: You know I don't look ahead. I'm going to tell on Debbie
Antonelli. She told me to look at us‑‑ no way this team is‑‑ I was prepared,
but I haven't actually‑‑ obviously Sue Semrau, head coach at Florida State has
done an amazing job. They've been in the top 10 for a lot of the season. I'm
not that familiar with their team. I watched them play Washington on tape
early, and they lost to Washington, and they didn't play well and they didn't
have their point guard Romero who was a transfer who got eligible, transferred
from Kansas State. I know she's a big difference maker for them, and then they
have a bunch of other transfers, they have like five transfers from other
schools. They're kind of a whole new team this year. I think they're very
talented and usually play man. I think they've pretty much played man all year
long. That's kind of consistent with us. I think that's kind of good. We
started playing a team that was all zone with one day of practice, that would
not be ideal. But I think‑‑ usually to be honest a lot of the best teams in
the country are some of the simplest to prepare for because what they do, they
do really well. They don't do a lot of things, and I think Florida State, they
have great personnel, they execute really well, really good man defense team,
but I will be getting on that as soon as we're wrapping up here.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST & 2ND ROUNDS:
TEMPE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+%26+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+TEMPE)

  

## March 22, 2015

  

### [Elisha Davis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28821)

### [Charli Turner Thorne](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24830)

  
_TEMPE, ARIZONA_  
  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: Well, we're definitely excited to be back for Game 2.
We've had some time to break down the film as well as‑‑ as much as we never
expect a game to be, the point spread to be quite that big, there's a lot of
things that we've looked at that we can do better, so we're excited about that
because obviously Ohio is a very good team. We've had a chance to look at
Little Rock. We've pretty much prepared for both. We knew that they were an
exceptional team and we thought that game could go either way as good as Texas
A&M is. Ultimately we think it's about us, and we think we can rebound better,
we think we can take care of the ball better, can play better position defense
without fouling.  
  
Q. Girls, Coach mentioned last night about UALR, their motion offense. How
often have you seen a true motion offense where that's what a team does all
the time and what are the challenges of playing a team that does that?  
ELISHA DAVIS: Well, Ohio ran a motion offense, so that's what we've prepared
for, so it's helped us a lot. We played a lot of teams in the preseason like
Villanova that had a lot of motion offense, as well. So we played against it.
The challenges with motion would be just us mostly be us talking on defense
about switching screens, making sure we jump to the ball and just make sure
everybody is guarding and stay between them and the basket. I'd say that's the
biggest challenge.  
KELSEY MOOS: Yeah, in PAC‑12, Utah did a lot of motion offense, too. We've
played against it fairly recently, too, so we just need to play our team
defense, talking, listen to each other, and just play great defense without
fouling.  
SOPHIE BRUNNER: I think the biggest key is just to know your scout because at
any given time you could be on anyone. So I think to key off what they said is
knowing everyone's tendencies and what they want to do and being ready to
switch out on people.  
  
Q. Elisha, how are you approaching this mentally, especially this being the
second year and the second round for you, a little bit different now that you
guys are hosting? How are you mentally preparing for this?  
ELISHA DAVIS: I'm mentally preparing by just knowing that I need to do
whatever my coaches and teammates ask of me, so if I need to stop the ball
better, if I need to push the ball harder, I need to do better with my
decision making, if I just need to make sure that I'm being that leader on the
court, that coach on the floor for Coach Charli and our coaching staff, I
think that's what's needed of me mentally. Also just staying poised because at
this time there's a lot of emotions flowing into these games, and I know that
my teammates look to me and I'm kind of like the spark plug of the team, so if
I'm down, they're down, if I'm up, they're up, so being that leader that Coach
Charli needs me to be is how I'm approaching this game.  
  
Q. Coach, could you talk about the luxury of being able to host these first
two games and just having that home ‑court advantage?   
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: Yeah. I mean, obviously to earn the right to be able to
host is a true advantage. We have our fans, we haven't had to travel‑‑ with
this team we actually are really good on the road, and we can kind of lock
them down. You know, I will say there are two sides of that. When you're home
and you're not away from the distractions of your home area. But I think it's
more of an advantage than anything, certainly just being able to have our Sun
Devil Nation here to cheer us on, and again, I can't thank our administration
and the PAC‑12 office enough for making that possible because it wasn't going
to be. But yeah, we take a lot of pride in playing at home. We lost a couple
games at home this year, and we don't usually lose more than a couple, and our
team took it really hard. So it's not just the NCAA Tournament, but it kind of
promises a second senior day, if you will, too. You have your last home game
and you celebrate and everything, and obviously we had hoped to be back, and
now this truly will be her last game in Wells Fargo Arena, so a little added
significance with that, I guess.  
  
Q. You mentioned their motion, UALR's motion last night. After watching
film, how is it different from some of the teams you've seen this year, or is
it at all, and what are the biggest complications with guarding them?  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: Yeah, it's different. It's definitely different from
Ohio, it's different from Utah. There's some similarities. I think some of it
is kind of based on the personnel. To me they're probably‑‑ they're the best
motion team we will have played all year long from what I've seen. Some of
that is their personnel. They just have some really good players that at any
time can just take you one‑on‑one and create their own shot and do some really
nice things with the basketball. They find each other well. They know each
other. So they're not reliant on, okay, we have to get open off these screens
for each other. They can get out of their motion and score in multiple ways.  
But they execute it well, and they read off of screens very well. You know,
Villanova, the difference between Villanova is they bounce the ball for 20
seconds at half court and then they get into their offense and it's a lot
slower‑paced game, and they did execute well. But I think from what I've seen,
they might be the best certainly that we're going to have played against.  
  
Q. Yesterday you mentioned Promise would be keying in on Taylor Gault. What
would be different on her as opposed to some of the other great guards from
the PAC ‑12 that you'd be looking at for her?   
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: That's a great question, and I don't know who I would
compare her to. She's a little different than‑‑ I mean, she's a little bit
like a Kelsey Plumb, I guess, but probably more athletic. The fact that she
can just raise up above you and hit a pull‑up shot consistently is a really
impressive thing that not a lot of players can do. It's not like, oh, just
take away her three or take away her to‑the‑rim game. Promise and I have been
watching a little bit of film and talking about that. She's a great player so
I don't think we're going to completely shut her down, we'll just try to limit
her. It won't be just Promise, it'll be an entire effort keying in on her. But
it's not just her, either. They've got other players that have stepped up in
games and scored well for them, too, and that's why they've won 29 games.
They're a very balanced team.  
  
Q. Last night you mentioned, too, with UALR just about their level of
confidence from them. Where do you see that most, either from watching a
little bit of the game last night or watching film? Where does that stick out
most, I guess?  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: Well, I think they get it from winning 29 games, and so
it just kind of oozes out of them, I guess, because they don't‑‑ they just
don't let things bother them. I think you can see it in their body language,
how they respond to a call that maybe didn't go their way or just maybe a team
goes on a little bit of a run. You just see them just keep playing and staying
with things like we talked about yesterday. I think that's the biggest thing.  
  
Q. It seems like this is a special group. You've got the experience, the
talent, all of it coming together. How do you keep the focus maintained with
this group, especially when you guys have lofty goals of making the Elite 8
and then even more than that?  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: Well, we're just taking Arkansas‑Little Rock right now,
and honestly we don't really talk about those things. We don't talk about
Elite 8 or beyond or even Sweet 16. We really just survive and advance. One of
the things that I told our team the other day, it was kind of fun that we
didn't play the first round and they had seen a couple days of the men's
tournament, the women's tournament, all the little details that teams, it
costs them. I just said to them, I don't know this for a fact, but I would
hazard to guess that a lot of these teams that were supposed to win, it wasn't
that they weren't the better team, they didn't focus on the right things.
There's so much hoopla around March Madness and this tournament and so many
distractions and a lot times I think teams just don't lock in to winning and
on the process. That's the biggest thing that we're focusing on, and we're
just kind of trying to keep in here, and I know that we have to play better
than we did last night or yesterday to win Monday, and they know it, too.  
I think shooting, we can shoot the same. We shot it pretty well, but every
other aspect of our game, we weren't really satisfied with.

_TEMPE, ARIZONA_  
  
JOE FOLEY: Well, we're glad to be here. Two more days of sunshine. It's been a
lot of fun. Going to play against a great team. I think the crowd is going to
get another great game. I think both teams are pretty evenly matched, and I
think that they've got a lot of weapons. They score well. They've got a little
bit bigger inside, but we're looking forward to the match‑up and looking
forward to play again, and like I say it's been a great trip for all of us and
these three seniors, it's been pretty special. I'm not looking forward to it
ending, but I'm enjoying what they're doing.  
  
Q. Girls, for any one of you, what's your initial thoughts on Arizona State
after watching some film last night and getting an initial kind of look at
them so far?  
KIERA CLARK: It's going to be a great match‑up, I think. It's going to be an
exciting game. We're looking forward to it.  
KA'NESHEIA COBBINS: Like Kiera said, it should be a great game. We're really
excited to be here. Like Coach Foley said, they have a bigger inside game than
we do, so hopefully we can step up and do our best to guard that.  
TAYLOR GAULT: Like they said, I think it'll be a pretty good match‑up at the
guard spot, but the bigs are a little bigger than us, but I think we can hang
tough.  
  
Q. For any one of you, how much tougher does it make it defensively when
they don't necessarily have a go to player, when they kind of spread it
around?  
KIERA CLARK: That means that we just have to lock in and focus a little bit
more, make sure that we help each other out.  
KA'NESHEIA COBBINS: We have to have a lot of help defense. When you have a
team like that who has multiple players who can do multiple things, that just
makes our team defense have to dig down and get to it.  
TAYLOR GAULT: Yeah, I think it'll just show us what we're made of defensively,
considering that they have multiple threats. We just have to pull together as
a team to play team defense.  
  
Q. Taylor, it didn't seem like yesterday any of you guys were really afraid
of the moment, the stage or the opponent or anything. Do you guys feel that
you guys belong here in the round of 32, in the top ‑30 teams, and how much do
you feel like you belong in this game and maybe even beyond?   
TAYLOR GAULT: Yeah, I think we deserve it. We've worked so hard this season,
and us being seniors, we're leaders on the court. We just know that we're not
going to let each other down, and we know what it takes. With that being said,
I know that we deserve to be here.  
KIERA CLARK: Basically what Taylor said. I do believe that we deserve to be
here, and it's a great experience.  
KA'NESHEIA COBBINS: Like these two, I have so much faith in these two along
with all my other teammates. You know, no, we're not afraid. We're the
underdog, so we just have to step up to the plate.  
  
Q. Taylor, what do you expect defensively from ASU's Promise Amukamara?  
TAYLOR GAULT: I don't know who that is.  
THE MODERATOR: No.10.  
TAYLOR GAULT: I really don't know. I think she's a good shooter, but I think
we can defend her, whatever she does.  
  
Q. Kiera, I talked to you last week about your feelings about being back in
the rotation after being in and out all year, and especially after yesterday,
how are you feeling confidence ‑wise, just being back in a role that you're
probably more comfortable with?   
KIERA CLARK: Well, it feels good. I'm just here to do whatever my team needs
me to do. It's about the team, not about me individually. I'm just here to do
whatever my assignment is, and here it goes.  
  
Q. Those 38 minutes yesterday were a season high. Were you a little sore or
tired after yesterday?  
KIERA CLARK: I did make a comment, and I told my teammates, y'all know I'm not
used to these kind of minutes, so I was tired. It was funny, we just made a
joke out of it.  
  
Q. For any of you guys, are you guys worried at all about the home ‑court
advantage that Arizona State is going to have tomorrow?   
KIERA CLARK: No, we're not really worried about that. We've just got to worry
about what our assignment is and get it done.  
KA'NESHEIA COBBINS: You know, we're not really too worried about this being a
home game for them. They're having a really good crowd, and the thing with‑‑
at the free‑throw line, we're just going to have to mentally block that out.
But I think we can get it done.  
TAYLOR GAULT: Yeah, they do have a nice crowd or whatever. Home‑court
advantage is always good for a team. It gives them momentum and a little more
courage, but it's not anything that we can't handle.  
  
Q. Ka'Nesheia, you brought it up. I can't remember what their free ‑throw
thing is called‑‑  
THE MODERATOR: Curtain of distraction.  
  
Q. I've heard a little bit of talk from yesterday's game. Have you heard
about it at all?  
KA'NESHEIA COBBINS: Actually my roommate and I, in between our little breaks
at the hotel, and we were watching reviews, and when they showed it up, and
it's like at the free‑throw line of the opposing team, like when they're
shooting the free throws they'll open a curtain, and it's like a clown. Every
time they open it, it's a different character, and we're like, how do they do
that? But the commentators were saying that they think that's something good.
It's cool, I guess. But we're just going to have to block it out and don't let
it be a distraction to us.  
  
Q. Taylor, how much of a boost have you guys gotten from Kiera the last two
games? Yesterday offensively there was a period where you were both hitting
pretty regularly yesterday. How much are you helped with her in the flow of
the offense?  
TAYLOR GAULT: A lot. Kiera is a big part of the team. She knocked down‑‑ she
had a spectacular game yesterday. It was unbelievable, not just on offense but
at the end of the game she had some clutch defensive plays, got some steals,
stuff like that. We need everybody to win, so with Kiera doing what she does,
it's just adding to what we can do.  
  
Q. Joe, they don't really seem at all intimidated about kind of the home
‑court advantage they're going to be against or the seed or anything or the
setting. Does this team have something that maybe some of your others in the
past haven't had, just mentally, I guess?  
JOE FOLEY: Well, they've had the experience of being in the division‑‑ NCAA
Tournament Division I tournament. They've played big games throughout their
careers, they've experienced playing in big games, conference finals, playing
at LSU this year, beating LSU on their home floor to start the season, to have
a team like Oklahoma come in and handle them pretty easy. I think the
experiences they've had is coming out right now, and I think that's what's
showing. We've been through this before. It's not anything new, so they know
they've got to play well. They know they've got to prepare well. But they've
been prepared, so they know what to do.  
  
Q. What makes ASU such a tough defensive team and how do you keep from
getting sped up when you get out there and they're pressing you?  
JOE FOLEY: Well, they're so diverse in the way they can score. That's going to
be the hard thing is the size inside, overcoming the size like we did
yesterday. They've got guards, No.0 is one of the best shooters I've seen. So
when she can spread it out, extend the defense as far as she can, that opens
up the middle. Same thing for the bigs, with her being able to spread it open,
so the inside‑outside action they've got just makes them a super ballclub.
There's no doubt about it.  
  
Q. You mentioned their size. You guys were able to kind of combat that
yesterday with I assume your ability and quickness of the guards. Is that what
you think it was yesterday and how much confidence does that give you that you
can do it again tomorrow night?  
JOE FOLEY: Well, we've had to overcome it all season but not to this extent.
When you're playing against 6'4", 6'5", like you are, it makes it a lot
tougher. I thought we were fortunate yesterday that we were able to get the
big kid to miss some baskets early so she didn't get her confidence going. We
helped really well. Their outside shooting is not nearly as tough as ASU's, so
that's going to be a much bigger concern. The Texas A&M guards can shoot but
it's not extended. They're more the mid‑range jumpers, so that helped us a lot
that we didn't have to extend our defense. It'll be a different story against
this bunch.  
  
Q. Charli Turner Thorne called your offense a thing of beauty. What do you
think of ASU's defense in particular?  
JOE FOLEY: I thought they did a very good job of trying to pressure. I think
the bigs helped well inside. The good thing about our offense that a lot of
people are starting to enjoy again, I think, is the mid‑range. Our kids are
used to playing in the mid‑range, so we don't have to rely on the three‑point
or lay‑ups. A lot of teams have gone to either getting threes or lay‑ups.
We're not that way. We still believe in the mid‑range. I think you see that in
Kiera's game, you see it in Gault's game, and we take threes with the addition
of AD, Lexus, gave us the addition of threes this year, so that really helped
our offense, and then our post players, we don't get the 6'4" and 6'5", at a
mid‑major you don't get those type of players, so I think it's to our
advantage when you run a mid‑range game that those big kids can't guard up. We
have a hard time guarding them but they have a hard time coming off those
screens. In my career, and I think that's the reason I've been successful,
that's kind of our equalizer is that mid‑range game, and that helps us.  
  
Q. You guys were in this place five years ago as an 11 playing on the home
floor of a 3. What can you draw, obviously the opponents are different, but
can you draw anything from that experience, maybe prepare a little bit more or
Oklahoma was a good team ‑‑  
JOE FOLEY: Oklahoma ended up in the Final Four. We didn't know it at the time.
To me it's kind of the same situation. You're playing on their home floor.
They're going to have a great crowd I'm sure, and Oklahoma had a great crowd.
They got after us right off the bat. We hit a lot of threes against Georgia
Tech and really played well. They pressed us and we handled the press very
well. Same situation here. They like to press, so if we can handle the
situation and hit the threes the second game, we missed a lot of threes early
against Oklahoma and got down about 10 or 11, and we got to the second half,
we'd get back to eight or so but we never could get back to the lead. So they
ended up closing us out, had big kids inside that really hurt us that second
game in three days. So it's kind of the same situation, and hopefully we'll
handle it a little bit better. Hopefully we'll shoot the ball a little better
than we did that second game. Like I say, nobody knew it at the time, but I
knew Oklahoma was a good team, but I didn't know they were a Final Four team.
If we'd have got by that game, no telling what we would have done. At least
the Sweet 16, maybe Elite 8. I think we're looking at the same situation kind
of.  
  
Q. I asked the girls this, but how much confidence do you have in this team
just belonging in this round of 32 and beyond? Do you think you guys should be
among or deserve to be among the top 16 if you advance?  
JOE FOLEY: Well, you've been with us the last two weeks, so I've got a lot of
faith in them. They play like they're playing the last two weeks, they're
capable of doing anything. When you shoot the ball like they've been shooting
it and you play defense as hard as they've been playing it, they're capable of
doing anything. I've got a lot of faith in them right now.  
  
Q. What's the biggest thing that you're emphasizing mentally for your team
in preparation for this game?  
JOE FOLEY: I think the main thing right now is you've got to focus even more.
You've had a lot of success in the last week, all the teams have had a lot of
success, especially the ones that had to win their tournament like we did. You
won three games, everybody has been patting you on the back, you've been
playing well, then you come in, beat Texas A&M, all the moms and dads patting
them on the back, you did this, you did that. They've got to overcome that.
They've got to get focused. I got from Butler's coach a few years ago, one of
the things I was really impressed with what he said was our kids play through
winning. A lot of teams you learn from losing, but when you can learn from
winning, you've got a pretty focused ballclub. I'm hoping that's what we are.  
  
Q. Promise Amukamara is ASU's top defender. What will that match ‑up of her
versus Gault be like?  
JOE FOLEY: It's probably going to be a lot like yesterday. A&M was trying to
push her off the line and trying to get to her and she handled it very well,
and of course Taylor has been the focal point all year long for everybody's
team. She's had a heck of a year with all that focus that they've had against
her to keep herself under control, handle the pressure and let the game come
to her. It's been pretty phenomenal. She's had a heck of a senior year. And
Taylor in the past, she's grown into a young lady and especially matured in
the basketball sense. Things like that used to bother her if she didn't get
off to a good start, but now to me she's very focused, she's very confident in
herself, and she's letting the game come, and she's making a lot more assists.
If people are running her off the line, two or three people at her, she's
improved her game to making assists, getting other people involved, and that's
the reason why we are where we're at right now.  
  
Q. When Kiera started getting a few more minutes in the tournament, did you
anticipate she could get to this level this quickly after kind of coming off
the bench through most of the year? What was your thought as to what you could
get from her?  
JOE FOLEY: Well, you know, early in the year we were playing Kiera a lot, and
she went into a little bit of a slump, and with her in the offense, especially
in Shan's spot, we had her playing, rotating a lot, just in the guards, we
were playing four guards quite a bit, and now that we're rotating her at Shan'
spot, Shan is not near the scorer, Shan has always been a defensive player,
and putting Kiera out there has made it super tough for us to guard that
mid‑range game with Gault and AD and of course Neash drives a lot and kicks to
them, so when you put the four guards out there that can handle the ball, that
can shoot the ball, that can drive the ball, our offense becomes ‑‑ we're at
constant movement and don't ever know where they're going to be, so that's
really helped our offense. Defensively she's improved and she's helped us
there some defensively. That's always been the drawback of Kiera, the
defensive aspect of it. But offensively when we get her on the floor
offensively, we become a much harder team to guard.  
  
Q. Do you anticipate Kiera starting tomorrow or do you like the rotation
that you've gotten to?  
JOE FOLEY: I would have anticipated her starting. Actually it's funny that you
ask that. I was going to start her yesterday. But we got screwed up. I told
Asriel, she didn't understand. I said I'm going to ask Neash if she can go or
not. If Neash can go, then we'll be starting Kiera. If she doesn't, then we're
starting Shan. Well, she thought because I was going to start both of them
then, and she got mixed up because when Ka'Nesheia told me she was going to
go, she automatically put Shan out there, and I asked her what did you do
because it was right at the 10‑minute mark when I made my decision so we
couldn't change it. I was going to start her yesterday. It was funny the way
it ended up.

Texas A&M  60

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Joe Foley is joined by Taylor Gault, Ka'Nesheia Cobbins
and Kiera Clark.  
COACH FOLEY: They had a great game. I thought both teams played hard. These
three here were unbelievable. You take these three seniors with Ka'Nesheia
with the turned ankle, so much fun to watch.  
  
Q. Taylor, can you talk about the start you and Kiera got, how did that lift
things, mindset and morale?  
TAYLOR GAULT: I came out with my set up. I knew what I could do offensively
and defensively. That's the thought I had was to shoot and drive and do
whatever I knew I could do best for my team.  
  
Q. Taylor, talk about the defensive effort you were able to do on Courtney
Walker. What did you feel you were able to do there?  
TAYLOR GAULT: Oh, we were just trying to stop her. That was our thought, stop
her from doing that. So I think we did pretty good on that.  
  
Q. Ka'Nesheia, can you talk about how our ankle feels, and how it felt when
you got here and how that was feeling throughout the game?  
KA'NESHEIA COBBINS: Once my adrenaline got going, it wasn't about my ankle, it
was about helping my teammates and converting on offense.  
  
Q. (Inaudible)?  
KA'NESHEIA COBBINS: No, I wasn't really thinking about myself. I just knew I
had to tough it out because I didn't want to leave these two alone, the rest
of my teammates hanging. We made it this far. I did whatever it took. Rehab
the pass two days to get ready for this game.  
  
Q. Kiera, can you talk a little bit about the fact this could have been your
last game and you had the career high points, how exciting that was for you?  
KIERA CLARK: Very exciting. We came into the game, like this is all or
nothing. This might be our last game, what did we have to lose. So we just
locked in and had a great game.  
  
Q. Kiera, you came into the game about 90 seconds in. Did you expect to get
the call that quickly? What is the mindset when you're coming into the game to
get something going?  
KIERA CLARK: You're ready. Coach emphasized these last couple of practices, in
order to help my team I'm going to need to shoot and score, and that's what I
did.  
  
Q. Can you talk about your team was able to take the leave, late in the
half, can you talk about what you feel your mindset was after having the lead
and losing it?  
KA'NESHEIA COBBINS: At any point in the game I just know we're going to leave
our heart on the court. And I just know that we're not going to leave that
court without a fight. And so I wasn't too much worried about it all, because
I know what our team is made of and the kind of people we are on the court.  
  
Q. Taylor, several times they made a run at you guys in the second half and
somebody, usually you, seemed to make a three. Also Dawn had a big three. How
important was it that every time they came at you that you guys came up?  
TAYLOR GAULT: That we came up? Oh, my mind is on a different issue, just
knowing that shots might not fall, but you can always play defense. So even if
shots don't fall, defense is key. And anybody can play defense. But being able
to combat with them scoring, us scoring, that's always good. That's what we
do.  
  
Q. Kiera, you shot 52 percent in the second half. Did you guys think a
shooting day like that was needed to win?  
KA'NESHEIA COBBINS: We had good practices, too. So carrying it on to the game
is just a plus.  
  
Q. Same one I asked them, did you think you had to play this well
offensively to win?  
COACH FOLEY: The only way we can combat it is score well. That's the reason
Kiera was in the lineup. She's been scoring well, but we had to have that
extra score in the lineup. I'm a little surprised we stopped them as well as
we did, especially 33 and the big kid. So that helped out a lot. But I felt
like we were going to have to score pretty well to win.  
  
Q. Were you trying to take away one or two players from them or go man to
man and see where you might match ‑up?  
COACH FOLEY: We concentrated on 33. We were trying to give help. We even
switched on that first half. And I think it paid off for us.  
  
Q. You've seen quite a few games from Taylor Gault and a lot of games she
scored points. Put this in perspective. Seemed like she was always in a flow,
and always hit a shot when she needed it?  
COACH FOLEY: Big time. Big time. She's done it over and over. But under this
situation and the game we're in today, the pressure, I mean she's got ice in
her veins, it's unbelievable what she does.  
  
Q. During the second half stretch Clark kind of took over. How important was
it to have two of them?  
COACH FOLEY: I think they ‑‑ looked to me like they were really emphasizing
make sure whoever Gault goes, you've got one or two coming at her all the
time. That opened it up for us a little bit. You've got to give them credit to
get the ball to the open man. We talked about it the last two days. I felt
Clark would be the one to get the shot, and that's why we focused on it the
last two weeks, and she came through for us.  
  
Q. You were controlling the first half, out played them. What was your
thoughts at halftime?  
COACH FOLEY: Looked like maybe they had their heads down a little bit and I
was a little worried. We just talked about, hey, guys, we dominated the first
15 minutes. We can do that. We can go back out. And I felt like we were very
well conditioned at that point. We beat a lot of teams in the last five
minutes. So I just told them, I feel like we'll win the game. And I think they
got their heads up a little bit.  
  
Q. What was your confidence level what you could get from Ka'Nesheia today
with that ankle? I don't know she was on the list of starters when we got
here. Was that a late change of heart there?  
COACH FOLEY: All I was waiting for her was to go through warm ups and tell me,
Coach, I'm ready. I said do you want to go or stay? She said I'm going. I was
just waiting on her. I've got all the confidence in the world on every one of
our players. I think everyone is going to give up whatever it takes to do it
all, they're going to give all to their team, whatever they can give.  
  
Q. Where will No. 700 rank in your career?  
COACH FOLEY: Tops right now. Top game. It's unbelievable, playing against a
friend. Playing in an NCAA tournament. It was fun. And to play as well as we
did. We played great, and we deserved it. And I'm proud of our kids.  
  
Q. You said it just now, a lot of people will look at it, but was this an
upset?  
COACH FOLEY: I told the team yesterday we were going to win. I felt like we
were going to score.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_TEMPE, ARIZONA_  
  

ASU  74  
Ohio  55

  
THE MODERATOR: We have Coach Thorne, Sophie Brunner and Katie Hempen.  
COACH THORNE: First I just want to say I think Ohio is just a really good
basketball team. I thought we brought it at both ends and they never quit. And
even had one good run down the stretch of the game. The way they execute
offensively, shoot the three, get to the rim, you know, it really clogged up
the paint. We had 17 turnovers.  
I'm really proud of our team. It's been two weeks since we played a game. We
‑‑ we got some shots up, shot the ball like we can shoot the ball. And I
thought our defense was ‑‑ in a team that we hadn't really played anybody with
them, I thought Sophie was just sprinting. We had to work hard and I thought
we did. I thought we had a complete effort from our entire team.  
  
Q. Sophie, the guards did a good job of penetrating. Was there anything that
you did to get open, or were you just waiting for the ball?  
SOPHIE BRUNNER: No, actually the guards did a really good job penetrating, so
just an easy two footer.  
  
Q. Your thoughts on the win Monday night?  
KATIE HEMPEN: It was a great team. And the preparation we had for this game
was so ‑‑ I think the coaches knew what we needed to do, and Sophie and Quinn
did a good job of helping. They did a good job. Our defense was what led to a
good offense.  
  
Q. You shot 60 percent the first half. The ball was moving well and you were
able to find an open shooter.  
SOPHIE BRUNNER: Yeah, I think we just knew that we had to fake them out and
move the ball for each other. That's what we've been working on all week, and
play well together and looking for each other, that's what we mainly focused
on.  
KATIE HEMPEN: Our main focus was going from the weak side in and seeing the
post. Pretty much we knew they were going to, you know, kind of focus on ‑‑ we
had to skip inside and inside out, and that's what helped us in the game.  
  
Q. I was wondering, you guys seem to play more cohesively this time. What is
it that you guy did during the last couple of weeks that helped you prepare
for this game and especially you Katie with all your three pointers, pretty
impressive.  
SOPHIE BRUNNER: I think we just got back to just focusing on playing together,
and just finding that chemistry again, because we kind of got it away from it
a little bit towards the end of Pac‑12 season. We made eye contact, just the
little things. And I think we did well. They showed up in the game. We focused
on trying to get consistent with the little things and had a good result.  
KATIE HEMPEN: Yes, exactly what Sophie said. I think our teammates were
helpful. You're going to make them, they're going to fall. And just their
support is amazing. And it's funny, because every time I catch the ball and
shoot it, but I know that they can rebound it. So kind of an ‑‑ they know I'm
going to shoot it. So it all works out.  
  
Q. Katie, in going back to the beginning of the game you guys seemed a
little frustrated at first, but then you broke off in a huge 13 ‑0 run. What
was said in that huddle during that first media time that got you going?  
KATIE HEMPEN: I don't think we were frustrated. We were just taking our time,
like what are they doing? Are we doing what we prepared for them to do? And we
just evened out in that first huddle. Our coaches do great about what we
should do. We were mobilized after coming out of the first huddle.  
  
Q. Katie, it was a big challenge in preparing for this?  
KATIE HEMPEN: Pretty much just go one‑on‑one. So you need ‑‑ I think the
biggest challenge was getting used to their game. We did a good job of it and
I think we started to connect.  
  
Q. What are your thoughts?  
SOPHIE BRUNNER: Yes, a great basketball team. They're tough. They're going to
try to outwork you. You try to work for everything. And you can tell that
nothing really bothers them. They just make things work and they'll run you
and stay with things. It will be a tough match‑up, but we're excited for them.  
KATIE HEMPEN: Just like Sophie said, they're a tough team. It's going to be a
fun match‑up. It's going to be exciting. Just great.  
  
Q. (Inaudible)?  
SOPHIE BRUNNER: It's great. It's a fun atmosphere to play in. We appreciate
what we've been able to do here, and being able to host, and just really
thankful.  
KATIE HEMPEN: Our fans do a great job staying in the game. Whenever we make a
good play they just ‑‑ it's awesome. Their support is what we always want.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about how you were able to play a pretty complete game?
Was it being more rested, preparation? Some of the away games you played late
in the season you weren't able to do that.  
COACH THORNE: Yes, we hadn't practiced a lot the last part of the season.
Kelsey hadn't practiced very much. It was amazing for us to get two weeks to
rest up and get in the gym. Get sharp defensively, that's what we did. The
first few minutes ‑‑ we haven't played in a couple of weeks, and they did
exactly what we thought, and we weren't having to ‑‑ but, yeah, I think it
definitely showed that our team has been working hard to prepare for the NCAA
tournament. And hopefully we'll build on it.  
Our team is hard on ourselves. We are not happy with our rebounding after this
game, at all. We're happy with our shooting percentage but not our turnovers.
We probably should have moved the ball better than we did. There's a lot we
can look at and get better for Monday night.  
I think it's hardest not playing for two weeks. We did have a game against our
scout team on Sunday, so that helps, but that's not quite the same.  
  
Q. That run in the first half, was that kind of when you guys are at your
best?  
COACH THORNE: It is. When our defense is turning people over and we're getting
easy buckets in transition, that's when we're at our best. This team didn't
really turn the ball over. I thought we worked hard. I thought our defense
looked fantastic at times, against a team that's done a great job of taking
care of the ball. They don't pass a lot. They take you one‑on‑one a lot. They
couldn't get to the rim and then they couldn't find teammates, and that was
just ‑‑ our team was working really hard.  
  
Q. One run in the middle of the second half. What allowed your team to be
able to go on those long spurts that separated the lead?  
COACH THORNE: Well, you know, we also had a long drought where we didn't score
down the stretch. As coaches, that's what we remember. Oh, my gosh, we haven't
scored for this long.  
Our defense. Our defense is just like we just said. If we're getting soft, I
think our shooting was better, our efficiency was better, so I think great
defense.  
And our transition game, we like to play fast, and not just in the full court,
but in the half court. If we can get out and run a little bit ‑‑ our goal is
‑‑ they're a tough team, and they're going to play hard, we want to outwork
teams. We took advantage when they got tired and we put our foot on the gas,
and this team is pretty good at that.  
  
Q. Obviously your team played well. What are the main things going into
Monday night's match ‑up?  
COACH THORNE: You know, things that stood out to me, they were in motion about
as well as any team I've watched this year. You see how many ‑‑ it was a thing
of beauty at times the way they just hit you with screen after screen after
screen, and they come out ready to knock it down, and obviously 24 buckets
from an All‑American. We know who Promise is guarding. She's a little rested
today, not quite as many minutes. She'll be fired up and ready to go. And they
have a Hall of Fame coach, and their offensive execution is amazing.  
The other thing that impressed me is they bumped out. They really bumped out.
And so I think, again, we're not happy with our rebounding. We weren't making
moves to get second shots. Second shots are huge for us. Those are a couple of
things we'll be talking about and focusing on.  
  
Q. That last nine and a half minutes, is there more you want to see, or is
that one of those times?  
COACH THORNE: That's what I was alluding to. That's why I put the group in at
the end. They were pissed, excuse my expression. These guys are the reason
that we are here. They got us here. And they were very frustrated that we
weren't scoring and letting the other team score, and they wanted to go back
in. So I put them back in for a little bit. They weren't always doing the
right thing, either, but, we got up almost 30 and we let up. And honestly in
the Pac‑12 it didn't happen very often. I thought we refocused well. It wasn't
that we were just missing shots. Our execution was really poor and we were
turning the ball over.  
  
Q. You've been scoring in field goals for a fair amount of time. And was
there a point of emphasis on attacking the rim, if you weren't going to get
the shots were you just going to take Ohio out of the game?  
COACH THORNE: We didn't think they were going to play us, and we wanted to
take some perimeter shots and draw them out and go right inside. Part of me
was wondering if that was their strategy, because they just hammered us. They
were hammering us. I was concerned about someone getting hurt, to be honest.
And they got in some foul trouble just coming over, but, you know, it's always
our goal to go to the field goal line. We're really good at that. We didn't
want to settle. We didn't want them to sit in and settle, and I thought we did
a good job of balancing that and getting to the field goal line.  
  
Q. You had a lot of great shooters in your time here at ASU. Where does
Katie Hempen sit on that list?  
COACH THORNE: We don't know; she's got another year. I think she's right up
there at the top. She works at it. I mean all of them do. Bree was an
efficient player, she didn't take a lot of threes. She shot a super high
percentage.  
Katie, you saw her at mid-range. It's exciting to see her game develop. She's
not just a three point shooter. So I think that makes it more impressive what
she's doing for us. I think she has a chance to be our all-time best. And I
know she has the work ethic.  
  
Q. I think Katie said you guys share some similarities, and it's tough on
top. Do you see that, too, from the little bit that you were able to see
today?  
COACH THORNE: Yes, we talked about that in the locker room. I said did you see
how tough they are and they said, yeah. You see they play through stuff,
nothing really bothers them. That's what we saw in that team. Our team knows.
Obviously I think that's where we are at. They had an amazing season. That's
what we're used to. We see that day in and day out in the Pac‑12\. But it was
impressive.  
  
Q. Are you planning your squad ‑‑ is it a hungry squad?  
COACH THORNE: They are now. They're waiting in the locker room for 30 minutes,
they really want dinner (laughter.) They're scrambling for snacks. I think
they found some waffles.  
Yeah, I do think this team is hungry. They really aren't satisfied just being
in the second round. I think they've worked really, really hard and they're
going to show up Monday night and leave it all out on the court. I think that
they want to obviously ‑‑ at a minimum, surpass their last year's postseason.
And obviously ‑‑ and they really believe in themselves.  
They've been hungry all year. It's a tough question for me to answer. Our team
has been hungry from game 1. And I think one of the reasons that they had the
consistency is because we try to rest them up and they just come out and you
guys see them. And they play hard. They get after it. And I think something
that is impressive about them.  
So I expect them to stay hungry. We talked about that at halftime. This is
their moment. This is why they've worked so incredibly hard offseason and game
in and game out to this point. They know how meaningful this time of year is.
They do.

_TEMPE, ARIZONA_  
  

ASU  74  
Ohio  55

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Bob Boldon and Mariah Byard and Quiera Lampkins.  
COACH BOLDON: I have no real comment. But I'd be happy to answer your
questions.  
  
Q. (Inaudible)?  
COACH BOLDON: No, not really. I thought they shot the ball well. They're
obviously a well‑coached team, and very skilled, very talented, and a very
good basketball team. And they showed it tonight.  
  
Q. Your thoughts object the game, difficult end to the season, but I guess
anytime you make it this far it's a success.  
MARIAH BYARD: I wasn't happy with the way the game went and the way we
finished off, but I think that ‑‑ I mean we had a great season and I think
this gives the rest of the guys something to work on in the future.  
  
Q. Your thoughts on the game and the season?  
QUIERA LAMPKINS: I think it was a great season, especially from where we
started last year. I don't think we had a great end to it, like Mariah said.
The rest of us will be here next year.  
  
Q. Coach, second half, obviously it was a little closer at halftime, but
things tended to get away the last ten minutes of the game.  
COACH BOLDON: Yeah, they should be happy with this team. It's a good team.
They played well tonight. They played well all year, and today was no
exception. Shot it well, had a good post presence.  
  
Q. Your thoughts on the season as well. And obviously it ends here today,
but it took you here?  
COACH BOLDON: This is a disappointing end to a tremendous season. It was a
team that wasn't ‑‑ I don't know where we were picked. It wasn't first or
second. Probably wasn't third. Might have been fourth or fifth or sixth. They
showed a lot of toughness throughout the year. And they persevered and worked
incredibly hard. They're a tough team. And were able to win a conference and
the conference tournament and put themselves in a spot that Ohio University
hasn't been to in a long time. And it's obviously something that we're very
proud of.  
As I mentioned earlier, just disappointed on the way it ended.  
  
Q. Coach, can you just say what do you think was the biggest thing they did
today that threw you? Was it the defense, the 3 ‑point shooting? What were the
biggest factors that allowed it to get away from you?  
COACH BOLDON: I just think they're really good. They do a lot of things well.
They shoot well. Guard well. They have a good post presence. They're obviously
well coached. They're a good basketball team.  
  
Q. Kiyanna Black was in foul trouble. How big of a factor was that in
today's game?  
COACH BOLDON: I mean, I would rather them not be in foul trouble. But KB ended
up playing 30 minutes. I don't think she was quite as aggressive as she wanted
to be.  
Lexie played most of the game. She picked up a couple of fouls late. It didn't
have nothing to do with us losing the basketball game. We could have been a
little more competitive if they played more. But basketball happens.  
  
Q. Coach, did you expect ASU to press that early?  
COACH BOLDON: Yes, I thought they would press us the entire game.  
  
Q. Coach, obviously painful now, but do you see the team getting back to
this position, in a NCAA tournament in the future?  
COACH BOLDON: I think that's the goal. That's the goal for every team. A bunch
of teams talking about getting to the tournament. We're going to try like
crazy. We've got to play basketball without turning it over 18 times. That's a
big number. That's a huge number. Obviously didn't shoot the ball very well.
And I don't think we guarded very well. We have a lot of things to work on.
We'll give the kids time off, and get back to the gym and try to get better.  
  
Q. How tough is it to leave a player like Mariah Byard this season?  
COACH BOLDON: We'll miss her percentage‑wise, and the things that she does on
the floor. But she's a tremendous help side defender. She has a tremendous
understanding of the game. She understands things as good as anybody we have.
She's a 3.89 student in nursing. She's a kid that gets it done. She's a
tremendous role model for our kids and how to conduct herself as a student and
athlete.  
There's a lot of different levels that we'll miss Mariah, but seniors have to
go and graduate and she can go make some money, and then we've got a bunch of
young kids coming in, and we try our best to coach them.  
  
Q. Your message for the squad after the game?  
COACH BOLDON: That they had a great regular season and if they want to win an
NCAA game they've got to get better.  
Thank you everyone.

UALR  69  
Texas A&M  60

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Blair is joined by Courtney Williams, Courtney Walker.  
COACH BLAIR: Folks, appreciate the coverage. I'm sorry we didn't give you an
A‑game today. Arkansas Little Rock did. They were the best team on the floor.
It had nothing to do with injuries or missed shots or whatever. Right now
they're playing better basketball than us. That's all on me as the head coach.
My job is to get my team playing better, more cohesive, our offensive sets
better, and not let a team shoot 52 percent in the second half, like they did.  
When we fought back in the first half we played so poorly, except for about
five minutes, and I thought we had weathered the storm. We came out and traded
baskets with them for an while, but eventually it just happens, they were
cutting, moving to the ball. We were dead tired. We couldn't guard their three
ball, because basically we were too tired to get to it. They were doing a
great job of running their motion and we've got to do a better job of getting
our kids in better basketball shape and being able to do the little things.  
But right now, really applaud Coach Foley and his 700th win. It seems like I'm
making a lot of my best friends happy this year because this happened about
two or three times and hopefully we can put a stop to it.  
This basketball team up here, you're look at them, we're all back next year,
and we're going to be better than ever. But to do this the commitment has got
to start from the head coach first and these three young ladies up here,
because they're the answer. We've got to look ourselves in the mirror and find
out what are we going to do to become a top ten basketball team again. Maybe
getting kicked in the butt and slapped around a little is going to be good for
us, because we're going to get on that practice court as soon as we take a
week or so off and try to get better and find the answer. But, again,
appreciate the coverage. It was good. Again, commend Coach Foley, his team,
Taylor Gault was by and far the best player on the floor. It wasn't even
close.  
Williams did a good job on her birthday trying to carry us, because we didn't
have much going anywhere else. And so sometimes she was having to take some
shots because she wanted it so bad, sometimes she would force them. Sometimes
they were not going. We had a well called ballgame. Little Rock played well.
They had a lot to do with us not playing well.  
  
Q. Courtney Walker, could you talk about, you seemed like you never got your
shooting touch today, could you talk about why your game wasn't coming to you
today?  
COURTNEY WALKER: It's hard to get going today.  
  
Q. Courtney Williams, you were trying to do so much in the first half, did
that take a lot out of you, talk about your game, when he took you out for a
rest, looked like you were awful tired at that point.  
COURTNEY WILLIAMS: Well, I think I was completely dead. I think the offense
that Arkansas ran, they had a lot of movement and you had to do a lot of
thinking real quick. It could be mentally tiring, but you have to hook it up.
And we didn't really have it today. But I think we could get a little bit
better shape. We have to practice harder during practice and we have to go
through practice and be mentally tough enough in practice to finish our games
like this.  
  
Q. Courtney Walker, could you speak about the troubles today?  
COURTNEY WALKER: It seemed like it was easy for her. She would come off, she
was always ‑‑ she was ‑‑ we just had to give good health, and she was taking
all her shots today.  
  
Q. Talk about dissecting their man to man defense. Could you talk about what
they were able to do that maybe other teams weren't able to do to stop your
offense?  
STUDENT‑ATHLETE: I think because I penetrated more, trying to get back in the
game and just taking care of the ball. As for me, I need to ‑‑ I needed to
make better reads in the defense, getting the ball to the post at the right
time. But they did a very good job of taking away the paint.  
  
Q. Courtney Williams, where did you feel your team was at halftime?  
COURTNEY WILLIAMS: I think we were playing really good defense at the end of
the first half. I think that's why we got our defense. And the second half we
let them shoot more. I think if we would continue to play good defense like we
did at the end of the first half I think we would have been just fine.
Arkansas, they played well on the offense. They were making big clutch shots.
We weren't tough enough to defend that.  
  
Q. Gary, you mentioned without Jordan your bench was not as deep. You did
look a little tired, and you mentioned it. Any idea on why at this point you
felt your team might have been a little tired?  
COACH BLAIR: They've been off for two weeks. Haven't played a game in two
weeks. There's no excuse. There's no excuse. That's on me. If my team is tired
that means I looked tired and that means I wasn't getting the job done. That's
the head coach's job. Our energy has been good for practices and the whole
nine yards. Just look at it, Walker had zero rebounds, it didn't even look
like she was a senior out there. That killed us right there. We don't have our
best energy player. Gault not only guarded Walker and shut her down in the
first half, then she shut down Williams in the second half. Okay, 5‑8 guarding
6‑1 down there. We were turning corkscrew shots up instead of face planting
her, because Gault is not known for her defense, she's known for her offence.
But like it is, we turned the kid into an All‑American today and I'm happy for
her. Six out of thirteen from the three, we hadn't given that all year, but we
were too tired to chase them. I had no other point guard to put in. Walker was
struggling when she went in.  
When we got the ball inside we had great looks. We didn't get all the finishes
we wanted. 26 minutes, 10 rebounds, 9 points, no turnovers, but still, it's
better numbers than a lot of my so‑called veterans had. So we've got to do a
better job, that's the bottom line.  
  
Q. Coach, you mentioned that their motion kind of tired you guys out. But
the way they played defense, that had to have an effect on it, too, it's like
they had you on both ends of the floor, right?  
COACH BLAIR: Their defense is a great help defense because of their lack of
size. When we had our people open inside we didn't finish when we got the ball
in and couldn't get to the foul line enough. That's on us. And we had enough
touches in there. We still outscored them 30 to 24 in the paint. But you've
got to score on some of those offensive boards, then you've got to be able to
turn them over. You've got an assist turnover ratio ‑‑ we were 13‑12\.  
  
Q. In the second half, both teams were struggling. Then Gault hit a three
pointer to go up by six. It looked like you couldn't believe that shot,
because your defense had been so good, but the last second shot was there, and
she did it a couple of times?  
COACH BLAIR: Yeah, the thing that was hurting us in the first half, they were
taking us down to the end and I think Curtyce put one in to help us. But that
was Walker and Williams not creating, and throwing it to somebody with one
second to go on the clock.  
Gault creates her shots. What we've got to do ‑‑ that shot clock is going
down, they better be able to shoot, and we didn't get it done.  
  
Q. Did you think that if you kind of pulled her down on the perimeter, that
would take away things that worked for them in the tournament or was that a
big focus today?  
COACH BLAIR: She hit the one shot that hurt us when we were dead tired, she
had an open look, we couldn't get to it. We had a couple of kids that ran into
a lot of screens instead of avoiding screens. You know they are coming. We
worked on it a bunch. Dawn's a nice little player, but it just wasn't her day.
And it wasn't ‑‑ all of a sudden you have other players step up. When he went
to his bench, his bench delivered, outscored us 24‑10\.  
We played Scott and Chelsea Jennings a lot of minutes, but they couldn't guard
her, because Walker sure couldn't, we were trying to put Walker off on
somebody else, and I thought we did a decent job on dawn. Cobbins didn't hurt
us. Dawn didn't hurt us. But my gosh, Gault and Clark, that's all it takes
right there. They played very well. I think they'll have a great chance
against the winner of this ballgame coming in. I'd love to see them advance.  
Thank you for the tournament, it was very well run.

### [Taylor Gault](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28770)

  
_TEMPE, ARIZONA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by UALR student‑athletes Taylor Gault and Kiera
Clark. Coach, an opening statement?  
COACH FOLEY: We're just proud to be here. We played a great tournament last
week. Conference tournament was as well as we've played all year, so it's a
good note to come in on and great place to be. Actually, I wouldn't mind
living here.  
  
Q. Girls, for either one of you, I mean, you guys have beaten Oklahoma,
you've beaten LSU. Those are two tournament teams. How much confidence does
that give you coming into this match ‑up against A&M tomorrow?   
KIERA CLARK: Well, we've played well especially during the tournament, so
we're going to try to keep that edge and come out excited and ready to play
for Texas A&M.  
TAYLOR GAULT: Oklahoma and LSU, that was like the beginning of the year, so
we're probably (No Microphone) but just knowing what we can do defensively,
we're just going to carry that over to tomorrow's game.  
  
Q. Keira, how do you guys overcome your height situation when you're
obviously playing bigger teams?  
KIERA CLARK: How do we overcome them? Whatever defensive strategy our coach
gives us is what we're going to follow by?  
  
Q. Since you're a guard, studying the film of A &M, how do you think they've
changed since Jordan Jones season‑ending injury?   
TAYLOR GAULT: I still think they're a well‑rounded team. The point is, she
really doesn't try to score that much, she drives very well. I think it's an
advantage for us, so we're just going to try to thrive off of that?  
  
Q. A lot of talk this morning was about A &M and all the tournaments they've
been in. I know I talked to both of you earlier this week about it. But what
do you draw on your first tournament as freshmen? You both played in that
game, but does that help getting to this stage knowing that you've been here
before or are they comparable at all?   
KIERA CLARK: We're coming in more experienced now. Our freshmen year we didn't
know what to expect. So now that this will be our second time appearing at the
tournament we know a little bit more what to expect.  
TAYLOR GAULT: Same thing what Kiera said. Just learning the game and the
college experience, and knowing what to expect in the tournament. We didn't
have a good tournament freshman year, so I think it gives us more drive and
makes us more hungry to know what we can do with our seniors.  
  
Q. Just to kind of expand a little more on that hype question with Texas A
&M, they've got 6'7" players, 6'3" player, and 6'5" player. So what is the
challenge of trying to play against people with that kind of height or a team
with that kind of height?   
KIERA CLARK: Keeping them off the boards, boxing out. That's basically what
the expectation is right now.  
TAYLOR GAULT: It will be different for me or for us. We're playing against
bigger guards, so that is pretty much a change‑up for us.  
So I just think as far as that, we have to crowd them and don't let them get
the shot off. I know they're taller than us, but doesn't mean we can't defend
them.  
  
Q. The NCAA tournament, you're playing a team from the SEC, a team that's
won a National Championship four years ago. Does that mean more? Is that more
of a challenge or is it a fact of it doesn't matter who you play in the NCAA?
What about that thought?  
KIERA CLARK: We haven't really focused on that. So just trying to keep our
game plan that we've prepared for and go with it.  
  
Q. Gary talked about your friendship and just the sort of relationship that
you've had over the years. Can you talk about that a little bit and what it
means to be playing against him in this game?  
COACH FOLEY: Sure. It's special. I mean, ever since he was at Arkansas for ten
years and at Arkansas Tech we played golf, and I played in all his functions
that he raises money for. We've done trips together, so it's a special
relationship. You don't have that very many times in coaching where you're
going to play against your best friend in an NCAA tournament. Now I've been
fortunate. He's come to our place. We've been to his place. Just the regular
season, non‑conference, he's good enough to play us. Played a mid‑major, and
he's actually had some great teams. I think we played them the year or year
after like the one NCAA tournament.  
But to play in the NCAA is a whole different level. I respect the guy. I think
for women's basketball you talk about a spokesman for women's basketball, I
think Gary is one of the best. He always promotes the game before he promotes
himself or his team. And I think you won't find many individuals like him in
the coaching career.  
  
Q. I was talking to Gary earlier this week, and I asked him when your
friendship sparked. He said he was at Arkansas either first or second year,
and he showed up to Arkansas Tech unannounced to watch practice. Do you
remember that at all? What was your reaction to that?  
COACH FOLEY: I do. I'm surprised. You've got one of the better coaches in the
country, and you just come to Arkansas, and we've had great success at
Arkansas Tech. There is no doubt. But to have one of the better Division I
coaches walk in the gym and say, hey, do you care if I watch practice? That's
pretty special. I think that shows you how much Gary respects the game. He's
always trying to learn. Even though he's one of the more well‑established
coaches, that shows you how much enthusiasm he has for coaches. He loves to
coach, he loves to talk, he loves the media. I know he's a great guy. But for
women's basketball, he's one of the best.  
  
Q. What is your strategy for height, and how have you dealt with that?  
COACH FOLEY: There is no doubt that is a problem for us. We don't have the
6'3" kids, 6'2" kids even. It will be a major problem. We're going to have to
pressure the ball and try to give them good looks to get it inside. They're
going to naturally score some in there. But the good thing is that's not their
focal point on their offense. Their focal point is the two guards. They've got
two great guards, and we've got to shut those down as well as we can. We're
not going to shut them down, but we've got to at least limit what they can do.
Naturally that will open up the inside probably a little bit more. So that is
going to be the X‑factor of the game, I think is how much they go to their
bigs.  
  
Q. Talk a little about your defense. Gary said you're basically a man to man
defense guy. You get your post players to play hard when sometimes they don't
even get the ball to score. Can you talk about your defensive philosophy?  
COACH FOLEY: Our defense is always‑‑ take away the strength of the other team,
we play man. We'll try to pressure some, but not‑‑ it's not just all‑out
pressure. We're not trying to steal the ball or make turnovers. We're just
trying to take away what you do well.  
It's been a philosophy I've had my whole coaching career, and I think we're
fifth in the country in scoring defense this year. I think we were taught two
or three there for a long time.  
But the size that they've got will hurt our defense, there is no doubt. We'll
just have to make up for it on the other end. We'll have to score a little bit
more. In the conference tournament we scored really well. We shot the ball
well and hit some threes, so that may be a little bit of a problem for their
bigs to cover our small.  
Our advantage on offense is I've never had the big kids at a mid‑major or
D‑II, so you learn to play with post players that can play out on the floor
and cause the big kids problems. So they have a little bit of a mismatch
problem too.  
  
Q. One more on you and Gary. I imagine you guys have had countless
discussions about basketball over the years. But what have you taken from him
that you've used in coaching over the years?  
COACH FOLEY: Probably recognize our position as coaches to help
student‑athletes to make the game better, promote the game better. He really
takes it serious. I've learned more in my career just about coaching. I think
the relationships, enjoying the relationships more with the kids, being around
somebody like him influences that, how much we should enjoy what we're doing
and things like that. X's and O's, we're probably as far apart as you can get.
He's extremely set offense. Defense doesn't matter a whole lot to him. We're
just the opposite. We're going to run motion offense. Defense is the most
important thing, so you couldn't get two coaches any farther apart as far as
coaching philosophy. But as far as philosophy of life, I think we're right
along the same lines.  
  
Q. Gary compared your coaching style to Bobby Knight. Is that intentional?  
COACH FOLEY: I studied Coach Knight. I've been to every clinic that I could go
to, every film, that is my philosophy. I enjoy the way that the game is
played. It's a team game. We're screening, cutting, we wear a lot of people
down with their man defense and motion offense. I think it goes hand in hand.
It's to wear the other team down. I think that's what we've done and that's
why we've been successful. Most teams can't stay with the pressure that we put
on them offensively and defensively and wearing down everybody in the game. We
usually have a chance to take over.  
  
Q. If you guys win tomorrow it will be your 700th career win. What would
that mean to get the milestone on this stage?  
COACH FOLEY: If we win tomorrow, it will be the biggest win of my life. It
won't be because of the 700 either.

### [Kiyanna Black](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28777)

### [Bob Boldon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28776)

### [Mariah Byard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28778)

  
_TEMPE, ARIZONA_  
  
COACH BOLDEN: This is an opportunity that kids dream of from the first time
you pick up a basketball, just to be here and play in this tournament. We're
just very excited about that opportunity and looking forward to the challenge
ahead.  
  
Q. For either player, what have you guys learned about ASU and how are you
game planning around them?  
KIYANNA BLACK: We know they're a physical team. They like to get out and
pressure the ball. I think our game plan is just to stick to our principles
and take care of the ball.  
MARIAH BYARD: I would agree with KB. I think that we've really been working on
taking care of the ball, which is what we've been working on all year. So I
think that'll be key for us in tomorrow's game.  
  
Q. You have a time differential. This is the first time you've had it this
season. Has that affected you at all, and do you have that going against you?
You also have to play at a home court. They've got the Curtain of Distraction,
if you've heard of that, during your free throws, stuff like that going on.
How is this different than playing like in Cleveland last weekend?  
KIYANNA BLACK: Personally the time difference hasn't affected me. I mean, we
just did the same thing we would do in Ohio, going about our day, eat, sleep,
practice. I wouldn't say it has affected me personally, but I don't know about
the team.  
I have heard about the Curtain of Distraction. I've seen it on SportsCenter. I
think I'll just stick to my principles shooting free throws, just do what I
do.  
MARIAH BYARD: And once again, I agree. I think that, first, with the Curtain
of Distraction, I've seen that on SportsCenter, as well. But I'll just stick
to my routine and shoot my free throws the way I normally do. The time
difference for me, we got out here Thursday morning, so I've already got back
on track and am ready to go.  
  
Q. Can you talk about how good you guys are at shooting the three ‑pointer
and how difficult that is for a match‑up for another team?   
KIYANNA BLACK: I think that's one of our strengths. We like to shoot the ball.
We find each other, get open, easy shots.  
MARIAH BYARD: I think that that's what we practice every day, and so yes, it
is one of our strengths. And we will continue to practice that until game
time. I think when you have a strength like that, you should use it, and
that's what we plan on doing.  
Our team doesn't just shoot the three‑pointers. We can also drive and you'll
probably see a lot of both in tomorrow's game.  
  
Q. These are two quality teams that hold other teams to 55 points. How much
of a chance do you think this could be a low ‑scoring, defensive type of game?
  
KIYANNA BLACK: There may be a big chance. Defense wins games, so in order for
us to have a chance to win tomorrow, I think we need to get stops.  
MARIAH BYARD: I agree, and I think that that's ‑‑ another one of our huge
strengths is keeping teams in low‑scoring numbers. From what I've seen and
what I've heard, they do the same thing, so I'm interested to see how
tomorrow's game works out.  
  
Q. Mariah, you mentioned it a little bit, but what do you guys rely on when
your three ‑point shot isn't falling, and do you think you could beat Arizona
State if you guys aren't hitting tomorrow?   
KIYANNA BLACK: Certainly if we don't make shots, it's going to be a tougher
game, but I think if the three is not working, we've got to look for lay‑ups
and then maybe that'll open up the three‑point shot.  
MARIAH BYARD: Yeah, we've also had a lot of games this year where our
three‑point shots have not been falling. We've been in that situation, and
we've relied on driving and getting to the free‑throw line and everything like
that.  
  
Q. Arizona State hasn't played for two weeks. Going into this game are you
worried at all about them being fresh, having a lot of energy? I know you
technically haven't played for a week, but does that come into your mind at
all?  
KIYANNA BLACK: No, I don't think that's a problem. Coming into the MAC
tournament, we hadn't played and other teams played, and we figured that was
their advantage and it was our disadvantage. It's just ‑‑ at the end of the
day, it's who's ready to play when the ball tips.  
MARIAH BYARD: I agree, and I think that the way we execute in practice, it's
just like a game, so really we're ready to play any day.  
  
Q. You guys have been the favorite in the MAC for the past two months, now
you're the 14 seed. How do you adjust to being the favorite all this time and
now you're kind of the underdog?  
KIYANNA BLACK: I don't really buy into favorites and stuff like that. At the
end of the day, I feel like whatever team comes out ready to compete is the
team that's the favorite. So tomorrow my mindset and the team's mindset is
just to come out and compete, not worry about seeds or numbers or things of
that sort.  
MARIAH BYARD: I agree, and I think that from my own personal experience, I
enjoy being the underdog more than I enjoy trying to stay on top. I'm excited
for tomorrow's game.  
  
Q. I'm not sure if either of you know, you have a couple players from
Illinois on your team, and ASU does, too. Do you know if there's any
connection? Do they know each other at all?  
KIYANNA BLACK: I have no idea. I've heard nothing about it.  
MARIAH BYARD: I think one of them just knew that they were from Illinois, but
that's really all the further that conversation went. I don't know.  
  
Q. Do you think your team has developed a chip on its shoulder being a 14
seed?  
COACH BOLDEN: You should have asked them. They were just here. Why didn't you
ask them? I don't have any idea. I think they're a team that will come out and
play basketball. Whether they're a 1 seed in the conference or a 14 seed in
this tournament, I don't think it makes any difference to them. I think
they'll come out and play as best they can.  
  
Q. Arizona State doesn't really have a go ‑to person, they're all kind of a
bunch of equals. What kind of challenge does that present defensively?  
COACH BOLDEN: Well, they present all kinds of challenges offensively and
defensively. Their balanced scoring is right at the top of that list of
challenges. You've got to guard everybody every possession. We talked about it
when we were getting ready for the tournament, that there weren't going to be
any bad teams in this tournament. That's just not the way this tournament
works. Good teams are made up of good players and they've got a bunch of them
and they're very balanced and do a tremendous job of sharing the basketball. I
think it's crux, it's the challenge of guarding them. That's why they've had
the kind of season they've had. They are incredibly balanced.  
  
Q. This is the first time in 20 years that you've made it to the tournament
and had such a record ‑setting season. What's different about this team that's
allowed them to make it this far and have that kind of season?  
COACH BOLDEN: A lot of trust. They really are a group that really trusts each
other. Offensively they share the basketball and look to get each other open,
and defensively they do a pretty good job with their rotations and really
count on one another to help through the tough times, whether it's the lull of
the season or a tough couple possessions or maybe we have a couple possessions
where we don't shoot it. There's a lot of trust that they'll make the next
shot, and there's a lot of trust that they'll be in the right spot with their
defensive rotations.  
  
Q. Mariah talked about how she enjoys being the underdog. Is that kind of a
philosophy that you like, too, just being kind of the ‑‑ kind of have nothing
to lose out there?  
COACH BOLDEN: I really like it when we're favored by about 25. That's when I'm
the most comfortable. But it's a challenge. It's what you get by being here.
And then I think it's something that we'll accept and we'll try to do the best
we can with it. I don't think anybody is necessarily intimidated by the idea
of this being a 14 seed or whatever number you happen to have beside your
name, but it certainly is a challenge.  
  
Q. You guys are third in the country in field goal percentage defense. What
do you think accounts for just such a dominant effort during the course of the
season?  
COACH BOLDEN: Coaching. (Laughter).  
I don't know. We have kids that play hard. And as I mentioned earlier, they
have a lot of trust in each other. They guard within our system, and whether
we're switching screens or not switching screens, they trust that their
teammate is going to do the right thing. And they have a lot of pride in doing
their job and trying to do their job as best they can, whether it's guarding
the ball and helping or guarding the post or guarding the screen or whatever
their job happens to be that possession, there's a lot of pride in doing that
job correctly.  
  
Q. I asked your players if they thought this might turn into a defensive
type of game. Could you see that happening, too? And also, I'm interested in
just what you think of watching Promise Amukamara as you've been preparing for
this.  
COACH BOLDEN: Yeah, if we can stop them it'll turn into a defensive game. That
is going to be the challenge. They're tremendous on defense, and really enjoy
watching them, until I realize we've got to play them. They do a lot of things
well.  
They've been solid throughout the year guarding different actions, and they
guard it well, move very well as a team. So I think if we can hold up our end
of the bargain, I think it could turn into a good defensive match‑up, but I
know they'll come out and put a good defense.  
  
Q. And Promise?  
COACH BOLDEN: She's good. She's really good. She's a complete basketball
player. You know, she's what you would expect out of a wing in this
tournament.  
  
Q. Two years in you already have an NCAA berth, a new record in school wins,
and now a new five ‑year extension for you. What does that mean for you as a
coach, to see the success happen so quickly?  
COACH BOLDEN: I think it's tremendous. You know, I'm fortunate to be in a good
place. I've got tremendous support from our administration. It's a beautiful
school. It's just a wonderful place to be. Hopefully this is a step in the
right direction‑‑ surely it's a step in the right direction, but hopefully
it's something that we can continue to build on and make sure it's not 20
years before we come back to this thing, and that's the challenge, and
hopefully that challenge is a couple weeks away. But that's the next step for
our program. But it's really an exciting time right now to be a part of it.  
  
Q. There are three veteran coaches here that you're coaching against. You're
kind of the rookie. I'm kind of interested in what your thoughts are on the
other three coaches that are here in this sub ‑regional.   
COACH BOLDEN: Oh, I mean, I hope I can coach as long as they have. It's a
tough gig. It's something that, just because you're good one year doesn't mean
you'll be any good the next year, and all three of the other coaches have been
able to sustain winning throughout the longevity of their career, and I think
it's an amazing feat. You see people get‑‑ people's patience, whether it's the
administration or the general public, is getting shorter and shorter it seems
every season, where people are‑‑ coaches aren't making it through their
contracts, sometimes coaches aren't making it through a season. Years ago that
was unheard of, and it wouldn't be outrageous for that to happen now.  
I think for‑‑ I guess it's something I would aspire to. It's hard to think
about it when you're competing against them, but if you ask me in two weeks
when I have time to reflect on it, I think I would say that that would be
something I hope that I could do, and hopefully return to this tournament, and
hopefully some day be the old guy of the tournament. But I'm not that old yet.
Don't let the gray hairs fool you.  
  
Q. Coming off of Arizona State's bench, how do you approach attacking a shot
blocker like Quinn Dornstauder and then, on the other end, are you guys
planning on fronting the post and just trying to stop them from getting the
ball inside?  
COACH BOLDEN: Those are two really good questions. I guess everybody is a shot
blocker. We don't have anybody over six foot on the roster, so there's a lot
of shot blockers in our conference in every single game we play. So yeah, I
mean, that's obviously an issue. We're going to have to, as I said, take care
of the basketball. We're going to have to move the basketball, we're going to
have to more their defense, going to have to be patient. There's a lot of
things we're going to have to try to do to score on them. It's one of the
reasons why they're so good defensively. At the other end obviously their size
is an issue, and they're really efficient around the rim. Their shooting
percentage around the rim is incredible, and they've done it against people
that are much bigger than us, so we've got to be really solid down there.  
  
Q. Arizona State's coach said that they can put out a short roster on the
floor, they still have players that are 6'4 ". What do you think in terms of
Lexie, Jasmine, players like Mariah Harris, down low. How important will they
be at the start of the game to ensure your players can go down low and don't
have to work around the outside perimeter?  
COACH BOLDEN: Yeah, at this point everything is important. We're a 14 seed
playing a 3 seed in their gym. Taking care of the ball is going to be
important, shooting the ball is going to be important, getting three‑point
shoots is going to be important. You're going to have to play a pretty good
basketball game tomorrow to win, and we understand that. There's a lot of
things on that list of what's important, and it's something you've got to take
seriously. Everything you can control you've got to do your best to control.  
  
Q. ASU rotates a lot of players in and out, they play nine, ten players, and
execute freely and all that. They tend to wear people down. Is that a concern
for you, and your players were asked about the Curtain of Distraction. Does
that matter to you that they're allowing that?  
COACH BOLDEN: No. I mean, yeah, the fact that they're skilled enough to play
that many players, again, they're a really good basketball team that did some
really good things this year, and your questions are solid because that's why
they're good, because they can play a lot of people. They can sustain winning
because if they get in a little bit of foul trouble early, they've got people
they can go to and they play incredibly hard. And when you play eight, nine
people, your kids can play hard, when they know they can take a break and come
sit down for a few minutes. There are a lot of things that contribute to them
being who they are, which is a really good basketball team.  
I think I'm the only person in the room that's never seen the Curtain of
Distraction, so I can't really comment on it. I hear it's pretty cool, so I'm
looking forward to seeing it.

_TEMPE, ARIZONA_  
  
COACH THORNE: I'll just start by saying how appreciative we are of getting to
be here, not only by being selected by the NCAA but our administration and our
PAC‑12 office arranging making it possible for us to host because a month ago
it wouldn't have been possible. So we are so grateful to just get to be at
home and be in the NCAA Tournament. We're very excited. This team has been
amazing to coach all year long, just really mature and hard‑working. We're
kind of ready to play. It's just been two weeks. Right, guys? Yeah, so we'll
just take questions.  
  
Q. Promise and Sophie, last year you guys kind of had a rough ending to the
PAC ‑12 season. How much, if any, effect did that have on your mindset, and
how did it affect how you approached this year and your success this year?   
PROMISE AMUKAMARA: I think it took a toll on us for the season. We knew how it
felt getting knocked off the first‑‑ well, our first‑‑ well, it wasn't really
the first round, but in our first game. We didn't want to be in that situation
again. And so we worked hard in the off‑season. People developed their skills,
and I think we did a lot better this year.  
SOPHIE BRUNNER: Yeah, how she was saying, I think we really took it to heart
that we didn't do well in the PAC‑12 tournament last year, and there was just
a lot of motivation going into this season and knowing we would be better than
last season and building on that, so that was our big motivation this year and
doing the little things better and becoming more consistent as a team, so I
think we've done a great job of that this year, so I think that's why we've
had so much success.  
  
Q. I'll start with Sophie. If nobody ever saw you play, how would you
describe this team?  
SOPHIE BRUNNER: I would describe us as really hard‑working because if you
problem I just look at us, we're not huge looking for anything like that. I
think we play well together and that's why we succeed. That's our main
ingredient to success is how we play together and our chemistry and how hard
we work. If no one ever watched us play I would just say we're a hard‑working
team and that we make other people work harder for us, so if they're going to
beat us they're going to have to work harder than us.  
PROMISE AMUKAMARA: Yeah, just like Sophie said, we're a hard‑working team, and
we're a very tough team. We're never going to give up, and we're just going to
fight for the whole 40 minutes of the game.  
  
Q. Can each of you talk about what you've gained from the break, the
benefits of having this break now, and then also what you think of Ohio and
what you've learned about them in preparing for them?  
PROMISE AMUKAMARA: I think during the two weeks we had off, I think it helped
us get rid of all the little kinks and really prepare for the game plan we
have going into these first and second rounds. Ohio is a great‑‑ they're a
great offensive team, and we're going to do our best trying to stop their
three‑point shots because they like shooting, and then just playing good
defense as a whole and rebounding.  
SOPHIE BRUNNER: Building on what promise said, I think we just got back to
like focusing on what we need to do and not so much the other team, just
getting back to working hard for every play and just getting back to like hard
practices. I think that was good for us, just getting tough again and
rebuilding that muscle. That was good, and then going into Ohio I think we're
focusing on just Ohio right now, and obviously want to go past that, but we
know we're going to be a really tough team and that they're good just like us.
We know it's going to be hard and we're going to have to make them work for
everything.  
  
Q. Coach, is there any personality trait of this team that you've seen
throughout this year that's something that stands out that's different than
any other team you've coached?  
COACH THORNE: Work. This team definitely stands out in my mind, and every team
every year is different. Every team has a different personality, and obviously
I think for this team, they're so young but yet they're so mature. They're so
serious but yet they have fun. And I think, like I've had to do so little.
They're usually like how do I make it fun. They make it fun for themselves and
yet they show up focused and ready to get the job done. I think their maturity
and their ability to balance enjoying the process as well as the hard grind of
preparation has been maybe the best of any team I've ever coached, and I think
that's truly exceptional for them.  
  
Q. What's it mean to you two to be playing at home?  
PROMISE AMUKAMARA: It means a lot to have the support system we have here at
home, and then just like Charli says, we just so appreciate that our
administration has‑‑ they allow‑‑ they made it possible for us to play here.  
SOPHIE BRUNNER: Yeah, building off what Promise says, we really thank our
administration and what the PAC‑12 did to make this possible and allow us to
play here and just the support we've gotten from ASU as a whole and the
students just really means a lot.  
  
Q. You guys played on the road last year. What do you think the difference
will be having a home court, and the Curtain of Distraction at your game a
couple of times. Does it make a difference for you guys like it has for the
men?  
PROMISE AMUKAMARA: Well, according to the statistics, I guess the Curtain of
Distraction has made a huge impact in the free‑throw percentage of our
opponents, so hopefully that plays a role during our games. But like I said,
we're just very appreciative to be playing here. Our support system is huge
from ASU and we're just happy to play.  
SOPHIE BRUNNER: Yeah, I think having the Curtain of Distraction will be cool.
They've been at a couple of our games and it's worked out well. That'll be
cool, and then just being able to play in front of our home crowd, I think
will be a really cool experience, too. I think overall it will be a good
experience, and we're just thankful for it.  
  
Q. Promise, I was there on senior day, but how does this game feel
different? You guys are hosting the tournament in your senior season, so how
does this game feel different for you?  
PROMISE AMUKAMARA: Well, first of all, since it's the NCAA Tournament, it
makes all the difference. It's not like a normal home game, we're playing for
so much more. This is for like the whole of our season, the National
Championship. It's huge, and it's worth way more than my senior game.  
  
Q. Promise, you mentioned their three ‑point shooting and that does seem to
be a strength of theirs, but you guys have done a good job with three‑point
shooting and of course you're known for your defense. What do you do when you
have a really good three‑point shooting team to keep them from getting that
going?   
PROMISE AMUKAMARA: I think we just have to‑‑ we all have to step up our
pressure, make them put it on the court, and then it's not against‑‑ it's not
one‑on‑one, it's one against five. It's not going to be me against my
opponent, it's going to be my opponent against myself and the rest of my team.
We're just going to play great defense and try to get stops.  
  
Q. What do you think about this group of coaches that are here for this sub
‑regional?   
COACH THORNE: Well, obviously it is pretty‑‑ it's very impressive, a couple
Hall of Fame coaches in our sub‑regional, which hopefully just makes the
experience here, having the NCAA Tournament in Tempe, that much more inviting
for our community to come out and watch because it's not just ASU and our Sun
Devils, but we've got some great teams with some amazing coaches, which is
usually the case in the NCAA Tournament.  
  
Q. Can you expand a little bit about the description of this team, and did
you see this coming when you first started practicing?  
COACH THORNE: The "did you see this coming question," you know, basically I
really‑‑ we really believed that we would be better than we were last year. We
had a good year last year, and we had a lot coming back, and we knew that we
could get a lot better. We expected to build on last year's success. The
consistency of this year's team has been amazing, and I don't know that I
would have predicted it. Probably would have predicted us to have a few more
letups or stumbling blocks. It didn't hurt that we stayed pretty healthy
because then when we did lose Kelsey for about three weeks, other people
stepped up and did an amazing job in her absence. We've already said it, but
just how much they came together as a team and how hard they worked from the
off‑season and through November and even as we got into the season was why
they were so consistent. I think we just have kids with big hearts that just
are really competitive and passionate, and I know you might think that every
athlete has that, but they don't. These kids are special that way. I mean,
anything we ask them to do, they do, and a lot of times they'll come back and
they'll want to do more. And when a coach has to shut her kids down instead of
saying, hey, don't you want to do some more shooting, that's a great problem,
and I think that's a little bit more along the lines of the character of this
team. And it is character. We don't have an All‑American‑‑ we don't have
necessarily a player that's going to take over every game or two players or
three players like some of the best teams in the country do. So their ability
to share the ball and take turns stepping up and just the essence‑‑ the thing
I keep saying, it's really the essence of teams. What everyone really loves
about team sports, our team exemplifies. Tia Kanoa, Sophie, then we have other
people that can step up and score and do things, and we've done that all year
long.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit more about what you've learned about Ohio?  
COACH THORNE: I mean, Ohio is very good. In watching them, I'm wondering why
they're a 14 seed, to be honest. But they've won 27 games, just like us, so
they're a confident team that knows how to win. They know who they are and
they play to their strengths really well. As Promise says, they love the
three‑point shot, but they're not just a three‑point shooting team. They're
kind of a three or key team. They're great at attacking the rim. They've got
great penetrators, and when you cut them off, they keep their dribble and they
find their teammates. They're a very good offensive team, and then they're a
very good defensive team. They've been holding teams to in the 50s all year
long. They play from the inside out, so it's more of that saggy match,
sagging, switching. They know they're a little bit undersized, so they're
going to just double and triple‑team our post and they're going to work really
hard to take away our paint touches, and if they beat us, they beat us from
the outside. Like a lot of great teams, I think they kind of keep it simple,
and what they do, they do really well. And when I say simple, I mean like they
don't play five different defenses, they play one defense and they do it
really well. They run their motion offense, and they run it really well.  
  
Q. You talked this season about how well your team does in preparing for an
opponent. I'm assuming that you would think that would be the case here, the
time they've had to get ready?  
COACH THORNE: Yeah, I think we've had good time to prepare. We'll be very‑‑ I
think we'll be very ready for what they do. I mean, we are preparing Wednesday
because we took Tuesday off, so it's not like we've had an enormous amount of
time, but we've certainly had the same amount of time in the Conference and
everything to prepare for somebody. But I think we feel good about what we
need to do to win, and it's a balance right now because we do‑‑ we really want
to be prepared for this team, and then we also just want to go out and kind of
do what we do, so we're trying to balance that. There's no secrets anymore,
it's just part of the season. In this day and age with technology, we have
every single game. We pretty much know everything a team did. We should
definitely be prepared.  
  
Q. When you went into the postseason last year, into the NCAA last year,
there were a lot of freshmen. What would you say are the main differences that
this team is going to bring to this postseason?  
COACH THORNE: Right. The only thing I'll say about Ohio, too, is they're
different than any team we've played this year, so I think that makes it‑‑ it
is making it more challenging to prepare. Usually you play a team, you're
like, oh, they're like this team, like Villanova, like Utah. This team‑‑ we've
played some five out but not quite with this personnel, so it is different and
their motion is different, and they have some dribble‑drive concepts but it's
different.  
In terms of this team, what's different this year? I mean, it is a different
team, but obviously the people that are making the plays, the majority of the
minutes this year, are all returners, and I think it's that one extra year.
With all that experience last year of kind of building on being the team to
beat, building on we expect to win game in and game out, kind of
reestablishing our winning tradition here at ASU and our team culture. So I
feel like we got it back last year, but this year we really‑‑ we didn't need
to get it back; it was here. Now life is a lot easier when you've got your
culture, your winning culture and you've got great relationships and you can
just focus on basketball.  
  
Q. I think if I've got this right, there's three basketball teams playing at
home this week?  
COACH THORNE: Four.  
  
Q. What does that say about your conference?  
COACH THORNE: Thank you. Yeah, we have four teams in our conference that are
getting to host this weekend, and I think it speaks volumes to the strength of
the PAC‑12 this year. I think we finished the regular season with four in the
national rankings, too, which speaks to something. I think a lot of that is‑‑
we've always been a great conference, but I think it's really helped with the
PAC‑12 Network. Having the PAC‑12 network has allowed people across the
country to watch us, and so I feel like our teams and our players are getting
a lot more respect now than we did when we were only having a few games on TV,
and we were waiting until the NCAA Tournament, and they were like, oh, they're
pretty good, and people didn't see them enough, and now they're seeing them.
So I think that has really allowed for a lot more recognition and respect.  
  
Q. You've gotten good production off your bench from at least four players,
and then Shaq has been doing some nice things for you lately. Is she ready to
‑‑ in key situations here if you needed her, Shaq to come in and help you,
just because of the extra size she gives you?  
COACH THORNE: Absolutely. Ohio is a tough match‑up. I'm just stating the
obvious for her with five out, they're playing virtually no true posts,
everybody is playing on the perimeter the whole game. But I think Shaq, Ayanna
Edwards, has really come on strong at the end of the season. We've put her in
in big games in key situations, and she's performed well, so we have
confidence in her, and depending on the situation and the match‑ups, we
absolutely will utilize her. Nicole Iademarco, she missed a few months with a
broken hand. She's gradually gotten back and playing better and better and
with a four‑guard lineup, maybe we can go‑‑ we're already pretty small, but we
could go a little smaller, too, and she's been progressing, as well.

_TEMPE, ARIZONA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We welcome head coach Gary Blair from Texas A&M University and
continuing down are Courtney Walker Courtney, Williams and Achiri Ade. Coach,
an opening statement?  
COACH BLAIR: It's good to be here. I had a chance to walk around the wall of
fame and Hall of Fame in the concourse, and just see some great names. A lot
of you do not have a clue who Oda Mae McDowell is or Barry Bonds played here,
Phil Mickelson, or JoAnne Carner, the great golfer.  
But there are just so many great athletes and so many sports that have played
here at Arizona State. This is my first time here. Of course, I've been to
Phoenix or Scottsdale, but it's good to be here. Arizona State has had a
tremendous year. It didn't take her long to take that year off sabbatical. The
rest of us could do that and have a year off and be assured that we'd have a
job. When we got back, we'd all do it. But give a lot of credit for Charli,
because she served our WBCA very well as president. We're looking forward to
playing UALR. It's going to be a great match‑up. We know what Coach Foley
likes to do. He's a Bobby Knight disciple, so that means man‑to‑man defense.
That means motion offense. That means execution. So we're just looking forward
to the game tomorrow afternoon.  
  
Q. Courtney Walker, talk about on film and scouting reports what you've
learned about Arkansas Little Rock, and what do you feel are the top two
challenges for you ladies?  
COURTNEY WALKER: We noticed that they run their offense very efficiently. It's
not like a set offense that they have to do. They run off of a lot of screens,
so defending those off ball screens and cuts will be one of our biggest
challenges defensively. Also, getting back in transition. They force a lot of
turnovers and when they get those turnovers they're able to convert them.  
So just not turning the ball over in the first place will be a big thing for
us so they can't get those easy baskets, and getting back in transition off of
a make or a miss.  
  
Q. Courtney Williams, could you talk about how your role changes when you
have to run the point with Curtyce, you have run some point, but could you
talk about how that changes your dynamics?  
COURTNEY WILLIAMS: I don't think it changes my dynamics because I like to
touch the ball anyway. I just pick my times when I need to pass the ball. If I
have a teammate open I'm going to get them involved. If I need to score the
ball, then that just comes with the flow of the game, having instincts and
just probably rebounding a lot more, getting the ball, pushing it up, and that
will make it easier to go in transition and make a play.  
So I don't think my role has really changed much. Just playing off of
instincts, passing the ball and scoring.  
  
Q. I guess for each of the players?  
THE MODERATOR: We'll go with Courtney Walker, Courtney Williams and Achiri
Ade.  
  
Q. If you could talk about how this evening has gone for you and how you
look at your team right now, and sort of describe your team a little bit for
us that haven't seen it that much?  
COURTNEY WALKER: We are‑‑ how would you describe us? One of our, I guess,
points is we have a lot of guard play that can be very active and we're very
deep at the guard position. We also have a lot of players that can get us up
and down the court.  
COURTNEY WILLIAMS: I describe our team as probably sharing with the guards,
sharing the point guard roles between me, Courtney and Curtyce, because we
know we have to help Curtyce out, because Jordan was the starting point guard,
and she was very vocal, more vocal than Curtyce. So at the guard position I
say we have to share and distribute even on the wings and everything.  
So the fours can run the floor, make the rebound and play hard like they do.
And the fives, I guess they just need to be big in there, especially against
University of Arkansas at Little Rock, because their biggest player is about
6'1". So if they're going to be big in there, I guess they'll make it better
for us because it will make it easy on us, because all we have to do is get
the ball inside. I think we want to press more this year in NCAA tournaments.  
ACHIRI ADE: I'd like to say even though we're a veteran team, we accept a lot
of challenges and we've been through a lot of challenges a lot of people have
to step up and accept new roles and things that they do. Just because we play
one position doesn't mean you can't play other positions. With the five
position we've really grown a lot in the five position since the beginning of
the year. They've gotten better each game, each practice. We're a growing
team. Every day we learn something new.  
  
Q. Courtney Walker and Courtney Williams, what are your impressions of the
guards of Arkansas Little Rock after watching them on film? What do you think
of that match ‑up?   
COURTNEY WALKER: Their guards do kind of different things. You have the point
guard, number 10 that is a very good three‑point shooter. She has a lot of
range and runs the motion offense. Then you have number 24 who is really good
at creating her shot, getting to the hole, and really good step back jumper,
so she's the main scorer out of the three. Then you have number 32 who can get
to the hole and drive, but she's also the leading assist player. So you have
to try to press with the ball while she's looking the floor over. So college
paired to us, you know, we also like our three guards that we have, so I think
it's going to be a good match‑up.  
COURTNEY WILLIAMS: I would describe their guards as very different players.
Like you said, they all do different things, so we really have to study the
scouting report on the bus and in the hotel so we'll probably match up with
different guards coming in transition. I might be on number 10 coming down in
transition, and we have to stay on the man number 32.  
So we just have to know the scouting report. I have to get number 10 up the
line, and Curtyce will have to push the ball, because 32 is like a facilitator
in and same thing for number 24. She can score, so we have to play good solid
defense on her.  
  
Q. Each of you played in an NCAA tournament previously. Can you just talk
about how that experience comes into play when you get to this time of the
year?  
COURTNEY WALKER: I think that's a good thing because you know I could probably
describe my freshman year as being very big time, which it is the biggest
tournament of the year. I think far younger players and players that don't
have as much experience, having these older players that have been here before
and kind of a little more calm and not so much in awe at the moment can help
them relax on the floor.  
Also, the fact that we've been deep in this tournament and have people on our
staff, coaches and former players who have won the whole thing before also
helps us keep our head in it, keeps us focused and gives us good experience
knowing exactly what we need to do to go far.  
COURTNEY WILLIAMS: Us in the past having NCAA tournament experience is really
good for us for a lot of the younger players like Khaalia, we have to tell her
this is the regular game. It could be your last game, but you have to go out
there and give it everything you have because you never know, this may be the
end of your season and we don't want to have a short spring break.  
But I think last year we got to the Elite Eight. That really helps us out
because we've seen what we need to do to beat the big teams like Connecticut,
which we played in the Elite Eight. Me and Courtney's freshman year we played
Nebraska. And we can't understatement that team because Nebraska had a real
good game against us. I think we're ready to play. Every team's going to be
ready to play in the NCAA tournament, no matter who they play during the year
in non‑conference. I think for us, we just have to go out there and be very
calm and play as hard as we can.  
ACHIRI ADE: Having the experience, we know what it takes. We know we have to
seize the moment. Not every NCAA Division I team makes it here. So we know
each game you have to give it all you have, leave it on the floor, and most
importantly have fun with it. That's basically it.  
  
Q. Courtney Walker, Coach was talking about how you guys were getting on a
roll and hitting a stride and Jordan Jones goes down. Where are you guys at in
trying to get back to that point? Do you think you're close to the team you
were when you went down or is that something you'll be chasing the rest of the
year?  
COURTNEY WALKER: I want to say we're a completely different team because we
have all our players except for Jordan. But Curtyce is a different kind of
point guard than Jordan. She can score. It's just what she can do. She's
naturally very quick and has good defense just like Jordan.  
But Jordan was more of a facilitating point guard. So that gives us a
different feel as far as running our offense goes. But we still have been
working on that since the SEC Tournament. We've had a lot of time to continue
to get used to Curtyce at point. She's a great point guard, so we've been
doing very well with that in practice.  
We just have to go out there and execute and keep the composure and do that
just like we did in practice these past couple of weeks.  
  
Q. This is for Courtney Walker, how do you think your play as changed?  
COURTNEY WALKER: I think since we've both been running point guard, for
Jordan, it's also a chemistry thing. Jordan kind of knew exactly where I'd be
in transition and stuff like that. Just because we played longer. That's
because we played longer. Curtyce is the point guard and she also can do the
same thing that Jordan can, finding open people and reading the defense. So
that would be the main difference, just more experience with Jordan. But I've
also played the one time now that Curtyce is taking a break or something.  
COURTNEY WILLIAMS: The biggest thing, I think is chemistry. Because she knows
where everybody on the floor is going to be. We know at the end of the game if
she needs a steal, she's going to get there. When she does get the steal, we
know we're going to Leak out in transition and go get an easy lay‑up or
something. But the biggest thing I think is transition. But I don't think my
game has really changed because I just play off of instincts.  
So, I mean being it's a little bit easier because Jordan knows that she can
get me the ball anywhere and she can get Courtney Walker the ball anywhere.
Curtyce, we look for her to score a little more and be a little less vocal.
But I mean, she's vocal in her own way. She comes up to us and tells us you're
not going to go in front of everybody, like Jordan does. But the biggest thing
is chemistry. But I think we're getting that chemistry with Curtyce.
Especially this last week in practice.  
  
Q. You and I talked earlier this week about your past with Coach Foley. When
you used to go, and you were at Arkansas and at Arkansas Tech, you'd watch him
practice. What did you take from that? Are there still things that you take
from some of those that you still use nowadays?  
COACH BLAIR: He executes. He's a perfectionist. They just run the same drills
over and over and over. A lot of times it's not five‑on‑five basketball, it's
three on three basketball making sure the pin screens are good and everything.
I'd like to know where Coach Foley was this morning. He missed the first
meeting. Isn't that a $10,000 fine by the NCAA? He's probably playing nine
holes of golf and trying to get ready for my golf tournament.  
What else I learned about Coach Foley is it's not about Coach Foley. It's
about a team, it's about a we. He is the most low maintenance, great coach
that there is. I mean, you're talking about a guy that most people around the
country could not even tell you where UALR is or who Joe Foley is. But the
coaches that know the game realize he's one of the best. He is one of the best
at putting X's and O's together. She's always in the playoffs. I think you're
going to see him there for a long time. As long as he stays there, UALR is
always going to be in the playoffs.  
  
Q. You heard your players talk about chemistry, trying to create chemistry.
How do you create chemistry in such a short time period when you have to play
two and a half games without Jordan?  
COACH BLAIR: It's hard. That's why I avoided chemistry in college. I took
biology. Didn't do too well there either. Chemistry, Jordan's not dead, okay
first. Get that across. She's going to be back with us next year and have a
chance to win Defensive Player of the Year for three times in a row, and
that's never been done in the SEC. She's going to be leading from the bench
and practice. She'll be in Curtyce's ear, but she'll also be in all of our
ears, because she, even though she's not on the court, you've got to listen to
your point guard. We might see the Xs and O's of it, but she feels it. She's
always constantly coming up to me now while she's sitting over there with her
crutches saying, hey, Coach you he need to stay in this a little longer or
this. She is so good at acknowledging the game, and that is what a point guard
is all about.  
Now, Curtyce is learning. The chemistry, she's getting better at being able to
take me. That is the most important thing. Can a point guard take a coach that
is getting on her, because I always will get on the point guard harder than
any other player out there on the court at all times because they're an
extension of me. And she's learning to handle it a little bit better. She
started in her safety net about always being behind Jordan. She started her
senior year after Jordan graduates, and she was very comfortable with that.
Now we're trying to get her out of that element and go on and teak charge of
this team.  
Courtney Williams is doing a great job leadership‑wise with her voice, because
she knows the game very similar to Danielle Adams who played for us before.
Danielle Adams knew everybody's position on every inbounds play, sideline
play, the whole nine yards. Well, Courtney Williams is filling that role for
us, and we want that voice to be heard. A lot of times we'll play Courtney
Williams in four to five positions in this tournament because she's the kid
that is a nightmare for match‑ups. Particularly if she's at the point guard
position. Because she's got the 6'1" size. She can take you down post‑up,
shoot the three or take you on the drive.  
So chemistry is coming along. But the best thing about chemistry is you start
winning and the kids enjoy themselves, what a place to come during spring
break. Right here. Your attitude is better all of a sudden. The sun is out.
The kids are out having a good time. You feel good instead of going up to New
York or Boston where it's snowing right now.  
  
Q. Gary, going back to host sides for the regional sites instead of
predetermined sites, what is the channel for your team? Can you play in the
second round in Arizona State? What is the challenge of playing on someone's
home court?  
COACH BLAIR: We've hosted for three straight years because the NCAA knows we
put butts in seats, and we've averaged 6500 for three straight years. We know
how to host championships. Aggie sports supports winners and we've always been
able to draw well even though that's our spring break weekend. I'm not sure
where Arizona State is on their spring break. But Charli has done a good job.
I think they average around 3,000 fans a game. But I'm sure for an NCAA
tournament that should go up. It's better for the top 16 seeds. I was all for
it because we were picked fourth or fifth in the nation to start the year. We
also almost had a chance to host, but the NCAA I really believe in the
committee room, even though Charlie Creme had us in bracketology for four
straight weeks hosting. Even though we were going to be a 6 or a 7, it wasn't
going to be fair to Louisville who was going to have to come in as a 2 or 3
and play in front of 6500 because the NCAA was using their facility for the
men's regional.  
So you've got to feel a little for Louisville. Send them to South Florida
where they might put a thousand in the stands. I think that had a lot to do
with where somebody was going to go. I think we were going to Florida State
first, Corvallis second, Arizona State third and we ended up here. I love it
here.  
  
Q. How much advantage do you feel since your team's been in the playoff, the
NCAA tournament the last three years as compared to a team that hasn't been in
the NCAA tournament last year?  
COACH BLAIR: UALR has been in three out of the last five; is that correct?
Four out of the last six. So there's no problem there. Joe has been there. Lot
of times you're looking at the jockey, not the team. So I'm looking at Coach
Foley, a veteran coach that knows the game, nothing upsets him. Nothing upsets
him. So he'll have his team ready. The guards are SEC style guards. They can
play in every league, particularly gulf. She's one that the rest of us, all in
the SEC, well, in the Big 12 then, all missed out on. He did a good job of
keeping her at home. She could play or start for most SEC teams. The little
junior college kid, Dobbs, they just fit within his flow of the offense.  
To be able to take post players like he takes and say, hey, you're going to be
a screener in my offense. Then you're going to go get offensive boards or
we're going to give you your points on the scores, but your primary thing is
you're going to be setting screens, like Bobby Knight set screens. We're not
going to call‑‑ you've got to have the right type of mentality to come in here
and say I'm going to play for UALR and I'm going to be a post player and I'm
going to set screens. That is my number one job. Then I'm going to get the
rebounds, I'm going to run the break, and I'm going to play good defense. You
have to have the right person to do that. There is a whole lot of all SEC post
players that wouldn't do that. They want the ball more often.  
  
Q. What would you say was the biggest weakness for your team over the
regular season that you'll be focusing on for the tournament?  
COACH BLAIR: The biggest weakness? Well, I found out really quick when Jordan
Jones went down five minutes to go in the first half she was more valuable
than I was over there on the bench. When you take out the heart of your
defense, because defense is created‑‑ creates a lot of offense. You can take
chances behind her. She had 37 charges already. Okay, because she's in your
shorts. In particularly, we were playing Little Rock, that 5'4" guard might
not be able to see those wings getting open and the post setting the screens.
That is how much pressure she could put on.  
So if that's how weakness, we've got to play team defense now instead of
individual defense knowing that Jordan was going to bail you out. Weakness
also is consistent scoring at the 5 position. We've got 6'5", 6'7", 6'3". It's
like eenie meenie miney mo, whoever is playing. I keep them in there and the
other two can come sit by me until we can get them ready. But we need
consistency at the 5 position. But we knew that going into the year. They're
young and experienced, okay? They just hadn't played that much. They're
getting better. But the season is getting to an end. I've got to get better in
a hurry.  
  
Q. A lot of people might look at this and see it's 6 versus 11, and kind of
label you guys as favorites. But you sound a little bit more cautious. Does
that come from what you know about Joe and his program and whatnot?  
COACH BLAIR: I think I was a mid‑major student at Boston, when you look at the
Middle Tennessees, the Green Bays, ourselves, the Gonzagas of the world, and a
lot of schools that are like that‑‑ I don't mean to leave anybody out‑‑ their
coaches are BCS coaches. They're just not playing in BCS leagues. That's why
their programs are always winning at the highest level because their
administration says I want the best coach. Some of those guys or girls never
get a chance to get to the BCS level, but they're going to win consistently
where they're at. Those programs are never going to lose, just like when I was
a student at Boston and Louisiana Tech. They're going to win because of
tradition and good coaching.  
I don't know if I answered that all the way, but I usually ramble anyway. So
just throw some adjectives in there.  
  
Q. You mentioned in your opening statement about Charli coming back from an
absence. Do you see anything different from what you've seen of her team to be
the same as what you've seen before or do you feel like just that you were
able to take a step back and take a breath and all that?  
COACH BLAIR: You have a great situation that happened in 2009. Correct me if
I'm wrong. Were they the 6 or 11 seed? I think we were the 3 that year. Okay,
we're up near Trenton, New Jersey, won our first two ballgames up in South
Bend, I believe, beat Minnesota and then go up there. We're the higher seed.
They had taken care of Florida State already. Is that right? And two good
teams. She's got that type of team again, okay? Now, she might not have Briann
January. We made Briann January a lot of money. Y'all shot 62% on us, we
couldn't stop.  
She was going to be drafted anywhere from 10 through 15, we made her a sixth
round draft choice. And of course an Aggie helped choose her, because Kelly
Krauskopf who is an A&M grad played. She's the general manager at the Indiana
Fever. She tore us up. They did everything well in that ballgame. It wasn't so
much that we played poorly. They played so good that was not a thing we could
do.  
That is the trademark of Charli's teams. It's the we, not the I. It's not the
head coach. It's the assistant coaches. It's the we factor, and that's why
she's one of the best at getting it done. She might not get all the McDonald's
All‑Americans that go up to Stanford or sometimes the other Pac‑12 schools.
She's getting it done with players that fit within a system and give her a lot
of credit. She could go to anyplace in this country, and you all are lucky to
still have her here. She doesn't want to leave. She's like Sherri Coale. She
doesn't want to leave Oklahoma. Mulkey doesn't want to leave Baylor.  
There may be more entertaining places than those three, but this is pretty
entertaining right here. This is a good place.

_TAMPA, FLORIDA_  
  

Uconn  63  
Notre Dame - 53

  
THE MODERATOR: On the dais from Notre Dame head coach Muffet McGraw,
student‑athletes Jewell Loyd and Taya Reimer.  
COACH MCGRAW: Disappointing way to end the season, but I thought it was a
great achievement to get here. Disappointing in I think that we weren't able
to really play our game. I feel as though offensively we ever got into any
rhythm. I thought Jefferson was outstanding, I thought they put a lot of
pressure on the ball, and that really hurt us.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Could you talk about their defensive pressure? It seemed like they were
doing a lot of different things to harass you, made it kind of difficult for
you scoring ‑wise in this game?  
JEWELL LOYD: It was a normal face guard where everyone was pressuring us,
Lindsay was getting pressured all the way up the floor. Got us out of our
rhythm ‑‑ well, when we had a rhythm.  
And we didn't execute as well as we planned.  
  
Q. Brianna, you had ten points in the first half against South Carolina and
then you scored your first two points in the second half. Did they change
anything defensively that you didn't see against South Carolina?  
BRIANNA TURNER: I think I wasn't aggressive enough, I was really timid in the
first half.  
  
Q. Taya and Brianna, could you talk about how difficult ‑‑ you guys are used
to how difficult it is sometimes you think, it's tough when they have those
shot blockers inside, especially Stewart, and also if you could talk a little
bit about the way Stewart rebounded tonight?  
TAYA REIMER: I mean, they have great bigs on their team. We knew that they had
shot blockers on their team, and, I mean, they're very good inside. So we were
just trying to run stuff that I guess could avoid that shot blocking somewhat,
and we were just trying to attack them.  
But like you said before, we really couldn't find the rhythm offensively.  
BRIANNA TURNER: What Taya said, they were long and athletic. We couldn't get a
rhythm going.  
  
Q. Jewell, seemed like there was a point there, I don't know if it was about
seven ‑minute mark, I'm not sure when exactly when it was, you were close and
they were able to get that last surge. Do you think that was sort of the
difference in the game there, they made that last run on you?  
JEWELL LOYD: I think we kind of lost people in transition, lack of
communication at times, and allowed them to get open shots at times when we
really needed to break away. We kind of relaxed a little bit, and that's when
they ran the shots.  
  
Q. Taya, I have to say you guys seem more ticked off than anything. But also
like kind of I know you all are coming back. Can you tell me about your
emotions right now about this game and maybe going forward to next year?  
TAYA REIMER: I mean, obviously it hurts. You know, we had a lot of growth this
season. And we really came together. And it's really tough. We really wanted
this. But we're just going to use it as motivation for next year.  
Obviously offseason starts now. So we're using it as motivation, because we
want to get back to this moment and we want to be the ones out there holding
the trophy.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. You mentioned Moriah's defense. How has her presence on both ends of the
court changed in the two years you've faced her?  
COACH MCGRAW: I thought she was a great defender tonight. I thought she made
things hard for Jewell. She made‑‑ we weren't able to really get anything
going, because most of our offense runs through Jewell. And she really did a
great job denying her the ball.  
I thought she made a couple of 3s that hurt us and other than that, I think it
was mostly her defense that really bothered us.  
  
Q. Muffet, Brianna Turner had a tough time getting touches. Seemed like she
didn't have much offense going. What changed in the second half? Because it
did seem like the light came on then.  
COACH MCGRAW: We didn't look for her enough, I thought. I thought we needed to
get her the ball more, talked about it at halftime, trying to get her in the
pick‑and‑roll, going high/low, and we were able to do that a little more
successfully in the second half. But I thought our point guards had a little
trouble finding her.  
She didn't seem to be able to find her even when she was open. I thought that
the pressure on the ball really disrupted us.  
  
Q. Wonder if you could talk about Stewart, she didn't have sort of the
offensive game she normally has but she was really tough on the board. How did
she impact the game maybe in ways that the stats didn't show?  
COACH MCGRAW: I thought Brianna Turner did a great matchup on her. That was
the matchup we were hoping for. She was able to stay out of foul trouble, and
I thought made it difficult for Bri to get any shots. And I thought just did a
great job both guarding on the outside and the inside.  
So I was really pleased with the way we defended her. She had 12 defensive
rebounds, but I thought we could have attacked the offensive glass a little
bit more, but we weren't able to do that. A lot of times we just had one
rebounder in there. But she's an outstanding rebounder.  
  
Q. Has this team come the farthest than the past five?  
COACH MCGRAW: No question about it. When we looked at the way we played in the
past season and what we've been through, we didn't expect to get this far. It
took us losing at Miami to really start to turn things around, and I think
from that point on we really saw the potential.  
  
Q. Going for the (indiscernible) I see you guys have a lot of players coming
back. As far as getting your team mentally prepared, do you think it will be a
better situation versus last year from now, because a lot of your team is
coming back? Do you think you guys could get back to this point and maybe pull
it off next year?  
COACH MCGRAW: We have everybody back but there's no guarantees that we could
get back here. I mean, it's going to take a lot of work and we've got three
All‑American guards coming in.  
We've got a great opportunity to look at some of the weaknesses that were
exposed to tonight. I think those guards can really help us. So I've got
really optimistic, high hopes for next year.  
  
Q. UConn's been dominating teams all season and a lot of double ‑digit
blowouts. Maybe other than Stanford no one has been close to beating them as
you were tonight. Why was it so close, and do you feel like your team was just
giving them their run for their money, a dogfight out there with UConn not
letting them slip away to the final seconds?  
COACH MCGRAW: I thought because we defended pretty well. We felt at halftime
we were guarding them in the half court offense pretty well and our problem
was in transition and second‑chance points. So if we could stop turning the
ball over, we'd have an opportunity to close that gap that we had at halftime.  
So I was relatively pleased. We held them to 63 points. That's probably a
season low for them, I would guess. And our problem is the offense; we
couldn't score.  
  
Q. You said the problem was the offense, you couldn't score, the turnovers
also hurt. They've got a lot of pretty good players over there, too, is it
not?  
COACH MCGRAW: I'm sorry, I didn't get the question.  
  
Q. The question is they're a bunch to handle, UConn is, are they not?  
COACH MCGRAW: Yes, they are.  
  
Q. Is this a good example of what UConn is? Because it seemed you did a good
job on a lot of people tonight. Stewy didn't kill you. Tuck didn't kill you
like she did the first time, and yet big basket here, Mosqueda ‑Lewis or it's
Jefferson. Is this a lot about who UConn is? Is that what we saw?   
COACH MCGRAW: I'm not sure I understand the question.  
  
Q. They seemed to get a big play here, there, or everywhere, without anyone
standing out individually. Did we kind of see maybe they didn't play their
best game? You guys made life difficult for them yet they found a way? In a
funny sense, is this what UConn is all about, just here, there, and
everywhere?  
COACH MCGRAW: I thought the 3 that Lewis hit was in transition was critical.
We had just cut it to 6. We didn't switch the ball screen. They got a
free‑throw jumper for 2, came down and turned it over. Transition from
Mosqueda‑Lewis for 3, and now it's a five‑point swing, 6 went to 11, and that
was the game.  
And so I would say that's pretty typical of Connecticut, that scoring in
transition, especially for Lewis.  
  
Q. What do you attribute some of those turnovers to, because some of them
seemed uncharacteristic for you guys?  
COACH MCGRAW: I thought so, too. I don't know. I guess the moment. You're in
the championship game. I think we were a little tight during the game. I
really thought we had nothing to lose. We would come out real loose and we
were the opposite. It was disappointing to see.  
I don't know why‑‑ I mean, they wanted to win and put too much pressure on
themselves.  
  
Q. Do you think ‑‑ as far as the game is concerned, do you think it was good
UConn defense or you guys just struggled a little on offense? Do you think it
was more so you or them?  
COACH MCGRAW: I thought it was mostly their defense. We had a couple of layups
we missed, but overall I thought it was mostly their defense.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_TAMPA, FLORIDA_  
  

UConn  63  
Notre Dame - 53

  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us on the dais from UConn, student‑athletes Moriah
Jefferson, Kaleena Mosqueda‑Lewis, and Breanna Stewart. And we're waiting on
head coach Geno Auriemma. We're going to start with an opening statement from
coach Geno Auriemma and then take questions for the student‑athletes.  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, obviously it's incredibly rewarding to be able to do
what we did. And it was really hard to do it. We knew playing Notre Dame was
going to be really, really difficult. And it was everything that we thought it
was going to be.  
But these guys made some plays in the second half that kind of showed our true
character. We talked about it in the locker room a little bit that every time
we were challenged, we responded.  
And couldn't be happier for them tonight. You know, every senior that plays
college basketball wants to win their last game in their career. And I'm happy
for K that she got a chance to do that and with Kia as well. And I'm glad that
the two buckets that K made down the stretch were kind of the difference in
the game. And that's the way she's supposed to go out, because she made a big
difference all year and throughout her career.  
So I'm thrilled for them. And what else can I say?  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Breanna, you came to UConn saying you wanted to win four national titles.
You're one away. Does it seem surreal in any way? Or just describe how that
feels, a lofty goal up there and now you're pretty close to it?  
BREANNA STEWART: I think it's really surreal, and I think I haven't had a
chance to even think about that, the fact that I've won three National
Championships. But I said I want to win four, and you can't win four without
winning three.  
  
Q. Breanna, on stage I think you said this is the hardest championship or
the hardest season. Why is that compared to the other two?  
BREANNA STEWART: Well, I think that this season was different. And Coach
(indiscernible) when we went into the locker room, we had to grow as players
and as people off the court, and that's what we did. And you saw us struggle
in November when we lost to Stanford and that kind of thing, and just the way
we've grown to become the type of team that you saw tonight and national
champions.  
  
Q. Kaleena, what did it mean to you to make those key shots, only up 6 in
the second half and after the game to be there holding on to the National
Championship trophy?  
KALEENA MOSQUEDA‑LEWIS: It meant a lot to be able to step up for my teammates
in a big time where they needed me. And definitely kind of had it in the back
of my mind that we wanted to go out with a National Championship and being
able to hold that trophy up at the end of the game and end my senior year the
way I wanted to and the way that any basketball player wants to was amazing.  
  
Q. Breanna, looked like you turned the ankle there with about eight minutes
left in the first half. Looked pretty painful. Can you talk about how much
pain you were in throughout the game, and then just seemed like you were still
able to really impact the game with a lot of so ‑called little plays but they
made a big difference?  
BREANNA STEWART: When I turned it I wasn't sure I stepped on someone else's
foot or rolled it on my own. Obviously it was painful. Anyone who has rolled
an ankle knows that. Rosemary, she does a good job, taped it to the point
where I really couldn't feel it during the game.  
  
Q. Moriah, you've also won three titles in a row. And I wonder just how you
feel about that accomplishment as well?  
MORIAH JEFFERSON: I feel the same way Stewy does. I had the same goal coming
in, wanting to win four national championships. And to be able to do it with
these guys and to do it on the type of season we had, I can't be more proud of
my teammates and I couldn't be happier.  
  
Q. I know everyone on the panel affiliated with UConn, you all have multiple
championships. My question is: As far as basketball is concerned, is it harder
during the tourney to get to the tournament or are the practices ‑‑ the
competition in practice, is that just the competition because you guys
continue to win? So my question is, is it harder in practice or are the games
actually harder for you guys?  
MORIAH JEFFERSON: Coach does a good job of making practices extremely hard. I
think when you're playing against the type of practice players that we play
against that are so well played throughout the whole practice and they're so
much stronger and physical than you, it's definitely hard.  
But I think it's two different types of situations because Notre Dame is a
great team and they play hard. But I think practice is something you really
can't imagine unless you go through it.  
  
Q. Breanna, you set out to win four championships. Alongside of that you've
won three Final Four Most Outstanding Player awards. The only player to do
that was Kareem Abdul ‑Jabbar. The only woman to do that. Can you describe how
that feels like?  
BREANNA STEWART: I think that, you know, it's a cool feeling that kind of
thing. But the championship is most important. And as I said on the stage, I
thought that Moriah should have gotten the MOP. I thought the way she played
was phenomenal these past two games. And I think that people wanted to give it
to me just because it was my opportunity to win three in a row.  
  
Q. Moriah, Coach McGraw credited your defense on Jewell Loyd as being one of
the most significant factors in the game. Can you talk about what that matchup
was like and how you defended her and basically what you did?  
MORIAH JEFFERSON: Jewell's a really good player. And you have to try your
hardest to not let her catch the ball. I really just tried to deny her and
make sure that she couldn't catch it and send it back door to Stewy and Kiah
who were there to block it. I give a lot of credit to them because it makes my
job on the perimeter a lot easier.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Rebecca Lobo told me that your players now maybe don't see the same
"Crazy Geno" that she saw 20 years ago. And I want to know, she said that
changes with each championship. So with each championship, how much or how
much do you change I guess as a coach and as a person as well?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I think it's natural. It's just natural that you go through
some changes. I ask my players to change. I ask them to grow up and to be
different than they are coming in. And I want them to be better in March and
April than they are in October and November.  
A lot of times that goes for coaches, too. I wanted to be better. I wanted to
be better as the season went on. I wanted to be a better coach for them at the
end of the season. So we spent a lot of time during the season growing up
together.  
They didn't trust very much early in the season. They just thought everything
was going to be real easy. And they didn't really depend on each other that
much. They kind of wanted somebody else to do the hard work. And little by
little, they became trustworthy. And I trust them now and I think they trust
me.  
When Rebecca was a senior and we won that championship, we all were in a
situation where none of us knew what we were doing. We were just kind of
winging it. None of us had been there before, none of us had done that, it was
like a magical ride, and we all just roll with it.  
With each year it's gotten increasingly more difficult to get to the same
point, because now you know where all the pitfalls are.  
I'm going to look back at some point and it's going to be‑‑ I'm going to have
to read it to really comprehend everything that we've done. I'm really going
to have to actually read it.  
  
Q. I know you've been asked and commented on this a lot this week, but now
that it's here, 10 up, 10 down: Phil Jackson, John Wooden, and Geno Auriemma.
Can you reflect on that now that it's here?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, none of those other guys you mentioned coached any bad
teams with bad players on them. So we all have that in common. We all coached
some of the most iconic players to play the game of basketball.  
So I think we have that as the thread that runs through all three. Anytime
you're in a championship situation, anytime you're trying to win any
tournament, but especially the National Championship, so many things have to
go right and you have to have players that make those plays that make it go
right.  
To do that 10 times in a row, to win 10 and be 10‑0 in National Championship
games is ‑‑ again, it's too big for me to think about it. It's too much. Too
much.  
  
Q. A question along those lines, when you match John Wooden with 10 National
Championships, invariably there will be people who will say: Well, you coach
women. Wooden coached men. It's different. How do you hope UConn's 10
championships, your 10 championships, are measured in the scope of basketball
history?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Whichever way they want to mention it, whichever way they want
to acknowledge it. Whenever way anybody wants to put it on a pedestal or keep
it somewhere else, you know‑‑ I said this the other day to people, you know,
we're not real good in this country about appreciating just people that are
good. We always have to compare. We don't appreciate Stewy. We have to compare
her to somebody playing in the NBA or somebody playing college basketball.  
I go through that with our Olympic team. Our Olympic team is the best team in
the history of the Olympics. We won five straight gold medals. But because we
travel with the greatest basketball players in the world, when you make a
comparison, you always come up short. So you kind of got to appreciate it in
its own element and say, okay, well, relative to their peers, those guys are
really, really good.  
Because if we don't, if we start relegating it, you know, and we go by what's
the most important sport in the country, the NFL. Bill Belichick is the only
coach worth a shit right now. Everybody else is just trying to catch up to
him. But every other coach that you mentioned, whether it's Phil Jackson,
Coach K, Anson Dorrance down in North Carolina, the women's soccer coach, when
you accomplish something that's really hard to accomplish, you should be proud
of yourself.  
And how people want to compare you to anybody else, that's their prerogative.
Some people are going to say this is really, really great and historic, an
unbelievable achievement, and some people will pooh‑pooh it.  
So as you can tell by some of my comments in the last couple of weeks, I've
lost the ability to care, give a damn what people think.  
  
Q. Because this team had overcome so much in growth over the course of the
season, was it one of the most satisfying and rewarding?  
COACH AURIEMMA: It is. It is. I didn't like this team in October. I mean,
don't get me wrong, I tried to like them. I was really nice to them. But that
always backfires. I tried to like them.  
Like last year, with that team last year, I liked them, they liked me. We
started off October15th loving each other, and it just got better and better.
It was Barney. I love you, you love me, we all loved everybody.  
This year I didn't like them in October and they didn't like me either,
because I knew. I knew what we were doing in October and November wasn't going
to be good enough to get what they wanted, which is what they have tonight.
But they didn't want to listen to me. They didn't want to hear it.  
How do you tell a group of guys that have won two national championships in a
row that what they're doing isn't good enough? So little by little, though,
they started to understand. They started to see what we were talking about as
a coaching staff. And Shea and Marisa and C.D., they put a lot of time in with
these guys, and little by little they started to see the results of that hard
work, how they started to trust each other more, depend on each other more, be
held more accountable to each other. Last year's team we had three bad
practices in five months.  
I remember all three of them. Great. That's it. In five months. This team we
probably had three a week. Because in the beginning they didn't know, they
didn't know, and as the season wore down, every day was great in practice.
Every day was a great day. Most of January, February, March, these last couple
of weeks, every day was great.  
I shouldn't say‑‑ there were a couple that were not so great.  
  
Q. During the breakout session, Breanna talked about when she was a high
school senior, she would talk to you, you guys would have conversations, check
up on each other, and she said a lot of times those conversations revolved
around sort of expectations, what she wanted to do when she came to UConn,
what you sort of either expected from her or said: I can help you with this
but you have to work. Can you recall even in general what those conversations
were like when she was a high school senior prior to heading in?  
COACH AURIEMMA: It's part of the evolution of our program. And it's part of
the evolution of the recruiting process. When we were recruiting Rebecca, it
was Rebecca. You could come to Connecticut and you could help us be really
good. You can help build a program that people will say Rebecca Lobo helped
build that.  
So that was the conversations that Rebecca had and I had on a regular basis
were about what she could do to help us and how much fun it would be to play
at Connecticut, close to home and all that.  
As the years have gone on, and now culminating with recruiting Stewy, my
conversations with Stewy were more about Stewy: Think of it this way, what do
you want? Tell me what you want, because even if you don't come to
Connecticut, I mean, there's a chance we could still win national
championships. So it's not like we're dependent on just one player.  
So what do you want? And she said: You know I want to win four national
championships. I want to be Player of the Year. I want to make the Olympic
team. I want, I want. She wants all these things.  
I said: Well, why don't you sit down and take a look at all the coaches that
you think can help you do that and you tell me where you want to go to school.
So it was more about now the conversation and recruiting, this is what we can
do for you, as opposed to Stewy: If you come here you'll help us do something,
what, we've never done before?  
So it's all about appealing to what they want now. And the thing with Maya,
the same with Stewy, all these guys, those kids that don't necessarily know
what they want, I don't know what I want, we don't get those kids. Those kids
have to play 35 minutes, lead the country in scoring, want to have fun, want
to love their coach, want to be buddy‑buddies with their coach. We don't get
those guys. We get guys who don't like me but want to win championships.  
  
Q. I know you said you just don't like comparing things, but three
Outstanding MOPs for Stewy. First woman to ever do that. And, again, Kareem is
the only person in college basketball to do that. What does that mean in her
legend?  
COACH AURIEMMA: There just hasn't been a player like Stewy in the women's game
in a long, long time. I think she might be like two inches taller and longer
than Cheryl Miller. And Cheryl Miller was one of the best players I ever saw
that size.  
Lisa Leslie was a great, great player, but I don't know if she was as
versatile. Stewy is not as big as Lisa, but I don't know that Lisa was‑‑
Stewy's the kind of player that women's basketball probably has not seen,
because it's still young. Kind of like when Kareem came to UCLA. Not a whole
lot of players coming out of high school were like Kareem, in the history of
the men's game.  
So for her to get three most outstanding players, as I said, she set her goal
to do that and maybe that's why she broke down up on the stage today, that she
knows how hard she worked to get here, and I'm proud of her. She has to do it
under unbelievable expectations, the weight of expectations on Stewy are way
different than any other kid playing college basketball.  
  
Q. You just touched on this a little bit comparing Stewy to Kareem Abdul
‑Jabbar in terms of the timeframe in which they played, and there's a lot of
similarities between you and John Wooden. Not just the 10 titles now but also
the era of the men's game and the women's game. Have you considered that, and
also like the role you've played in the evolution of the women's game?  
COACH AURIEMMA: That's a good question. And I like it better when it's phrased
like that. Because we are in that stage, the NCAA Tournament is only 30 years
old, or 34, 35, maybe, the NCAA Tournament. Used to be a different tournament.  
So we haven't been doing this a long time. College women's basketball being in
the public eye hasn't been‑‑ that hasn't been a constant in the media, the
social media, the fans, the everything.  
This is all new to us, relatively new. 30 years. And even in the last 20
years, you know, since 1995, things have changed dramatically for the women's
game. And I can remember as a kid you couldn't get a college basketball game
on TV, in the late'60s, early'70s.  
When UCLA was going through their run, you couldn't get college games on TV.
There was no big Monday, ESPN no televising those games. You were lucky if you
ever saw a game. So the game didn't have the appeal that the men's game has
today. And the NCAA Tournament was different back then. You play two games
close to home and you went to the Final Four.  
And we're not quite that, but there's a lot of similarities. So I think John
Wooden was one of the reasons why the college game became the game it became.
Like the game down at the Astrodome in Houston, that kickstarted a lot of
things.  
And I hope that we at Connecticut have done our part to grow this game. When
people say is this good for the game, what you're doing, I'm part of it so I
think it's great for the game.  
But I do think there's a level of attention that we're given that I think
helps everybody. It helps everybody. And just like it ended at UCLA, they're
not what they used to be. History has a way of reminding you that the same
thing is going to happen with us, the same thing. Just want to enjoy it while
we're in it.  
  
Q. You said in October/November your players weren't doing the right thing.
What weren't they doing or maybe what were they doing that wasn't right? And
was there a point in the season where that changed, where you saw that they
started trusting you, where they started doing the right thing?  
COACH AURIEMMA: It's never like big, big things. It's not like they didn't
feel like coming to practice. Or they were dogging it in games. Never anything
like that. It was more of this little detail is really important and they
would tell you by their actions no, it isn't, and that would just piss us off,
like big time.  
So this thing in practice, this drill we're going to do, I know it's really,
really hard. But if you're going to stand there and complain that it's really,
really hard, now you're just not good enough to be where you want to be.  
So there was a lot of going on like we were making it, we were trying to
prepare them and they didn't necessarily want to work at it, they just wanted
to play games and win. They didn't really have an interest in practicing
great. And I think after we played at Notre Dame and came back, because that
time leading up to the Notre Dame game from the Stanford game was pretty
important. A lot of changes were made on our team between the Stanford game
and the Notre Dame game. A lot of good stuff happened on our team.  
And from January1st, pretty much, until everything changed. They embraced how
hard it was. Every drill we gave them that was impossible, they embraced it.
They tried to win at it any way. Everything we threw at them they tried to
win. Every obstacle they tried to get over it instead of, oh, well, Coach,
there's only four us on defense and there's five of them on offense, how do
you expect us to guard them? What, do you think I'm stupid? I know there's
five of them. You're supposed to figure out how to guard them.  
As the season went on they started to embrace the challenge, and that
basically is what got us to where we are now.  
  
Q. I know you said you've lost the ability to give a damn about what other
people think ‑‑  
COACH AURIEMMA: That's not really true. My wife, I care what she thinks.  
  
Q. I'm just wondering whether you might also care what the team thought when
they sort of lifted you up and carried you off the floor. What was that like
for you, that experience?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, that first started in 1995. Every year since then it's
become less enjoyable, because back then they were overjoyed at the fact that
they could carry me off the floor.  
Now when they pick me up, all they do is bitch and moan how heavy I am. Well,
I make it worse because I kind of just lay there like a stone. So Kaleena
Mosqueda‑Lewis took the brunt of it today.  
Yeah, that's just something that started. I don't know that they like it or
don't like it, but they do it. They have fun with it. And we have a lot of
traditions on our team. Some are like really, really dopy and some are pretty
cool.  
And as I've gotten older I embrace more of the traditions that they think are
important. And it's a fun‑loving group, and I'm happy for them.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

### [Kaleena Mosqueda-
Lewis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23275)

  
_TAMPA, FLORIDA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us on the dais from UConn, head coach Geno Auriemma and
five student‑athletes, Morgan Tuck, Kaleena Mosqueda‑Lewis, Breanna Stewart,
Moriah Jefferson and Kia Nurse. Questions?  
  
Q. Geno, I'm guessing a lot of your freshmen weren't even born during your
first championship run in'95. And the players who maybe were don't remember a
time where UConn wasn't a powerhouse. So, can you give us some insight onto
the challenges you and those maybe early'90s players faced that these players
have never and will never face?  
COACH AURIEMMA: We've been really lucky the way that you would like the way
programs get built, that there's some kind of blueprint for it and that every
coach would aspire to have that same blueprint.  
You take a job that not a lot of people want at a school that has never had
success, then you win a little bit and a little more and a little more, and
you win with players that are not being recruited by the bigger schools, the
really good schools. And little by little you end up winning a National
Championship in 1995.  
Doesn't always work out that way. And we were lucky that it did. A lot went
into those first 10 years. And it went from hoping we make the NCAA Tournament
and then hope we win a game in the tournament because we lost our first two
games, the first two years we were in the tournament we lost in the first game
that we played, hoping we get to the regionals and then hope we ever get to
the Final Four.  
So it was always like I hope we can do this, I hope we can do this. So what's
changed that these guys haven't had the experience is there's no like I hope
we do this. It's all this is what we're going to do. And in some ways I think
they missed out on the excitement of getting there. But they get to enjoy all
the fruits of what all those other players did. And now they come here with a
different set of expectations, this is what we're going to do.  
Some of the kids that I recruited, I want to help build a winning program and
I want to maybe go to a Final Four. Stewy says I want to come to Connecticut,
I want to win four national championships.  
It's a different world that they live in, different expectations that they
have. And I'm lucky that I got to be part of all that.  
  
Q. Can you sum up Kaleena's career and what she's meant to this program?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I had a coach tell me the other night that Kaleena is a
one‑dimensional player. I thought it was pretty funny because Kaleena's
freshmen year she had 31.  
And to me, the beauty of somebody like K is that because she's such an
incredible shooter, that if you're not paying attention, you think that that's
all she does.  
And yesterday she had seven assists. And she's probably our best screener.
She's one of our best passers. She gets in the way defensively once in a while
and causes her man to‑‑ she confuses the offense the way she plays defense.
She makes you think she's guarding you but she's really not. That's a real
talent that not a lot of players have.  
But over the last four years, she's become a really good basketball player,
somebody who is very dependable and reliable and somebody you can count on.
And that didn't used to be the case when she was a freshman. And each year
after that.  
And that's what you want players to do. You want them to grow and become a
little more than what they are coming out of high school. And she's had an
incredible career and she's put her name in the record books, and those
memories will last a lifetime.  
  
Q. Among the five of you, which one of you I guess are the biggest UConn
history buffs, that maybe grew up following those early 2000 teams? And if any
of you guys are, what do those teams mean to you, even though you just watched
them on TV?  
KALEENA MOSQUEDA‑LEWIS: I didn't like watching basketball very much when I was
little. So I really didn't get a chance to watch as much as I probably should
have. I know them now because they come back and visit.  
  
Q. Any of the rest of you?  
UNIDENTIFIED PLAYER: I wouldn't say like the early 2000s because we were in
grammar school and I don't think we were all into basketball as much as we are
now. But I know definitely middle school and high school all of us pretty much
got to watch some of the games and got to aspire to be there one day.  
COACH AURIEMMA: You have to rephrase that for Kia Nurse because in high school
she was watching the dogsled races in Alaska. This is a different Yukon. You
have to be specific with her if you want her to answer.  
  
Q. Geno, you're a Philly guy so you appreciate and understand the underdog.
A lot of times the city reflects and represents that. It's been a long time
since your program or team has been an underdog in a game. Is there any part
of you that misses that, what Muffet has today, the idea that nobody believes
you can win and to sort of overcome popular perception?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah. I mean, I think we all aspire to be in that situation at
some point in our lives, you know, where you're going to capture the
imagination of a lot of people. It's that whole Rocky Balboa thing in
Philadelphia. The city has a statue of a guy who made a movie, a fake boxer,
in front of one of the great art museums in the world. You know what I mean?
It's a crazy city.  
But I think it's part of the lure of sports, that feeling that‑‑ let me tell
you what it's like to be the underdog, what I think, what it was like for us
when we were in that situation.  
When you're the underdog, all your game plans are about this is what we're
going to do, we're going to do this, we're going to do this, and then we're
going to do this and we're going to beat their ass. And everybody gets all
fired up, yeah. And you go out and you play.  
When you're in our situation, I get up every day and I go, damn, if they do
this, this, and this, we're going to lose. So it's a flipped way of thinking,
because when you're the underdog you think all things are possible. All you
have to do is play the perfect game and all things are possible.  
And, yeah, I miss being in that situation. But hopefully history holds true.
The underdogs don't have a really good record against the top dogs.  
  
Q. Geno, I'd like to see if I can get your players to chime in on this first
before you address it. But here you are on the verge of a tenth title, and
it's been said that the reason being is that you've been able to collect the
best players. For the players, when did UConn come up on your radar? If you
didn't watch them on TV or didn't know as much about their history, when was
it that you became aware of UConn as a national power? And, Geno, when did
that happen for you when you were able to start recruiting that type of player
that could put you in the situation where this program is right now?  
KALEENA MOSQUEDA‑LEWIS: As Morgan said, once we started getting really serious
with basketball, it wasn't easy to know who the‑‑ we knew who the powerhouse
was, and a lot of times that was UConn. And we've grown up watching them since
we were high school, junior high, and that's when we got interest from UConn
and then created the relationship with the coaching staff.  
And once you do that, you pay attention to the teams more because you want to
see how they're doing and think about going there.  
COACH AURIEMMA: All right. Stewy was National Player of the Year in high
school. And Morgan Tuck was All‑American. K was All‑American. And maybe Player
of the Year senior year, although some other people thought some other people
were. And Moriah was First Team All‑American and Kia was All‑Canadian.  
If she hasn't already been up here, when Muffet comes up here and brings her
five starters, they were all First Team All‑Americans at some point in their
careers, if I'm not mistaken.  
And any other coach that brings their starters up here at this point in time,
generally speaking, has five of the best players that played in high school
playing on their team. That's how you get here.  
I don't think any of the coaches should apologize for getting the best
players. I think that's part of the job description when you sign up to be a
coach. A lot of coaches think it's noble and honorable to recruit bad players
and make them better. I've been there. It sucks. You don't get to play in
March when you have that kind of team.  
We hear that all the time: You've managed to collect the best players. That's
true. Honest to God, that's true. There's a lot of kids that graduated the
same year that Kaleena Mosqueda‑Lewis did. A lot of them. They're not here.
They're All‑Americans, they went someplace, but they're not here. It's
something else, once you get them here, to get here. This is not easy. Whether
you have the best players or don't have the best players. Getting here is not
an easy thing.  
And I think any coach that coaches at the level that we're trying to play at
right now‑‑ it's like, well, yeah, you know, you have Maya Moore and you had
Diana Taurasi and you had Stewy ‑‑ they start naming all these iconic players
I've coached. Yeah.  
I don't know of any really good coach that coaches bad players to the Final
Four. Every coach is blessed to have the best players when they get to the
Final Four.  
  
Q. Coach and players, what do you remember about the last game between you
guys and Notre Dame back in December, and maybe tell the media here where you
think that Notre Dame team has come and where have you come as a team?  
COACH AURIEMMA: It was early in the season for both of us, obviously. Anytime
you play a really good team on the road that early, you don't know what's
going to happen. We could have easily as gone out there and gotten blown out.
We were down 10 kind of early in the game.  
I don't think any of us expected to go up there and just outscore them by 30
the rest of the way. That was a surprise. I think that they were missing one
of their best players. And you look at their team now, and they're a different
team, they're a better team.  
I think they were more centered around the great talents that Jewell Loyd
brings to the team, and I think they're more versatile now. They have more
players doing more things. And we've changed a lot since then as well. And
we've found out a lot about ourselves as well. We've gotten better at every
area of the game. And I think that the two teams that are playing tomorrow
night are not the two teams that played against each other in December.  
Any horse racing fans in here? Anybody know who Steve Cauthen is? Who did he
ride? He rode Affirmed. Anybody know who the jockey for Alydar was? Hard to
remember. I have no idea because he didn't win any of those three races.  
  
Q. Moving off horse racing ‑‑  
COACH AURIEMMA: That's why people become famous, because they ride the best
horses and they coach the best players.  
  
Q. You mentioned back when you first started it was a hope to do something
and now it's an expectation. Is it ‑‑ I don't know if easier is the right
word, but for these players to I guess kind of advance further? And you said
expect it. So, I mean, they have to expect it, too.   
COACH AURIEMMA: They do. They do. They come to Connecticut expecting to win
National Championships. But you know what? We had a team from 2005, after
Diana graduated our team in 2005, 2006 and 2007, that didn't make the Final
Four three years in a row, and the world was ending in stories as we knew it.
We would never be any good again. Our time was over. Our program was history.  
Those kids all came to Connecticut expecting to win national championships.
Expecting to do it and then being good enough to do it and then paying the
cost of what it takes to do it, those are all variables that you don't know
going in. So whatever expectations these kids have, they still have to come
and prove it.  
They don't just show up in September, go to practice, and somebody says here's
when the championship game is and here's when the parade is, here's your
schedule: You have English at 10:00, you have history at 11:00, you have math
class at 2:00, and the parade is April12th. It doesn't work that way.  
  
Q. You have a chance to pass Coach Wooden if the team wins with 10 national
championships. I believe you had nine, if my memory is serving me ‑‑  
COACH AURIEMMA: He has ten.  
  
Q. Tie. There's always been this criticism that it's too easy to do in
women's basketball, but it strikes me when he won his it was in an era about
30 ‑odd years after the beginning of the NCAA Championship for men, and you're
winning it about 30 years after the beginning of the NCAA Championship for
women. Can you see a comparable development string and that as we look forward
the competition will grow wider? There are 40‑odd‑thousand high school girls
playing basketball, and one would think that the talent could wind up
elsewhere, too.   
COACH AURIEMMA: Those are the similarities in the era that the game is played
now and similar‑‑ I was in high school during that run for some of that run.
So obviously I was a big fan of UCLA just like every other kid that played
high school basketball. You might not know a lot of kids playing college
basketball, but you knew who UCLA starting five were. And they did get all the
best players.  
You read the stories about UCLA and their freshmen team. When they weren't
eligible, the freshmen team beat the varsity and varsity were returning
national champions, four starters back. They did have the greatest collection
of talent. But still gotta go out on the court and still gotta win the games.  
And, yeah, the NCAA Tournament was different. You win four games, you win the
National Championship. The first two probably played a bus ride from Pauley
Pavilion or certainly in that area. So we do have a lot of similarities
between where we are now and where the men's game was then.  
And you look at where the game has gotten to today on the men's side and what
the popularity of the men's basketball tournament is. Is it going to be‑‑ are
we ever going to be that popular like the men's tournament is? I don't know.
Women's sports in this country, team sports especially, have always had a hard
time reaching that status.  
I think in this country individual women sports are more celebrated than team
sports. Women's tennis or women's golf or women's skiing even. Will we ever
get there? I don't know.  
Will there be more good teams? Yeah. Like I said the other day, look at South
Carolina. Look at Dayton. Things take time. UCLA hasn't been what it was
since. Things do change.  
  
Q. Last year it seemed there was a lot of attention for tomorrow night's
game with off ‑the‑court stuff. Is it nice that the focus this year is what's
going to happen in between the lines tomorrow?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Nobody likes to have more fun than me with stuff when I can. I
try not to take myself or‑‑ I think that's one of the reasons why we generally
play pretty well during this time of the year, because we don't take ourselves
that seriously. We understand what the deal is.  
So when it gets to be more than that, I'm not really comfortable with it,
because it didn't seem like it was fun. But it's really good right now. I
think on the outside people might not really understand the level of respect
that we have for them and that they have for us.  
So no matter what anybody says or does or thinks, it's there and it's always
been there and it will always be there. Always.  
  
Q. Can you talk about your vision of what good offense is supposed to look
like, and do you think that if more teams ran offense like these two teams do,
the games would be easier to watch?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah. Yeah, you know, I think in any sport, in any sport
people are kind of drawn to players who make things look easy, five players
who pass the ball to each other, cut, help each other get open, get an open
shot, knock it in. That draws people like, wow, how did they do that or I like
the way they do that. In any sport. Doesn't matter what the sport is.  
I grew up in Philadelphia. So I saw one version of hockey back in those days:
We touch the puck. We throw into that corner. Five guys are going to run after
it. Three guys are not going to come out of that corner; they're going to the
hospital. And then we're going to score and we're going to win. So that's one
version of the hockey that I grew up with. Then there's the Edmonton Oilers
version of hockey.  
So there's a lot of ways to win but some ways I think are just more appealing.
And you don't have to necessarily have the best players. Look at Dayton again,
because it's more recent, a perfect example of a team that figured out this is
what we have, how do we make these guys into a good offensive team.  
And basketball is a beautiful game. I don't know if Harvey is still here. But
he wrote a great book about the Knicks in their heyday with Bradley and
DeBusschere and Reed and those guys. And part of the beauty of the team was
how well they played together and how they moved the ball.  
And that's why I get on my players all the time, let's get an open shot and
let's try to make half of them. And let's get a shot from inside ten feet and
let's try to make 70 or 80percent of those. Why? Because if you don't make
them then why am I paying you‑‑ like not giving them money‑‑ like you're
getting a scholarship. Let's not get confused here.  
  
Q. Geno, obviously to get to where you are and where you have been, it
requires an obsession, attention to details, standards, things that have been
with you a lot of years. But also beyond the Xs and Os, it's like college,
you're dealing with people, college, you're dealing with March. Sometimes you
seem very fascinated with. What is your general philosophy toward dealing with
people and dealing with getting them to play their hardest? Are there certain
things that they're very important to you that make you learn that are vital
that you've always got to have with you?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah, and I've been through a lot of different cycles. Early
on my career in my career I thought that I could control every situation that
I was in and make it turn out the way I wanted it to turn out. And I realized
at some point in my career that no, I can't. And even to this day, like even
going into tomorrow, I'm going to worry about things that I really have no
control over.  
So once I realized that was the case and I learned to just let that part go
and spend more time with my players and getting them to feel and think a
certain way about how we're going to play, how we're going to perform, that
believe in the way we practice, believe in our training, believe in our
preparation, and not put the emphasis on winning, not put the emphasis on what
happens if we lose.  
And I had this conversation with them just recently. I think one of the
reasons why we win a lot, other than good players, one of the reasons why we
win a lot this time of year is we're not afraid to lose. We don't play with
any fear of losing. And I think sometimes that kids, adults, they paralyze
themselves with fear of what if we lose, what if I screw this up, what if I
miss this shot, what if I turn the ball over.  
Like there's this paralyzing nature that comes with that. So as a coaching
staff, we try really, really hard to eliminate that from our way of thinking.
And to be honest, that's the best we can do.  
Once you get into March, you're not going to get a lot better physically.
We're not going to get bigger, quicker, faster, stronger. If we sucked at
guarding ball screens, we're not going to get a lot better at it.  
So it's more of that kind of mentality as opposed to anything else.  
  
Q. You've always spoken very highly of Jewell Loyd on and off the court.
What makes her a great player? What makes her a great person?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, I liked her a lot better in high school before she told
me she was going to Notre Dame instead of coming to Connecticut. I don't like
her as much now.  
I watch her play and I think there's something about her that is different
than any other woman playing college basketball today. It's just something,
she just has something, she has the way she moves, the way she touches the
ball, the way the ball comes out of her hands. She just has something.  
And not very many players playing men's or women's basketball have that. And
she plays with a confidence. And she knows she can make any shot. She knows
she can do‑‑ when she touches the ball she knows she can do anything with it.  
And she does it in a way that's very classy, I think, I just admire everything
about her. I wish she was a little bit older, you know. Then she wouldn't be
here tomorrow night. So that's a big part of it.  
I wish she was a little bit older, that way she'd give Diana and those guys on
the Olympic team a run for their money. She's that good. She's that good.  
  
Q. Jose Velazquez was the jockey.  
COACH AURIEMMA: You had to Google that.  
  
Q. I wanted to ask you about Morgan Tuck and the psychology of kind of
coaching somebody right now that's suddenly nationally being called
underrated, overlooked, and could you just talk ‑‑ you can get mileage out of
that at key times. Could you talk about‑‑ because very rarely do we come up
and ask you about somebody who has been overlooked on one of your teams. It's
been sort of every drop has been squeezed out of their publicity. Could you
talk about as a coach addressing that and bringing her through the National
Championship, obviously being very motivated by being overlooked?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I think it came up recently how‑‑ the reason why she might
appear to be overlooked is because of the way Stewy towers over the game right
now. And Stewy casts a pretty big shadow. So within that, it's easy to look at
our team and say those other guys are pretty good but they're not Stewy.  
Then she didn't play last year. So the fact that she didn't play and we won a
National Championship and went undefeated, it was like she must not be that
vital. She must not be that important. But if somebody just came to our
practice every day for a month, they would think Tuck was the National Player
of the Year. That's how good she is every day in every area. You're right
about it's hard to be under the radar on our team, I understand that.  
But there can't be ten players in the country better than Morgan Tuck. But I
understand. I really do. And all those kids, whenever people say, well, Tuck
should have made All‑American, my response is, okay, which one of those ten
kids would you take off. They all deserved it, too.  
I think right now what Morgan is showing is that I'm not Stewy, I'm not
Kaleena. I'm not Moriah Jefferson. But there are things that I do that nobody
else on my team can do. And that to me is the beauty of Morgan. She doesn't
try to be anybody but herself.  
  
Q. Brianna Turner didn't play in the first matchup you guys had. Now she's
back in the lineup, playing exceptionally well. What changes does she pose for
you guys and how do you go about stopping her?  
COACH AURIEMMA: You watch her and physically she just runs right by you. If
she can't run by you, she just jumps over you. So she impacts the game in a
way that the rest of their post players can't.  
She impacts the game on the defensive end with her athletic ability and her
length the way some of the other post players at Notre Dame can't.  
So obviously there's an element now in the mix tomorrow that wasn't there in
December. How do you stop her? I think at this time of the year, I don't think
there's any such thing as stopping anybody. I think you just try to make them
uncomfortable a little bit.  
Tomorrow we have to try various things to make Notre Dame uncomfortable.
They're a great offensive team. And trying to stop one person or trying to
take them out leaves you vulnerable to so many other things.  
So they're having the same discussions at their staff meetings that we have.
So I don't think there's any stopping to be honest with you.  
  
Q. On the subject of Coach Wooden, what stories do you have about him? Did
you ever meet him? Did you ever talk to him? Did you subscribe to his
philosophy of the pyramid of success?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, we are a lot different. Come from different eras,
different backgrounds. I couldn't tell you one piece of that pyramid, because
at the time that I was growing up and they were winning every game, I was more
interested in, you know, how good Mike Warren was. I was more interested in
how Valley shot the ball or why Shackleford was so good, or, holy shit,
they've got Sidney Wicks and Curtis Rowe and they're still winning like that.
So I didn't pay attention to the other stuff.  
And I've told this story a bunch of times, and it's probably nothing. It loses
its luster after you tell it enough times. But I did meet him one time. I was
fortunate to be at the same clinic he was.  
And I got introduced to him because I asked to be introduced to him. And it
was like I never knew my grandparents, but it was like sitting there and
talking to your grandfather. I'm 61, so I was probably 45, 46, 47, maybe.  
And he put his hand on my knee and patted it a couple of times and we talked
for about 10 minutes, 15 minutes. He did all the talking and I just listened
about basketball, about how he enjoyed watching the games and why I reminded
him of when he coached blah, blah, blah. And I thought that was pretty cool.  
And then the next thing you know, we win the National Championship in 2004.
And Sports Illustrated makes these things and Diana's on the cover. This
little thing on the top: "Why I love UConn Women" by John Wooden. So it's a
nice article by Coach Wooden about why he loves UConn and how unselfish we are
and we move without the ball, blah, blah, blah.  
And he goes on and on about our team, and he says: I've never met their coach,
but he seems like a nice young fellow. When I read that, I'm like, okay, so
much for my impression that I made on Coach Wooden.  
  
Q. You have such a vast knowledge of sports history. So you know that
sometimes the most dynastic team in sports, how well prepared they are,
something weird can happen in a championship game, a weird bounce or whatever.
You're 9 ‑for‑9 in championship games. Is that something that you're most
proud of, that every chance you had to win a championship you've won on?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I think when I look back on our career at Connecticut and our
success, that is‑‑ especially in a one‑and‑done environment, it's like college
football bowl game or the NFL, where you're undefeated during the regular
season and you have one bad night, one bounce of the ball goes the wrong way
and doesn't mean the best team won, but you didn't win. That other team won.  
So to be in that situation for us nine times and have it all work out our way,
that's kind of improbable, when you look back. You don't realize while you're
doing it, but when you bring it up like that and you really force yourself to
look back, man, I really can't explain it either. Can't explain it.  
And I said this yesterday, for those of you that were here, it's going to end.
It might end tomorrow. Might end if we're in that situation next year,
following year. This isn't something that's going to last forever. Not going
to win every single championship game that we're in, if we're in some more,
but up to this point, man, it is something that's really hard to explain. And
I'm just incredibly grateful.  
  
Q. When you're talking about Jewell, you described her and this sort of
intangible way, it's like that that old song (indiscernible) gotta get
rocking. I don't know what it is, but you only know it when you see it. Is
that what you're saying? And, also, is ‑‑  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah.  
  
Q. ‑‑ it seems as if in the tournament early in the season she knew she had
to carry the team. Turner developed, other people developed, but in the
tournament she's back to the feeling I've got to do too much? Have you seen
any of that?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I think the great players all feel that way. Like at this time
of the year, they want to be responsible for winning because they feel like
it's their responsibility.  
So, yeah, in addition to all the intangibles, she makes shots from all over
the floor. And I think being the leader of that team, I think she probably
does feel a sense of I've got to put the team on my back and I've got to carry
them.  
And sometimes that is a heavy load to carry, you know. But you look at the way
Lindsay Allen has played in the tournament, you're right, having Turner back
and that kid Cable had only one bucket yesterday, the only one she had to
have. Taya Reimer scoring more points.  
Everybody's doing a little more. And I think that's why they are where they
are. We have training camp coming up in May for the U.S. National Team. I'm
going to get into her stuff, I'll figure her out a little more when she comes
to training camp. I'm going to straighten her out.  
  
Q. A little off topic, but this morning Lisa Leslie got enshrined or
inducted. Talk about her, her impact on the game, and as a fellow Naysmith
Hall of Famer, what does that mean?  
COACH AURIEMMA: We were saying earlier, the game is older than 30 years, but
the NCAA Tournament, the NCAA taking over college basketball for women was in
the early'80s, I believe. And since that time there's been like some names
that eras and the names, you know, whether it's Sheryl Swoopes winning a
National Championship and doing all that or more recently the Brittney Griner
era or the Diana era or Maya, guys on my team.  
There was for a long time the Lisa Leslie era, in college, in the WNBA, in the
Olympics. She was a towering figure in women's basketball. There's never been
a woman built like her that could do the things that she did.  
And she might have been the kind of forerunner for guys like Stewy. The impact
that she had on the women's game. At the time, it didn't get the attention
that it's getting now. But I'm glad people remember. Because sometimes people
forget. I had a chance to be on the coaching staff in Sydney when she was on
the team. And she was once‑in‑a‑lifetime kind of player.  
  
Q. Got a conference ‑related question for you. Your colleague Jose Fernandez
got a contract extension and raise today. I presume you would think that was
well deserved.   
COACH AURIEMMA: How big was the raise? Pretty big? Good. He owes me a lot of
dinners when he used to cry that he didn't get paid enough.  
I met Jose on a recruiting trip in Sacramento‑‑ not Sacramento. Where did they
play the Rose Bowl? Pasadena. Met him on a recruiting trip, and at the time I
had no idea who he was. And he had been the assistant at South Florida. So I
kind of knew that maybe and he had just gotten the job.  
And we were just sitting there, and I just met him five minutes earlier and we
were just sitting around talking blah, blah, blah, and he said: What are the
chances I get you to come down and play us down there. I said I don't really
need a lot of arm twisting to come to Florida to play a game in the middle of
winter.  
So we came down and we played them. And the following year they came to our
place. And we beat them pretty good down here, down in Tampa. They come to our
place the following year and we barely won the game in overtime. I remember
telling him that day done, the series is over, we're not playing you guys
anymore.  
I didn't get into this so you guys could take us into overtime. I was
expecting come down here, go to Burns or Molly Os over here and smoke cigars
and have a great time. And it dawned on me right then and there, he coached
the team and he did things, I thought if they ever get pretty good players,
they're going to be really tough. And it took a long time for the school to
realize what they had because they kind of strung them along for a long time.  
And what happened today with him, long overdue. Long, long overdue. He's one
of the best young coaches in America. And they're lucky to have him.  
  
Q. You talk about paying the cost. And with Stewart, when did you get a clue
that she could take what you would throw at her? Was it before she got here or
did you have to wait until she gets to you?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Hard to tell when kids are in high school how much they can
handle, physically, emotionally. You really can't tell. Sometimes you mean get
an inkling, but with Stewy, there was none.  
There was no foreshadowing anything. Only her amazing talent. When she got to
Connecticut, it was pretty evident her freshman year that she was going to be
great. But I'm glad it went the way it went her freshman year, because she
couldn't take you being hard on you. She couldn't take the other teams being
physical with her.  
It was all brand new to her, the physical pounding that she took, the way
people just‑‑ you saw her yesterday, the way people just foul her on every
possession, trying to get her out of her game.  
And for about a month, month and a half she lost her confidence. She lost her
ability to play basketball because it was such a shock to her system. She had
never been under that kind of duress in her entire life. She's 18.  
And since she was 14, it was a magical ride for her. Everything she touched
turned to gold. That freshman year, that kid she got knocked senseless. And
you know what, show you how tough she is, when March came around that year,
she just took over the tournament, after doing nothing all of January and
February. That's when I realized that this kid's got something that very few
kids have.  
I still don't really get on her as much as I did like some other players. But
when it's a big game and big plays and big moments, man, I've had some great
ones, but this kid's something else. She's something else.  
  
Q. The UCLA men were a dynasty. The Yankees have been a dynasty. The
Patriots are a dynasty. How do you feel about that word being associated with
your program?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I don't know. I guess everything needs a moniker. Everything
needs to be labeled, I guess.  
I think since 1995, in the last 20 years, we've been as good and as consistent
in our sport as anybody else has been in their sport. I never‑‑ and the guys
that cover our team on a regular basis‑‑ I never compare our sport to any
other sport. I don't compare our team to any other teams. I don't compare what
we do to what anybody else does.  
I just know that in our sport, from 1995 to today, what we've done against our
peers is as good if not better than anybody else has done in their sport
against their peers. I don't care whether it's harder in that sport or this
sport or that sport.  
I understand all that. Don't get me wrong. But given the rules that we play
with, with all the people we compete against, I'm pretty proud we've done it
the way we've done it for as long as we've done it.  
  
Q. I was just curious, at the end of the game last night, I couldn't help
but notice your reaction where you threw up your arms, and it was as if to say
here we are, here we go again. Was that the overriding emotional feeling that
you had at that moment and what do you suspect it will be like if you reach
that same moment tomorrow night and you're able to thrust your hands up in
triumph again?  
COACH AURIEMMA: That moment was‑‑ I don't want to say it had any connotation
about anything. Really, it didn't. We have some real strengths on our team and
there are things that we do that are really, really good. If Moriah Jefferson
is knocking in 3s, we're really hard to play against. We're really hard to
play against.  
If Moriah Jefferson specifically and Kia Nurse are knocking in 3s, we are
really, really hard to play against. So really when Moriah knocked in that 3,
for me it was like‑‑ I don't know it was Easter Sunday, right? So maybe like I
hope there's a whole bunch more of those where that came from. That's kind of
what that was.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_TAMPA, FLORIDA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Notre Dame. Joining us from Notre Dame we have
head coach Muffet McGraw and the five student‑athlete starters, Brianna
Turner, Taya Reimer, Lindsay Allen, Michaela Mabrey and Jewell Loyd.  
  
Q. Coach, is this year more special in a sense they're all special making
the Final Four and championship, but because you guys were not expected to be
here maybe as in past seasons?  
COACH MCGRAW: This one is definitely different. I think when we started the
season and looked at what we lost last year and were wondering where all the
offense is going to come from, to say that we've come a long way, I think it's
a little bit of an understatement.  
I'm just proud of where we've gotten to and how this team has just been
resilient and continued to pursue their goals this year.  
  
Q. Can you just give us a quick thought about how long you are still living
off of what happened last night, how long it took you to come back to earth
after the way that game ended?  
JEWELL LOYD: We're still talking about that on the ride over here. Just
everything that kind of went into that game and the emotions and everything.  
So I think that's a game you actually can't forget. Great game for women's
basketball and we're all excited how we played and how we fought back.  
TAYA REIMER: I mean, yeah, same thing as what Jewell said. We were still
talking about everything just on the way over here and there were a lot of
emotions in that game and it was a great game. It was a battle, and I think at
this point now we're trying to come down from that and focus on what we need
to do now.  
LINDSAY ALLEN: Like Taya and Jewell just said, a lot of emotions and a lot of
highs and a lot of lows in that game. Just very proud of how this team
responded and how we stayed tough throughout the game.  
  
Q. Coach, Breanna Stewart is a great challenge. How do you plan on defending
her?  
COACH MCGRAW: Well, she is a difficult matchup because of her size and her
ability to play on the perimeter and on the inside. So we've got a couple of
ideas that we're going to try.  
I don't think anybody's been very successful with her this year. She didn't
have a great game against us last time, but I would say that was more her than
our defense.  
  
Q. Probably not by you guys, because she had such a good game against you
guys last time, but Morgan Tuck had another big game last night. Is she
somehow ‑‑ which would seem kind of impossible for you, but is she somehow
overlooked on that team?  
COACH MCGRAW: I was asked that the other day in the conference. It's
disappointing that the media decides ahead of the season who the best players
are going to be. Because I think she's their second best player. I thought the
game that we had with them she was the best player on their team. She really
did so many great things. She's incredibly overlooked on that team.  
  
Q. For any of the players who haven't played UConn, how much do you enjoy
playing them or do you not enjoy playing them and why?  
JEWELL LOYD: I like playing UConn. It's definitely a learning experience.
Winning and losing against them, whatever it is, you learn so much and it
really‑‑ I think it's good. Every time we've played them, it's always been a
good battle. That's what you want for women's sports.  
  
Q. Coach, what impresses you the most about Morgan Tuck of all her
abilities?  
COACH MCGRAW: You know, I think it's her versatility. Because she can go
inside and out. She's really worked on her perimeter game. She's tough to
defend around the basket. But you've got to guard her at the 3‑point line.  
But they have so many weapons you want to try to find somebody that you don't
have to guard, and she would be the wrong choice if you decided not to guard
her.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about growing this team, especially since the UConn
game and just what have you done to replace the All ‑Americans you lost and
get them back to the Final Four?  
COACH MCGRAW: I think we've had two big areas of growth. The first would be in
our leadership. I think that Jewell has really done a great job of taking over
a lot of the leadership. And I think Lindsay Allen has really grown as a point
guard who is much more vocal this year than she was in the past. She's really
done a good job of talking to the team. And I think Jewell has taken the time,
when we needed somebody to kind of rally us, she's gotten them all together.  
And I think the second area is Taya and her leadership with the post. She's
become a mentor to the post. She's only a sophomore and we're expecting so
much from her. And she just continues to deliver. She's been our steadiest
player all year long, and I think it's because of her that our whole post game
has really improved.  
  
Q. Michaela, you played UConn a lot. And your impressions of the last game
that you played back in December, and also to Bri, you didn't play in that
game but you were on the bench, and tell me what you saw from that game?  
MICHAELA MABREY: Well, we're definitely able to compete with them. And I mean
able to compete with them. And tomorrow night, playing defense, definitely.  
BRIANNA TURNER: I think I remember in the beginning of the first half I
thought we played really well. I think that the second half I think we let
players get off, especially Morgan Tuck. And in that game we weren't really
focused on her, and she really made us pay for that.  
But I think our offense kind of disintegrated and we're not playing well on
offense, I don't think it translated well to our defense. So that's what I
think about the game.  
  
Q. Muffet, Brianna obviously didn't play in the first UConn game. How
different is this team with her in the lineup?  
COACH MCGRAW: She's our leading rebounder and one of our top three scorers. So
I think she makes a difference in our team at the defensive end, with her
rebounding, her presence of shot blocking and the way she can run the floor. I
think that she adds a lot to our team.  
I think that we are a much better team with her on the floor.  
  
Q. Jewell, can you talk about embracing the challenge of leadership, what
were the important lessons you had to learn and how do you think you've grown
and developed into that role since the Connecticut game?  
JEWELL LOYD: It makes it easy when you have great teammates and great coaches
and everyone kind of believes in you. I've been learning from them as well.
We've been learning from each other and it's easy when you have unselfish
players that want to learn and are able to just help you out when you need it.  
So I give credit to my teammates and coaches for that.  
  
Q. Lindsay, this is an intense rivalry, maybe the most intense in the
women's game. When you're on the court, how much talking is there between the
two teams?  
LINDSAY ALLEN: There isn't much talking. We both have tremendous respect for
each of our programs. And they don't talk much and we don't talk much and we
just go out there, let the game speak for itself.  
  
Q. Muffet, does it feel good that a player like Madison Cable, who has
contributed a lot over these four years without getting big numbers, a lot of
recognition, now is part of Notre Dame legend forever?  
COACH MCGRAW: I thought the greatest thing about the game last night was that
the two people that really were stars for us down the stretch were Madison and
Hannah, and two that have come off the bench all year and given us a great
lift, brought a lot of energy, did so many great things.  
So I think for them to have that feel‑good moment, I don't think any of us up
here could be happier for them.  
  
Q. Jewell, you and Brianna are generally considered right now the two best
players in the game. Do you feel any individual rivalry with her, even though
your games are different and your positions are different?  
JEWELL LOYD: Not at all. Like you said, our positions are different. I have a
lot of respect for her. We're friends off the court. It's not about a
one‑on‑one matchup. It's about team basketball. It's Notre Dame versus UConn.  
  
Q. Taya, can you talk about having to be a mentor and a leader of a
sophomore for two freshmen posts and what has helped you develop yourself and
them to become a Final Four team?  
TAYA REIMER: I think I was lucky to have two amazing senior leaders last year
like Ace and Ariel, and I learned so much from them. And I think being in the
experience that I was in last season, playing in the Final Four and having to
contribute as a freshman, I think that I learned a lot from that.  
And I was kind of forced to grow up, and I think that I really tried to
embrace that role. Even though I'm still really young, just being able to use
those experiences and help them out, Bri and Kathryn, it's just something that
I've had to do for the betterment of the team. And I'm just happy that I can
help them out any way that I can.  
  
Q. Jewell, how much has last year's loss in this spot to UConn provided
motivation for this team and is there a sense of unfinished business going
into tomorrow night's game?  
JEWELL LOYD: Anytime you lose in a game you're always motivated to win and try
to figure out what steps you need to take to finish the goal. But that's last
year. It's a whole different season, different team. We're just really lucky
and blessed to have the opportunity that we have to fight for another National
Championship.  
  
Q. Brianna and Lindsay, can you explain the emotions of walking off the
court after fouling out and watching what transpired the last couple minutes
of the game when you can't do anything about it?  
LINDSAY ALLEN: There's just a range of emotions, a lot of highs, lot of lows,
and I think we were both pretty disappointed when we fouled out. The call
could have gone either way. We were just really disappointed, but our
teammates kept telling us they believed in us, they were fine, they were going
to close the deal for us.  
We have really unselfish and passionate teammates and eases the nervousness
that much more. We're fortunate to be in the position we are in.  
BRIANNA TURNER: I agree with what L.A. said. Our teammates just fought out
there, like we'll get you to the Tuesday game. They were so encouraging. On
the bench I was cheering so loud for Madi and Huff. It was good.  
  
Q. You've played them so many times. When you're scouting and evaluating
them, is it different than another opponent because you have so much
familiarity with them? And if it is different, specifically how is it
different?  
COACH MCGRAW: I think it's a little different just in that we don't have to
worry about learning the numbers and the names. We know them so well and I
think our offenses are pretty similar so we run a lot of the same stuff. So it
does make it easier to understand the scouting report.  
At the same time it doesn't make the game easier, but the familiarity, I
think, helps us in a lot of ways. I don't think we have the intimidation a lot
of teams face when they play UConn.  
  
Q. Lindsay, after the weekend you had last week in Oklahoma City, how did
you get through the frustration? Looked like everything was ‑‑ just nothing
flowed last night. How hard was it to just try to get in the flow of the
game?  
LINDSAY ALLEN: I think it was really tough. I think South Carolina did a great
job of making us uncomfortable and not letting us get into our offense and get
into the flow of the game.  
But I just put trust in my teammates. They kept believing in me no matter what
happened. When I fouled out, they just told me everything is going to be fine
and we're going to get the win.  
And I'm blessed and fortunate to be able to make it to the National
Championship.  
  
Q. Brianna, I know it was an early season game against UConn, but how
difficult was it for you to miss that game and how excited are you to play
against them tomorrow night?  
BRIANNA TURNER: It was definitely difficult to miss that game, and along with
the other two games missing my team. I'm excited to be out there tomorrow
night and be out there with my teammates as well.  
  
Q. Jewell, the runs in last night's game with your game, UConn has their
runs. How do you avoid that when UConn might be up against team 10 where it
tilts to 20 or goes back the other way, how do you prevent those runs?  
JEWELL LOYD: Basketball is a game of runs. Comes down to who wants it more.
The 50/50 balls, rebounding, I'm playing with passion, and that's what you're
going to see tomorrow night.  
  
Q. Coach, can you elaborate a little bit how you grow leaders? Is it within
them, you wait and see it emerge, or do you do things to speed up the
process?  
COACH MCGRAW: I think it's a little bit of both. I definitely think there's
leadership traits that some players have that others don't have as much. I
think the willingness to put yourself out there, to be vocal, to say what
needs to be said, not just to go with the popular opinion. Sometimes people
really need to hear an honest answer.  
And we do a lot of things. We have a great leadership workshop at Notre Dame,
Rosenthal Leadership Academy, that our players go through separate from
basketball that a lot of our student‑athletes do and we do a lot of things
just to encourage the way they talk to each other and we listen really hard
how they talk to each other and kind of give them some different scenarios of
how that could have gone.  
  
Q. Jewell, you weren't aware of it at the time during the game, I'm sure,
Tom Cruise was in the house, the star of Mission Impossible. Do you think it
was kind of appropriate the way the game ended last night?  
JEWELL LOYD: Yeah, we didn't find out until after the game that he was there.
Obviously having someone of that caliber at your game is pretty cool. That was
a great ending to a really great game. So it was awesome.  
  
Q. Muffet, throughout the season you're essentially the favorite in every
game. This is one game where you'll be considered the underdog and a lot of
people will pick your opposing team. What is it like to basically be a
favorite, to be the team that everybody goes for, you're the biggest game for
everybody all year, but in this game your team does sort of a reversal here?  
COACH MCGRAW: I love being the underdog. Always have. I think it's a great
position to be in. The pressure is not on us; it's on UConn. We can go out,
relax, play our game. Nobody expects us to win, nobody's picked us to win.  
So we can really have a very loose attitude going into the game in terms of
being relaxed.  
  
Q. (Off microphone)?  
STUDENT-ATHLETE: We like to have fun. I think we play our best game when we're
loose and we're smiling and just having fun. That's how you play when you're
at the parks with your friends, you're smiling, enjoying the game, enjoying
the moment.  
We're definitely just excited to be here.  
  
Q. Early this morning, Geno described himself as being nauseous playing
against you guys Tuesday night because you're so hard to play against. How
would you describe the way you feel?  
COACH MCGRAW: I agree. We have so many similarities. We've played each other
so much. And I think it's become such a great rivalry that it's a game that I
really enjoy because it's the two best teams right now going at it and
battling and they're a very difficult team to match up with.  
They do present a lot of problems for us defensively. And you have to be able
to withstand their runs and try to make some of your own. But overall I think
it's a great game for women's basketball.  
  
Q. Not to take away anything from defense because I think both these teams
are very strong defensively, but is this game, being the championship game
again and the fact that both of you guys have been in this position so much,
really a sign of how great your offenses are in terms of execution, and is
that something you feel like other teams really need to look to aspire to?  
COACH MCGRAW: Yes, I agree with that. I think offensively we both generally
are 1 and 2 in the country in field goal percentage. I think shot selection is
a big factor with both of our teams.  
The shots that we get are the shots that we get all year long that the same
people are taking the same shots I think in every game. So I do, I think for
us this team is a lot about offense. Because I don't know that you can stop
them.  
I think they're going to score. And so the question is can you keep up with
them by scoring as much.  
  
Q. You won the National Championship a while back. This will be four times
in the title game in five years. You haven't won it again. Is it frustrating?
Is there some feeling, well, I have won this or does it drive you crazy that
I've been one game away three previous times and we weren't able to get over
the hump?  
COACH MCGRAW: You know, I think getting here is a great achievement for any
program. I think that there's probably 350 schools in the country that would
love to trade places with us.  
So I think being here has been just a great achievement for all of us. I think
probably because we did win one that maybe I don't feel that sort of pressure.
But I want this for this team. I want to win for this team so they can have
that feeling of looking up in the rafters and seeing another banner.  
  
Q. You said how this group has relished the underdog and a loose team right
now. How different is that from last year when it seems there was so much
different mentality going into this game, the pressure of two undefeated and
such, whereas now you're the underdog and just the difference last year and
this year?  
COACH MCGRAW: Last year was a business‑like approach. We had a really good
team coming in undefeated, which was an amazing, amazing feat for us to
accomplish.  
We lost Natalie Achonwa so it immediately put us back in the underdog role. I
think we came into the game with an underdog mentality. But I think that team
was different because we were so experienced. We had so many players that
could score. Kayla McBride has had so much success against Connecticut in the
past.  
I think it's a lot different in that way just because our experience last year
and this year. We're still a little giddy.  
  
Q. Have you gone through the last eight minutes of last night's game yet and
figured out what went wrong at that time and how to fix that?  
COACH MCGRAW: You know, honestly I thought we got really good shots. We missed
a couple of point‑blank layups. We missed a couple of shots we normally make
and we didn't rebound. I think it was a little bit of both ends.  
When we were making our runs, we were holding them to one shot, scoring in
transition. Then when we were missing shots and not getting rebounds, I think
that was the difference in the game. So I still felt pretty good because
execution‑wise I thought we were still getting the shots we wanted. Our
problem at that point I thought was at the defensive end.  
  
Q. You talked about not having the same intimidation factor. Is there any of
that with Stewart also that she's not just a two ‑time National Player of the
Year, that they've been on the court with her?  
COACH MCGRAW: No, because I think we've had that kind of player ourselves. I
think we feel like Jewell was a Player of the Year also, and I think she's a
great player. But I don't think that we have any intimidation factor going
against us.  
  
Q. Connecticut's in a position to win a tenth title. Is there some common
denominator among these UConn teams that they're able to put themselves in
this position? Are there two or three things they do consistently that allow
them to be in this spot?  
COACH MCGRAW: I think they have a great coach, and I think they have a lot of
the best players in the country. So I would say there were two really good
reasons for that.  
  
Q. You played UConn so much. You've gone up against Geno so much. I'm sure
this thing has evolved. You've been on top. He's been on top, all kinds of
things happened. What are the myths and the realities of your relationship
with him and all the times you guys have gone up against each other?  
COACH MCGRAW: You know, we have a really good relationship. I think we see
each other out recruiting. We talk on the road. I think he's the kind of guy
that if you‑‑ if I wanted to talk offense and I called him, I think we would
sit down and talk about offense, recruiting or really anything that we wanted
to.  
I think that both being from Philly, we just share some sort of a bond. Jim
Foster is kind of best friends with both of us, and so we've got a lot of
common threads running through our relationship. But I think a lot of respect
on both sides.  
  
Q. The offense that you run, how has it evolved? And who taught you?  
COACH MCGRAW: Well, it's still evolving. We run the Princeton offense which
Pete Carril started at Princeton and one of my former players, Liz Feeley, was
the women's coach there at the time. So she did a lot of the work for me.  
We went out to a lot of different people. We went up to Northwestern and Bill
Carmody was an assistant with Pete Carril, so we watched his practice and
talked to him a lot. UC Davis runs it. I sent my assistants out to different
places. Went out to Air Force and Coach Scott was out there.  
We've been to a lot of places to see people, and it constantly evolves because
we have different players. This year we're still evolving. I don't think we've
run it nearly as well as we have in the past. Natalie Achonwa was really
special in that. We put our own wrinkles in to fit our team.  
That's what I like the most about offenses, tinkering with it and changing it
up to see what fits us.  
  
Q. Did you catch yourselves last night after the game going back and saying
all the things that have occurred this season and saying to yourself I still
can't believe we've gotten this far with this young of a team?  
COACH MCGRAW: Yeah, we had some really bad practices this year. And the
coaches were kind of going: Remember that time at Mohegan Sun, it was the
absolute worst practice of the year. Not just of the year but of my 30 years.
We had some awful practices at times during the year.  
And I remember telling the team we were pressing like an NIT team. And, I
mean, we just had so much that we should have forgotten, but just drawing back
on some of those things and we had some games, too, where we didn't play well.  
But I think it's fun to look back now and say look where we've come.  
  
Q. You've been around the game for a while, and for so long it used to be
Old Dominion and Louisiana Tech, UConn and Tennessee, and now you guys and
UConn. Is it nice for a sport that's still growing that the two teams that
people really know more than anybody else are playing for a championship
tomorrow night?  
COACH MCGRAW: I think it's a rivalry people want to see. I think that it's two
well‑known teams and the games ‑‑ we've had some good games in the past, so I
think it's one that people want to tune into.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_TAMPA, FLORIDA_  
  

Notre Dame  66  
South Carolina - 65

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by head coach Dawn Staley and student‑athletes
Tiffany Davis and Alaina Coates and Aleighsa Welch. Coach, an opening
statement.  
COACH STALEY: We gave God the glory when we made it to the Final Four. We'll
give him the glory for the defeat. I feel that our team did what they had to
do, put themselves in the position to win the game. Unfortunately for us, it
came down to them making a play when they needed to make a play and we didn't.  
But really proud of our effort. Proud of the women that represent the
University of South Carolina women's basketball team.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Tiffany, on the final drive, was it air ball from the tip? What were they
showing you on defense? Looked like you never got a look on that final try.  
TIFFANY MITCHELL: I came off the ball screen. They were making it hard for me
to try and find a shot. And on one of the passes, they deflected it.  
  
Q. As much as you fought back tonight again and again, how much tougher is
this one to handle?  
ALEIGHSA WELCH: Anytime you end your season, it's a tough pill to swallow. I
credit us, I credit my teammates for still fighting and never dropping their
heads. And I think a lot of people thought we were down and out in the second
half.  
But it's always tough to swallow when you put so much effort and energy and
you don't come out with a win.  
  
Q. Tiffany, can you talk about kind of the flow of the game. They would push
out to a lead and you guys would push back. Did you feel it was an uphill
battle for a lot of the game?  
TIFFANY MITCHELL: I mean, it started out slow the first half. Second half I
think we came out with a better start. But it's always hard to kind of come
from behind especially against a team like Notre Dame.  
  
Q. Tiffany, when you have to come back like that again and again, how much
does it take out of you in a game situation?  
TIFFANY MITCHELL: We put ourselves in that position. So at that point it
doesn't really matter how much it takes out of us. We still have to do it. We
have to play. I don't think we're thinking about being tired.  
  
Q. Alaina, can you tell us a little bit about the first Final Four
experience? Did you feel like the big stage ‑‑ do you think it was nerves at
the beginning of the game was why you guys got off to a slow start?  
ALAINA COATES: Same story. I do credit nerves a little bit, but I do feel like
we were able to just suck it up and just get over all that. We're used to
playing in front of big crowds, and we knew our fans were there and we saw the
energy, and we just went with it.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the start of the game and did you think it was
nerves?  
COACH STALEY: I don't think it was nerves as much as just‑‑ as much as we
started the Sweet 16 and the Elite Eight, that's kind of what's been happening
to us‑‑ I mean, it's just bad plays, bad decisions at the beginning of the
game. And you think with the five that we do start, they've been in situations
like this last year and this year. And we put ourselves in a position to
overcome a slow start.  
So I don't know what the answer is. But I don't think it was nerves. I think
our players were really ready to play. They just made bad decisions like they
would at any point in the game.  
  
Q. Aleighsa hits the putback and you lead for the first time in the day.
Especially when you got the ball back, did you feel like you pulled another
one out? And what happened in the boxout at the end?  
COACH STALEY: We were in the game. We fought our way back. We got the lead. At
that point you don't exhale and think you have the game won. Because we've
been in some tight ones the last three times out.  
It's just they made a play. We defended pretty well. I think the shot was kind
of short that Loyd missed, and I think it was Cable that got a beat on the
ball and did the same thing that happened on the other end.  
  
Q. You talked a little bit about the play in the front court. They had a
couple of ‑‑ Notre Dame had ‑‑ their front court players had a pretty good
game against you guys, and there might have been a lot of folks who thought
you would have had an advantage there.   
COACH STALEY: I mean, you know, I think they're not bad players. They're very
good players. I thought what we were able to do over the course of 40 minutes,
I thought we equalized what they were able to do early in the basketball game.  
It's going to take for us a rotating post play in the depth that the post play
kind of beat teams in the 40‑minute period. So they got off to a really good
start. When the game settled down, I thought we made them miss a couple of
easy shots at the end of the game to get ourselves back in the game. And that
is our death over a 40‑minute period taking its toll with their post plays.  
  
Q. Can you set up that last play for us, what were you expecting to see from
Notre Dame and what was the play designed?  
COACH STALEY: It was just horn's action, a play that was pretty effective for
us all game. What we wanted Mitchell to do was to kind of turn a corner, see
if she can get an angle to get inside, maybe get to the basket. But they were
hedging out and they made it difficult for her to have an angle to get to the
basket.  
They did a really good job of shading her and forcing her outside of the
paint.  
  
Q. How much are the missed free throws going to haunt you?  
COACH STALEY: That's key. We left a lot of points at the free‑throw line. But,
you know, still we overcame that to put ourselves in a position to take the
lead, had another possession after that.  
I thought if we could get that possession to fall, it gave us a little bit of
cushion. But we couldn't.  
  
Q. You have a lot of talent coming back, but how hard will it be to say
goodbye to Ibiam and Welch, especially Welch who's been here for the beginning
of this?  
COACH STALEY: It's truly hard. They leave a big void in our program. They won
a lot. But what's great about the senior class that's leaving us is they're
leaving us with a legacy of leadership.  
They didn't come in as the best leaders in the world, but they leave as
probably one of the best leaders, one of the best class of leaders that we've
had come through our program.  
So I think our players have taken note to how they led our basketball team.
And if they're half the leaders that Elem and Olivia and Aleighsa were to our
basketball team, our program is in a great place.  
  
Q. I know it's a team moment, but can you give us a sense of what you said
to your team after the game already?  
COACH STALEY: I told our team that we came up short. Obviously we wanted to
win the National Championship. But I just hope they take note of how hard it
is to get to this point and how hard it is to win a semifinals game and also
how much it took.  
And we're not far off. We're not far off. We just have to‑‑ we just have to
continue and get the experience of playing in the Final Four. So our
experience is going to have different outcomes.  
  
Q. You've been in their shoes. How long does it take for the sting to turn
into those warm memories of what they were able to achieve this season?  
COACH STALEY: It takes a while until you get back, till you get back to a
place where you can at least compete for it and taste it a little bit.  
But I'm glad our players got a chance to experience this so they can get in
the gym and work hard, so they become better students of the game so if we
ever got to this point again, we're going to have different results.  
  
Q. Obviously you guys had at the beginning of the year a goal to win the
National Championship, and it was a loss tonight, obviously. But when you look
back when the journey started with training camp back in September and
October, how would you describe or how are you going to remember the journey
of this season that you guys win an SEC Tournament for the first time and
making it to the Final Four for the first time?  
COACH STALEY: We did a lot of firsts for our program. They have a very
memorable year. And I want us to enjoy the year, but I also want us to have a
certain hunger, a certain bad taste in our mouth from experiencing and being
so close to competing for a National Championship that it will fuel us to be
better individually, to be better collectively so we can get back to this
point.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_TAMPA, FLORIDA_  
  


Notre Dame  66  
South Carolina - 65

  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us is Notre Dame head coach Muffet McGraw and
student‑athletes Madison Cable, Jewell Loyd and Taya Reimer.  
  
Q. Madison, take us through that basket.  
MADISON CABLE: Jewell shot it, which usually it goes in almost all the time. I
was just crashing anyway to try to get a rebound. And it bounced right where I
was, and I turned around and had an open shot so I took it. Luckily it went
in.  
  
Q. Tay, can you talk about the front court play you had tonight? A lot of
people thought South Carolina is a big team, they might have an advantage
there, and you guys especially early in the game really took it to them?  
TAYA REIMER: We knew that they were a really good team inside; that they get a
lot through their interior play. Our game plan was to try to contain that and
try to shut them down and on the offensive side just attack them.  
So I think that we did a pretty good job of that especially in the first half.
And then, I mean, at the end of the game it just came down to trying to
contain them and get a rebound.  
  
Q. Madison, your transition offense was solid tonight. What helped you play
so well in the front court and pushing the ball?  
MADISON CABLE: It's something that we try to do every game and we work on in
practice and stuff. So our guards did a good job looking up and finding the
streaking post or whoever it was down the court.  
  
Q. You guys went a long time without a basket at the end of the game there.
Can you talk about what it was like out there? Did you feel you were starting
to tighten up a little bit?  
TIFFANY MITCHELL: I think so. But it happens. We knew it's all about defense
and getting stops and battling. We looked at each other, and we were like:
Let's go. We need a stop. We knew that shots aren't always going to fall,
we're not going to get calls, whatever it was. But defense, that's something
that we can to control.  
  
Q. Jewell and Taya, can you talk about the very last play, their play, and
what you saw and the defense you played on that particular play?  
JEWELL LOYD: We knew they would have the ball in Tiffany's hands and they
would have a screen up top and whichever way they got off, we would double
her. She went back and forth a couple times, and then she came over to my side
and Hannah and I trapped her.  
Hannah, a great block and kept the ball in play, which allowed more time to
come off the clock and everybody was able to contest. And great team defense
all around.  
TAYA REIMER: The guards did a great job containing Mitchell up top not letting
her get a good shot off, and me and Kathryn were trying to stay back and
trying to get it if she tried to pass into the post, or if she shot it just
get a rebound.  
  
Q. For any of the players, can you give us a sense of just how difficult it
is for what Hannah Huffman did to come in 14 minutes cold and defend on maybe
the biggest play of the season? Just those of us ‑‑ obviously you guys may not
have been in that situation, but you certainly can relate to what you have to
do mentally to sort of perform there?  
JEWELL LOYD: When you have a player like Hannah Huffman who is so passionate
and motivated, she was ready. She was like: Okay, I got it. And we had belief
in her. We knew she was going to help us. Whatever she needed to do, whether
get a steal or deflection, that's what she was going to do. Hannah, that's
what she does for us.  
  
Q. Madison, this was like your only two points. Ever hit a bigger basket in
your life?  
MADISON CABLE: Somebody already asked me that. Thinking about it, I don't
think so. So I guess it's a good time to get my two points for the game.  
  
Q. You've been on the doorstep before here for the chance to win the title.
Does a night like that make you think we're going to close the deal this
time?  
MADISON CABLE: You have to stay motivated. We're going to win, we're going to
have fun, but we're motivated.  
And we're enjoying this and we enjoy this night and live it up for sure and
get refocused tomorrow.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Will you talk about your front court play with Turner and Reimer
tonight?  
COACH MCGRAW: I thought Bri and Taya really played well, especially in the
first half. They were eight for 11 we talked about at halftime, we needed to
get them the ball more. I thought we had more opportunities to do that and
weren't quite as successful.  
We came out with a plan to go inside. Then Jewell got hot, and we kind of
changed the plan a little bit and went to Jewell a little bit more.  
They battled. They battled. We didn't get as many rebounds as we wanted to,
but I thought they played hard.  
  
Q. Muffet, can you take us through the last possession defensively, what
your thinking was and philosophy was for that?  
COACH MCGRAW: Well, we had the timeout, so we were able to talk about what was
going to happen. We thought that Mitchell would get the ball and there would
probably be a ball screen involved.  
We talked about how important it was going to be. Because we were still in the
triangle and 2 at that point. We talked about how important it was going to be
for the person to come out and hedge on the ball screen. And I thought that
was probably as good a hedge as we've had. But when I looked down the bench,
Michaela Mabrey, not as well known for her defense.  
So we wanted to get a better defender in, and Hannah Huffman is somebody that
played earlier in the game, guarded Mitchell, did a great job on her, and so
we wanted to give her that opportunity.  
  
Q. Walk us through the final play going without a timeout and your final
offensive possession.  
COACH MCGRAW: What we work on we're going to rebound and go. And if we have
something we'll obviously take it. If we don't have something we'll take the
timeout there. I thought Jewell had kind of a clear path. We set the high ball
screen for her and it was a great shot. And Maddie came out of nowhere to get
the rebound.  
  
Q. You know they're going to get their points inside, they're going to try
to get their points inside, but they only had a couple 3 ‑pointers and a
couple of mid‑range jumpers, can you just say how much your defensive game
plan factored into that?  
COACH MCGRAW: I'm not sure if you can say they have a weakness, but we thought
that pick your poison, we were going to let them take jumpers. Sessions hit
the 3 in the first half but we weren't going to deviate from the game plan.  
We were giving up pretty much everybody except for Mitchell and Roy, when she
came in the game. So we tried to pack it in on the post, which they still did
a really great job of scoring against us.  
But we went triangle and 2, and on box and 1 we went 1‑2‑2\. Played a couple
of possessions of man to man, played a little 2‑3, throwing everything but the
kitchen sink at them trying to figure out a way to stop them.  
  
Q. You haven't had much from your bench this season, or even tonight. But to
have the game winning shot and a key play on defense come from subs in the
last minute, just want to ask about the confidence you had in those two in
those moments?  
COACH MCGRAW: Our bench has been terrific all year long. I thought Madison
Cable was the best 6 man in the league. She didn't win the award. But she was
so key in so many games for us. Plays a lot minutes for us.  
Kathryn Westbeld comes in and gives us great minutes in the post. And Hannah
Huffman, starting with the ACC season, has really come along and done a lot of
great things for us defensively.  
Her job is not to score but to bring energy, rebounds, set screens and take
charges and play defense. So I have a lot of confidence in all of those
players. And Hannah I think, the biggest play of the game, to put her in, I
think I told her I trust you and I have confidence in you.  
  
Q. On day one of practice it's always the goal, but did you see this group
with the changeover get into a national final?  
COACH MCGRAW: I did not. I remember thinking that and telling the team we lost
40percent of our offense, 40percent of our rebounds and 40percent of our
assists. We really were a very different team, very young team. We did not
have‑‑ we didn't know who the leader was going to be.  
We really struggled early on with communication, with a lot of little things.
And I thought the staff tried to keep it simple. We tried not to overwhelm
them with things but freshmen are going to be overwhelmed anyways.  
So I would say for us to be at this point now is really I think we
overachieved to get here.  
  
Q. She obviously fouled out with a couple of minutes to go. But when Brianna
Turner was on the court at times she was the best player on the court. How
much of a glimpse did people who watched her tonight get in terms of what she
can become over the next couple of years?  
COACH MCGRAW: Yeah, she has amazing talent. She just wants to learn. She's a
hard worker at practice. She can run the floor. That's one of her greatest.
She can block shots and rebound, and she can finish around the basket.  
I thought for her first Final Four, played extremely well defensively and
offensively. And I know if you asked her she'd probably say she didn't play
very well, but I'm so happy with her potential and where she's going to be.  
  
Q. You talked about their depth and how much that might cause trouble for
you. When Wilson came off the bench and Cables came off the bench and they
started coming back, were you worried that you might not have enough in the
tank in the second half when they came off the bench again in the second
half?  
COACH MCGRAW: Their bench is really good. Probably they could start any of the
eight people that they play a lot. And that was our big worry. We wanted to
start out the game with kind of packing it in and seeing how that looked
first.  
And then when they came in with Wilson, we tried to stay on her left hand. We
weren't overly successful with it. I thought we probably would have changed
the game plan looking back on it, maybe deny a little bit more. But she's a
tremendous talent.  
  
Q. The cameras are on you at the end of the game, I don't know, you did a
little bit of a dance. Your face appeared like maybe you were even surprised
at how the last 14seconds or maybe even the last minute played out. Can you
just take us through what you were thinking during that last possession?  
COACH MCGRAW: I was surprised how the last minute 13 played out. When Lindsay
fouled out, I thought we might be in a little bit of trouble.  
We told Jewell, you'll have to run the point and you'll have to take over the
ball, we're going to have to do it on defense. We're going to have to rebound.
When they took the lead, I wasn't sure how things were going to end up for us
because you never know if we're going to be able to have that resilience that
we needed at that point without our point guard.  
So I was just amazed. I think Maddie makes a great play and then we get a
great defensive stop. So yeah, I was pretty happy after that one.

_TAMPA, FLORIDA_  
  

UConn - 81  
Maryland - 58

  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us on the dais is Maryland head coach Brenda Frese,
student‑athletes Lexie Brown, Brene Moseley, and Laurin Mincy.  
COACH FRESE: I'm proud of our fight, and like I told the team in the locker
room, when you look at a season and go 34‑3 and you look at two of our three
losses are coming from teams that are playing for the National Championship
game, that's a heck of a season.  
And obviously the score doesn't indicate in terms of the fight, and we've got
to be able to do a better job of closing the gap, but I thought we did a
tremendous job in the first half trying to put some things together,
especially in the adversity of the calls made. We just kept fighting and we
kept battling.  
And I thought the runs in the second half obviously hurt us and were really
tough.  
But couldn't be more proud obviously of Laurin Mincy and the legacy she's
left, for her to give everything to this young team, and I know this
experience and continuing to play UConn and playing Notre Dame will continue
to make us better.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Lexie, in the past, when other teams have gotten runs on you, you've been
able to come back. What was the difference today not being able to respond in
the second half?  
LEXIE BROWN: I'm not really sure. I just think we continued to get deflated as
they went on their runs. And the thing about UConn, it's not one person
contributing to that run. Seeings how our team, we would try to key in on one
person and then somebody else would score and we'd try to key on that person
and the next person would score. They do a great job of sharing the ball.  
  
Q. Laurin, what are your emotions right now, and how difficult going out the
way you did this game?  
LAURIN MINCY: It's really disappointing. Obviously we wanted to come in here
and shock the world and get this win. But I'm proud of how my team competed
this game and all season and I can't wait to see what's ahead for them.  
  
Q. Lexie, Coach was talking about Laurin's legacy. To you, what does that
mean?  
LEXIE BROWN: I just see her as a player who is extremely resilient and a great
leader. She had a lot of adversity during her career here. A lot of people
could have rolled over and said: You know what? My knees, I'm not going to be
the player I used to be.  
But Mincy, she worked extremely hard to get back this season, to see her back
to who she was before her knee injuries and see how hard she worked and pushed
us every day. I think that's the legacy she's going to leave with us.  
  
Q. Looking back on your career, what are you going to be most proud of?  
LAURIN MINCY: Just the family I made here. These are my little sisters. And
whenever they need anything, they can call me. So it's a family atmosphere,
all the support from the coaches I've had over the years.  
  
Q. Brene, late in the second half you guys started driving the lane and
drawing some fouls. But in the early part of the game you seemed a little
hesitant to attack Connecticut that way. What was going on that was different
late in the game or was it just your mindset?  
BRENE MOSELEY: I think our mindset changed. I think we just wanted to be able
to attack in whatever they were giving us. They were playing pretty well. We
wanted to be able to get inside. We were doing pretty well, so we wanted to go
inside. That's basically where our mindset was on that.  
  
Q. Brene, you played with Laurin longer than anyone. What has she meant to
you and what has she meant to the program?  
BRENE MOSELEY: I'm speechless when I talk about Laurin. Everything she's
contributed along the years. When she first started, I was right beside her.
And we created a bond then. So tonight was tough just because it's the last
game with her, so it hurts my heart. But I know she's going to go on to bigger
and better things and we're going to continue keep doing what we're doing here
at Maryland.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Frese.  
  
Q. Brenda, at what point did you know that it didn't look good for you
tonight? And what led you to think that?  
COACH FRESE: Maybe after the first two foul calls on Brionna Jones. No, I
mean, seriously, I thought it was the second half. They came out, and their
aggressiveness defensively, they were really physical. Obviously they really
clamped us down from the field and we were having a difficult time being able
to score.  
  
Q. Nice season for you guys. I'd like to talk a little bit about how tough
it was because you shut one person down, someone else steps up. Morgan Tucker,
obviously a good player, but you were doing a good job on KML, and she steps
up. How tough were they to play against defensively? Because they have so many
weapons you can't just shut one down.  
COACH FRESE: Obviously Tuck was a big‑time X factor for them tonight. You look
at the stat line of Kaleena and she hits 13 but she gets seven assists and
goes into facilitator and they get everybody else going.  
So, it is‑‑ obviously you've got to be able to have five that can match them
on both ends of the floor, both defensively as well as offensively.  
  
Q. I just wanted to get back to Morgan. It's tough enough to prepare for
UConn. Did Morgan give them something that you might not have expected, how do
you prepare for her?  
COACH FRESE: I mean, I was just thinking she was one of their 3s that wasn't
an All‑American, right, had an All‑American night.  
It is. Obviously we planned, obviously, in terms of their ability to be able
to score. But she's such a difficult matchup. She took us inside. She took us
out. She was able to score. She recognized when Brea was in foul trouble. She
drove her. Showed a really high IQ.  
  
Q. You had said yesterday that you thought it would be really good for the
game for you guys to beat them. I guess I'm wondering why that is and whether
you think it's bad for the game if this is the same title and game from last
year?  
COACH FRESE: Obviously to be able to grow our game we have to start having
parity. And I honestly‑‑ you look at the men's side and you can't predict from
year in, year out.  
And I think that brings a level of excitement. Brings a level of enthusiasm.
We're getting there. When I look at players out there that are kind of
starting to go to a lot of programs, just like our kids, A'ja Wilson going to
South Carolina, starting to have that type of depth in our talent pool.  
When you look at our game in the NCAA Tournament and you look at Dayton
getting as far as they did, you're starting to see some parity that our game
desperately needs.  
  
Q. When you reflect on Laurin's career, what has she meant to you and what
has she meant to the program?  
COACH FRESE: Gosh, I couldn't be more proud of Laurin. When you talk about to
watch her this season grow into what she became for us, a leader by example, a
leader vocally, but you look at the fact that she's a fighter. I mean, I
thought all the adversity that she went through in her five years, to be able
to lead this team to new heights, to a season that nobody expected is
something that I'm going to cherish forever in terms of her legacy.  
  
Q. Was it difficult to see her finish her career that way today? And she
didn't play a lot in the second half. Was it a difficult decision for you not
to play her much in the second half?  
COACH FRESE: It was a tough night. She was very anxious. I thought nerves got
the best of her. When you look at six turnovers by Laurin Mincy, that's not a
stat line that you see this season.  
So it was, it was tough. I mean, because I could feel where she was in the
game and it was hurting the team but she's carried the team throughout this
entire season.  
So a tough night for her but at the same time the growth for our team is we
have to be able to carry on without her now as she graduates.  
  
Q. Two straight Final Fours but having not quite reached the National
Championship, what do you need to take the next step and get back there?  
COACH FRESE: The next progression, it's where obviously Notre Dame has gotten
themselves to and it's the next step for us. Obviously the consistency factor
for us was key in terms of being able to get back‑to‑back, but there's that
one more percent in terms of where we need to go.  
But I'm excited when you talk about our future and graduating one senior, to
be able to have the sophomore class come back, I'm really, really excited
about this future.  
  
Q. Maryland had one of the best seasons in school history. Yet UConn wins
pretty handily. Does Notre Dame stand a chance in the championship game, and
if so what do they have to do in order to win?  
COACH FRESE: I'm trying to remember that first game with Notre Dame, if Turner
played. So obviously I think that's a different element.  
But I think when you talk about the National Championship game, both teams are
going to be ready to compete and two phenomenal coaches that are going to be
ready to play. I think it will be a really competitive game.  
  
Q. It's one thing, when you're looking at parity, you're 1 seed for a
reason. But UConn consistently beats the best teams in the country by
substantial margins. What is it about them that makes them that just more
better players than everybody gets or what?  
COACH FRESE: It's a blend of everything. Obviously Geno is the best of the
best. He's a phenomenal coach. I think as you talk about our talent pool, you
know, I liken it to Kentucky men except for the fact that UConn's able to get
every year a top 10 player, they don't lose them to the pros.  
When you're able to build that kind of roster and add the coaching and with
what you're doing, to insert that into your lineup every year, it's huge, when
you're able to build a roster like that.  
So our game is coming. There isn't that depth of the talent pool yet to be
able to kind of spread that amongst the different programs. But it's
definitely coming.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_TAMPA, FLORIDA_  
  

UConn - 81  
Maryland - 58

  
THE MODERATOR: On the dais from Connecticut is head coach Geno Auriemma and
student‑athletes Morgan Tuck and Breanna Stewart. We'll open with a statement
from Coach Auriemma and then questions for the student‑athletes.  
COACH AURIEMMA: I mean, obviously we played really well for long stretches at
a time, and we went into the game knowing that Maryland was going to be a
difficult matchup for our guards; that their guards were going to be a big
part of what they were trying to do.  
And I felt for the most part we handled it pretty well. We've got the kind of
team when we go on runs and things start breaking our way, we take advantage
of those situations, and we did so again tonight.  
And we felt going into the game we had a little bit of an advantage with these
two, with Morgan and Stewy, and we tried to really take advantage of that. And
obviously they were great. I can't say enough about them. Tuck, anyway, she
played both ends of the floor.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Morgan, nice game tonight. On a night where they did a pretty good job
bottling up Kaleena, can you talk about how well you played, 24 and 9, 10 for
16 from the floor. Out there taking over.  
MORGAN TUCK: I think it was a credit to my teammates. They gave me the ball
where I'm best at. That's around the basket or driving to the basket. So I
think I played well because my teammates played well as well.  
  
Q. Morgan, you weren't able to play here last year because of the injury,
obviously. What did it mean to you tonight to play in this setting and to do
so well?  
MORGAN TUCK: It means a lot, just to be out there and actually contributing
and making an impact. That's why I came here. And to be really doing it, it's
a great feeling.  
  
Q. This is also for Morgan. You made two 3s early in the first half and you
basically were about 26, 28percent on the season. Do you think that
contributed to opening up some lanes for you going to the basket?  
MORGAN TUCK: Yeah, I think so. I know I have to hit some outside shots unless
they guard me and they can't double Stewy and Kaleena. So when I'm open, just
try to knock it down to make it easier on them.  
  
Q. Breanna, the game against Notre Dame was a long time ago in December.
What do you remember about that game? What stood out for you most about that
win, the December win?  
BREANNA STEWART: I think what I most remember is got to a point where we were
down 10 in the game. And it still felt like we were in control and we were
able to come back and Morgan played great in that game. So did Kiah Stokes.
She had a lot of rebounds. I'm not sure how many.  
But we really were the aggressors, and we came in there and we wanted that
game more.  
  
Q. What's it mean for you guys to have gone through this road to get to this
point and now be one win away from winning another National Championship?  
BREANNA STEWART: It means a lot. This is exactly where we want to be right
now. We want to be playing Tuesday night. That's the last game of the season,
and we gotta make sure that there's still work to do. We have practice
tomorrow. We've got to focus on those, because we don't want to just play in
the National Championship game, we want to win the game.  
  
Q. Breanna, talk about Morgan tonight and how much it means seeing her excel
after what happened last year.  
BREANNA STEWART: To see how Morgan played tonight, it's just a great feeling,
especially as you said she sat out all last season because of her injuries and
that kind of thing. And she kind of slid under the radar, even though we all
knew what she could do. And she just really came out tonight to show everyone
that she's one of the best players in the country. And I'm glad she's on our
team.  
  
Q. Morgan, how important was it for you guys to come out in the first couple
minutes in the second half and hit them with that quick run to extend your
lead?  
MORGAN TUCK: I think it was pretty important just to get a run going. And I
think it's always important to start the half coming out of the timeout with a
basket. It helps get our momentum going.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. You've raved about Morgan all year long. You have three All ‑Americans. I
don't know how many you can get, but certainly give us one more example of why
she should be the fourth All‑American.   
COACH AURIEMMA: I understand, obviously, there's a lot of really good players
in the country, and I understand that you can only‑‑ you can only reward our
team so much for what we did. And the three that they've picked to be
All‑American, I thought deserved it.  
I thought all three of them had tremendous years. And I think because we have
Stewy, Morgan gets overlooked a little bit. And we talked about it after the
awards came out. And she was okay with it. She was okay with it.  
On our team, if people had an opportunity to come to watch our practices, they
would think that there's a lot of practices during the course of the season
where if you came in there you would think Tuck was the national Player of the
Year. That's how good she is every day in practice. And not having played all
of last year, obviously she wasn't in the conversation at the beginning of the
season of who the top players in the country are.  
But a lot of kids have made First Team All‑American that wish they were
playing Tuesday night. So it all works out.  
  
Q. You played Notre Dame, I mean, an inconceivable amount of times since
2009. How would you evaluate what it's like to play against them? Do you enjoy
it? Does it become too much? What do you make of the fact you've played an
opponent so much?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, they were in our league and clearly we were the two best
teams in our league. And when you're in that situation, you're setting
yourself up to play at least three times if you're the two best teams. And
then because they're so good, they end up here all those years that we were
here. And I think it's a credit and it says a lot about them and what they've
been able to do.  
They're a lot like us. And I think that's why they have had success against
us. That they have a lot of the same qualities that we have as a team and as a
program.  
So we give them problems like other teams in the country don't and they give
us problems like other teams in the country don't. I mean, Notre Dame beat us
a bunch of times there after not beating us at all for a long period of time.
Then they beat us a bunch of times. And everybody felt there was something
wrong with us and sometimes at Connecticut when you lose it's what's wrong
with you, not what's so good about the other guys.  
Then they went to another league and won every game there by 100. So everybody
found out in that league, too, how good they really are.  
So Tuesday night is not going to be any fun, believe me. I'm glad we're
playing in that game, but it's not going to be any fun. They're really hard to
play against.  
  
Q. You went to Kiah Stokes, you went big against them. Talk about how you
thought that may have changed a little bit of the way you guys were able to
play against their front line?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, we were trying to figure out what gave us the best
opportunity to guard them. And we knew we were going to have a problem man to
man. So we made a decision to go zone, and that's Kiah. So when Kiah comes in,
we can play a little bit of zone, we can change our man to man a little bit,
make it look a little different than it looks otherwise. And she gives us a
big presence in the middle.  
I mean, we're not very big. So having Kiah in there, you know, it just frees
up Stewy and Tuck to move out in the perimeter more where I thought that their
guys would have a hard time guarding because they were clogging up the lane
pretty much.  
It's almost like they made two decisions, Maryland did, we're going to guard K
pretty hard and keep everybody else in the lane and try to bottle all those
guys up.  
So I said this all along, when Kiah is good, she's really, really good. And
today she was really good.  
  
Q. In the years past, you've talked disparagingly about other coaches, you
say UConn is so dominant because they get the best players, deprecating their
own players. If it's not the players, one would think you're defaulting to
coaches, but I've never heard you speak that way about any other coach in the
country. So what exactly is it that enables you to consistently year after
year beat the best teams in the country by substantial margins?  
COACH AURIEMMA: That is true that there is that perception out there that‑‑
believe me, it's not a wrong perception that we get really good players. And
in a lot of cases we do get the best players. Stewy was the best player coming
out of high school.  
So we do get‑‑ but we don't get all of them. We just get some. And then
there's probably 10 or 12 other teams in the country that they get some. And
then when you add them all up over four years, they have seven guys that were
All‑American and so do we.  
And that's the beauty of women's basketball in one sense is that when you get
to the Final Four, it's like on the men's side this year, the four best teams
made it to the Final Four. That doesn't always happen. But in women's
basketball that happens a lot, because people stay for four years and they
work, they get better every year. And so we know what we have to do if we want
to win a National Championship. We have to beat the best teams.  
So we practice in a way that we prepare to beat the best teams. And our kids
really buy into that. They love the winning part. They love the way we do it.
I don't think we have a secret formula. I don't think we have a magic potion.  
I just think that we do certain things that I know other coaches don't do. We
do certain things that I know other programs don't do. And we reap the
benefits of it.  
I don't think I work any harder than any other coach. I don't put in more
hours than anybody else. I don't watch more film than anybody else.  
My staff, we're really good at what we do. But we're not so much better than
everybody else that nobody can beat us. I'm not comfortable with me saying
that.  
  
Q. 9 ‑0 in the title game. What do you attribute your success to in this
game?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Trying not to listen to people talk about what the record is.
Because if you play in enough of these games, you're going to lose at some
point. We've played in a lot of these. I mean, we've played in nine of them.
So that's a lot. And we won all nine of them.  
I hope we play in nine more while I'm at Connecticut and the thought we're
going to go 18‑0 in these games, if that happens, ludicrous. Ludicrous.  
So we're going in on Tuesday. It's one game. One night for the season, really.
So one game, one night, and the other nine aren't going to have any bearing on
it. That's not going to mean anything, nothing. At least not for me. I'm
nauseous already thinking about Tuesday's game.  
  
Q. You said in Albany you were impressed with what Muffet did this year.
Just talk for a second, they probably weren't predicted to be back here with
what they lost last year to graduation, just how impressive that they are back
in the title game for a second straight year.  
COACH AURIEMMA: I think that's what I said: They're a lot like us. And we lost
Stefanie and Bria, we lost two All‑Americans. And it was just assumed that
well you're going to be back there.  
They lost two All‑Americans, and they're back. Because I think at Notre Dame
and at Connecticut, we don't try to have great teams. Our goal, and I don't
think their goal is any different, Notre Dame, they're not interested in
having a great team. Their program now kind of sustains great teams year in
and year out. They're not dependent as much as some other schools maybe on
graduation, recruiting.  
There's always enough players already in those programs that when somebody
graduates they just throw somebody in that spot. No matter how good that other
person was, you just move somebody in that spot and because of the coaches
that they created there, those people are able to thrive and survive and play
great because that's what the expectation level is.  
Some other place you lose two All‑Americans to graduation, the guys coming in
go, oh, we can never be that good. So they're not. But I think in places like
hopefully Connecticut and Notre Dame the expectation is I don't care what you
look like or where you were last year, when I put you in that spot, you're
going to play like an All‑American.  
And that's a heck of a compliment for any program. And they're right now I
think obviously I'm biased, I think we're the best, but you'd be hard pressed
to find anybody better than that.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_TAMPA, FLORIDA_  
  
DAWN STALEY: We're just excited to be here, participating in our first Final
Four, and we look forward to the challenge of playing Notre Dame tomorrow
night.  
  
Q. Alaina, give us a statement on the game tomorrow night.  
ALAINA COATES: Well, just excited to be here and we're really looking forward
to playing Notre Dame. They're a great team, and we're just ready to go out
there and get to playing.  
  
Q. Alaina, can you talk about just the mindset of coming in off the bench in
terms of what that's like? Do you like to read defenses? What are you thinking
in those first few minutes before you're coming into games?  
ALAINA COATES: Just coming off the bench and everything, I'm just making sure
I'm paying attention to how we're playing people and just reading how they're
playing, especially at my position, since I do come off behind El, just seeing
how they handle her and her physicality because physical wise we're kind of
the same and just seeing how they adjust to that and just coming off the bench
I'm in that mindset of I want to be a spark, I want to be able to come out and
contribute and I just want to come out and give it good energy and make sure
that I help contribute to my team.  
  
Q. How has the Final Four either been similar or different than what you
expected, at least so far as we're here on Saturday?  
ALEIGHSA WELCH: You know, we've never been in this position, so we didn't
really know what to expect. I think the hospitality has been great, just kind
of the excitement and the vibe around it for this being our first time, you
know, it's exciting for us, so you kind of just‑‑ you've got to take it in,
but with everything that's going on, just find a way to draw that line from
the excitement of what's going on outside of basketball to focusing on
basketball because I think the one thing none of us expected was how easy it
can be to get lost kind of in everything that's going on outside of what your
main goal is here, and that's to come in and win two games. It's been an
exciting factor for the first timers, but we know we've got to focus and get
to business because we do play tomorrow night.  
  
Q. Coaches a lot of times talk about what you can learn from a loss being
greater than what you learn when you're winning a lot of games. Can you talk
about what you learned about yourselves in that loss to UConn that you've
carried over that's made you better to this point?  
ELEM IBIAM: I think we just learned in that loss just to play as a team. It
was kind of early in the season, so we've definitely grown as a team, and I
think all the teams have grown. I think we've just learned just to stay
together even when we're down or we're not playing as well as we normally
play, just to stay together, keep our heads up and really stay locked in to
what our coaches are saying.  
  
Q. Dawn, have you mapped out your plans for how you deal with Jewell Loyd?  
DAWN STALEY: I mean, we do have a game plan in. I think what you have to do
with the type of player like Jewell Loyd, you have to make her work. We can't
allow her to just get easy buckets, everything that she gets she has to work
for, and I think our players are up for the challenge of just trying to stay
in front of her. She's a very good player that can create her own shot in a
lot of different ways. So we have to be as patient and disciplined as Notre
Dame is on offense on our defense.  
  
Q. Dawn, can you talk a little bit about with the starting lineup in terms
of when you haven't really changed that very much, having Alaina still come
off the bench, having Asia come off the bench? What's been the mindset of why
that combination has worked best for you guys?  
DAWN STALEY: Well, I just felt at the beginning of the season, we did try to
change it up the first game of the season, and it was more based on just
reward. I thought we put probably the best five players on the floor for our
basketball team, and sometimes the best five players don't have the same type
of chemistry that you need to be successful, so we made a change to go back to
a lineup that was more comfortable, that had some chemistry, that they played
together all season long, a year prior to coming into this year, and we
thought it would be a great opportunity for Asia and Alaina to see the game a
little bit, and also in the back of our minds, they come in the game and we're
a totally different basketball team. So it puts a lot of pressure on our
opponents to prepare for two different teams, and if you're preparing more so
how you're going to play us, you're preparing less with the things that you
need to do to attack us.  
  
Q. Aleighsa talked about how easy it is to get lost in all the stuff here
going on outside of basketball. You have three years of Final Four experience
as a player. None of these girls have ever been here. How do you make sure
that they're ready, that they're focused on what they need to do?  
DAWN STALEY: I think there is a fine line of enjoying the moment but also
focusing on the task at hand. When we have to do mandatory media stuff, we
give it that energy. When it's time for us to go on the court and work out, we
demand that they be focused and we demand that they understand what the game
plan is, and if they don't have it out there on the court, then we've got to
do more film sessions. That's the way you have to balance it.  
There's a different element, as well, when you have the element of family
members being here, and I think most of their family members are getting in
some time today, so you'll let them enjoy a little bit of time with their
families, but there comes a point where they have to stay in character. We
need to stay in character and treat it like a road game.  
  
Q. How important is it for the future of women's basketball that this team
doesn't let Connecticut keep winning national championships?  
DAWN STALEY: I don't know how important it is. I think it's important that
teams like our program, who I think we've done it the right way, we're
patient, we're worked our tails off to get talent in our program because when
it boils down to it, you need talent to dethrone a team or a dynasty like
UConn. But I think it's a great story that we're here.  
We're not here off of luck. Our team worked to get in this position, and it
just goes to show some of those other programs, if you continue to work and
you continue to recruit and you continue to do things the right way, I think
the basketball gods will put you in this position.  
We're not here to hand Notre Dame a win. We're not here to hand Maryland or
UConn or whoever we'll face in The Finals, if we're able to get by Notre Dame,
we're here to win a national championship. That's our mindset. It's probably
everybody's mindset that's participating in the Final Four, but UConn beats
you mentally and physically if you're not prepared to play them.  
  
Q. Dawn, great players don't always make for successful coaches. Why has it
worked for you?  
DAWN STALEY: I think probably because I'm a point guard, and point guards are
a position of service. You're always serving other people, and it's easy to
make that transition. When you're a shooting guard or a post player, you see
the game a little bit differently. You see it from an aggressive, I need the
ball in my hands, shoot the ball, and it takes time. When you get players like
yourself, it's easy to coach them, but when you're a point guard, you see how
it all works and how it all should flow. You have a different pulse of the
game. And to make that transition I think is a little bit easier for point
guards than other positions. But not impossible.  
  
Q. I know coaches don't like to go more than four or five games out when
you're scouting somebody that you know you have to play, but when did you
start looking at Notre Dame, and from your standpoint, what do you see in
Notre Dame that you like about what they do on the floor?  
DAWN STALEY: I think we've probably watched Notre Dame all season long because
our aspirations were to get to this position, and we knew that they were going
to be in the mix. We've watched them, not necessarily from a writing down
their sets or anything, but just getting a feel for how they like to operate
and the things that they do well, and then what I like about them is they play
basketball with all five players. Everybody has a role, and everybody plays
their role, and everybody can make an impact, especially from an offensive
standpoint, where you can't lay off of anybody. Everybody has to be guarded,
and the beautiful thing about Notre Dame is the person with the ball is not
only the person that needs to be guarded. They make you guard five players on
the floor, and when you're able to utilize the people that don't have the
ball, it looks pretty special and beautiful.  
  
Q. When you have two players like Tiffany and Jewell who likely will spend
some time guarding each other, do they often times neutralize each other and
the game comes down to what the other four players do?  
DAWN STALEY: I think in some instances when you have two great players
competing at a high level and very similar in talent and skill set, they do
have a tendency to offset each other. But I don't think this time around‑‑
they're going to have to make plays. Tiff is going to have to make plays for
us, Jewell is going to have to make plays for Notre Dame for both of us to be
successful.  
I'd just like over the course of 40 minutes, I like the depth that we bring
into the game, so Tiff is having an off night, we feel good about being able
to generate points from some other sources.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about your relationship with John Chaney and
what he's meant to your coaching career?  
DAWN STALEY: You know, Coach Chaney, when I first got into coaching, he was my
only impression on a daily basis. A lot of times our male counterpart at
different universities, they're not as open to someone like Coach Chaney. He
would come into our practices, he would allow us to come into his practices
and learn, and what I saw from Coach Chaney is he preaches quality. There's
not a whole lot of quantity in the amount of reps that his guys got. He would
lecture for an hour, and he expected perfection. When they were able to go out
there on the court and execute, if they didn't execute in that moment, there
was another hour lecture coming after that. But he is a perfectionist. He put
his team in positions to win basketball games that no one else thought they
should have been in. For that reason he'll always be one of the best mentors
that I've ever had. Obviously he did not get to the point of participating in
the Final Four, but certainly I dedicate our time being at the Final Four to
him and all the other players that have affected my life as a coach.  
  
Q. Dawn, we have some players here, Breanna Stewart being one, players that
are 6 ‑3 or bigger who have the guard skills and run the court. How has that
changed women's basketball in the last even 10 years that you have these type
of players that create such a match‑up difficulty?  
DAWN STALEY: Well, I think it puts just‑‑ in terms of the whole big scheme of
women's basketball, we've seen the Europeans do this for many, many years.
It's becoming more prevalent in our American basketball system, and I think a
lot has to do with probably‑‑ has to do with seeing the WNBA and seeing their
dreams being lived out in front of them, so they're trying different things.
A'ja Wilson, she's got incredible guard skills. Breanna Stewart, incredible
skill set. Brianna Turner, they're all just long, lanky, and they have the
ability to score in a lot of different ways, so I think it's just opened our
game up to be able to play on a bigger scale. You'll probably see it more in
international play where we match up a little bit better now that our post
players aren't just on the block, back to the basket players.  
  
Q. A'ja played relatively few minutes in the regionals. I think it was 10
and 14. Was there any reason for that?  
DAWN STALEY: Yes. Foul trouble. Foul trouble. But I think it's great
experience for her. I think she's due for a really good game. She's just got
to find a way to not get herself in foul trouble to where we have to limit her
minutes.  
  
Q. You were talking a little bit earlier about the chemistry of the
combinations on the court. When Alaina and A'ja are in, both still really
young players, but how have they ‑‑ what's their chemistry like between the
two of them, and how do you think both of them have grown in this year?  
DAWN STALEY: Well, Alaina and A'ja, they played AAU basketball together, so
they had instant chemistry, but playing at this level, it's a little bit
different, the demands of what needs to be executed out there on the floor. I
think it's helped Lain, Lain being Alaina, I think it's helped her become more
of a leader, and our staff often laughs and chuckles because Alaina is out
there just directing and telling A'ja what she needs to do, and A'ja is like a
little pup. She's listening, she's like, okay, and she does exactly what
Alaina tells her to do because some of the stuff that Alaina is telling her is
the exact same things she learned from Elem the year before and Lisa the year
before. It's helping her to add some tools to her toolbox that are intangible,
and that will go a long way, especially with Lain just being as young as she
is.  
  
Q. Talking to people who know you, they say you're a basketball junkie, you
love watching games, have a lot of TVs in your house and you watch film all
the time. From an Xs and Os standpoint game planning, what most impresses you
about what UConn does, forgetting about Geno's psychology or how he runs his
program, but in terms of true Xs and Os and what you see on the court, what
does UConn do year after year that really impresses you?  
DAWN STALEY: Well, it's probably along the same lines as Notre Dame. They make
you play all five players. There isn't anybody that you can double‑team
without them making you pay for it. What they are extremely good at, they're
great passers. They make other people better. Every five players on the floor
make other people better, and a lot of times a team only has one or two, one
or two players that can actually make someone better. You know, it is a
beautiful thing to see how well they work together. I often think about how
did these players come into this system, because it just seems like they have
a skill set of passing the basketball, when I know Geno probably thinks one or
two of his players aren't great passers, but somehow they hide their
weaknesses, and they do a really good job year in and year out having each
player on the floor develop how to pass the basketball.  
  
Q. When you got to Temple as a new coach and you got to South Carolina, both
programs were really nowhere at the time. Can you compare the evaluations that
you looked at when you had to build both situations?  
DAWN STALEY: You know, Temple, I mean, both programs I knew nothing about
besides they were probably the doormats of their conferences. What you had to
do was change the culture. You had to get your players to stop thinking about
where they're going to spend spring break besides in the gym prepping for
postseason play. I was fortunate that our Temple players bought into that
right away, right away. Instantly we hit the ground running, and it was pretty
much a success story, and then when you move to a place like South Carolina
where it was very similar, but the players didn't catch on. They really didn't
catch on to doing the things that they needed to do to change the culture and
love basketball in the way that they probably should love basketball.  
Now, I'll be the first to say, if you don't love basketball, we're probably
not the coaching staff for you, because we ask you to do things out of the
love of the game, and when you love it, you're able to accomplish things like
we've been able to accomplish. But I will say this: Those players in year one
at South Carolina, they understand it a lot more. They understand what we
asked them to do a lot more because they stayed around our program. They've
been a very good support system for us, and they'll be in town sometime this
weekend to enjoy the fruits of their labor.  
  
Q. Do you have the inside track if Tiffany is going to get the award named
after you?  
DAWN STALEY: I do, actually. I have the inside track, but I can't let it out
at this moment. But Tiffany is‑‑ if she's up for the Wooden Award, if she's an
All‑American, if she's up for Naismith Player of the Year, I'm quite sure we
got it right in having her one of the finalists for the Dawn Staley Award, and
for her, it probably means a little bit more to get the Dawn Staley Award than
some of those other awards because she looked up to me as a youngster. I'll
tease her about that, too. And I'm just kidding. To win the Naismith Award, to
win the Wooden Award would be a great tribute to her hard work, and not only
her hard work but her ability to lift our program to where it is, because
there aren't going to be very many finalists for any of those awards if their
team isn't one of the top teams in the country.  
  
Q. I think even people who don't follow women's basketball closely, they
know of Geno, they hear of the things he says and they're aware of his place
in the game. For people that might be curious who don't know a lot about him
who would ask you, what's this guy all about? What's he bring to the game, and
what impresses you about him? How would you answer that?  
DAWN STALEY: You know, I think Geno is a champion. I think he knows how to‑‑
he knows what buttons to push. I think as far as his team and other people, I
think he's calculating. I think he knows exactly how to get a rise out of
people, and if you don't know him very well, you'll get yourself out of whack.
But if you know him, you'll understand him.  
When it comes to winning and knowing basketball, he's very genius‑like. To be
able to do what he's done year in and year out, the players that he's coached,
and to be able to win as much as he's won, I think he's deserving of all the
attention that he gets, and I hope to one day join in that national
championship banner raising that he's done for UConn.  
  
Q. Morgan talked about a good game against you, 17 points, six or seven
rebounds. Can you talk about what a healthy Morgan Tuck has done for this team
to make them better?  
DAWN STALEY: Well, I think Morgan is probably the brute that they need. She's
their emotional leader. She's an incredible athlete. She can score with the
best of them. She just gives them great balance. When a player of her caliber
is healthy, she's really a hard match‑up for anybody in the country,
especially with all the talent that she's surrounded by.  
  
Q. You've been around the game long enough to see many of Geno's press
conferences and many of the comments he gives that people comment on. How
comfortable are you answering questions that are away from women's basketball,
just on a philosophical comfort level?  
DAWN STALEY: For me, I'm the type of person that stays in my lane because I
don't want anybody in my lane. I only answer questions that have a direct
impact on me or our program.

_TAMPA, FLORIDA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Maryland head coach Brenda Frese,
student‑athletes Laurin Mincy and Shatori Walker‑Kimbrough and Lexie Brown.
We'll start with an opening statement from Coach Frese.  
COACH FRESE: Thrilled, obviously, to be in Tampa. Place has extra special
meaning for my husband and I. We were married in Clearwater about 10 years ago
in August. So tremendous fun to be able to come back and take our team.  
Obviously we're really thrilled to be one of the last four teams standing.
When you talk about the preseason, I think the other three teams were probably
predicted to be here. And for us to be able to come back‑to‑back Final Fours
when no one expected to see us up here is something that I'm really proud of
with this team.  
You talk about losing five seniors, three‑time All‑American in Alyssa Thomas
and new conference and a lot of question marks coming in. I'm proud of the
growth of this young team this season, led by one senior with Laurin Mincy,
three sophomores and their improvement every day.  
It's a team that didn't let others define them and set the bar. It was really
up to them in terms of holding each other accountable and setting their own
bar. So I think it's fun when you talk about it. I think we're a really hard
scout, only team down here that has no All‑Americans, and I think that's what
makes us so dangerous is because we're a team.  
Obviously we have great respect for Connecticut and everything they've
accomplished. To be able to sustain it at a really high level is really hard
to be able to do. But, however, as we're here, we're not going to concede
anything. We're competitors, too.  
And I think that when you talk about playing Connecticut, they're a really
hard team to face, but at the same time for us it's the best way to be able to
close the gap.  
We want to play them as many times as we can. I liken it to when I first got
hired at Maryland, we got to play Duke, a team that drilled us when I first
got hired and then four short years later, actually to this day in 2006, we
were beating Duke in the National Championship game.  
So for us a big thing is understanding in terms of how to play a team and how
to be able to close that gap. So we're looking forward to tomorrow. It's
Easter Sunday. So we're hoping to be able to find a lot of baskets.  
(Laughter).  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Laurin, tough act to follow that comment by Coach about the baskets. When
did you guys start believing this team could be back here? Last year you get
back here with Alyssa and the goal ‑‑ but when did the group think making it
to the Final Four was something that was an attainable goal for you guys?  
LAURIN MINCY: I think in the summer when everyone committed to come here and
work out in the summer. Usually that's an option. But everyone decided to come
back. The workouts we had and just to see how together we were during the
preseason, I knew we were special. And then to go into the Big Ten Conference
where we were not knowing who we were going to face and then to go through
that undefeated, I knew we had a great chance to get back to the Final Four.  
  
Q. Lexie, back court battle expected for tomorrow. What do you expect to see
from Moriah against you?  
LEXIE BROWN: I'm expecting a lot of ball pressure. She's one of the elite
defenders in college. But I mean I think I'll be able to handle it. She's a
lot smaller than me but a lot quicker than me also. But I'm hoping we get
after it. It's going to be a lot of fun going against Moriah.  
  
Q. Lexie or any one of you up there, what do you take away from the Stanford
game, or was that for them or is that too far ago or even from what Dayton was
able to do for a half against them last week?  
LEXIE BROWN: Yeah, the Stanford game, you can't really think about that game.
Every team is different than they were back in November/December. So that
game, yeah, it was a great win for Stanford but UConn is a completely
different team than they were then.  
With the Dayton game we saw how Dayton played fearlessly for the first ten
minutes. No fear. They were taking all their own shots. They gave UConn their
best shot. So that's really the biggest thing we learned from that Dayton
game.  
  
Q. Laurin, just noticing Connecticut year after year, their opponents ‑‑ you
feel with some of them are sort of intimidated, almost beaten before they
start, and why won't that happen to this team?  
LAURIN MINCY: Yeah, I think a lot of teams get caught up in their respect of
UConn. Obviously UConn, a great team.  
When you go into a game, you have to go in confident and fearless, I like to
say, when you're playing UConn. So we're going to go in there fearless and
give them everything we have.  
  
Q. Shatori, both teams like to run. Do you think Maryland has the advantage
in the transition game?  
SHATORI WALKER‑KIMBROUGH: Yeah, I do think we have a slight advantage only
because of how deep we are on the roster. Connecticut goes seven deep. And I
think we go 12 deep.  
And I think just running them and tiring their legs out and us bringing in
fresh legs and continuing to run.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Brenda, when you look at them on tape, I'm sure a lot of stuff stands
out. But specifically what do they do really well?  
COACH FRESE: Obviously they share the basketball extremely well. Within their
offense, you know, they take great shots. And I think where they really hurt
people is in their runs. If you're not able to be able to keep up with them
from a scoring end, I think that's when the game's over.  
  
Q. Same thing I asked Laurin, when did you think this team could make it
back here, knowing what you lost, knowing what was done, when did you think
this team could be special, back in the Final Four for a second straight
year?  
COACH FRESE: I think for me it was conference play, when you talk about we
really had to grow as a team in our non‑conference plays and then when you
talk about going into our new conference and going to Nebraska, going to
Minnesota, you know, and playing in front of 10,000 fans and going in and
winning, it was big.  
And all of a sudden game by game you start winning more games, and it was
really when this team kind of set the bar for themselves in terms of their
expectations that they had.  
  
Q. You have Lexie and Aja, both have dads that played in the NBA. What's it
like coaching members that have family members in basketball? Is it more
difficult coaching them than players that do not?  
COACH FRESE: It's kind of a really neat story when you talk about that their
families were both with the Boston Celtics at the same time. They were on road
trips together. They obviously don't remember it. But neat for the families.  
It's been anything but difficult. It's been incredible. I think, because you
talk about these two girls have worldly experiences, I mean, when you talk
about the number of games, press conferences, environment that they've been in
since being an infant, I think they walk in just with a whole other element.  
Obviously Lexie is our point guard, is poised beyond her years. And I think a
big reason of that is the arenas she grew up in. So it's been really a neat
feature. Obviously we didn't seek it out. It kind of evolved in terms of both
players coming to Maryland.  
But it's been a really cool experience to be able to have both of them.  
  
Q. Obviously Connecticut's dominance sort of overshadows everything, even a
year when you've got four No. 1s in the Final Four. When you look at the non
‑Connecticut portion of tomorrow's crowd and even the country, do you think
they will root for you? And is beating a juggernaut a good thing for this
sport, if it happens?  
COACH FRESE: Yeah, I mean, aren't we tired of it? I think everybody's rooting
for us. I think we're ready for some new stories. And our sport needs it, to
be quite honest. But at the same point it's up to us as coaches and programs
to be able to develop our teams and our programs to that point.  
And I know that there are a lot of people out there that are cheering and want
to see Maryland be able to beat UConn. And I know for us and for our sport it
would be a great thing to be able to have the teams out there. But at the same
point it all goes in runs. Tennessee in past years was a team we talked about.
Then we had a blend of other teams.  
So, again, it's our job as coaches and teams to be able to get ourselves to a
position to be able to beat them.  
  
Q. Talk about the cell phone experiment, the fans, what effect has it had
and do you recommend it to other programs to try?  
COACH FRESE: Well, it really came about, I forget the year, three years ago,
when we played Texas A&M in the Sweet 16 and went on to play in the Elite
Eight.  
And our players then had their cell phones and everything blew up after the
Sweet 16 and going into the Elite Eight. And Brene Moseley came in shared with
us as a staff how she was not able to manage it, that it was a lot of
distractions, a lot of text messages. And from that we really talked about it
as a staff and took it to our team last year and talked about wanting to go
into the Sweet 16 game to turn their phones in and leave them off and with us
until we finished our season or continued on after the Elite game, the Elite
Eight game.  
It's been huge. Our players bought in last year, then again this year when we
brought it up and they were all on board. And we have a team rule just night
before when we're on road games but just to keep it during this duration, I
think helps them to realize they can minimize the distractions that are out
there.  
  
Q. I remember you said last year when you made it back how special it was
you appreciated how tough it is to get back to the Final Four. Now you're back
here for the second straight year. Is it more fulfilling that this program has
been here two straight years as opposed to the time in between?  
COACH FRESE: Yeah, I'm really proud of our consistency, because it is really,
really hard to get here. And especially with a team that no one expected to be
here. And when you talk about our youth, you know, to be able to accomplish
what they did, pretty much we were written off after Alyssa graduated and our
five seniors.  
So no question, I'm really proud of that fact. But it is a different mentality
coming back with this team. Last year's team was kind of that was their goal
and they were happy to be here. It's not the goal of this year's team. They've
set really high goals for themselves.  
And although we're going to always enjoy the moment, we're never going to take
it for granted. We're always going to be humble in this moment because it is
truly an honor to be here. But at the same point we do have really high goals
for ourselves.  
  
Q. The Stanford win against UConn, can you use that as a blueprint in any
way, or was that so long ago it doesn't matter?  
COACH FRESE: I mean, there's always something that you can learn from every
team. And I think Tara is one of the best when you talk about out there
basketball minds and what she was able to do.  
Obviously it was early in the season and every team grows within that season.
But, yeah, no question, they beat UConn. And so you saw the confidence that
they played with, took them into even overtime. Obviously we watched that game
but they just did a phenomenal job in terms of having their team ready to
play.  
They played with a ton of confidence. And I thought they were really
confident, really aggressive going at UConn.  
  
Q. Along the same lines as your philosophy with cell phones, how do you view
social media during the season for your players?  
COACH FRESE: We try to let them navigate through it. But also some boundaries.
I mean, during the season we have a midnight curfew in terms of being on any
of it. So we want them to shut it down so they can get their sleep during the
season. Obviously day of games or if we're on the road we take the cell
phones.  
So we try to kind of give them that balance and that blend. If something is
tweeted or retweeted or something that doesn't represent our program, we'll
communicate it should be taken down and communicate the examples.  
But our girls have done a really nice job I think over the course of time.
It's really something hard to navigate, like I can't imagine if I would have
had all that when I was in college, because I think it's a lot that you're
asking young people to have to be really professional with.  
  
Q. You mentioned the runs that UConn goes on a little bit in your opening. I
think they went on an 18 ‑4 run against Texas in the Sweet 16 and we saw them
in the second half against Dayton come out firing and just separate
themselves. How do you prevent that from happening to keep yourself in the
game?  
COACH FRESE: Call a timeout. Maybe ask for a few more. You know, I mean, I
think you really have to have a pulse on the game. You can't take bad shots in
those runs.  
They're going to score. You've got to be able to go right back at them. You
can't let their run take you down. You've got to be able to stay really strong
within that and be able to keep your poise and your composure.  
  
Q. How much do you think your winning a championship in'06 buys you with the
players that are on your roster today and then beyond that, recruits, because
there are not many people over the last ‑‑ not many coaches I would say over
the last 10 years who can walk into somebody's home and say I've been to the
place you want to be?  
COACH FRESE: Yeah, obviously it's something you're always going to be able to
utilize in recruiting because there haven't been that many teams that have
been able to win championships.  
And I think for us most currently, though, is having the ability to talk about
back‑to‑back Final Fours because I'm not sure how many recruits remember'06
compared to the last two years. So I just think when you're able to sustain it
at a high level, be able to‑‑ now as I'm‑‑ what am I, finishing my 13th year
at Maryland, that consistency level I think is really important to recruits.  
  
Q. This idea that guard by wins championships in March, and the guard fight
this season, a lot different than last season. Do you think that's sort of
what separates this team from last year's Final Four team?  
COACH FRESE: You know, I mean every team's built differently. But I love the
fact that when we're going to see a lot of pressure, and you talk about the
defense that we've had to face when you talk about coming through Duke and
Tennessee and that defensive pressure and what we're going to see tomorrow
night, it is critical to your success. And to be able to see ‑‑ in my opinion
I feel like we do have one of the best back courts in the country. And when
you talk about what these three have been able to do together, you know,
they've been a huge part to our success this season.  
  
Q. If you've watched enough tape on UConn, you've seen different ways to
guard Breanna Stewart. Some teams double her. Some teams don't. She's
obviously, given her length and abilities, a very hard check. Have you thought
philosophically what you want to do in terms of how to defend her, whether
it's doubling, zone or something else?  
COACH FRESE: Yeah. I mean, obviously when you watch as much film as we have,
you are able to see a lot of different things. I can't really tell you what
we're going to do. But I mean obviously she's the most difficult matchup on
the court when you talk about her length and her ability to post you up or her
ability to step out and be able to shoot the 3, her ability to kick to
Kaleena.  
They have a lot of‑‑ what, they have three All‑Americans. So when you talk
about the weapons that they have on the court and then you finish with the
Player of the Year with Stewart, she's a really extremely difficult matchup.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_TAMPA, FLORIDA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us now from UConn head coach Geno Auriemma;
student‑athletes, Moriah Jefferson, Kaleena Mosqueda‑Lewis and Breanna
Stewart. We'll open with a statement from Coach Auriemma.  
COACH AURIEMMA: I don't know how many ways we can say this during the course
of the couple of days that we're here. When you get to this point in the
season, there's a lot of things that we have to do yesterday, today. And I'm
sure they're all fun things to do and I'm sure that everybody gets a kick out
of those in some way.  
But really what everybody wants to do right now is just play. Everybody just
wants game time to come and there's no more to prepare for, there's no more
film to watch, there's no more practices to go to. Right now it's just about
playing the game.  
And we know what the task at hand is. We know how good a team Maryland is. We
know what we have to do.  
And we're anxious to get started.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Kaleena, could you tell me what difference a healthy Morgan Tuck has made
to this team, what a key component she's been?  
KALEENA MOSQUEDA‑LEWIS: Yeah, definitely having Morgan healthy for us for the
whole season has definitely made a difference for our team. Just because she's
been able to be so dynamic for us out there and be able to be a consistent
person for us on the court at all times.  
Definitely someone we can constantly look to for leadership and someone who
kind of keeps us calm and makes sure everything's under control out there.  
  
Q. Breanna Stewart, coming on the stage with an ankle brace or boot, is that
a pre ‑existing injury, nagging injury?  
BREANNA STEWART: The boot is nothing. It's the inflammation of the sesamoid
bone. And it's fine as of today.  
  
Q. Breanna, third time here, Coach says you want to play games. Is that the
mantra, not this other stuff, and ready to get on the court and do what you
need to do?  
BREANNA STEWART: Yeah, I think this past week we've been looking towards
getting here, and now that we're finally here in Tampa, there's a lot of other
distractions to kind of take you away from playing basketball. But we came
here to play basketball, and that's what we want to do and it was nice to get
on the court today.  
  
Q. Moriah, what challenges do Maryland's guards possess for you
specifically?  
MORIAH JEFFERSON: Lexie Brown is a great shooter. I have to do my best to try
to contain her and keep her from driving to the lane. The other guards are
good also. They're really aggressive guards, and we have to make sure that
they can't penetrate on us when they're trying to get to the basket and kick
it off to the big guys.  
  
Q. Breanna, do you think over the course of your career you've learned to
deal better with teams throwing defenses, being very physical with you during
games, do you think you're better at dealing with that than you were maybe a
year ago?  
BREANNA STEWART: Definitely. I think especially transitioning from freshman to
sophomore year and even sophomore year to now, getting stronger was one of my
big focal points. And I know that everything's going to be physical with me.
I'm expecting that every single game.  
So it's gotten to a point where I'm used to it, and if it doesn't happen, I'm
sometimes surprised.  
  
Q. Question for Breanna. Breanna, just in general, do you guys enjoy being
the team that everybody kind of wants to knock off the throne, the team that
everybody's pointing to all year?  
BREANNA STEWART: I don't really think we think about it like that. We know
that everyone's‑‑ everyone wants to beat us, yeah, and it comes with the
territory. We come to a program where we set the standard really high, and our
goal is to get to the Final Four and to win championships.  
And we know that we always have a target on our backs.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. I'd like to ask about Morgan's role and, first of all ‑‑ that's a
complicated surgery she had last year. Were you at all fearful she might never
get back or never get back to the level where she wouldn't be able to play
again at the level that you saw in high school? Did you ever have a fear she'd
never get back? And talk about what she's meant to you this year.   
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah, you know, Morgan's freshman year at Connecticut, the
first two weeks of practice, we still had Stefanie Dolson and Stewy,
obviously, came in at the same time. And during those first couple of weeks, I
mean, it was pretty evident that at some point pretty soon Morgan was going to
be one of the best players in the country.  
And she was coming off a knee surgery she had. I think people forget, when she
got hurt she was Illinois Player of the Year as a freshman. I mean, that's not
any state. That's a state where they play a lot of pretty good high school
girls basketball.  
And the injury that she developed started to bother her and sophomore year
it's something that she thought we could manage. And when she elected to have
the surgery, it was two things: One, it was, man, I don't know if we can win
the National Championship without her, last year. And, two, our doctors and
everyone told us, you know, there's a 50/50 chance that this will work; she
could come back 100percent or come back just as bad or if not worse than she
is right now.  
So Morgan and her parents wanted to make that chance. And obviously we
obliged. But I knew what we had there, and I knew that at some point, if we
could get her just playing and not worrying about her knee, that there are
very few players in America that can do what she does.  
If she didn't play on the same team with Stewy, I think people would get a
different view. And they help each other a lot, obviously. Those two
complement each other so well.  
But I have to say that every big game that Morgan's played in‑‑ we lost a
Stanford game because Morgan didn't play much and fouled out. I was
experimenting with our team.  
That went real well, huh? And we knew once we got her in the starting lineup
that she got a lot of minutes and she hadn't played all last year that we were
going to be a different team. And she is the biggest difference in our team.  
  
Q. Someone told me that they admire about her she can play the 3, 4, 5,
defend the 3, 4, 5. Is that basically right?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I think we're very fortunate that we can put her anywhere we
want to put her and she's very, very effective. And she's been able to adapt
her game to fit whatever need that we have that game. So whatever we need that
day, that's what she's capable of doing. Not many players‑‑ and having her and
Stewy up there really, I hope, poses a lot of problems for a lot of teams.  
  
Q. When you look at Maryland in years past, typically similar on the front
court, with Alyssa Thomas, Tianna Hawkins and, Alicia DeVaughn, now with the
guards producing at a high level, does that change at all how you prepare to
get ready for them?  
COACH AURIEMMA: They're obviously a much different team than the Maryland team
we played the last couple of years. I think when you have a team where you
have one player that is as dominant and as great a player as Alyssa Thomas
was, you tend to expect her to do so much for your team, that sometimes you
don't get to see what the other players can do.  
And now that Alyssa is not there, I mean, a lot of these guys that are playing
huge roles for Maryland, they didn't even start last year. So now they come
off and everybody's like: Where did these guys come from? They were always
pretty good. But it's just now they're playing leading roles, and they are
much more difficult to defend than they were last year.  
Everybody probably thinks they don't have the inside game that they used to
have, but at this time of the year, I don't care how many big guys you have,
your guards are going to win your games in March.  
You have to have great guards who play great. And their guards play great the
whole tournament, and that's the biggest worry that we have tomorrow.  
  
Q. What is it about your players that allows them to thrive in the role of
the favorite so often?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Probably being in that role a lot has as much to do with it as
anything else. They come to Connecticut with that expectation in mind, and
they either embrace that role and survive and actually thrive, as you said, in
that role of having to be the favorite and having to be on your game every
night because everybody'snational championship is when they play you during
the regular season, as you guys have seen that cover our team.  
People beat us, they storm the court, they carry their coach off the court,
we've seen it all. And they thrive on it and they embrace it because they want
it. They want to be in that role. And we just kind of keep feeding into it as
coaches and we keep pushing it forward and we try not to shy away from it.
There's no shying away from it.  
I mean, it is what it is. And you either embrace it and thrive in it or you
wilt and you don't play.  
  
Q. The loss in November, you got some immediate mileage out of that I'm sure
with your team in November. Do you still get mileage out of it in April?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I don't know. You know, I don't know‑‑ you can only hold onto
things for so long. We try not to hold onto things for that long. I might
bring it up once in a while, but it hasn't come up in a long time now. But I
wish we would lose more. I really do.  
I wish we would lose on a regular basis like everybody else does so that when
we don't play well or the other team plays great and we get beat, it becomes
kind of part of the college landscape at Connecticut. Hey, you know, it's all
right, they'll bounce back, they'll be fine.  
I think those things help you. And it did help us. I just don't want that or
any other loss at Connecticut to be that's the reason why we're going to be
good or that's the reason why kids get better is because we played a team that
played really, really well. And I keep reminding my players, not using
Stanford in particular, but keep reminding my players all the time that when
you play, the team that plays the best that night is going to win if both
teams are equally talented.  
And that game just reinforced that, as did the Dayton game.  
  
Q. When you look at what Brenda Frese has done building up the Maryland
program during the time she's been there, do you consider her one of the best
in your profession?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah, I mean, you don't get to win as much as day one in both
the ACC and now in the Big Ten and win a National Championship and make
multiple appearances in the Final Four without being really, really good.  
The Maryland program has a long history of great success. Chris Weller was one
of the icons and one of the mainstays of college women's basketball, and
Maryland was one of the best programs in America. When I was an assistant,
they were as good as anybody in the country.  
And I think Brenda went there and kind of rekindled that and then took it to
where it is now, where I don't think anybody is surprised that Maryland's
here. I don't think they sneak up on anybody anymore.  
Her and her staff and their players, they keep winning. And it's not a
one‑time thing anymore. They just expect to win now. And so does everybody
else expect them to win.  
  
Q. Lexie Brown is one of Maryland's obviously top dynamic scorers but also
the daughter of Dee Brown, former NBA player. As a coach, what are the unique
characteristics of a player that has family ties to the game, and what's it
like coaching against them? Is it any different than players that don't have
any connection?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I think it goes both ways. I think you're starting to see more
daughters of NBA players playing college basketball. It goes both ways. Some
benefit from being in that environment, growing up in that environment, from
what I've seen. They learn how to compete. They understand what winning and
losing is. They understand what preparing is. They understand what the
expectation is. They have to live with the name that they grew up with. They
have to separate themselves from their father's notoriety and carve out their
own identity.  
So it's not easy being the son or the daughter of somebody like that. And I
think she's handled it great. And he's probably helped her handle it great. I
met him a couple times, and he seems like a regular dad.  
Now the flip side of that, some of those guys are out of their mind. And their
daughters are out of their mind, because the expectation level is unrealistic.
And the expectation level of the parents is unrealistic. And you always cross
your fingers and hope that those kids can be really good on their own merit
rather than live off their father's names. And I gotta say she's one of the
ones that's been able to do it.  
  
Q. Breanna has ‑‑  
COACH AURIEMMA: I'm excited to watch the games tonight. I'm excited to watch
the games tonight.  
  
Q. Breanna has shown a really unique ability to perform her best when the
spotlight is its brightest. Why do you think that is? And is that something
you saw in her when you recruited her, or is that ‑‑ I don't know‑‑ I imagine
it can't be taught, but why does she possess that unique characteristic of
playing well when it matters most?  
COACH AURIEMMA: You just don't know the answers to that question. I don't know
the answer to that question. And I don't know that anyone does. I don't know
that Stewy does. When you're recruiting somebody, you really try to
distinguish like why are they dominant. Are they dominant because physically
they're just so much better than everybody else, and that was the case with
Stewy obviously. She's in eighth, ninth grade and she's just dominant in her
age group.  
One of the things that I thought was telling was that in all the U.S.A.
Basketball experience that she's had, I think she's won more gold medals than
anyone else in the history of U.S.A. Basketball, by this age, is that she
always played up. She always played above her age group. So she's always the
youngest player playing with older kids. And, yet, she was always on the
all‑tournament team or MVP or led the team in scoring or led the team in
rebounding.  
So that kind of gave you an idea that this kid thrives in a pressure
environment. But she's still just coming out of high school. She's still just
a kid. So you don't know how that's going to translate into college.  
And sometimes you recruit a kid and you think this kid's going to be it and
they're not. And sometimes you get pleasantly surprised. Which Stewy kind of
knew she had it and then all she needed was a stage to prove it. And she's
done it, man. I've coached some great ones you all know that. I can name them
but I don't need to. And she's as good as anybody I've ever coached when the
big moments come.  
  
Q. Because of all of your accomplishments over the years, when your program
is portrayed it's often portrayed as this unbeatable machine, almost like you
cut them and they don't bleed. Is taking the pressure off your players
something that you have to actively participate in, or do you have players
that know the reality and don't pay attention to such things?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I think every player, every person in this room has to deal
with some kind of pressure at some point. And you can't avoid it and you can't
ignore it and you can't pretend that it's not there and you have to figure out
a way to use that pressure to make you better.  
There's not a lot of difference between‑‑ like you saw those ten kids get
WBCBL All‑American out there. There's not that much difference between those
ten kids as actual 18‑, 19‑, 20‑year‑old kids. There's not that much
difference.  
If you were to sit down with all of them, there's a lot of similarities
between those kids. What happens, I think, is the pressure that you're under
every day forces you to adapt and then you become somewhat immune to it after
a period of time.  
But that doesn't change the fact that you're just a 19‑, 20‑year‑old playing a
game, and it doesn't mean that tomorrow night that pressure can't overwhelm
you. It's still there.  
The kids that play on our team are not unlike any of the other kids playing in
this Final Four. I think just during the year and during their careers they're
under a lot more pressure than the other kids on the other teams here, and
they learn to use it to their advantage.  
And I don't really try to do anything to diffuse the pressure, other than when
March comes around, I change to accommodate the situation, and I try to help
them even more.  
October to March, I really don't care what happens to them. I don't care how
hard it is, how much pressure they're under, how much they struggle, what
people say about that.  
The more misery we can inflict upon these guys from October to March, the
better. When March comes around, we just take a deep breath and say this is
our time.  
  
Q. You said you'll be watching the men's game tonight. What kind of advice
and what kind of experience can you give to Kentucky and Coach Calipari going
into their 48 ‑0 hopefully season during this weekend?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Throw the ball to your big guy. Which one? Any of the 10.
Don't worry about it. (Laughter) I got to know him pretty well when he was
coaching at UMass. That guy, you talk about a guy who has it all figured out,
that guy right now has got stuff going in college basketball that no one ever
has done.  
And he's an unbelievable recruiter. He's an unbelievable coach. He's an
unbelievable‑‑ just able to thrive in that environment that he creates, and
he's in his element right now. He's in his element right now. And he gets
overlooked for what kind of coach he is, how good he is and how good his teams
play. So coaching against a Philly guy tonight and guys like Bo Ryan, they
don't get intimidated by guys' names or reputations. So I'm anxious to see the
game.  
But as far as any advice for Cal, you know, I don't know that there's anything
I could possibly say that he doesn't already know or doesn't already have. I
can't think of anything. I mean, I can but I can't say it in public.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## April 4, 2015

  

### [Lindsay Allen](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28835)

### [Jewell Loyd](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26561)

### [Muffet McGraw](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14071)

  
_TAMPA, FLORIDA_  
  
Q. Jewell, South Carolina has obviously been looking at how to defend you.
Have you been looking at how they might try to defend you, and who are the
best defenders on that team?  
JEWELL LOYD: Yeah, we worked on how we're playing, we worked on a lot of other
different strategies, as well. We know Tiffany Mitchell is one of their better
defenders and she might be guarding me, I'm not sure. But just working on a
lot of things.  
  
Q. Jewell, how similar or different are you and Tiffany as players? You get
a lot of comparisons between the two of you.  
JEWELL LOYD: Yeah, I think we both have the same mindset of attacking. We're
patient, pretty good athletes. People compare us pretty similar like, but at
the same time we're kind of different, as well.  
  
Q. Could you just talk about the experience of having been here before and
how you think that may factor in in terms of a team that's never been to the
Final Four before?  
JEWELL LOYD: I think that really counts for a lot being in the Final Four,
because there's so much stuff you do off the court and there's different
distractions. But I think overall it's just going to be a lot of fun for all
the teams that are here.  
  
Q. Lindsay and Jewell, address what you have seen of the South Carolina
team, if they remind you of anybody that you've played before the season, what
kind of match ‑up or difficulties do you see in playing this team?   
JEWELL LOYD: I think they remind me a lot of Tennessee, also being an SEC
school. They're very physical, they have great posts and they have a really
physical defense.  
LINDSAY ALLEN: Yeah, I definitely agree with that. They're definitely
physical. They follow the game plan really well and they play hard. They're
fighters.  
  
Q. Lindsay, you were pretty much lights out the last two games. Did you wish
that you could have been playing Wednesday and Thursday, too, and what kind of
got you on that roll?  
LINDSAY ALLEN: I think just our game plan those two games. The posts set
really great screens for us and we got some free‑throw line jumpers that
really worked on in practice, so just having that confidence and having your
teammates really trusting you and instilling that confidence in you.  
  
Q. Some say that just having Final Four experience counts for a lot. Do you
think that will play an advantage since this is South Carolina's first trip?  
JEWELL LOYD: I just think that experience really helps. We understand
possession basketball, and both teams are here to try to win, so it's going to
be a competitive game, and that's what you want in women's basketball.  
  
Q. Jewell, if you and Tiffany are matched up against one another, does the
competitor in you almost kind of want that?  
JEWELL LOYD: Well, you want good basketball. You want good competition all the
way around so you want the challenge, and it's awesome. We talked about that
on the court, as well, and we were excited to play each other.  
  
Q. Growing up did you guys ever expect to be here?  
JEWELL LOYD: Growing up it was always a dream of mine playing for the Final
Four and playing on the biggest stage against some of the best players who
ever played the game. Yeah, that was really a goal of mine growing up.  
LINDSAY ALLEN: Yeah, definitely. It's something you dream about growing up as
a kid, just playing under the big lights and playing with great teammates and
great coaches, so it's been awesome.  
  
Q. What are some of the biggest challenges you face as a basketball
player?  
JEWELL LOYD: I think probably just time management, understanding that you
still are a student‑athlete, so student comes first, so just understanding how
to manage your time.  
LINDSAY ALLEN: Yeah, I would say balancing school and basketball. Obviously
you have to do both, and it's hard to balance that at times, but you have to
get it done.  
  
Q. Muffet, how do you see Tiffany or some of USC's other defenders matching
up with Jewell?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Well, they've got a lot of choices. I think that's the strength
of their team is they have so many great guards with terrific defensive
ability in terms of their just athletic ability. I think they could probably
keep a fresh body on her throughout the game without really losing a lot, even
when they go to the bench. I think they've got some really strong defenders.  
  
Q. I have two very unrelated questions. One, after a spectacular season,
Jewell struggled a little bit in the tournament. What have you said to her
about hanging in there and not trying to force it because she was doing a
little bit of that? And the other question is talk about what Morgan Tuck has
added to Connecticut?  
MUFFET McGRAW: I would say in terms of Jewell, that when you look at her
numbers I would have been thrilled if anybody else on our team had those
numbers. I think that she has been so spectacular all year long that we expect
a superstar every single game, and I think the beauty of us being here and our
team, what got us here, is the rest of the team. I think that what Jewell does
when she's on the floor, she draws so much attention from the other team, and
their whole defense is designed to stop her. So it allows the rest of the team
to step up, and the thing that allows that the most is I think is Jewell,
because she passes the ball so much she's so happy when the other teammates
score, and I think that she's that kind of team member that really kind of
empowers the rest of the team to, hey, step up, I believe in you, you can step
up and help us win, also. I think she's very comfortable having other people
contribute, but I think she is also ready for a big game.  
And as far as Morgan Tuck, I think that it's a shame that the media decides
who's going to be the best players at the beginning of the year because I
thought from our game at least in December, she was the best player on their
team in that game, so probably their second‑best player. I don't think she's
gotten near the attention that she deserves. I think she's had a fantastic
year, and she is a big reason for their success, and for some reason she's not
getting any attention from the media.  
  
Q. How important is it for women's basketball that someone other than
Connecticut win this weekend and in championships down the road?  
MUFFET McGRAW: I thought this was a great year for women's basketball in terms
of the parity of the tournament. We had a number of upsets, we had a lot of
close games throughout the tournament into the regionals. You saw North
Carolina and Florida State almost beating South Carolina to get here. We had a
really tough game with Baylor to get here. Maryland had a tough game with
Tennessee to get here. I don't think it was‑‑ even though all four No.1 seeds
are here and only for the third time in the history of the tournament, I think
that there's a lot of parity, and it's getting better every year. I think
we've got the best four teams here now, and I think what everybody is hoping
for are good games, at least competitive games.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the concerns you might have for South Carolina and its
front court and what kind of challenge you think that's going to give to your
front court?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Well, I have a lot of concerns about South Carolina. They're
such a good team and their depth is just probably the best in the game.
Actually I think they have the most depth of any team here. They have great
post players on the bench and in the starting lineup. You can't think about
we'll have to get them in foul trouble or maybe we can do this or that because
the people they're bringing in or as good or better than the ones that are
starting. I think they present a lot of trouble for us at both ends of the
floor. Defensively you've got Coates who's a great shot blocker. She's just
got such a big body. We really haven't seen a post player with her size and
ability all season long, so I think it's going to be a little different for us
to see the strength of their posts in this game.  
  
Q. Elaborating on that parity question, with a lot of the same programs at
the top, how hard is it for a school like South Carolina to establish a Final
Four ‑caliber program?   
MUFFET McGRAW: Well, I think you're starting with a great coach, and that does
make things a little bit easier. She's got a tremendous reputation in the game
and she does a great job, so I think that helps. But I think it's difficult. I
think the thing that helps you is when you have great in‑state talent. That is
probably the thing that can really get you going because when you have local
players who want to stay close to home to play and have their families watch
them, it makes it easier to recruit them. I think they were fortunate that
there was so much talent in the state of South Carolina. And then when you
start to win, that attracts more good players. I think good players want to
play with good players, so I think it's really been flourishing for Dawn.  
  
Q. Tiffany Mitchell gets so much attention for her offense. What have you
seen from her on film in terms of a defender, especially how well she's able
to defend late in games?  
MUFFET McGRAW: It's funny, we were talking, she and Jewell are so similar in
that way that they both guard the other team's best player, and we ask so much
of Jewell and I'm sure of Tiffany, as well. You've got to perform at the
offensive end but then you've got to shut down somebody, and of course you'd
better rebound and do some other things in between. I think to have the best
player be the best defender, it just says a lot for Tiffany and her mindset. I
think a lot of really good players just want to score, and they don't have as
much interest at the other end, so I think it's great to see these two young
ladies really take pride in their defense.  
  
Q. Whereabouts at the end of the season did you start to feel like, okay,
now we're getting our feet underneath us as far as rebounding and we can
rebound with other people?  
MUFFET McGRAW: I think we were really challenged throughout the season in the
ACC, which is just really prepares us so well for the tournament because we're
seeing so many great teams, yet Florida State who was only out‑rebounded once
all season long and that was when we did it in the ACC Tournament. I think
rebounding we faced so many teams throughout the year that this is a great
rebounding team, they're hardly ever out‑rebounded so we've really got to do
our job, and I think we finally started to take pride in it. It took a while,
I think probably late in the season, probably end of February, before we
really started to take some pride in the box‑out and work a little bit harder
on the boards.  
  
Q. Just wondering what the impact Natalie Achonwa has had on the program
this year, the contributions she's been able to make.  
MUFFET McGRAW: It's been great having Ace around to just help counsel some of
the players, to have her on the bench, to talk to us a little bit from the
players' point of view. We'll talk about some things we're going to do and
she'll give some input as to whether that's a good or a bad idea or something
that they would embrace. It's been good for me to have a little bit of a
sounding board which is very similar to when she was a senior. We talked about
a lot of things then, too. It's funny to watch her. She incredibly organized
in running things, which is not a surprise because of her leadership ability.
But it's been great. It's been great for her to have this experience of being
on the bench and being around practice. It's kept her going through the injury
because she's just been rehabbing and working hard on that.  
It's been, I think, a great experience for both of us.  
  
Q. What have you learned about Taya Reimer this year?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Taya has been probably the difference in our season I would
say. Somewhere around the middle of January, she turned into a completely
different person, and she has brought an energy and an aggressiveness and a
confidence that we really needed. I think that our posts were‑‑ I said in the
beginning of the year I didn't think they were tough enough, and she's the
difference. She's the one that really brought out the toughness in the others.
She's been a mentor for Kathryn and Bri. She's just added so much experience
as just a sophomore, but I think she has really turned the corner, changed her
game, and I think that from that point on, I think she's had an all‑American
type of season. We're just so happy that she has kind of found a way to lead
this team.  
  
Q. I apologize if you answered this already, but just talk about Natalie
Achonwa growth, what she's done for you, her growth as a person over the last
year for you?  
MUFFET McGRAW: You know, as a player, Natalie was the most mature player I've
ever had from the time she was coming out of high school. She was always
somebody that was incredibly organized and knew what was coming months down
the road, and then as a player the same kind of leadership with the team, took
care of them, everybody was always in the right spots. They were on the bus at
the right time. They knew where they were supposed to be because of her
leadership and her organization, so those skills in the DOBO job have been
tremendous for us. She has organized all the itineraries, she keeps everybody
in line. She's on top of everything, and plus being a former player I think
can really help the players. She can counsel them on some things ‑‑ if we're
hitting a rough patch and she needs to go in and talk over some things with
them, I think she's a really good listening ear for them to be able to vent
some things. And she's just been great on the bench. She's got great ideas.
Initially she didn't say too much and then finally got comfortable and gave
some input in what we were doing on the court. I think it's been great, really
great for us, and I think great for her, as well.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## April 1, 2015

  

### [Dawn Staley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15625)

  
_TAMPA, FLORIDA_  
  
COACH STALEY: Hi. We're just really excited about participating in our first
Final Four in our program's history. Our players are pretty excited about it,
but we're also going to approach this as a business trip. I can remember
participating in my first Final Four in, I believe, 1990, and reflecting on
that, I was really just happy to be there.  
All the hoopla before you actually play the game plays a role in having the
energy to finish the job. So we'll be conscious of that throughout our stay in
Tampa. And also just instill in our players that we came to win games, and our
focus has to be on that.  
  
Q. Hi, Dawn. I know beyond the hoopla ‑‑ and there may be more hoopla now
than there was even when you played. Beyond the hoopla, what it is about a
first Final Four experience that you're going to have to talk through with
your team.   
COACH STALEY: Well, just I think the biggest is the hoopla, the excitement.
Our kids have never been on this stage before. I think only Tiffany Mitchell
last year was around all the excitement and the hoopla of a Final Four, but to
have our entire program‑‑ and not just our players. It's probably our staff,
our managers, every single person is going to be in an element that they
haven't been before.  
So it almost‑‑ you get a little star struck by it, but at the same time, our
kids have been a team that has been focused all season long, and our focus has
been to get to the Final Four. But our main focus is to win a National
Championship. You don't want to shortchange this opportunity by being clouded
by something other than the basketball game.  
  
Q. I did want to ask you about playing in the Final Four specifically in
'91, when you came so close to winning and you guys lost by three in overtime.
How much have you thought about that game over these past few years or maybe
this week? Just how much do you think about that since it happened?  
COACH STALEY: I don't think about it much, meaning since we punched our ticket
to the Final Four‑‑ I joke around with one of my former teammates who played
on that team, Tonya Cardoza, and every now and then, I tell her, ask her, why
did she go for the steal?  
We talked about Debbie called a time‑out. We listened to Debbie and the
time‑out, and then we came back on the floor. As players, we had our own
little time‑out, our own little meeting after the meeting, and I just
specifically remember telling Tonya, "Don't go for the steal," and she ended
up going for the steal, and I ended up having to foul Dena Head, who was a 50
percent free‑throw shooter, and she hit both of them and kind of tied the game
up. So we joke around about that.  
What I'm reflecting on now is the first time that I was able to participate in
the Final Four because it's very similar to what our players are about to
embark on, and I just don't want them‑‑ I want them to enjoy it because
there's a fine line between enjoying it and enjoying it too much to where you
won't focus.  
It can be overwhelming. I'm looking at the schedule, and there's not a whole
lot of time that's dedicated towards practice and having our players focused
on the game. So we've got to do a really good job at keeping them focused and
keeping them in the moment, but also knowing that our ultimate goal is to win
a National Championship.  
  
Q. As a quick followup to that, Dawn, you've been in Thompson Boling Arena
several times. You've seen that '91 National Championship banner hanging up
there. Has there ever been a time you looked up there and shook your head and
thought, Boy, I was this close to having it at Virginia?  
COACH STALEY: Not really. It's so long ago, but when you bring it up, there
are ill feelings because we were right there. We had the game in our hands.
Unfortunately, it wasn't in the cards. We're going to play it out that way.  
I think this time around will probably be a little bit more gratifying because
we're two decades removed from that, but I think for it to happen for us in
South Carolina, I think it would be pretty special because it's at a time in
which nobody really anticipated our program to be where it is today.  
To be able to compete for a National Championship is something that I
envisioned for our players, for their parents, for our university, for all of
Gamecock nation, and we got an opportunity to see it through.  
  
Q. Dawn, the fact that virtually all the players on the other three teams
have been through this before, is that a disadvantage? Or does that take the
pressure off your group?  
COACH STALEY: I mean, you can look at it either way. They're probably looking
at us like we're going to be running around, not knowing what to expect and
not knowing what to do and getting full off of the excitement. You will if you
haven't experienced it. I've experienced it, so I kind of know when it's time
to draw the line.  
And then you can also look at it like we're in a position that we haven't been
in probably besides once this year, and that's playing the underdog position.
That's something our program has been probably for, with the exception of this
season ‑‑ we've played that role before. So it will be familiar territory when
it comes to playing that role.  
  
Q. The first question is how important is your leadership, the girls that
are leading your team going into this, the team's first Final Four? And then
I'll let you answer it, and I'll ask you a question about Notre Dame.  
COACH STALEY: I think it's extremely important, but at the same time, we need
to continue to stress staying in character. With all the excitement of going
to the Final Four, we need to stay in character. We need to continue to focus.
And our leaders, which they're in unfamiliar territory. It's easy to focus at
home, and it's easy to focus on the road when there are less distractions.  
This is all teams. All teams that are coming, they have a lot of
distractions‑‑ the hoopla, their relatives, their parents are going to be
there in the same hotel. So there's going to be a lot. I think it's really
important that we focus‑‑ we enjoy, but we focus on the task at hand, and that
is probably making some of our relatives upset because we won't‑‑ we're going
to treat it as a road game where we don't have a whole lot of time to share
and enjoy with our loved ones because we have April 8th to share all these
wonderful times.  
So we're looking forward to it, and hopefully, it ends the way we want it to
end.  
  
Q. And going into that answer you just gave me, what is ‑‑ in your eyes,
what is the character of your team? What is the South Carolina basketball
team?   
COACH STALEY: We're a really focused basketball team. We're resilient. We are
a team that I consider a very disciplined basketball team. But we're not
mistake free. We do make mistakes, and we do have some lapses, but we're able
to overcome those lapses by working hard and playing to our strengths. And our
strengths are being able to play inside out, to be able to utilize our depth
throughout a 40‑minute basketball game.  
  
Q. And then my question about Notre Dame, how much have you seen of them
this year when you haven't been working on with your team and its next game?
And give me a brief look at what you ‑‑ you know, their strengths as you see
them.   
COACH STALEY: Notre Dame is a very calculating basketball team, very patient.
They know where their shots are coming from. From a defensive standpoint, they
make you make plays while they are in between you and the basket. So they want
shots over you instead of around you. I mean, the trick is being able to keep
them off balance enough to get the shots that you want to get from an
offensive standpoint.  
  
Q. Hi, Coach. I was just wondering, can I have your thoughts on how your
freshman you play a lot, such as Bianca Cuevas and A'ja Wilson, have evolved
and perhaps bettered themselves from when training camp started to this point
now?  
COACH STALEY: I think they've progressed nicely. And I often think about, if
we had to just throw them in the fire, how much of that progression would have
put them in a better position of having more opportunity to play,
unfortunately. But fortunately, we have some older players that have been
around the block that are teaching them.  
And sometimes the lessons that they're learning now by getting less reps will
benefit them in the long haul because they have to think now. They have to be
able to think and understand the game and slow the game down a little bit so
they can get a better understanding of how you excel at this level every
single day.  
  
Q. As a followup to that, even though they don't start, Cuevas and Wilson,
that is, do you think going into the season they knew they were going to have
to play a considerably sized role for this team to go as far as you all have
gone to this point?  
COACH STALEY: I think both of them are pretty intelligent, talented players,
and obviously, we brought them here with the hopes of having them play an
integral part of our success, and they have. I think sometimes we think
integral and impact is being out there starting and scoring a certain amount
of points.  
But as you saw over the weekend, there were times in which I felt really good
about putting Bianca in a game in which we were down by ten, and you saw how
she thrives in that situation.  
A'ja Wilson, she's in the end of the game when we play Duke, when we're in the
Bahamas, when we're playing Syracuse, when we were down.  
So these are experiences that they have and that they cherish because they
haven't played a whole lot of minutes. So when they've had some success, they
bottle it up, and they find a way to allow those instances to help them.  
  
Q. Hi, Dawn. I have two questions for you. The first thing is you talked
about keeping your team focused and sort of trying to avoid getting
overwhelmed by the situation. I'm curious for you as a coach, I know you're
focused on planning, but I'm wondering if you've allowed yourself to
appreciate that three of the four coaches in the Final Four this year have
strong Philadelphia ties, and if so, is that special for you at all?  
COACH STALEY: Absolutely. Philly people always have so much love when you do
well, and Geno has been doing this for‑‑ Geno and Muffet have both been doing
it for a long time. I'm pretty much the new kid on the block when it comes to
being at Final Fours with the basketball team. So extremely happy that
Philadelphia is getting the due that it deserves because a lot of times our
sports teams always‑‑ well, not always. Our sports teams end up breaking our
hearts.  
  
Q. True, true. My second question is you're one of the most accomplished
people in the game, but I'm curious about your early days in Philly, maybe at
Dobbins or wherever. What accomplishment from back then are you most proud of
or stands out most in your mind?  
COACH STALEY: I guess just growing up‑‑ I read the article today in The
Inquirer by Mike Jensen, and I forgot about some of those days which my
brothers touched on. I did. I had a really‑‑ I'm most proud of being able to
cut the bottom of a milk crate out, nail it to a piece of wood, and put it on
that electrical pole. And I used to really‑‑ I perfected a bank shot off of a
wooden basket in a crate.  
So I know I've accomplished a lot of things in my life and my basketball
career, but that's truly hard. I won a lot of horse games on the streets of
Philly learning how to perfect the bank shot under those circumstances. So
proud moments.  
  
Q. Hi, Coach. My question for you is being a point guard, being that leader,
that coach on the court, is that what made it so easy for you to become a head
coach?  
COACH STALEY: I think being a point guard and being in a position to serve
others makes it almost a natural move to be able to be a coach. I think some
of the other‑‑ the patience of a point guard. I think the biggest transition
was probably I wasn't one that talked a whole lot. I saw things. There isn't a
whole lot of fat to when I'm speaking. I just speak just to the point.  
Sometimes speaking to the point, players don't always get it. So you almost
have to figure out‑‑ and this is a point guard thing. You have to figure out
how players process information. You've got to figure out what buttons to
push. Those characteristics of being a point guard make it a lot easier to
make the transition into coaching.  
  
Q. As a follow ‑up to that, you're going against a former point guard in
Muffet. I don't know, what do you think that chess match will be? Have you
looked up to her over the years with all her accomplishments, going to five
consecutive Final Fours now? What do you think about that matchup?   
COACH STALEY: I have a great deal of respect for what Muffet has been able to
do year in and year out for a very long time. I think her style of coaching is
incredible because she's able to get the best out of her players year in and
year out. She runs a system in which everybody seems to be able to be
successful in her system, and that's what you want as a player and as a coach.  
When everybody feels like they can make an impact on a game and they're
involved, I think it benefits everybody.  
  
Q. Dawn, I've been talking the last couple days with Tammi Reiss and Debbie
Ryan, and they're talking about how happy they are that you're in the Final
Four and what this means to even people you played with back in Virginia, your
former coaches. Can you maybe talk a little about how you've kept all these
relationships with your ‑‑ if you will, the UVA family of friends and the
Temple former players and stuff, and how maybe you're sort of carrying some of
that in, the good wishes of all those folks going into the Final Four.   
COACH STALEY: Basketball has been my life for a very long time. When
basketball is so much a part of your life, it's the people that make it really
important, that you meet, that you join hands with. Every single team that
I've been involved in, I've tried to be a really good teammate, tried to pass
on my competitiveness, and I've tried to use some of what they do best and use
it to benefit me.  
Debbie Ryan, Tammi Reiss, Audra Smith, ‑all of those players that I played
with at Virginia, and we came up short in winning a National Championship‑‑
those experiences fuel me to this day. I know I've accomplished a lot‑‑ the
gold medals, being a part of Olympic teams, just being a part of USA
Basketball. But the one thing that's always escaped me was the National
Championship.  
And I don't know if it's because it wasn't in the cards. Maybe it wasn't in
the cards. Maybe there's something bigger that will affect a lot more people
than my Virginia days.  
But to be able to look back on my career‑‑ I talked to Coach Chaney a few days
ago, and he's one that I look at. I drove 12 hours from Philadelphia to
Atlanta, and I believe he played Michigan State in the Elite Eight. He fell
short of going to a Final Four, a legendary coach like Coach Chaney.  
I take with me to the Final Four all of those people that have played an
integral role in my career and in my life because it's something that not very
many coaches‑‑ they coach their whole lives and won't get an opportunity to
experience going to the Final Four. So I take all of those people who helped
me along the way and who also experienced that awful feeling of not‑‑ you
know, that void of not winning a National Championship.  
So hopefully, the cards are in our favor this year, and hopefully I'll be able
to hoist the trophy for all of those people that have played an integral role
in my life.  
  
Q. Debbie says she always knew that you had a coach in you. She wasn't sure
exactly at what point, because you were such a great player, that you would
transfer over to coaching. But I'm wondering, even back then when you were at
UVA, did you know eventually coaching was going to be what you got into?  
COACH STALEY: I absolutely did not want to be a coach a day in my life, not
one ounce in me wanted to be a coach, and I don't know why. I have coaches who
were friends before I became a coach, and the only thing they talked about was
their team, and I just thought there is‑‑ although I love this game. It is my
livelihood. It is my passion. But it didn't create balance as a coach.  
Little did I know, once I became a coach, I understood. It's almost like‑‑ and
I don't mean to say this and lessen of what a mother who's giving birth to
their first child, but it almost equates. Because I don't have any children,
so basketball has given me all the emotions. Every freshman that comes in our
program, or when I was at Temple University, it's almost like birthing them.
They become your child, and you live that, and you're able to shape their
lives on a daily basis and leave part of you in them so they can have the
tools to be successful.  
So I don't know why I shied away from that, but I'm glad that‑‑ and bless his
heart, rest in peace, that Dave O'Brien saw something in me to give me that
opportunity to have these emotional relationships with all of my players.  
  
Q. Dawn, two quick things for you. First of all, congratulations on a
wonderful season. Second of all, talking about transition from being a player
to being a coach, could you compare the satisfaction, Dawn, the fulfillment
you find in coaching to what you found as a player? Is it harder for you as a
coach? Do you feel like you have less control, less ability to influence the
outcome of the game?  
COACH STALEY: It's much harder as a coach. Part of the reason is because you
have to deal with all the trials and tribulations of having a team execute and
perform at a high level, and sometimes you have no control over that. You
could try, but with young people, you have to have a feel for what they're
feeling, and you almost have to figure out what it is. You're constantly
thinking, you're constantly trying to figure out the best way to handle
different situations.  
As a player, you practice, you get excited about the anticipation of playing,
but then you don't have to worry about stuff that comes up. As a coach, you
take all of that every single day, and you never know‑‑ no day is the same. No
day is the same because we have 15 players on our roster that we have to make
sure that they're eating properly, going to study hall, going to class, coming
to practice with a great mindset. Some of them have bad days. Some things just
happen.  
So it's more about just the preparation of getting them to understand, to
prioritize and to manage their time in a way that young people probably don't
want to do, but once they get it, they find out that they're able to do a lot
more with that time once they manage it properly.  
So it's much harder as a coach, but it's more gratifying because you know what
it took to get those players there, and they know, in turn, what you did to
get them there. When I say "Coach," I mean our entire coaching staff because
it takes a village to raise a child and to raise a champion.  
  
Q. Dawn, I just wanted to ask you real quickly, when you took the job, I was
wondering if you had a timetable, a timeframe with what you thought you could
turn this thing around and make this successful? And outside of talented
players, what are two or three key things that have happened that have helped
fuel the success of this program?  
COACH STALEY: I never really put a timetable on things. I think for me and my
outlook on just success, success has a certain feel, it has a certain sound,
and it has a certain look. So when all of those things are in place, you're
going to be successful. But that takes time, but it also is exhausting because
you've got to figure out how you get‑‑ how you move 15 young people to feel,
sound, and look like the success that it should be.  
Then it takes talent. It takes talent. It takes great people, and it takes a
commitment, a commitment of discipline. So once we got those things in place,
our program started to move in the right direction. We didn't always have
that. Seven years ago, we didn't have that.  
But obviously, I feel like I had to learn some things as a coach that I needed
to learn in order for me to grow and for our program to grow in the way that
it's grown.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## April 1, 2015

  

### [Muffet McGraw](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14071)

  
_TAMPA, FLORIDA_  
  
COACH McGRAW: We're thrilled to be going back to our fifth consecutive Final
Four. I think of all of those five, out of all of those five, this team has
improved the most. I think this is the youngest team we've ever taken. Not a
senior in the starting lineup. For them to get it together and just keep
getting better, it's been really fun to watch.  
It's been a great group to work with. They are just relentless, and they never
quit. We've been down in a lot of games, and they just keep stepping up. We've
had so many different people. I think that's also another difference from
year's past. We relied on our All‑Americans in years past, and I feel like
this year everybody that's in the game can contribute.  
  
Q. Talk about some of the comments you made after the game the other night,
it sounded like you were almost a little surprised that this team made it this
far. I know this is a goal every year, but has this team surprised you?  
COACH McGRAW: Yes, it is our goal every year. But when you lose two
first‑round draft picks, three starters and a ton of experience, I don't think
you go into the season thinking this is our National Championship team.  
So we had the goal of getting back to the Final Four, but for us to achieve
that goal, I think we really, really had a lot of work to do, and this team
has definitely surprised me in that.  
  
Q.Do you think this team can go into the Final Four with a little different
attitude? Two years ago there was kind of a we've got to win it for Skylar.
Last year, we have to win it for Michaela and Natalie. This year, you know, I
know you want to win, but there is not the pressure of we've got to do it. Is
there just kind of a looser feel to it?  
COACH McGRAW: I think there is a looser feel. I think we're enjoying it a
little bit more. I think that maybe not having the pressure to try to win it
for somebody and just play our game and have fun, I think maybe that's going
to make us a little bit better and hopefully we'll enjoy it.  
  
Q. How much has Lindsay Allen become more of a scoring option changed the
efficiency or impact of this team?  
COACH McGRAW: Coming into the season, we talked to Lindsay and told her she's
going to have to score a little bit more. Last year she really had to get the
ball off the floor and have a 2 to 1 assist to turnover ratio. That's all we
asked of her. This year she's got to score more and be more vocal, and she's
been able to do that. That's a tough transition for some point guards, like
Lindsay who is a pass first point guard. So coming in with a scorer's
mentality and still trying to run the team and get the ball to other people
really it was a seamless transition for her.  
She's looking to score more and doing more in transition, and she's been
really successful. I think it's helped our offense tremendously.  
  
Q. There are always moments in the year when things can go a different way
and teams start losing and sometimes losing you continue losing. Was there a
moment this year where you thought that the team had reached any kind of
crossroads, and obviously it went the right way? Having not seen you guys in
person this year, and I'm sure there are others on the call who could say the
same thing, but was there either a practice or time in the season where you
felt it could go another way but it didn't?  
COACH McGRAW: Yeah, I thought the DePaul game way back in December. I think we
were down six with a minute to go and somehow won the game, and I think that
coming off the Connecticut loss, I think that was our next game. So for us to
win that game I think gave us so much confidence. I felt we really responded
well to that. Then the loss to Miami, I thought that was a tipping point. We
could have gone either way at that point too. We played about as poorly as we
could possibly play. Worst game of the year. Shot about 25% from the field and
didn't defend, and so many things went wrong in that game. So I think to come
back from that debacle and win out the rest of the year, I think that shows
that we did get a lot tougher.  
  
Q. Two questions for you: First of all, this being a young team as it is,
are you and your coaching staff trying to concentrate on not making it so
difficult for them making the moment more fun? In what ways are you trying to
do that? Then I've got another question for you after that.  
COACH McGRAW: We're definitely trying to have fun. Let them enjoy themselves.
I think they play so much better when they're loose, which is hard for me
because I've got to be a lot more patient and a lot more forgiving for what's
going on the floor at the time. I think we're trying to make it less
complicated. I don't think we're trying to do too many different things, too
many new things. We're trying to do what we've done all year and been
successful with, and hopefully that makes it easier for them.  
  
Q. The second question is you've played UCONN. You've played Maryland. You
know a little bit about them. You haven't played SouthCarolina. In that
regard, do you have to make it ‑‑ do you have to cram to the try to find out
as much as you can, or are you more concerned about having your team ready and
playing its game going into the game against SouthCarolina?   
COACH McGRAW: I think it's a little bit of both. I get immersed in the
scouting reports, and we've certainly done a lot of homework on SouthCarolina,
and there is so much to do that at times we think maybe it's time to step back
and just work on us and try to do what we need to do. So we are trying to
simplify it, but they're such a good team and they have so many strengths that
it's difficult to simplify that scouting report.  
  
Q. If I can just follow that up really quickly. During the course of the
season you didn't plan this, but UCONN played SouthCarolina. Did you take a
little time off from watching your team and preparing for its next team to
watch that game and did you put it on the back burner knowing that you might
run up against SouthCarolina?  
COACH McGRAW: Yeah, we did watch that game and we've tried to watch a few more
during their tournaments throughout the conference tournaments. That's when we
really started watching a lot of different teams to see who we might play.  
  
Q. First you talked about having your girls relax a little bit and sort of
enjoy things. I'm curious, I know you're in preparations and the goal is to
survive and advance for a shot at another title. But I'm curious if you've
allowed yourself to appreciate that three of the four coaches in the Final
Four this year have really strong ties to Philadelphia, and if so, is that
special for you at all?  
COACH McGRAW: It is. We were thinking maybe a cheesesteak for the winner. I
think that it's great. We always thought that so much began in Philadelphia on
the men's and women's side, even in the Big Five way back. To have three of
us, and we all still speak the language, I think we're all pretty much the
same and tell it like it is. I can really appreciate that. Yeah, it is kind of
fun. It's a shame that the Final Four is not in Philly.  
  
Q. Obviously, you're one of the most accomplished coaches in the field
today, but I'm curious about your early days growing up in Philly, and what
athletic accomplishments back then either at Saint Joseph's playing or Saint
Anne playing are you most proud of today?  
COACH McGRAW: Well, my senior year at Saint Joseph's we made it to the
national tournament in of the NAIW, so basically the Sweet Sixteen. The top 16
teams went to Minnesota to play. I think we finished third or fourth in the
country, and that was a great accomplishment because the program had just won
when I was a freshman.  
Fortunately, they didn't even have reel to reel tapes going at that time. I
don't think we kept stats, so I can kind of embellish my accomplishments from
then because they were not much to speak of.  
  
Q. This is SouthCarolina's first Final Four. What do you think your team
knows about this experience? Or what do you speculate that a team knows about
the Final Four experience because they've done it before and somebody that
hasn't doesn't know yet, and how does that play into the game?  
COACH McGRAW: Well, I think it helps to know what to expect, especially with
all of the things that you have to do outside of your own practice and playing
the games. There is so much more. It's very time consuming and it's a little
draining mentally I think sometimes too. But when it's your first one, you're
so excited to be there and do all of it that it's actually sometimes probably
easier for the first timers because everything's different, everything's fun,
everything's new. You really look forward to getting involved in everything
that you have to do.  
  
Q. Coach, do you have any initial thoughts on SouthCarolina and how you
might match up against their size?  
COACH McGRAW: Yeah, I don't think we match up very well. They are so strong in
the post and their depth. You can't even think about getting them into foul
trouble or what if they play with a smaller lineup because they have so many
people they can bring off the bench. Then they've got Tiffany Mitchell who
obviously first team All‑American, one of the best guards in the country, and
they've got big shooters. They have great team speed. They play really hard
defensively and pressure so well.  
Again, they don't have to worry about foul trouble because they have so many
people on the bench. They can really go out and pressure as long as they're in
the game. I think they're a really difficult match‑up for us.  
I think we've obviously played NorthCarolina and Florida State, two of the
teams that they've played. So we have a little bit of a look at how they match
up against teams we're familiar with. But I'm not sure that really helps us in
the scouting report.  
  
Q. A follow ‑up on the previous question about SouthCarolina going to the
Final Four for the first time. When you went for the first time is there an
awe factor that you have to get over to settle down and think about playing
basketball?  
COACH McGRAW: You know, there was. There was for us, but it was so long ago.
Things were so much different then. I think if you just look to five years ago
when we went for the first time in a while, we were just so thrilled about
everything that happened. We loved having the police escort. We thought it was
great having all the interviews with ESPN and just going around town and
seeing all the people. I mean, everything was kind of fun.  
I think now it's a little more businesslike, so I think that's why I think
it's important to have fun and enjoy it. I think they'll really have a great
time.  
  
Q. Following up on that, how do you go about making it more fun? Do you plan
to do anything specifically different?  
COACH McGRAW: I think a lot of it is me. I think a lot of it is I'm pretty
business like. I think my approach will trickle down to them. So I think that
I can make it more fun just by enjoying the moment myself.  
  
Q. On Lindsay Allen, when she switches from being a distributor to being a
scorer, is that something she feels naturally or do you talk to her at a
timeout? How does that come about?  
COACH McGRAW: She's really good at taking what the defense gives her. So I
think for her she's had games where she's had big numbers like she did this
weekend, and she's had games where she doesn't take a lot of shots because we
don't need her too because other people are scoring and we're trying to get to
the phone us. But I think she listens to what our plan is. Are we trying to
work the inside? Are we trying to work the pick‑and‑roll? What are we looking
for? What do we think our strengths will be in this game? So she just attacks
it that way. And then in transition I think she's always looking for what's
available.  
  
Q. So it wasn't necessarily part of the game plan? It was just the way the
game developed?  
COACH McGRAW: Yeah, I think a lot of it is how the game developed.  
  
Q. The second one was on Taya Reimer. How was she different from last year?
She obviously came off the bench in the last game, but how is she a different
player?  
COACH McGRAW: I think she's maybe our most consistent player. I think if you
looked at her stats through the ACC schedule and through the tournament, she's
going to get us 8 to 10 points and 8 to 10 rebounds a game, and we can pretty
much count on that. And I think that consistency is one of the strengths that
she's had. I think she also brings a lot of physical play around the basket in
terms of both offensively and defensively. I think she's really smart. She's
kind of stepped up as a leader in the post as a sophomore helping Kathryn and
Brianna. So she's taken on a little bit of a leadership and mentoring role.  
  
Q. This Final Four is made up of four top seeds only the third time in
tournament history, yet there is still a procession out there that is sort of
UCONN and then the rest of the field. Can you address just the overall
strength of the four teams and is that a little demeaning to the other three
teams that are there?  
COACH McGRAW: I think this is one of the best tournaments that we've had in
terms of parity. I feel like there were so many great games throughout the
tournament. There were upsets. There were great games that the No. 1 seeds
advanced, but we all had games where maybe three of us had games where we were
in a really good game in a rally good battle. I think that's great for TV.
Definitely we're heading in a great direction as the men. We had almost the
same number of upsets on the first day that the men had, maybe even the same
number. Even though the top seeds advance, which is unusual, and only look
twice in the past ten years, but it seems as though there is definitely more
parity and more excitement about the tournament.  
But to have all four teams advance, I think Connecticut has the most
championship, and I think the media does cover them quite well, so everybody
knows where they stand. They have the No. 1 team in the country and the No. 1
overall seed.  
  
Q. Just wonder if you could talk a little bit. You mentioned this being your
fifth consecutive Final Four and how you come with a business-like approach.
How much energy do you spend feeding the beast of those expectations now that
you've really been able to build an elite program and had this kind of
sustained success?  
COACH McGRAW: I don't think a lot. I think we go into the Final Four with an
attitude of we're going to do what we do. We're going to work hard. We have an
attitude that we think we can win. At the end, we have four of the best teams
in the country. We've had some really close games. We've lost some
heartbreakers. We've had some success in the semifinals. But I don't think we
go in thinking we've got to win this one. We're just going in and playing our
game.  
  
Q. As a quick follow up, how about even during when you're out recruiting or
at the beginning of the season, is there any kind of thought process that
you've had? We've been there, and/or is it again, no, not really?  
COACH McGRAW: Obviously, we've done something special. I don't know how many
teams have been to seven Final Fours. I think just a handful that have been
there five times in a row. We are one of the elite programs in the country,
and I think everybody knows that.  
  
Q. But you don't feel pressure or expectations in a good way? It's something
good for us to motivate you and your staff and your team to continue that each
year?  
COACH McGRAW: No, I really don't. I think probably if we were the overall No.
1 seed maybe we'd feel more pressure like we haven't been able to get it done,
but no.  
  
Q. Coach, I wondered if I could go back in time with you. I think it was
your second year at Notre Dame when Dawn Staley came into the college game as
a player. I would imagine you were probably fairly familiar with her as a high
school player in the Philadelphia fill area. I don't believe Notre Dame ever
played Virginia while dawn was there, but I'm sure you probably watched her.
What were your thoughts of her in terms of how she impacted the college game
while she was a player?  
COACH McGRAW: What a great player. Just her determination and the things she
was able to do for that team to be able to take them to three Final Fours I
think she went to. Just changed the game, changed Virginia's program, just
such a competitor. Being from Philly, I really appreciated that, and I loved
watching her play and was so proud of her when she went on to the Olympics
representing Philly and then to get into coaching now I think is just such a
great thing. She is one of the great young coaches in our game.  
  
Q. You obviously have such a great relationship with the South Bend
community and how that relationship with a head coach in a community how that
helps the women's basketball program, and if you were looking at what Dawn's
been building at SouthCarolina and has built, do you see that as one of the
important things in women's basketball for a head coach to have that kind of
connection and community with the community that she's coaching in?  
COACH McGRAW: Yes, I think it's critical to your success. She has done a great
job getting the community involved. You see that reflected in the attendance
figures. She's willing to get out in the community and be visible. I'm sure
her team is doing the same thing. I think you need to. That is part of the
women's game.  
We have a relationship with our fans that is, I think, a little different than
the men's game. We enjoy being out in the community. We enjoy taking part in
different types of community activities and trying to give back a little bit
for what the fans have done for us. And I think the fans feel a connection
with our players and feel like they know them.  
  
Q. You're two years in at Notre Dame at that point, did you have a chance to
actively recruit Dawn at all? Did you have any conversations with her?  
COACH McGRAW: No, we did not. I don't really remember honestly how it all
started or where it was in the process. I'm sure we saw her play. But I really
don't remember.  
  
Q. Muffet, this is your fifth consecutive appearance in the Final Four.
That's something I think only three other programs have accomplished. Those of
us who talked to you let's say five or six or seven years ago, you talked
about getting to a place where Notre Dame is at the Final Four every year, and
they're thought externally as one of the three or top 5 programs in the
country. I know it's hard to answer this, but do you think externally now your
program is where you wanted it to be five or six years ago where there is a
thought that every year Notre Dame, like Connecticut is a true threat to get
to the Final Four?  
COACH McGRAW: Yeah, I think so. I would say I probably wanted that 15 years
ago, and it's finally happening. I think you just learn a lot through this,
through the experiences of it, and for what my staff has been able to do
recruiting‑wise, and the more you get there, the better players want to come
and play on your team. It's a little bit of a chicken and egg. What comes
first? I think we got there and started to get really good players once Skylar
got here.  
I think we're where we want to be, and staying here is hard. I think that
people don't realize how hard it is because we've gotten there five years in a
row. They start to expect it a little bit, but it takes a lot of work to get
here.  
  
Q. I mean, you may not be able to answer this because it's not the easiest
question to answer, but have you found, at least in the last couple of years,
that it's easier or harder to stay at this level versus building the program
to get to the level?  
COACH McGRAW: Well, I would say it's easier to stay here because you kind of
know the recipe a little bit better. I don't know that we haven't won it
again, so that's still a pretty tough challenge. But I do think it's easier
because the team knows what to expect, and they know what we want.  
  
Q. Being a former point guard, do you think that led to you being a coach,
and made an easier transition to you being on the court and being a leader on
the team? Second part of that question is do you see a type of chess match
between you and Dawn both being from a point guard to now being head
coaches?  
COACH McGRAW: I definitely think playing the point helps you and prepares you
for coaching. You have to be the coach on the floor, and you have to know
everything about every position. So I think there are a lot of point guards
that are in coaching, and we're all very competitive.  
I never see any game as kind of a head‑to‑head chess match, which with the
other coach I think it's more about what the team is going to do. It will be
fun, I think, to face off with another point guard.  
  
Q. You've had such great production in the NCAA tournament from the
supporting cast, whether it's been Lindsay or Michaela with the bevy of three
there. At times it seems Jewell pressed. How do you balance having such a star
figure like Jewell balanced with what the supporting cast has been able to
contribute without maybe slowing down her game also?  
COACH McGRAW: I think that having Jewell helps everybody on our team step up.
I think that she is such a great player, and when she is so excited for
Michaela making threes and making passes to Brianna and Taya so they can
score. They feed off of her confidence. I think she's the one that's really
responsible for the way the rest of the team steps up because they feel so
empowered by her and she's not trying to do it all, and she's so happy with
everybody and just with winning. I think they see that attitude and that
really gives them more confidence.  
  
Q. If you could talk a little about Brianna's progress this year? Obviously
the strength aspect is a work in progress, especially as a freshman, but when
you match up with SouthCarolina's size and depth up front, her role there
against the Gamecocks?  
COACH McGRAW: Well, Brianna's our leading rebounder. She's been a leading shot
blocker and does a lot defensively just with her presence inside because of
what she's able to do. But to match‑up with SouthCarolina, they've got a lot
more bulk than I think she does. They're a little bit bigger. I think it's
going to be interesting. They have a little more experience. They have one
freshman I think, but the others have a little more experience.  
She's had such a great year. She's gotten better. She's so coachable. Wants to
learn, wants to get better. She always wants to know what she can do
differently and how she can attack things differently. She watches a lot of
film. I'm so pleased with her progress. She's really overachieved for us this
year, and we're excited about her future.  
  
Q. I just wanted to ask you really quickly. There is a story playing out in
Indiana right now regarding the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, and I know
the NCAA as an organization has come out and expressed some concerns. I was
just wondering what your feelings are on the Bill as well as the fact that the
Women's Final Four will be in Indianapolis next year?  
COACH McGRAW: The University has come out with a statement regarding that. We,
as a Catholic institution, we are a community that welcome and value everyone.
We are against unjust discrimination whenever and wherever it occurs.
Personally, I, of course, agree with that statement.  
But I think we'll have to look and see next year. I think it's something we
need to look into in terms of whether or not to have the Final Four there.  
  
Q. I have an X's and O's question about South Carolina's post size. That is
a team that has both defensively and offensively caused issues for opponents,
just given how big they are up front. When you look at them, how do you want
to attack them up front on both ends specifically?  
COACH McGRAW: I don't want to give you the whole scouting report (laughing).
But we're still practicing with plan C right now. We've eliminated A and B.
We've got a lot of different ideas of what we want to try to do. We've got to
try absolutely everything. And if you saw the beginning of our Baylor game, we
played six different defenses before half time. We're going to throw
everything we can at them and see how the match‑ups look. We are a man‑to‑man
team, and that is our primary defense.  
Offensively we're just going to run our stuff the same as we do every other
game. I don't think we'll do anything different offensively. But defensively
is where we'll really be challenged.  
  
Q. Just one thing you had a pretty rough free ‑throw shooting game, I
believe, against Baylor. Was that just anomaly for that game or did you and
the coaching staff, did you read anything more into that?   
COACH McGRAW: You know, I think it was anomaly for us for the season, really.
We're about a 71%, 72% free‑throw shooting team. We're 100% the game before
against Stanford. I think a couple things played into that. I think, one, that
game to go to the Final Four is a pretty big game. Every shot there is a lot
riding on that, especially down the stretch.  
I think we were probably a little tired. Obviously, Lindsay and Jewell played
a lot of minutes, though they shot it a little bit better. I think a lot of
things played into it, and we're not ready too much into it.  
  
Q. So often the discussion this year has been in terms of Player of the Year
whether it's Jewell Loyd or Brianna, obviously both would be incredibly
worthy. They're both going to be WNBA players. From Jewell's end, have you
ever heard her, and even if it's good natured, think in terms of wanting to be
known as the best player in the country over Brianna or over anybody else? Is
that an important or are Player of the Year honors important to her?  
COACH McGRAW: I think every good player wants to be the best. I don't think
there is any question she would like to be the Player of the Year. I think
she's earned it. Certainly the way she's played, and being the ESPN Player of
the Year I think is a great first step and being First Team All‑American.
These are things that matter.  
When you put the time in and devote that kind of commitment to getting better,
I think you want to be rewarded for that. I think if you said do you want to
win that or win the National Championship, there is no question she'd want to
win the National Championship. But for her, and really for all of us here,
we'd love to see her be Player of the Year.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## April 1, 2015

  

### [Brenda Frese](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15652)

  
_TAMPA, FLORIDA_  
  
COACH FRESE: Obviously it's great to be one of the last four teams standing
and couldn't be more proud of what this team has accomplished up to this date.
If anyone's seen us play, I mean, you can obviously tell it's taken a total
team effort for us to be able to get to this point.  
But I'm really proud of our consistency factor, when you talk about
back‑to‑back Final Fours, for us to be coming to Tampa, so many things that
take place behind the scenes to be able to accomplish such a feat. So we are
really looking forward to getting down to Tampa, and for our preparation in
terms of getting ready for UCONN.  
  
Q. Just from the work you've done and what you've seen, what's the
blueprint, what will it take to beat UCONN?  
COACH FRESE: It's going to take a collective team effort. Obviously in that
Stanford game, they did a tremendous job collectively as a team. But I think
you have to‑‑ you know, defensively, they are a great scoring team, and you've
got to be able to try to take some things away. And then I think you have to
have your own team that's got to be able to keep pace in terms of being able
to score the basketball.  
  
Q. When you go to the Final Four for the first time, is there an awe factor
you have to deal with before you play basketball, and how were you able to
deal with it so effectively in 2006?  
COACH FRESE: No question, I think you're kind of blind‑sided by how many
obligations you haves as a coach and with your team. So there's a lot of
things that kind of take your energy away from preparation in terms of getting
ready.  
I think for us in 2006, one thing we were really fortunate, we were playing
common opponents, when you talk about North Carolina and Duke, so scout
specific. I mean, it was teams that we knew and were already prepared for.  
I think when you have different teams that maybe you've never played before,
it makes it a much harder element.  
  
Q. And when you're going into something like this for the first time, as
opposed to going in multiple times, is the pressure kind of off to a degree?  
COACH FRESE: To a degree. I think it probably matters what your mind‑set is. I
know when we went in, our goal wasn't just to get to a Final Four. I think if
you're happy to make it to a Final Four your mind‑set might be different
versus going in and knowing that you're going to win the whole thing.  
So I think different approaches matter in terms of everything that you have to
balance when you get there.  
  
Q. You guys obviously scored 58 in your win over Tennessee. UCONN in just
about 50 percent shooting from the field, they scored 91 in their win. What
are you going to change about your game offensively or defensively to compete
with such a high ‑scoring offense?   
COACH FRESE: I think we've been fortunate that we have been an up‑tempo type
of team and we have to get back to our transition. The Tennessee game lended
more to a halfcourt, physical defensive style of play, where I think both
Maryland and UCONN really like to get out and like to push the tempo.  
So you've got to be able to score the basketball with Connecticut. You've got
to be able to make your own runs and try to get stops on the defensive end.  
  
Q. You talked about how now coming into the season, you talked about a young
team in your conference; do you think playing against such a legendary program
in UCONN has really solidified your place?  
COACH FRESE: We hope that people are able to see on a national scale now our
consistency factor. I think what this team has been able to accomplish this
season, going undefeated in conference, winning the Big Ten Tournament and now
making it to back‑to‑back Final Fours, I would think there would be a
consistency factor that continues to show up.  
  
Q. You won a national title in 2006. This is your fourth year in, and some
of the other coaches are talking about it being so long until they got to that
point. How did that change your coaching style from then on after winning the
national title and knowing you're one of the youngest to ever do that?  
COACH FRESE: I think first and foremost in leading up to that, it was the
talent pool. We had a rich talent pool in our game when you talk about that
cycle of players that went to a lot of different programs.  
After winning the National Championship, I felt like we were able to recruit
probably a smaller, elite level, pool of players. So I think when you're able
to do that, that allows you to kind of put those pieces together to help gel
to hopefully allow you to be able to have success on a consistent basis.  
  
Q. After the early success, is it what you expected and did it change your
view of where you wanted to go with your coaching career?  
COACH FRESE: I always knew when I took the Maryland job that I felt like it
could be a national power type of program. In my wildest dreams, I didn't
think we would win a National Championship in four years.  
Definitely the timetable was sped up in terms of how it unfolded and how it
took place. We were just really fortunate that we had so many great, elite
players in our backyard and in our region that we were able to be able to sell
our vision to.  
So that piece for us is a huge part in terms of becoming who we are today.  
  
Q. We all know Lexie didn't have the first half ‑‑ (inaudible)‑‑ but then
she ended up scoring 15. How do you get her going or is that just her
independent mind‑set? Did you say anything at halftime to get her going in the
second half?   
COACH FRESE: It's definitely, for Lexie, her confidence level. She needs to
have a big assist or a big shot in terms of, you know, feeling the ball going
through the net.  
So that shot before halftime just kind of helped her settle in I think, settle
down in terms of the stage and the moment and obviously she played with an
extreme level of confidence in the second half.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you and we look forward to having you in Tampa Bay this
weekend.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## April 1, 2015

  

### [Geno Auriemma](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14072)

  
_TAMPA, FLORIDA_  
  
RICK NIXON: Good afternoon, welcome to everybody to today's Women'S Final Four
head coaches media teleconference. For the next several minutes you will have
the opportunity to visit with UConn Head Coach Geno Auriemma. UConn will be
playing in its record 8th straight Women's Final Four in 2015. They will be
playing for an unprecedented 10th National Championship coming up. First game
will be this coming Sunday against Maryland. The second game of the
doubleheader of the National Semifinals with play April 5th here in Tampa Bay.  
With that I'd like to turn it over to Geno for a quick opening statement.  
HEAD COACH GENO AURIEMMA: Thank you, Rick. I appreciate the opportunity.
Obviously anytime you're in the Final Four it's a special time of the year.
Anytime your team gets to play for something as important as the National
Championship, it's the ultimate in a player's college career, I think.  
So we're really fortunate and really happy and excited. It doesn't matter how
many times you find yourself in this situation, the feeling is always the
same.  
The other thing that's the same is the best teams in the country usually find
their way to the Final Four, and that's no different this year. I think the
four best teams in the country are in the Final Four. It should be an
unbelievable weekend of basketball and I'm looking forward to getting down
there and getting started.  
  
Q. Kiah Stokes, what did you learn about Kiah during her four years? For you
what are the satisfactions and frustrations of seeing her progress over the
four years?  
HEAD COACH GENO AURIEMMA: Well, it's been an interesting four years, to say
the least. Very rarely do you get to coach somebody that has more blocked
shots and shot attempts during her four years. That's kind of unusual. But
there's been a lot of games where Kiah has been the difference in the game.
I'm sure that there's a part of her, there's a part of us, that, wow, it could
have been unbelievable had we figured out a way to get even more minutes, more
production.  
But having said that, I don't know that there's a lot of centers in the
country that got a lot more done than she did, that she came into college
with. You look at some of these kids that graduated the same year she did and
you look at what they've done and you look at what she's done, and she's had a
great career. And I think most people look back and they wish I could have
done this, wish I could have done that. But just like in the game against
Texas, and probably in the game against Maryland coming up, she's going to be
a huge part of what we want to do this weekend.  
  
Q. Earlier in the year you were talking about looking for leaders, when did
you find them and who are they?  
HEAD COACH GENO AURIEMMA: Well, you know, sometimes it's easy, you know,
leaders just kind of throw themselves into those leadership positions. And
sometimes they just emerge out of necessity. We had a huge personality on our
team last year in Stefanie Dolson, and we had a four‑year leader in Bria
Hartley, who‑‑ those guys just dominated the team in so many ways.  
So replacing them and stepping into that void was not going to be easy. And in
the beginning everyone just kind of felt like someone else would do it. And as
the season progressed in late November, December, whatever, our juniors kind
of took the reins. Kaleena, I think, came out of her‑‑ she's a real in
introvert.  
So I think that the four starters all in their own way that were here last
year and the year before, we don't have a single leader, one person that we
look to. Right now on the floor Moriah Jefferson has been that. But Stewie has
taken over in her own way, something that is more subtle. And in just looking
at the way our team operates right now I would say those four have equally
shared the load.  
  
Q. Your first eight or nine years when you guys weren't successful in
winning a National Championship, what kind of things did you sell to get
players there to buy into your program, a program that hadn't been very good
before you got there?  
HEAD COACH GENO AURIEMMA: Well, in the beginning it was an opportunity to be a
part of something. The kids‑‑ their other choices weren't necessarily great
choices in terms of they weren't the kind of players that were going to help
you win a National Championship initially. They weren't the kind of players
that were turning down National Championship type programs to come to play at
the University of Connecticut.  
So the kids that we got were the ones that wanted to be on the ground floor of
something, wanted to play a lot. And believed in what we were trying to do. We
didn't have much to offer in terms of facilities or recognition, so it was
Chris Dailey and I going around and trying to sell them on what we wanted to
build.  
We even tried on some official visits to take them to Yale, to take them
around that campus and tell them it was UConn, but I think Chris Dailey shot
it down, but that would have been my way of recruiting players.  
But it took an while and we finally got to the Final Four in 1991. It was only
six years after we got here, five or six years after we got here. And then
things kind of started to open up after that.  
  
Q. I know there's a lot that goes into recruiting, but when did you know
that you could build on what you guys had already put together?  
HEAD COACH GENO AURIEMMA: Well, I thought in '91, we went to the Final Four in
'91, and we didn't have one player coming out of high school that was on the
top 100 on anybody's recruiting list. Those kids reminded me of the team we
just played.  
But in 1995 I think winning that National Championship in 1995, we started
getting kids from outside the northeast, in '96, '97, 98. That's when we
realized that we could get involved with the best players in the country.
People knew who you were. We had created a little bit of a brand. The way the
'95 season unfolded, the mystique around that team, I think it was after that
that we realized that we could be pretty special.  
  
Q. I know you've addressed this in the past, but your program has been so
dominant, especially in the last couple of years, the majority of the game
haven't really been that competitive. I know it's been good for you and the
program. Overall has it been good or bad for the popularity of women's
basketball?  
HEAD COACH GENO AURIEMMA: Has it been good or bad for the popularity? Well, I
would like to think that what we've done over the course of the last ten years
or so has been really good for the popularity of the game.  
I think the attention that comes from being really good and having a certain
standard that we set and a certain level of recognition, I think it has been
good in that sense. I think coaches around the country and their athletic
directors can say, hey, look, look what happened up in a small place like
Storrs, Connecticut, look what they've been able to do, why can't we do the
same thing. South Carolina, wasn't today what South Carolina was ten years
ago. Neither was Notre Dame, before 2000. Just in the last ten years looks
what's happened. So you see Dayton playing in the tournament. You see Gonzaga
playing. You look around and a lot has happened in the last ten years. Is it
good? I think it's good.  
You look at the four teams in men's basketball, a lot of shockers there, huh,
in the Final Four, you know. I think everybody is stunned at the four teams
that are in the Final Four in the men's round. Those guys hardly ever get to
the Final Four.  
So the good teams are going to be good all the time because they have the
culture of winning. And it's up to everybody else to catch up. And I think the
catching up is happening. We're not invincible. We're not unbeatable. I just
think that we've been on an amazing run and it's going to end. Somebody is
going to knock us off; maybe this weekend, who knows? And we'll have to start
all over at some point to build it back up.  
But I hope it's good. All the naysayers are going to say it's bad. And I'm
sure half the people in women's basketball want us to lose, maybe more than
half. And some maybe are just tired of it. Nothing we can do with that, not
one thing we can do about that. My players work just as hard if not harder
than anybody else.  
We're not going down there thinking that we're so good that it doesn't matter.
Any team that's down there this weekend can win the National Championship, we
don't buy into this nonsense that we're the only team that can win this thing
any more than I'm sure the rest of the country thinks Kentucky can't lose in
the Men's Final Four. That's not the case at all. Things happen in the Final
Four that you just don't expect.  
  
Q. Two questions for you, Geno. First off, you lost to Stanford on November
17th. And I wanted to know what stands out for you the most about November
18th, November 19th, November 20th, the days immediately after that loss?  
HEAD COACH GENO AURIEMMA: One of the things that stood out was we didn't
really have the same reaction that I'm used to having when we've lost in the
past. Usually you lose a game and everybody is upset, everybody can't wait to
get back on the court. Everybody is edgy. That didn't happen with this team.
It's almost like they've won so much, some of these kids have won so much and
won two national championships and they've forgotten what losing was like. And
even when they got reminders, oh, that's a fluke.  
So it was up to us as the coaching staff to remind them that, hey, you know,
this isn't last year. And we're not unbeatable. It took a while but we were
not a very mature group, we really didn't know how to respond. And we've grown
up. We've matured a lot since that November weekend, absolutely we've matured
a lot.  
  
Q. Is there something specific to that maturity, growing, or is that just
the course of what happens during a season from November to March?  
HEAD COACH GENO AURIEMMA: I think if you have winners on your team, if you
have people that are competitors, they start to find their level and they
start to‑‑ whenever there's any kind of a void people tend to step in and fill
that void. I don't think there's anything I can put my fingers on, it's just‑‑
we have a lot of players that have never been in that situation before. Moriah
Jefferson never had to run a team. She wasn't responsible for all the things
she's responsible for now. Kaleena Lewis, if we couldn't find her at the end
of games, it didn't matter, because other guys were going to step up. Morgan
Tuck didn't play last year. Kia Nurse was playing in high school in Canada. So
we have a lot of players that are in way different situations than they were
in the past. And it took some time for them to grow into those roles.  
But I think in the Dayton game the other night I think we saw a little bit of
that maturity come out, especially after the devastating circumstances of
being down one at halftime, especially after all that adversity that we had to
endure, the audacity of that team to be up one against us (laughter.) You
should not believe how our people responded to that.  
But I think that was a big help for our guys to understand that's what most
people go through during the season. And we're no different than most people.
We just sometimes make it look like we are, but we're not that much different.  
  
Q. Geno, two questions for you. First, I know you're focused in on the task
at hand but I'm curious if you've allowed yourself to appreciate that three of
the four coaches in this year's Final Four have really strong ties to the
Philadelphia area, and if so is it special at all to you?  
HEAD COACH GENO AURIEMMA: It obviously has not been lost on me. And we're all
connected in certain ways. I was assistant at St. Joe's and when I left Jim
foster hired Muffet to take my place. And obviously I have Dawn on my staff
now with the U.S. National Team.  
There's I think a lot of respect there among the three of us. And I think
we're all proud of where we come from and how we learned the game and the way
we carry ourselves, and what we expect from our teams and the way we view the
game. I think we're all obviously a product of where we grew up. And Dawn from
right inside the city and Muffet and I from the outskirts. But we all have
similar traits. And I think it's evident when you match our teams play. And
I'm really excited. I'm excited for both of them and this is Dawn's first one
as a coach. And I'm really thrilled. I wish I was a bystander and could sit
there and root for all three of us.  
  
Q. My second question is, obviously you're one of the most accomplished
coaches in the game, I'm curious about coming up in the Philadelphia area,
what accomplishments from back then stand out to you, are you most proud of?
Does anything stand out to you?  
HEAD COACH GENO AURIEMMA: Well, it's probably one of the reasons why I had to
leave. I didn't have very many accomplishments when I was down there. I think
one of the accomplishments that I had was I left. Not very many people leave
the Philadelphia area, obviously. It's got such a hold on you when you grow up
there. It's one of the most unique places in America to grow up because you
just feel so compelled to be there and to be a part of it and never leave.  
But I was happy that‑‑ I'm proud to think that I grew up in an era where being
on a really good team was important, that being a great teammate was
important. And I was fortunate to do that, regardless of whether it was the
Kennewick or Montgo or any other an place I've been, to be able to coach and
play and be around great people that valued being on good teams and valued
being a great teammate.  
The most fun I ever had in the Philadelphia area was I got to be in the
batter's box in the American Legion game and play against Jon Matlack, before
I knew who he was, and I didn't strike out. That was the best part of my
growing up in the Philadelphia area.  
  
Q. Where was that?  
HEAD COACH GENO AURIEMMA: We played in a tournament in‑‑ in Westchester. I
think he's from that area. We played in a tournament in Westchester. And we
got in a van and drove down there. I thought I needed a passport to go to
Westchester back then. I think I was 15 or 16 and I'd never been out of the
area. We had a great pitcher, Joe Geisley, who was a great pitcher, we had a
good team and we thought we were hot shit. And we're like, who the hell is
this guy? And then we find out after the fact, the following summer he's
pitching for the Mets.  
  
Q. You know being the star at UConn for now over a decade is something, not
just what the player does on court, but she's a figure nationally, she's a
figure in the community. And everybody kind of develops their own personality,
you know, going all the way back to Rebecca and Sue and Diana, Maya, what's
that been like, that process, for Breanna, and how have you sort of watched
her grow not just for her whole personality?  
HEAD COACH GENO AURIEMMA: Well, I could be mistaken, but I think Breanna had
so much more success at such a younger age than any of the ones you mentioned
that starting 8th and 9th grade and being USA basketball, and I think she's
won more gold medals than anyone her age right now at this stage of their
career, than anyone. I just think she's‑‑ and she's done something in college
that no one's ever done, being MVP of two Final Fours, her freshman and
sophomore year.  
It's been a little different for her. I think the expectations on her were
greater. When my an came here as a freshman, things were a little bit
different for her. When Diana got here as a freshman, she didn't even start.
We had a great team, and Sue, the same thing. And you look back on all those
guys, still they came here under different circumstances, the height of the
whole social media and the expectations. And she's got to be Breanna Stewart
every night. Here's a kid that averages 18 points a game, and a dozen rebounds
and four assists and three blocks or whatever the numbers are. And everybody
goes, ah, she didn't have a great year. The expectations for anybody else that
would do anything resembling what Stewie did, would be looked upon as God's
gift to basketball. But it's been different for her. It's really, really been
different for her. And she doesn't really have that edge that Dee had. Nobody
has that. But that some of the great ones have had, the way they carried
themselves. She's much more laid back, and much more easy going. And that edge
comes out at the NCAA women's time. But her four‑year‑‑ three, almost‑‑ has
been quite different than all those other players. But no less impactful,
that's for sure.  
  
Q. If I can ask you a completely different question, back in '91, and I
realize this is going a ways back, you played Dawn's Virginia team, Dawn
Staley, when she was at point guard or guard at Virginia. I just wonder what
your thoughts were going into that semifinal in terms of facing her back in
'91 and I guess how you rated her as a college player then. Was she somebody
that you expected would go on to the coaching ranks based on how she played?  
HEAD COACH GENO AURIEMMA: You know, going into that Final Four I thought we
had a really, really good team. I thought that we were the most difficult team
to play against in the country because of the way we played, what we took
advantage of and all five of our starters, we played without a center, and all
the teams that we were going to play, they relied a lot on their inside game
and we didn't.  
When we were getting ready to play Virginia, we thought they would have a
difficult match‑up with us, and we thought we would have a difficult match‑up,
we knew we couldn't guard them, but we also knew they couldn't guard us,
either.  
But then we go down there, and we kind of got caught up in the festivities of
the Final Four and not really preparing for the game as well as we would have
liked, looking back.  
But obviously Virginia was the star studded team, Dawn was a national figure
and so were the Burge twins, and Tanya Cardoza, and they just had a lot of
great, great players. And they maybe had the best team in the country that
year. But it was a four‑point game with a minute to go and they had the best
starter guards in the country. They did. And we went toe‑to‑toe with them.  
And obviously Dawn went on to be a great player in the Olympics and a great
player in the WNBA. You just never know if those guys want to be coaches. When
you're that good as a player, you have so many doors open to you that you just
don't know whether they think that coaching is in their future. But obviously
she's taken everything she's learned and become a hell of a coach. I'm not
surprised that she's there this weekend.  
  
Q. Jeff Walz, Louisville, said recently, when he sat in on one of your
practices he was kind of amazed by just how much the kids policed themselves
and demanded of themselves. Ideally is that the way it is at this point in the
season at Connecticut, where your kids are studying the ball by yourself and
there's not a lot of needling or yelling required?  
HEAD COACH GENO AURIEMMA: I think it depends on the group that you have, but,
you know, we have‑‑ hopefully we have some upperclassmen who understand if you
do these things and if you do it this way good things will happen. We have a
culture of that here that we created. And it took some time. But by the time
you get to be a junior and a senior at Connecticut, there isn't much I can say
to you that I haven't said a thousand times. There's not much more I can do to
motivate you. It's got to come from inside you. I'm not out there on the
court. I'm not in the middle of every play, of every scenario, I'm not in the
locker room when you guys are there. I'm not in the back of the bus. I'm not
in the hotels when you guys are there together.  
So there's got to be a sense from the upperclassmen of this is what we do at
Connecticut, this is how we do it, and it's going to be done like this all the
time.  
If I still have to do that when a kid is a senior or junior, there's a pretty
good chance they're not going to play a big role in that program. The practice
where Jeff was at we had‑‑ I think was one of the best teams we've ever had,
and we had all great upperclassmen, and some teams just lend themselves to
that. Other teams, you've got to stay on them all the time. Like this
particular team right now, you've got to be really careful with this team.
You're too hard on them, they're, why are you doing that. If you go easy on
them and go, okay, guys, it's on you. Like, hey, you know, a birthday party.  
So this team you've got to zig and zag a little bit with, and so far we've
guessed right. I hope we can keep guessing right.  
  
Q. I think many people would consider this year's Player of the Year, if you
want to call it a race or whatever you want to call it between Jewell Loyd of
Notre Dame and Breanna. And I for Breanna's purposes, are things like that
important to her, even if she's not as edgy or Diana and some of the other
players that you've had, how much does she look at that kind of individual
stuff in terms of letting it be known externally that she's the best player in
college basketball?  
HEAD COACH GENO AURIEMMA: I think it's really important to her, I really do. I
think it's important to Jewell Loyd. I think kids that have the opportunity to
be the National Player of the Year, I think it's important to them. If they
say, it doesn't matter, I just want my team to win. That's not true. They want
their team to win and they want to be National Player of the Year. That to me
is what great competitors do. And I think if somebody said to me, Jewell, that
kid is really good. And she's really, really good.  
And Stewie is the same way, I think she wants to be the National Player of the
Year. She wants everybody to think she's the best player in the country. I
don't think she would sacrifice for that winning, and I don't think Jewell
Loyd, either.  
But I say to the kids, when people vote on awards, you've got to take had that
with a grain of salt. You don't know why somebody is voting against you. You
don't know why somebody is voting for you. We talk about that all the time.
When people are voting, and when people vote they have biases. If my coaching
staff voted we'd vote for Breanna. And if Notre Dame's coaching staff voted,
they would vote for Jewell and they'd both be right.  
  
Q. One more on Breanna. Because she has an opportunity to be around some of
the best players in the world, I should say the best players in the world,
forgetting about play on the court, did you notice that she picked up anything
mentally in terms of attitude after having been around and practicing with
players who really are at the highest level of being competitive, that it's
not just women's basketball, but in sports?  
HEAD COACH GENO AURIEMMA: I think a little. I think she was too young to
understand really what was going on. I think she was just caught in the
moment. Like, hey, I'm on a national team and I just finished my sophomore
year in college, I must be really good, I must be really cool. And I kept
trying to tell her, no, you're not. You're not anything like these guys. And I
want you to pay attention to the guys that prepare a certain way. I don't want
you to pay attention to all these guys, because not all of them prepare the
same way. I want you to pay attention, who prepares the best? Who gets ready?
Who's there every day? Who comes to work everyday the same way? Who can you
count on? I want you to pay attention to that, not pay attention to I'm with
the pros. I'm with the best players in the world, all that, because every time
she steps on the floor she got her ass beat. And that was good.  
But, you know, when you're as young as Stewie was, when that happens to you,
sometimes that knocks you for a loop, because all of a sudden you realize,
man, I'm not nearly as good as I thought I was.  
So I think it was good for Stewie to be in that environment. And I also think
maybe not so good. So when we got back, we had some work to do. She struggled
a little bit. And obviously she's where we want her to be right now. But I
think you've got to be careful when you put young kids in the middle of all
those great pros. It can work both ways, and I think in this case it was a
little bit of both. It helped her a little bit and it hurt her little bit.  
  
Q. (Inaudible.) How difficult is it been to bring in players like Stewart,
there is has to be the right type of personality to be able to play together
for four years?  
HEAD COACH GENO AURIEMMA: Yeah, we're not perfect. We don't hit a home run on
every recruiting trip. We bring kids in here and sometimes it just doesn't
work out. We're not that different than any other school. People say,
Connecticut, kid transferred from Connecticut, yeah, kids transfer from every
school, you know why, because coaches make mistakes, and kids make mistakes.
So you try really, really hard to not‑‑ in the case of Sue, Asjha Swin,
Tamika, we had a home run there, we had a Grand Slam there. Four great
personalities, four great teammates and three Olympian.  
With this three that we've got new Stewie, Tuck and Moriah, same thing, three
great kids, great personalities, great teammates, phenomenon on natural
players, who don't step on each others toes, who respect each other. And are
willing to share and sacrifice some things for the bigger good. And not
everybody wants to do that. And the roll of the dice, you take the chance, and
you hope it works. And with these three it certainly did.  
  
Q. I was just wondering your thoughts on the new RFRA law in Indiana,
especially with the Final Four set to be there next year?  
HEAD COACH GENO AURIEMMA: You know, I'm not completely familiar with the fine
print on what it is exactly that they're trying to do. And I heard this
morning on the news that somebody is backtracking on what it means and what it
doesn't mean and how to rewrite it and how to make it so that everybody
understands it better, and what you can do and what you can't do.  
And I'm probably not the best person to ask. I'm a basketball coach. I get to
coach a lot of different types of people, different backgrounds, different
raises, different religions, different orientations, whatever it is, and to me
that's personal. And I try to stay out of their personal life unless they want
me in it.  
But I've got to tell you, I've always been fascinated by people who care so
much about what other people are and what they do in their personal lives.
Like how small minded do you have to be to care that much about what other
people are doing? Life is hard enough as it is, trying to live your own life.
What do you care what other people are doing, as long as it doesn't affect
you. And if it's true, and hiding behind this religious crap, that's the most
cowardly thing I've ever heard it.  
So I don't know all the details but what I've heard and what people have told
me, it's just‑‑ it's 2015. I'm sure those people are nice people out there.
I'm sure they don't want the Final Four to be canceled. I'm sure they don't
want all this bad publicity that they're getting. Nobody wants that.  
So some on, some to your senses, here. Just go on with your life and let
everybody else go on with theirs. That's my approach with my team and I don't
understand anybody who's got a different approach.  
  
Q. You've read a lot about the state of the men's college game this year,
that the game is not as fluid, efficient, exciting, well played as it has been
in years past. There's many reasons people would surmise that from more
freshman, sophomores playing than juniors and seniors. I know you are
obviously an authority on the women's game and your team. But you're a
basketball coach and a basketball fan, so you see a lot of men's college
basketball. What has been your thought about where you see the state of the
men's game is right now?  
HEAD COACH GENO AURIEMMA: It's funny, you asked me that, I just had a
conversation with Phil Martelli yesterday and I think he's the president on
the ABC board of directors or whatever.  
And we had this conversation and we talked a lot about where the game is and
what the future of the game is. And obviously it's immensely popular. You look
at the interest paid on the NCAA tournament. I don't know that it's as
immensely popular during the regular season as it used to be, but obviously
the tournament is just at another world when it comes to that.  
Having said that, I think the game is a joke. It really is. I don't coach it.
I don't play it, so I don't understand all the ins and outs of it. But as a
spectator, forget that I'm a coach, as a spectator, watching it, it's a joke.
There's only like ten teams, you know, out of 25, that actually play the kind
of game of basketball that you'd like to watch. Every coach will tell you that
there's 90 million reasons for it.  
And the bottom line is that nobody can score, and they'll tell you it's
because of great defense, great scouting, a lot of team work, nonsense,
nonsense. College men's basketball is so far behind the times it's
unbelievable. I mean women's basketball is behind the times. Men's basketball
is even further behind the times. Every other major sport in the world has
taken steps to help people be better on the offensive end of the floor.
They've moved in the fences in baseball, they lowered the mound. They made the
strike zone so you need a straw to put through it. And in the NFL you touch a
guy it's a penalty. You hit the quarterback, you're out for life. You know, in
the NBA, you touch somebody in the perimeter, you whack guys like they used to
do when scores were 90 to 75, they changed the rules.  
This is entertainment we're talking about. People have to decide, do I want to
play 25 bucks, 30 bucks to go see a college scrum where everybody misses six
out of every ten shots they take, or do I want to go to a movie? We're
fighting for the entertainment dollar, here, and I have to tell you it's not
entertainment from a fan's standpoint.  
So that's just‑‑ I'm talking as a fan, not as Geno, Auriemma, the basketball
coach.  
RICK NIXON: Thanks to everybody for being on the call with us. Geno, good luck
to you and we'll see you this weekend in Tampa.  
HEAD COACH GENO AURIEMMA: Thank you.  
RICK NIXON: Thanks toll all.

_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

South Carolina  80  
Florida State - 74

  
COACH STALEY: I'd like to just say Florida State really gave us a tough match.
They were there to the very end. They were opponents in which we felt like
matched up pretty well against us and they took us to the wire. Fortunately
for us, we got players like Tiffany Mitchell and Alaina Coates that made plays
for us down the stretch and got us this incredible win.  
  
Q. What was that moment like when the final buzzer sounded what was going
through your head?  
TIFFANY MITCHELL: Just full of excitement pretty much. It's just great to
finally take this program to a Final Four. It's really fun to be able to enjoy
this moment with our team.  
ALAINA COATES: I couldn't really think. I was just running back trying to find
somebody to pick up. Just a lot of excitement and just really glad we were
able to come up with the win.  
  
Q. Tiffany, again, especially after yesterday, you kind of took over late.
Is that something you felt you had to do? Did Dawn tell you to take the
ball?  
TIFFANY MITCHELL: I just think me and Coach Staley have a nonverbal
communication. I just look at her and she looks at me and I'm just like, all
right, it's time. That's kind of what happened. Just made plays for my team
when I needed to.  
  
Q. Alaina, you were named the Most Outstanding Player of the Greensboro
Regional. Do you feel like you're playing the best basketball of your college
career over the course of these past few tweaks?  
ALAINA COATES: I feel like I'm playing better basketball. There's always room
for improvement. I know during the regular season it didn't turn out as great
for me as I wanted it to, so I just want to be able to do more for my team and
for myself coming into the postseason.  
  
Q. There were a couple of older players out on the floor, Courtney Newton
and Markeshia Grant, how much did it mean to you to help see the players that
helped build this be here for this moment and for you to give that to them?  
TIFFANY MITCHELL: It means a lot that they still support us even though they
have graduated years before. It just means a lot how they come back and cheer
us on even though they graduated.  
  
Q. Big three ‑pointer with about a minute left. You had only made one to
that point; any hesitation that that was the shot at that time? Take us
through it.   
TIFFANY MITCHELL: I mean, we just ran the same play pretty much three times in
a row. And I knew the first two times I went to the basket, they were playing
off me, and I just had enough space and I shot it.  
  
Q. You talked about finally making it. What do you think has tipped it to
get you to the Final Four for the first time after last year, not getting
there? Is it experience? Is it new players? What's the difference?  
TIFFANY MITCHELL: Yeah, I think it's a little bit of both. We have enough
experience on this team and just to mix in some of our youth, I think that
helps us just because we are so deep. I think last year, we didn't have enough
to get us over that Sweet16 hump and this year, I think we are so much deeper.
That's what helped us in these past few games.  
  
Q. For either of you, when things weren't going your way, was there a moment
where you felt the momentum change?  
TIFFANY MITCHELL: I just knew we were always in the game. We've played behind
plenty of times, so we never doubted for a second that we were going to lose
this game, and that's the mentality you need playing against such a great team
in Florida State.  
  
Q. You've played in two straight down ‑to‑the‑wire games. What is it about
your team, this team this year, that you're able to kind of stay poised and
end up coming out on the winning end?   
TIFFANY MITCHELL: For me or Alaina? Both of us? Can you repeat the question?  
  
Q. What is it about this year's team that you can come out on top?  
TIFFANY MITCHELL: Ahhh‑‑  
COACH STALEY: Welcome to my world (laughter).  
TIFFANY MITCHELL: Like I said, we just had enough‑‑ we knew we had enough this
whole tournament. I think our bench is a lot better than Florida State's and
it showed today.  
ALAINA COATES: Just to piggyback off what she said, yeah, we all just knew
that once we hit the floor, that we had to go out there and make an impact.  
  
Q. Alaina, you said the regular season maybe didn't go as well as you wanted
it to. What does it mean to you person will I to win most outstanding
player?  
ALAINA COATES: It just means a lot knowing that my hard work paid off; knowing
that I was able to go out there and contribute to what my team was doing in a
big way like that. It means a lot.  
  
Q. Tiffany and Alaina, wanted to hear from both of you about the fans. I
think there were more fans here today than yesterday, and I don't know how
much you hear them on the court. I know they were loud the other day, but what
did it mean to both of you individually?  
TIFFANY MITCHELL: It just means a lot just knowing that our fans will travel
and support us anywhere we're at. They definitely created home‑court advantage
for us and it seemed like a regular home game. It was really loud. It was
probably louder than Colonial, than it usually is as Colonial. I think it
played a huge part on our comeback when we were losing and us getting over
that hump and finally taking that lead.  
ALAINA COATES: Just kind of piggybacking, our fans play a big role in what we
do. We feed off their energy. They pick us up when we're down. They keep us up
when we're ahead. They are the ones that they support us no matter what. They
will follow us pretty much anywhere. It's a great feeling, we just go out and
do what we do for them.  
  
Q. For both of you, throughout this tournament, have you looked at some of
the other teams that you can potentially play, Notre Dame or Baylor on Sunday,
and UCONN is in the other bracket. Have you started to look at potential
opponents?  
ALAINA COATES: I mean, the games, we watched them but we were too focused on
handling what we needed to handle in Greensboro first.  
TIFFANY MITCHELL: Pretty much just taking it one day at a time. We are looking
at our next opponent. We are not looking too far ahead. Like today we were
focused on FSU, and now we are going to be focused on whoever wins out of
Baylor and Notre Dame.  
  
Q. Alaina, what's it like when you're up on the ladder cutting down that
net? Is that a surreal moment?  
ALAINA COATES: Yeah, it feels good. I remember last night watching Kentucky's
men do it and thinking that could be us tomorrow, tomorrow afternoon. To
actually be in this moment and experience this means a lot.  
TIFFANY MITCHELL: Just how the game went and just having to fight and get down
to the final buzzer and things like that, just knowing that we had to fight
really hard and we came up with a win; it just made it a really great feeling.  
  
Q. Either player or both, looking ahead, not so much who you're playing, but
if you look back to your game against Connecticut, did you learn something in
that sort of environment that's going to help you in Tampa, and how do you
stay poised when you're the new guys on the block down there? All the other
teams are going to have a lot more experience in this environment than you.  
TIFFANY MITCHELL: I think that's going to play into our advantage being that
we are the new kids on the block in the Final Four. I think that puts more
pressure on them. We are just going out there and we are playing, so I think
that puts more pressure to say you've been there already. Just go out there
with a level head and compete.  
I think the Connecticut game did help us because there's another level of
basketball out there and we are starting to realize that, and we are playing
pretty about basketball right now.  
  
Q. What was going through your mind when that final buzzer sounded?  
COACH STALEY: I wanted it over, as quickly as possible. I just wanted to
embrace our coaches because they have worked so hard. This is something that
we have wanted to do as a staff for a very long time, probably long before we
got to South Carolina. And to be able to enjoy this moment with them, it's
pretty special. They work hard. They put us in a position to achieve this type
of success, and we wanted to just enjoy the moment.  
  
Q. Seven years ago, you win ten games; did you think that this would be
possible? Did you still have this goal in mind?  
COACH STALEY: The goal is always in mind, whether or not we have the pieces in
place to accomplish those goals are a different story. I think with each year,
you gain a little confidence because we play in the best conference in the
country, and our conference prepares us for games like this where they go down
to the wire, where they are physical and where you're able to maneuver and try
to out‑fox whatever our opponents will give us.  
But it's always been in mind. It's just we've got some pieces that will allow
us to compete at this level and go into the Final Four and have a legitimate
shot at winning.  
  
Q. A few weeks ago it seemed like Bianca was maybe struggling a little bit
with confidence; how did she overcome that to have her biggest?  
COACH STALEY: Bianca is a competitor: Whether she is flying around the court,
whether she's having great games or not‑so‑great games, she's a competitor.
You want in those situations‑‑ I felt like we would have an advantage with her
on the floor, just her quickness, her ability to put Florida State back on
their heels. You know, that's why we went with her pretty early.  
In the second half when it was getting down to the wire, we felt like we
wanted our experience down there. But she doesn't lack confidence, at all, no
matter what situation she's in, and I think she's at a point where she's
understanding the process a little bit better. She's aware of her surroundings
and what she needs to work on to improve.  
But still, even if she doesn't play a minute; if she plays 12 minutes, you
know she's always going to be a threat on the floor.  
  
Q. You called Tiffany Mitchell Superwoman on Friday, and with the game tied
67 ‑67 she scored the next seven points. Was there any doubt in your mind that
she would be the player to step it up down the stretch?  
COACH STALEY: Well, I had no doubt. We are probably‑‑ this is a monumental win
for us; we'll probably rename that play because we ran it a few times down the
stretch. We ran it on Friday night. We'll rename that Mitch in on honor of
her, because she hit big buckets for her. I had no doubt, no doubt where the
ball was going, even though Alaina Coates was having a pretty good second
half. But Tiffany Mitchell is the person we want the ball in her hands when we
need a basket.  
  
Q. What was the name of that play beforehand?  
COACH STALEY: We got more games to play (laughter).  
  
Q. Are you able to let this sink in? You've been through is this as a
player. Is it all relatable?  
COACH STALEY: It's much different as a coach than a player. Because as a
coach, you reflect on all the former players; you reflect on all the bad
seasons; you reflect on the good seasons; you reflect on what basketball
really means to you. And for me, it's all I had. It's been my passion, my
livelihood and I think as a coaching staff, we came to South Carolina because
we felt like we can get here at South Carolina with the conference, just when
we got to South Carolina, the players that were local. And with the coaching
staff that, you know, has coached or played at the very highest level.  
So it's a great moment because it is shared by so many people across so many
teams. I think back to my coaching at Temple University, this is the dream
that we sold them on; come to Temple and you'll win a National Championship.  
Now it's come to South Carolina; you'll win a National Championship. You'll go
to Final Fours. It makes it all make sense. Now we have some credibility to
what we're saying and what we're selling, our program, our university.  
  
Q. I've heard some people say this was a statement game. What was the
statement your team made tonight and what factor was the fans?  
COACH STALEY: This game is always a tough hurdle, because it's coming down to
the wire, you're playing against some of the country's best opponents, and you
know, you don't know a whole lot about them. You try to crunch up a whole
season in two nights of work, getting a scouting report together.  
It is; it puts South Carolina on the map. Now I think the regular season that
we had, the success that we've had in our conference; but when you hurdle over
being a regional champion and going to the Final Four, it puts your name in
history.  
So it's a history‑making game for us, but‑‑ and I said this before. Any
National Championship team, any champion in any sport, they have fans. They
have people who come watch them play and cheer them on and they find a way to
create a home‑court advantage no matter where they are, and our fans have done
that for us all season long.  
It does my heart good to know that when you walk out there, all the chants you
hear is Gamecocks, and it's a beautiful thing. Really, I couldn't write a
better script for our season, for the community, and how they embraced our
basketball team. It's a beautiful thing that I'll always cherish, especially
being in the State of South Carolina.  
  
Q. Is there a step that you have to take from being a great team to being a
champion team? If so, is this team ready to take that step down in Tampa, or
do you not know yet?  
COACH STALEY: Well, I'll tell you this: We are not just going to show up and
just be happy to be there. This particular regional final game isn't the
destination game for what we set out to do this season.  
So, you know, I think this was a statement game because we are going to ‑‑ we
punched our ticket into the Final Four, and now it's time to maybe check off
some things that we've wanted to do, which is win the National Championship.  
How we get over that is we show up on Sunday‑‑ I don't know, Sunday night or
Sunday afternoon, ready to play whoever wins the Notre Dame and Baylor game.  
  
Q. What were your thoughts on your team's performance for about the first 15
minutes of the first half and how were you able to overcome the early
turnovers and miscues?  
COACH STALEY: For us, I think we have taken opponents's punch in the first ten
to 15 minutes of probably each game that we've played. So it was no different.
I think sometimes our players, they want to make an impact. They want to make
an impact so bad that sometimes it's not the right decision.  
We just wanted our players poised and calm and not get ahead of the game. Just
take each possession as it is and try to figure out what's the best shot to
take out there, what's the best defensive assignment to execute.  
But I just felt we were in a good place, even though we were down. It was
familiar territory, so we didn't panic. We just had to let the game settle in.  
  
Q. Speaking of stepping up in the moment, Alaina Coates, talk about her
performance on the week end.  
COACH STALEY: She was fantastic. Alaina, you know, just it clicked for her. It
clicked for her in postseason play where I think she just realized how
talented she is, and when she puts her mind to doing something, it works for
her. I think there wasn't any doubt that she could be the best player on the
floor when she puts her mind to it. And she definitely was a key component of
us getting to this point.  
  
Q. Tiffany Mitchell played every minute, 21 points, six rebounds, five
assists. What's it like for you to watch her?  
COACH STALEY: It's become pretty common. We're going to go to Tiffany Mitchell
for as long as she can run up and down the floor. She is a well‑conditioned
athlete. She could probably play another game and have the same type of
performance.  
It was really hard for us to take her off the floor for what she means to us
on both sides of the ball. She defended like no other. She chased Conwright
around all night long, and then when it was time, when the game was on the
line and we put her on Romero, and I thought that was probably a great call.
And I think Coach Boyer thought that was a pretty good matchup down the
stretch and I think it was a difference maker.  
  
Q. A week ago, Alaina said she thought she simmered down her sophomore
compared to her freshman year. Do you think she's being a little harsh on
herself with that statement?  
COACH STALEY: Not at all. I think what we have to understand, as freshmen,
especially being a student athlete, it is the biggest transition of your life:
Socially things change; academically things change; athletically things
change.  
When you take her out of her normal environment, these things are crashing
together at once and then we're asking her to perform on a nightly basis to
help us win a National Championship with all the other things that she has to
deal with, it's hard.  
And things, as you get older, your sophomore year, things just start clearing
up for you. You have your junior year, senior year. It should be just putting
on an old shoe and you should be helping other people deal with that. So
things are clearing up for her from a basketball standpoint, and you're seeing
the benefits of her seeing it a little bit differently.

_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

South Carolina  80  
Florida State - 74

  
COACH SEMRAU: What a great basketball game. It's hard to lead for 28 minutes
and trail for three and lose it. Credit South Carolina and their toughness.
Tiffany Mitchell, I felt like we did a good job with their post kids and I
thought Tiffany found her shots and made some big plays down the stretch.  
Did what we needed to do: We out‑rebounded them. I felt like getting ten more
shots, out‑rebounding them, you know, it was difficult to play without our
kids on the floor, and that was the difference. We didn't play without
fouling, and really, I felt like that was the biggest difference in the game.  
So for our kids to battle the way they did with a crowd like this, wish we had
been in Jacksonville or Tampa, but certainly you have to credit South Carolina
and their play all year long and their crowd here today I thought was
fantastic.  
  
Q. How hard is it to settle into any kind of rhythm when you're constantly
going in and out due to foul trouble?  
BRITTANY BROWN: I don't know, it was really hard, feeling that you wanted to
be out there with your teammates and make a difference, but I thought we did
fine, even though we were in foul trouble because we have a deep bench and
everybody was producing on our team regardless of who was in foul trouble or
not. You miss those people being out on the floor but I think our team did
what we need to do.  
  
Q. Have you guys faced a crowd ‑‑ have you been in an environment like that
this year where the crowd was so loud and so large?   
ADUT BULGAK: Yes, we have, every single home game in Tallahassee. We were out
there ‑‑ it was a garnet crowd, and the only thing was they was confused which
team they were cheering for (laughter).  
  
Q. I think you went one basket over eight minutes or thereabouts in the
second half and it was just getting tough to get a shot to knock one in. What
was South Carolina doing or you guys not doing on offense that kind of made
things grind to a halt on offense?  
ADUT BULGAK: I think they did a great job of defending us and knowing their
personnel. But you can't base your next shot on what happened on the last
shot. So we just had to keep pushing through and eventually a basket would
fall, and it did.  
  
Q. At the end of the game, the one sequence where you played defense, South
Carolina was only up by two and seemed to miss the rebound. Can you talk about
that sequence and how pivotal that was at the end of the game?  
ADUT BULGAK: That was probably the worse moment of my life, like just the ball
was right there at the tip of my fingers and I should have got it. I mean,
especially‑‑ proud of our game on rebounds, but like I said, the previous play
can't‑‑ that play can't be determined by the previous play. We brought the
ball back down and we ended up hitting a big shot. Just got to carry on.  
  
Q. I know it's going to take some time to be able to reflect but when you're
able to hang with a team that was No.1 in the country for as long as you did,
are you able to at least take some sense of accomplishment in that and what
you guys were able to accomplish to get to this point?  
BRITTANY BROWN: I'm really proud of how our team did this year. Of course we
fell short of our goals but we made history, and it was just fun. It's one of
my favorite years playing basketball besides high school. I love these girls,
I love the coaching staff, from GA's to scout ‑‑ scout boys. I will just say,
I will remember this forever. It was a great moment.  
  
Q. Just going back to the foul trouble, how did that affect what you were
trying to do, your bench play, everything, how did the fouls really impact
this game?  
COACH SEMRAU: I couldn't figure it out, honestly, Jordan. We just played a
game where neither team went into the bonus until ten minutes in the game two
days ago. I was just stunned. I think our kids were stunned.  
When you're playing‑‑ it was so tough playing without Maegan. When she plays
30‑plus minutes a game and she played six the first half, gets her fourth
quickly, third and fourth; I know I'm rambling‑‑ I can't quantify it. I just
want to credit the other kids. I mean, to be in the foul trouble we were with
her and Adut; Adut played seven minutes in the first half; and to have this
kind of game, I'm proud of them. I just wish‑‑ I wish we had had that rhythm
that we didn't have.  
  
Q. The last time you were in the Elite 8, you faced a juggernaut and it
wasn't pretty, wasn't a great game for you guys. Does this show what this
program that you were a minute way from going to the Final Four against a very
good team?  
COACH SEMRAU: Yeah, no question. I mean, the calibre of players, just they
want to be great, and they were great in a lot of ways this year.  
I think to play that many minutes leading, what you mentioned was the No.1
team in the country at one point, they weren't afraid. They had so much
courage. They stepped into, you know, a packed house, I think it was one time
we played like this and that was at Notre Dame and they played great. I don't
think it matters whether this team was on the road or at home. They just
battle and I'm proud of them for that.  
  
Q. Your thoughts on Leticia's effort tonight, seemed like she was battling
through and the hand was affecting her.  
COACH SEMRAU: Yeah, I think it did. And Maegan gives her a lot of relief, and
I felt like without Maegan on the floor, we didn't have somebody else that's
real comfortable handling the ball in that situation. I mean, Kena did a great
job when she was in. I didn't feel like I could play them together for
defensive reasons. But yeah, she's a warrior. She's a battler.  
I think the most important thing for us is understanding when we lose two
players, we have to use this momentum, especially back in Tallahassee to build
a fan base like South Carolina has. That's certainly something that's
extremely important in women's basketball that happens and I hope that the
City of Tallahassee will jump on this bandwagon and bring something special
next season to Florida State.  
  
Q. You had mentioned on the first day you were here, you guys have a
different go ‑to player every game and you didn't know who it was. Tonight you
had a lot of players that statistically were kind of balanced but you just
didn't seem to find the one.   
COACH SEMRAU: Yeah.  
  
Q. Was that somewhat not being in rhythm? Was it a matter of nobody quite
could step up and make a shot or two and take charge?  
COACH SEMRAU: Yeah, I think that's what it was. I felt like‑‑ and again, it
was just so difficult to substitute, and thinking about, I hated going
offense, defense that early with Maegan that early in the second half; that I
kept thinking the game could go to overtime. And we had two kids foul out, and
that's ‑‑ we don't have kids foul out. I just was trying to protect that, keep
it close, and I think that hurt in some ways that she couldn't play the whole
time.  
  
Q. Can you appreciate now how good a basketball game that was and the fact
that I think at one point they had 15 or 16 shots in the first half
trailing?  
COACH SEMRAU: Yeah, unbelievable, low turnovers by both teams, high assists.
Just the way that we battled and rebounded the ball against a team that is an
excellent rebounding team; I think they are tenth in the country. No, that was
a fantastic basketball game. I think it was good for women's basketball. The
crowd was fantastic, and we're moving forward.  
  
Q. Yesterday we talked about them in the post and how good they are and
obviously tonight with their points in the paint, is it what you expected, or
what was going on down there?  
COACH SEMRAU: Yeah, it was what I expected and I thought our post did a
tremendous job. They knew the scout very quickly. They adjusted. I mean, it's
a war to try to get around, stay in front, guards get to help side, make sure
you get back out to shooters; in every way, they adjusted. Welch wanted to go
left and they didn't let her go left. I thought we had a tremendous game plan
and almost pulled it off.  
Thanks so much. Thanks to the City of Greensboro for making this an excellent
event.

_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  
Q. Asia, it seemed like you might be hesitant to shoot from outside last
night, were you trying to space out those possessions or did you just want to
get a cleaner look?  
ASIA DOZIER: Our initial game plan was to go inside because that's what we've
been doing all season and that's what's been successful for us.  
Coach always says if you have an open shot early in the shot clock more than
likely you'll have that same shot under ten. That's when the shots are
expected and that's when we had the best rebounding positions. So I just wait
patiently and it usually works out for the best.  
  
Q. Aleighsa and Tiffany, you have worked so hard to go to the Sweet16 and
now that you're finally here, how do you balance the excitement of being in
this point and with the focus of having to win one more game?  
ALEIGHSA WELCH: I think you have to maintain your focus because this isn't the
point in our season that we want to be and as far as to say, okay, we got over
the Sweet16 hump, we're satisfied. We still have bigger and better goals for
ourselves. But we took in the win last night while we still could but when it
came down to it, we are still focused and we have another game tomorrow.  
TIFFANY MITCHELL: I agree.  
  
Q. Talk about, you've made a lot of big shots in your career, but the shot
last night, can you just talk about, when it was all over, did you watch it
again and just some of your thoughts on making that shot, and also how much
you've grown as a player; that you want the ball in your hands in those
situations all the time.  
TIFFANY MITCHELL: Well, yeah, people sent the video to me after the game, so I
kind of got to see it. Coach Staley just drew up a play to try to get the ball
into my hands and Aleighsa set me a screen on the baseline, and I kind of just
read it from there, and my defender, and saw an open lane, so I took it.  
I think that the confidence just comes from Coach Staley and my teammates
pretty much want me to take that shot, and the confident from them just rubs
off on me and I feel comfortable taking that shot.  
  
Q. Aleighsa, how much did it mean to you last night when you were not
playing one of your better games to are have your teammates pick you up?  
ALEIGHSA WELCH: It definitely meant a lot. Like I said, it's my senior year
and I definitely didn't have the game that I wanted but we had a lot of
different people who stepped up, and one of the main people did who was a
fellow senior of mine, which was Olivia Gaines.  
So it just meant a lot that‑‑ and I think it just shows the depth of our team
because like I said, I didn't have the game I wanted but we had a lot of
different people who in the biggest moments of the game shined the brightest
of the entire season. It meant a lot that my teammates were able to pick me up
with the game I was having.  
  
Q. Aleighsa, to follow up with that, since you didn't have one of your
better games last night, how determined are you to come out tomorrow and make
sure that your season doesn't end?  
ALEIGHSA WELCH: The determination factor is always there, but last night's
game isn't going to be in the back of my mind as far as when we play tomorrow.
You've just got to let it go. We are still able to play tomorrow so that's the
most important part. You attack the game with the game plan that we set up and
you do what you have to do to get a win.  
But I'm not really the type of person to harp on a bad game. You've just got
to let it go and you've got to continue to play because we're in a situation
where we do have the opportunity to still be able to play.  
  
Q. Aleighsa and Alaina, Florida State's front line is pretty big; how much
of a challenge will it be to try to keep them contained like you did against
Mavunga last night?  
ALEIGHSA WELCH: You know, they do have a big front line, and it presents a
different challenge than probably what we've seen all season except with the
exception of Duke.  
I think the biggest thing is their rebounding. They are a really good
rebounding team. So trying to contain that aspect of it and limit them to one
shot on the offensive end. But you've got to do your work early. You've got to
make them work for everything and you can't give them anything easy. But we've
just got to make sure we do what we're supposed to do heading into the game.  
ALAINA COATES: Piggybacking off what Aleighsa said, it's going to be key, we
just make sure we do our jobs defensively and offensively.  
  
Q. Alaina, can you talk about where you are now as a sophomore, as opposed
to a freshman? It's always a big learning curve for a post player because
you're a big target. Can you talk about how you've progressed as a player with
fitness, with your moves, with your mentality as a sophomore?  
ALAINA COATES: Last year was as a freshman, I didn't really trust in my moves
as much as I do now. I was a little impatient. I just wanted to get a shot up
and just getting on the court.  
And now, I'm really just looking at things and seeing which shot is best for
me, should I pass it out, should I not, just keeping a low head and making
sure I stay in the game and don't get frustrated.  
  
Q. Tiffany, neither South Carolina nor Florida State has never been to the
Final Four; does that make it feel more real or wide open that there is going
to be a first ‑timer going regard of who wins tomorrow?   
TIFFANY MITCHELL: I guess but our ultimate goal is win the National
Championship so that's what we are going to try to do tomorrow‑‑ or get to the
Final Four tomorrow.  
  
Q. Aleighsa, obviously the goal is to win; what would it mean to you coming
from where you started with this program four years ago to make it in the
first Final Four in program history?  
ALEIGHSA WELCH: It would definitely be a big deal. That's something that I
wanted coming in when I made my decision to come here.  
So to kind of be staring it right in the face, I guess you could say with our
game tomorrow; it would be something that I could just, once again say it was
something I was able to accomplish in my career here in South Carolina.
Because even when Coach Staley first recruited me it was a goal I wanted to
achieve with my team at some point in my career.  
Of course we do have a bigger goal at hand but you savor the moment and
something like that would definitely be something that's just big for me and
something that I'll be able to take for myself years after I graduate.  
  
Q. Khadijah, people always talk about the depth on this team but could you
address specifically the depth at guard? Last night is a great example with
Tina coming in and the minutes she played and Olivia. Can you sort of talk
about like how all season that's been the case; that you guys have kicked each
other up offensively and defensively at the guard position?  
KHADIJAH SESSIONS: We have a lot of guards, a lot of guards are capable of
doing different things, bringing different things to the table. And last
night, as you said, Tina Roy and Olivia Gaines stepped up big and contributed
big for us on the defensive and offensive end.  
It's just the best thing that, you know, sometimes it might not be your game
and somebody on the bench can come up and pick you up. That's what's so
special about this team, and we've been doing it all season.  
Talking about bench production; we're one of the best in the country, if not
the best, coming off the bench and we take pride in our bench coming in and
stepping in for the players that's not doing what they can that game. We have
a tremendous bench, tremendous depth in the guard and post position, so
definitely a great thing about us.  
  
Q. Their front line is really big, really tall and they like to get up on
the glass. How much of a challenge will it be to try to keep them off the
rebounds?  
COACH STALEY: It's a huge challenge. It's something that they do extremely
well. It's going to be probably the No.1 key to the basketball game. We just
have to be disciplined. Those hours that we spent pre‑season, the drills that
we do every day in practice, the boxing out, and being deliberate and making
sure that we don't give people extra possessions is going to be key for this
particular game.  
So hopefully our players will do that and execute that tomorrow.  
  
Q. You've talked about focus all season. After an emotional game last night,
getting over a hump they have been wanting to get over for so long and a team
they have been want to go get over for so long, do you have to stress that
more or is it so ingrained now that they know it instinctively?  
COACH STALEY: Our team has been a creature of habit. We've been able to focus
on the task at hand and we've been able to turn the page and focus in on the
next task. I think we'll stay in character when it comes to that. Obviously
it's a great win for our program. It's a great milestone. But it's not our
destination game. It's not what we intended to do this season. It's along the
way but it's not, you know‑‑ it's part of what we wanted to do.  
  
Q. Similar thing, I asked Alaina about her progress this year, both in the
minutes that she can play and just how she's learned to be a big ‑time post
player.   
COACH STALEY: You know, Alaina, we sometimes forget that she's just a
sophomore because it seems like she's been in our program for so long. I think
sometimes the game is played extremely fast from a post‑player's eyes and it
needs to just slow down, and you need experience to understand it. You also
have to have the knowledge as a coach to get to your players. You can say
things but sometimes things can go over their head.  
So you have to figure out‑‑ you know, we have to figure out how she takes in
information and how she's seeing things. What we've done is Coach Taylor, we
just try to familiarize where she is on the floor. She has to understand where
she is on the floor and we give her certain moves to where she is on the
floor. And if she's off the block a little bit, she knows what to do. I'm not
going to say what she's going to do if she's in the paint, two feet in the
paint, she knows what to do.  
And she's not a selfish player at all. She's probably one of our better
passers, and I think A'ja Wilson has been the recipient of her passing. So we
look forward; we want her to have a tremendous postseason so she can feel that
confidence going into summer workouts. She's committed to staying all summer
long. So we are just looking for her to continue to grow and be a dominant
post; be the best post player in the country next year.  
  
Q. You're familiar with Shakayla Thomas; how can they impact the game and
how close was she to being a player for you?  
COACH STALEY: Shakayla will probably have to answer that question. We
recruited her extremely hard. We felt like the same things that she does for
Florida State; she is an incredible athlete. She can rebound in traffic. She
can get down the floor fairly quickly. She's got great basketball instincts
and IQ and she has an incredible will to win. She poses somewhat of a matchup
problem for us.  
Hopefully we can just use our experience against her. She'll be going up
against some someone like a senior, Aleighsa Welch, which hopefully we can use
our experience against her youth and her athleticism.  
  
Q. Based on past experienced with Aleighsa, what type of performance are you
expecting from her tomorrow with her coming off a bad game?  
COACH STALEY: I mean, she's about winning. She's not about her own stats.
Because obviously we've got a team full of players, and you know, for her to
play like she did, she's not one that always fills the stat sheet. I think we
have to credit her for some of the intangibles that she brings to the game.  
So statistically, it wasn't, you know, where she normally is, but you have to
account for the intangibles. She had a tough defensive assignment where she
had to clog up the paint for us while the penetration; so I think we probably
wore her down a little bit to where she wasn't able to perform as she normally
does on the offensive end.  
But she'll be Aleighsa. She'll be Aleighsa tomorrow. She'll communicate.
She'll be our emotional leader, and along the lines, I think she'll be more of
an impact coming off; she'll have more of an impact offensively.  
  
Q. How do you balance pounding the ball inside with your guards taking open
shots when they get them, and were you happy with that ratio last night?  
COACH STALEY: I wasn't happy with it in the beginning of the game. I think we
have to be truly calculating at the beginning of the game and we have to let
our opponents know exactly what we are trying to do and make them defend that.
Because for our perimeter players, you know, the more times that we get the
ball inside, is going to lead to more open shots for them if we are
successful.  
The shots that we took early against North Carolina, are the same shots that
we can get at the end of a shot clock, and you keep North Carolina or an
opponent on defense for a little bit longer, especially when it becomes a
possession game. North Carolina wants a lot of possessions so if we are
shooting quickly, you play into their hands and they got off to an 8‑0 run
because of our quick shot.  
So we just have to be a little bit more patient and a little bit more
disciplined, and when we are, it puts us in great rebounding position. And
also puts our players in the position where they are taking practice shots,
not contesting shots, not rush shots. Calculating, expected shots so we can
put ourselves in a position to rebound and to get back in transition if we
can't come up with an offensive rebound.  
  
Q. What do you expect from Florida State: Will they zone you like everybody
else or because of their size will they matchup with you man ‑to‑man?  
COACH STALEY: We've seen 95 percent man. I think at this stage of the game
you're going to do what you've done all season long so I anticipate them
playing us man. They match up with us on the perimeter and in the post, I
don't see why they wouldn't play us as they have played all season long.  
  
Q. You had nine busloads of fans yesterday. Any word on how many busloads
you expect to make the trip tomorrow?  
COACH STALEY: As far as I know at the moment, nine, we'll probably be
returning, but I'm sure‑‑ I have to check my Twitter account to see if anybody
else is coming up or if we've got any more bus companies commit to bringing
our fans to Greensboro.  
But it was quite remarkable to see a caravan of buses coming to see us play
and the excitement that was outside of this arena before they were allowed to
come in the game, and then when they came in the game, and most of Gamecock
Nation was the lower bowl, and it truly got loud in there last night and gave
us the energy to get the win. I'm hoping we can double the attendance for
Sunday.

_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  
Q. Question for Maegan, yesterday was really the first game where you went
down completely to the wire after stomping through the first two rounds of the
tournament. As one of the senior leaders, how do you keep this team grounded
even when the game is going down to a one ‑point game?   
MAEGAN CONWRIGHT: One thing we really focus season is unit and something we've
been working on all year, and we haven't hit our peak in it yet. And I feel
like we did a really great job yesterday of staying together when things are
going down and not separating, and just communicating with each other.  
  
Q. Adut, for a while, came dangerously close to being the first team to out
‑rebound you since Notre Dame. What were you doing in the paint to make sure
that didn't happen and to keep the rebounding numbers as solid as they always
are?   
ADUT BULGAK: The coaches, I could hear them from the bench yelling, "Get
around the players." So we had more of our guards start boxing out and
crashing harder, and so that made it easier and opened the lanes for our post
to also get in the action of rebounding.  
  
Q. Adut and Ivey, obviously South Carolina is known for the depth and size
that they have inside. You guys have faced similar kind of tough teams. I
wonder if you can talk about what it's like going against South Carolina in
terms of having people they can rotate in on the interior.  
ADUT BULGAK: Well, first of all, we're‑‑ can you repeat the question?  
  
Q. South Carolina's size, they have got a lot of size and they have a lot of
people that they can rotate in on the inside. Can you talk about going against
that?  
ADUT BULGAK: Well, with their size I think we are going to look to our guards
to hassle the post when the ball gets in but I think our posts can also handle
that. We have played against players that were bigger than us this year, and I
think we're going to do a good job of just stick to go what we know and
playing good defense; and also with their rotations, just like us, we have a
deep bench but I think our match‑ups will be fine.  
  
Q. Has yesterday's 21 ‑point performance sunk in for you and how do you put
that in the back of your mind and get ready for South Carolina?   
LETICIA ROMERO: Well, we got the win. We forget about last night. Now we have
another game. I think what we have to think about, get ready for South
Carolina, it's going to be a tough game and just be ready. There's nothing
else that we will think about.  
  
Q. Maegan, to go through a close game and be tested as much as you guys
were, does it give you a sense of confidence knowing that you can survive a
battle like that going into what is probably going to be a pretty tough game
tomorrow?  
MAEGAN CONWRIGHT: Most definitely, it's always confidence when you're stepping
up and getting a tough win. Arizona State was a great team and their pressure
was phenomenal, so for us to get through that and stay together only makes us
improve on what we can do and how we will play towards South Carolina.  
  
Q. Brittany, you're a guard who is averaging maybe about two to three
offensive rebounds per game, against a team like South Carolina, how important
is it to have guards that can also rebound the ball in case the ball gets away
from the post players?  
BRITTANY BROWN: It's very important. Something that we always have been
stressing throughout this whole year that we've done so well is defending and
rebounding.  
Regardless of who our opponent is, that's what we want to do in every game
that we play, and just like you said, it's going to be huge because of how big
they are with their posts. We know how hard that our posts are going to work
inside, and for our guards to contribute a little bit of that, that takes some
pressure off of them.  
  
Q. For Maegan, how much have you gotten a chance to see Tiffany Mitchell for
South Carolina in terms of she's been the SEC Player of the Year the last two
years, but she's really improved in terms of shot selection and different
things. Wonder your thoughts on going against her tomorrow.  
MAEGAN CONWRIGHT: Yeah, it was funny because some of my teammates asked if I
ever played against her and I couldn't remember. But when she was a freshman,
I was a junior and I think that's when I got hurt so I never got to play
against her.  
So to see her and watch her, I still watch my teammates at Kentucky, and she's
a great player and I can't wait to play against her.  
  
Q. Adut, the fact that you guys have out ‑rebounded almost everybody you've
played this year, is that just a statistic or something you take particular
pride in? Are you checking the stats sheet after every game to make sure
you've upheld that? What does it mean for you guys?  
ADUT BULGAK: I'd say all of the above, actually, in some aspects. Like to us,
rebounding is very contagious for our team. I've had games where I'll have a
double‑double, and then Brittany will come around and then she'll have a
double‑double. It's like when somebody is rebounding well, you see the team is
rebounding well, it just trickles down and everybody wants to be a part of it.  
So it's become a big identity for our team, and yeah, we check ‑‑ we'll like
check the stat sheet to make sure that we have out‑rebounded everybody just
because it's such a main focus of our game.  
  
Q. A year ago at this time, a difficult time for you, and here you are one
game away from the Final Four. Can you even put that in perspective of what
this 12 months has been like for you?  
LETICIA ROMERO: Well, it's just a blessing to be able to play this year. I
never thought I was going to be able to play. And with this team, I have told
them so many times that at the beginning of the season, whenever we start
having games and I was on the bench, I wish I could have played because how
much fun you see they have on the court, and that is translated into success.
That is I think the key for us to be where we are right now.  
  
Q. Kentucky is one of the one teams to beat South Carolina this year. Is
there anybody up there that you can maybe reach out to for a last ‑minute
pointer or two?   
MAEGAN CONWRIGHT: Yeah, I can, but our coaches have done such a great job of
looking at what we need to work on towards winning versus South Carolina and
some similar things that we will take from Kentucky. We watched film this
morning, and it was really cool to see them beat South Carolina and we are
looking to do the same.  
  
Q. This is just the second time Florida State has made it this far. One or
the other team, either Florida State or South Carolina is going to be a first
‑timer in the Final Four. What does that mean to you to be a part of that in
the one season you're able to play here?   
MAEGAN CONWRIGHT: It's such a blessing, you know, leaving Kentucky and not
knowing where I was going to go and then Coach Sue taking a chance with me,
with a lot of coaches that didn't; as far as me turning my ACL, they didn't
know what I was going to bring to the table.  
To be able to come here and do this for Coach Sue, I couldn't be any happier
to be able to be in this position to get to the Final Four. And to be in a
region where nobody has done it before; so up for grabs, it just gives us the
rest of us confidence that we can do it and we are not going to back down.  
  
Q. You've been in this situation before, getting ready to go up against the
number one seed in the region to go to the Final Four. Is there any
familiarity compared to 2010 when you were matched up against UCONN?  
COACH SEMRAU: I think people think of the Final Four as a destiny, and I
don't‑‑ this team doesn't see that. This is a game and this is‑‑ so I really
look at it very similar that it's a great team that we are getting ready to
face. And if we put too much emphasis on the destination, then we are not
going to be prepared for the next thing. And I think it's really important
that we keep our mind on our business.  
  
Q. Could you talk about a little bit of the difficulty that South Carolina
presents in terms of their size and their depth on their bench?  
COACH SEMRAU: I could talk a long time about the difficulty that they present.
Talk about size; talk about speed; strength; depth; their ability to defend;
to feel; their guard play is tremendous. They are such a well‑rounded team,
and obviously very deserving of a No.1 seed.  
So there's a lot of things I could talk about. They are a great, great
basketball team.  
  
Q. Kind of like what I asked Maegan, as a coach, are you happy to see that
you had to go through a test like you did last night before going up against a
team of South Carolina's calibre, as opposed to if last night had gone similar
to the first two games?  
COACH SEMRAU: I'm happy now. Last night was a battle, and I mean, it's
definitely‑‑ I think any time that you battle and face adversity, you get
stronger. Fortunately we were able to be a point ahead when the buzzer went
off and so I think absolutely, it strengthens us as a team.  
  
Q. I think Coach Hatchell mentioned last night that South Carolina's role
players ‑‑ just one after the other in the game. Can you think of a team
that's comparable depth‑wise that you've played this year? I know you've seen
some good teams in the ACC but anything at all that is comparable to it?   
COACH SEMRAU: I wouldn't call their bench players role players. I think that
everybody plays an extremely important role.  
I would liken them in size to Duke in our conference. There's great size. So
we have seen that throughout conference play. But yeah, I think it's probably
the only one I can think of right off the top of my head.  
  
Q. Can you put in perspective with Leti, she sort of just hit the ground
running and I know she played a lot overseas with the junior team and then the
national team. But still, the fact that she has made the adjustment really so
quickly with this group, can you kind of put that in perspective?  
COACH SEMRAU: I was shaking my head when you asked her that question, because
I haven't even thought that, you know, what, 12 months ago, that she was going
through the process of transfer; and for her to be in this situation just
shows the maturity and resiliency that she has.  
She's got a tremendous family. They stayed up Spain time last night watching
it on ESPN. They are flying here to see her one way or another this week, and
I tell you, she's remarkable.  
  
Q. A couple times, you've asked her to let the ball fly a little more and
shoot a little more; was last night the game you've been waiting for from her
this season?  
COACH SEMRAU: It came down to, shots weren't coming easy for anyone. And even
the ball reversal and getting the ball into operational areas wasn't easy.  
And so Leti knew that it was a role that she needed to take in order for us to
win, and that's when she is at her best scoring‑wise is when she knows she's
needed. She loves to get other people involved, and I think that's really the
heart of a true point guard. I think it just shows what she's capable of last
night.  
  
Q. Obviously nobody on your roster was in the Elite 8 the last time you were
here, but for you personally as a coach, was there anything of that experience
‑‑ taught you anything that you can glean that you can apply to tomorrow?  
COACH SEMRAU: What's so cool is we had so many alumni come back to our first
and second rounds who were in that Elite 8 game and were in Sweet16s, and they
spoke a lot to our players about that time. The thing they talked about was
family, and the thing they talked about was the people. And I think that's
what it's about.  
Regardless, throughout the course of time, I think that that's what basketball
really is all about. It's great to win, but the people you do it with are more
important.  
  
Q. You went against Jewell Loyd, ACC Player of the Year, three times this
year. Tiffany Mitchell is the two ‑time SEC Player of the Year. Can you see
some comparisons and how does facing Jewell maybe help in terms of preparing
for Tiffany?  
COACH SEMRAU: Yeah, I think they are two different players, but two excellent
players. You even mentioned shot selection, and I think both of them have an
incredible knack for knowing what their team needs when. Both are extremely
efficient when they shoot the ball.  
I think that the post game for Tiffany depth‑wise ask size‑wise, maybe gives
her the ability to do a little less offensively or maybe puts a little less
pressure on her than Jewell has. And both of them are great defenders, as
well.  
  
Q. South Carolina coach is predicting nine busloads of fans coming up to see
them ‑‑  
COACH SEMRAU: Cool.  
  
Q. ‑‑ this could be Florida State's first truly hostile environment in this
tournament. How do you prepare your team for that?   
COACH SEMRAU: They will be wearing garnet, I think. It's great. The more
people, the better for our team. I think it's fantastic what South Carolina
has done with their fan base. They are not too far away from here, so the fact
that they are going to jump on buses; I know that if we were in Jacksonville,
the same thing would be happening for Tallahassee, so I think it's fantastic.  
  
Q. Both teams take so much pride in rebounding. How much physical do you
expect tomorrow's game to be?  
COACH SEMRAU: Probably as physical as it was last night. We felt like last
night was extremely physical. And we don't mind that. I think that is all
about work and both teams love to work. That's a stat I think that shows when
teams have a lot of effort and work, that's what stands out.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S REGIONALS SEMIFINALS & FINALS:
GREENSBORO](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+REGIONALS+SEMIFINALS+%26+FINALS%3A+GREENSBORO)

  

## March 27, 2015

  

### [Charli Turner Thorne](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24830)

  
_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

FLORIDA STATE  66  
ARIZONA STATE - 65

  
COACH TURNER THORNE: Just like to thank the NCAA and Leslie and Sybil and the
Selection Committee for everything, we know how hard you guys work to put this
tournament on and we really appreciate it, and the people of Greensboro thank
you so much for your hospitality.  
I just want to say this has been one of my most fun seasons ever in coaching,
because this team is so tough, and so fun to coach, and no drama and no
selfishness. We needed to play a little better basketball today.
Uncharacteristic turnovers for us. Kind of hard to advance to the Elite 8 with
that kind of possessions.  
If we hung around on the boards, we'd be okay, but we never anticipated the
turnovers. So just want to‑‑ hats off to Florida State, who does an amazing
job. They have a great team, and you know, we wish them the best.  
  
Q. Could you walk me through the ‑‑ you got the ball to Peace, did it slip
out of her hands or what happened there?   
COACH TURNER THORNE: We have a four‑second play, where we up‑screen. And she
actually had Kelsey open down the court. She's a first‑year player. I'm not
even exactly sure she knew what she was looking for. We didn't have a
time‑out.  
Probably would of rather had Lewy (ph) get the ball first in her hands. But
you know, she went with it aggressively which is also part of what we would
like her to do, and you know what, she looked at the clock and then she slowed
up and allowed them to poke the ball out. And obviously, probably don't want
to do that in that situation. Probably just keep going and get the shot to the
rim.  
But you know, we practiced for end‑of‑game situations usually pretty good, and
when we had our break after our Pac‑12 tournament, we really went through
these situations again and tried to get sharp. That was some really tough
calls on Promise; the fact that our one senior wasn't in the game down the
stretch really hurt us, so we had a first‑year player and we didn't quite
execute the play.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about Romero and her impact on game?  
COACH TURNER THORNE: Yeah, she had a great game. We definitely‑‑ if Promise
wasn't in foul trouble; when somebody gets hot against us, we put Promise on
them, Nigerian nightmare, and they don't have a good game. She got some tough
calls and she was in foul trouble the entire game. We actually put her on her
for a little bit in the second half and then she still just had three.  
But disappointing because she was hurting us, and we weren't doing a good job.
Lewy (ph) and Peace weren't doing a good job guarding her, so I think Promise
could have gotten over those screens and gotten her space and not allowed her
to create so much. We wanted to play her right hand. We didn't want to leave
her wide open driving left. We just didn't play‑‑ she did a great job. She's a
very talented player and she really stepped up, and would have liked to have
had our best defender on her but didn't work out.  
  
Q. The run they went on at the end of the first half, you've been in those
kind of deficits before but how much was that a factor in terms of trying to
come back from being down by 11?  
COACH TURNER THORNE: Well, it was really disappointing because we just sort of
gave them the ball. Again, very uncharacteristic of us and lack of discipline.
It's a young team and first time in this situation and I think we didn't have
as much poise‑‑ the poise that we normally have. The turnovers were‑‑ you
can't set up your defense, right.  
I mean, it was just‑‑ we felt fine at halftime because we knew we gave it to
them; that their halfcourt defense held them to probably 15 points in the
first half and we just needed to start taking care of the ball. That happened.
We tied it up. We had the game that we wanted and we just needed to, again,
credit Florida State. We needed to get our stops down the stretch, and Katie
got hot, which was great. We were confident going to Sophie. We just had‑‑
even just off that free throw rebound, to give up a layup, that was just
something that‑‑ yeah, disappointing for our defensive mentality.  
THE MODERATOR: Katie Hempen had an excellent game. Can you talk about her
performance?  
COACH TURNER THORNE: Well, Katie's been‑‑ she's obviously one of our best
shooters, and she's always clutch down the stretch. I thought she absolutely
put us in a position to win the game, like she does‑‑ like she has on many
occasions this year. We just need a better end‑of‑the‑game defense.

### [Sue Semrau](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24768)

  
_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

FLORIDA STATE  66  
ARIZONA STATE - 65

  
COACH SEMRAU: Credit Arizona State. Their defense was tough as nails, and we
knew it because going to be. We knew it was going to be a physical game.
Credit our kids for hanging in at the end. I'm really happy we got some
separations to end the half. I know they are a second‑half team and they had a
great second half.  
  
Q. By my count, down the stretch, three times they got it to a single
‑possession game, and each time you hit a shot in response to that. Can you
explain what it is about you that you rose to that occasion?   
LETICIA ROMERO: Well, when it comes to those kind of moments, and at end of
the game, just don't think. You just want to help your team to win the game,
you know. And you know, all those games that we have had, it has always been
somebody different.  
Today was me shooting the last shot, and I'm sure tomorrow we're going to have
a lot of response (ph), I don't know, just having a team like this, you just
play, and it's just easy.  
  
Q. The last time you guys were in this building, it obviously was not very
friendly to you. You lost to Notre Dame. But describe what it's like to come
back here to an arena that's familiar, a city that's familiar in ACC
territory; do you feel like that contributed to your success?  
STUDENT‑ATHLETE: I mean, last time we came here, we lost to Notre Dame, but
you learn a lot from losses. Coming in now, we learned a lot. Notre Dame is a
team that wins championships, and you know, we are trying to learn how get
through winning games and we want to learn how to win championships.  
Now we know what not to do and we feel better prepared coming in now, because
them stepping up like that, and us being in a region where nobody in this
region has got to the Final Four in such a long time, it's up for grabs. We're
preparing to just, you know, go out and do‑‑ learn from our loss last time and
be better this time.  
  
Q. For Maegan, could you walk through what happened the last four seconds of
the game?  
MAEGAN CONWRIGHT: It's so funny, because my team makes fun of me because I do
this defensive move a lot, and I mean, I didn't really think‑‑ I know that I
was recruited for defense and defense is my strong suit. So when I was looking
at her, and I felt like I could go get the steal, so I just did. I don't know,
I wasn't even thinking.  
COACH SEMRAU: It was awesome being back here in Greensboro. It's been a home
away from home for Florida State, for the ACC, to see all the familiar faces,
it was awesome.  
  
Q. For Maegan, just the resolve she showed to make that play at the end of
the game, especially after a tough sequence, for a fifth ‑year senior to make
that, how neat was that for you to see?   
COACH SEMRAU: I think it was her teammates. At that time‑out, her teammates
just rallied around her after she had missed that shot. I think that's the
thing that gave her the kind of confidence that she needed to make that play.

_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

SOUTH CAROLINA  67  
NORTH CAROLINA - 65

  
THE MODERATOR: Just an opening statement, please.  
COACH HATCHELL: Well, you're looking at three warriors up here. I'm so proud
of my team and these kids for the way that they hung together, the way they
fought. The team chemistry and camaraderie that these kids have, it's what
it's all about. You don't have to, I guess, move to the Elite 8 to be
champions, and these kids are champions, because there's a lot of people that
didn't even give us a chance.  
I read some articles saying that South Carolina, just go ahead and take today
off because it was in the bag, and stuff like that. But you know, these kids
fought hard. It could have easily‑‑ we could have made that shot at the end or
shot this, that, the shot in the corner that went in the corner that bounced
around and went in for them, different things like that happen. But if anybody
knows, I know life's not fair. Things happen.  
But you have to be warriors and overcome them. I told them just because it was
a trip to the Elite 8 or Final Four was delayed‑‑ it wasn't denied; it was
delayed. So we've got a great group coming in next year, a couple McDonald's
All‑Americans, and the best player in Canada. And we've got a great group
returning. It's amazing how they have improved over the year and the
adjustments that we have to make whenever Xylina went out and some different
things like that.  
I'm so proud of these kids for how they competed and how they fought but more
than anything else, the chemistry that they have as a team. It is something
really, really special and a lot of teams nowadays don't have that. But these
kids had it, and you could feel it, and that's why I wanted to win so much for
them. But I'm so proud of them.  
South Carolina has a great team. They are absolutely loaded with players. They
just keep putting them in and a lot of those kids sitting over there would be
starting at a lot of other places, but they just keep putting them in, keep
putting them in. They are a great team but I thought we were a great team
tonight, too. We wish them well and I'm sure we'll probably see each other
again down the road.  
But I thought my kids were well prepared and they played their hearts out and
I couldn't be any more proud of them.  
  
Q. Is this about as physical a game as you've played in college as far as
the teams going at each other, and how do you think you handled it?  
STEPHANIE MAVUNGA: Not at all. I think that we played so much more physical
teams. I think that the refs kind of let us play a lot. But then again, there
were some really sketchy (ph) calls in there. I feel like sometimes they were
trying to make up for a lot of calls and I've never been one to blame anything
on refs. But I feel as if sometimes we had a lot of makeup calls. But I think
that we both played hard but I don't say it's the most physical game or
anything.  
Some battles with Dukes, some battles with Louisville and Notre Dame, we've
had some really tough games, with just a lot of people; Miami, a bunch of
people that I think are tougher than they are. But I think that we did a good
job of handling it.  
I think that we shot away from Carolina basketball a few plays which would
have made up for that, and I feel like every possession counted today. And you
know, one more possession, it's a different ballgame, it's a different team
cheering. And so, that's how I feel about that.  
  
Q. How much did this game mean to you personally and how do you think your
team's effort was tonight overall?  
LATIFAH COLEMAN: Personally it meant a lot. Possibly it could be my last game
and it was. I felt like my team fought hard. We all fought hard. Just didn't
go our way.  
  
Q. You guys were up I guess three with like two minutes left and just seemed
like a rebound away or a basket away from maybe being able to put more
pressure on them. What was the difference in maybe not being able to get that
one more play, get that one more stop?  
STEPHANIE MAVUNGA: What was the difference? I guess, I think with a minute 30
seconds left, I think if we would have secured that rebound, then it's a whole
different ballgame. They would have had to foul us.  
But then I think there were some turnovers down the stretch that were really
key. Some for myself; I think every one of my three turnovers were actually
really key. I just feel as if whoever scored from that point was the one that
was going to win but it was going to be about who wanted it more.  
And I don't necessarily think that they wanted it more than we did, but like I
said, like taking one play off, it really matters and maybe we weren't as set
up as we should have been. I mean, that shot that went up from the corner that
bounced up and down and any which way it could have and went in, you don't see
that every day. I mean, the game was going any which way.  
An extra possession, like I said, would have changed the whole ballgame. And
of course we had the shot at the end by Jamie Cherry; of course, I personally
I feel as if she got fouled, but of course the referee is not going to call
that in such a tight game and let it be decided by free throws.  
  
Q. The first couple minutes, you had six quick points. What did they change
defensively to shut you down the rest of the game?  
STEPHANIE MAVUNGA: Oh, double and triple teams. I think that they quickly
figured out that if they were going to get any single coverage, it was going
to be ‑‑ it was going to be a long game for them.  
And I really feel as if whenever I saw the single coverage, like I said last
time, when it's single coverage, that's sort of exactly what it is I like to
do. I feel as if my coaches and my teammates have done a good job of telling
me that I can go with anybody in the state as long as it's single coverage,
then I'm going to score the ball. And I think that they have a lot of faith in
me to do that and I think that they have really been instilling confidence in
me.  
And so when the double and triple teams came, that was a whole different look.
I mean, it's harder to score with three people or two people than it is one,
and so I think that they changed that quickly, and they really figured it out.
They came out and I think that‑‑ I did a good job of finding some of my
teammate at times, of course, but then again, I had some turnovers, I had some
turnovers out of the double, triple team, but it is what it is.  
  
Q. Were you surprised how ‑‑ (inaudible)?  
ALLISHA GRAY: No, we weren't surprised at all, because, you know, we are an
aggressive team. When the lane is open like we are used to, we just drive all
the time. So, no, we weren't surprised at all.  
LATIFAH COLEMAN: We run a lot of movement and motion stuff so we could attack
the basket and it worked for us.  
  
Q. What do you think of your team's overall accomplishments in your senior
year?  
LATIFAH COLEMAN: Like Coach Hatchell said, a lot of people didn't think we
would be where we were today. I'm just very proud to be a part of this team
and I'm blessed for the experience. I feel like we had a good year.  
  
Q. For each of you, you guys were up three going into that Final minute.
What was your reaction to seeing that ball bounce around and go in to tie the
game?  
STEPHANIE MAVUNGA: My reaction, of course, I'm like, okay, we're still in the
game. There's still a minute left the clock. But then again, like I said,
should shot doesn't happen every single day. I mean, it's not every day that
everyone gets a shot that's going to bounce around and come in.  
I mean, like I said we still had a minute on the clock and it wasn't over.
Then we still had a defensive stop to make, we still had points to score. So
looking up and seeing the shot go in, I'm like, okay, we need to score, get a
stop, score, get a stop.  
ALLISHA GRAY: I agree with Steph, what she said. Even though she made the
shot, we still was in the game.  
LATIFAH COLEMAN: My reaction was next play, like what do you do next; it's not
over yet.  
  
Q. How would you compare this to last year's Sweet16 matchup?  
STEPHANIE MAVUNGA: I still think that we're a great team. I still think that
we're the better team. I just feel as if, like I said, if there was just one
possession here or there and it would have been a different team celebrating.  
I think that last year we did a good job of keying in towards the last minutes
and really focusing in and playing Carolina basketball: You know, playing
hard, playing smart, playing together, and really just focusing in and not
taking plays off and not really panicking and being frantic.  
I think that today, we did the same things. I just think we didn't really key
in every single possession like we should have. Like I said, a turnover less,
a rebound more, a free throw more, and we would have‑‑ we would have been the
team celebrating tonight.  
  
Q. Seemed like you guys were a play, a rebound, a shot away from getting
strong control down the stretch. Why do you think it wasn't something you
could quite get ahold of?  
COACH HATCHELL: Well, you know, several things happened. I had a view on the
side whenever they called Latifah out‑of‑bounds, she got knocked
out‑of‑bounds, but they got the ball back, that was crucial. You know, the
ball going in like that; just a rebound here or there; Stephanie fouling out
that last minute and some seconds. You know, we ran a couple things.  
Jessica is a really good shooter. We actually were running some things to get
some of those shots or to actually get the drives, too, because we were
getting‑‑ we were able to turn the corner and take it in there pretty good but
their big girls had been blocking shots and all that.  
So actually one time I had four guards in there, I had four shooters in there.
But anyway, could have gone our way easily, a shot here or there; or the ball
bounced around and not gone in. I thought one time we got the rebound started
out, and all of a sudden the whistling blows and there's a foul called on us.  
So there's several things like that. But, hey, I've been doing this a long
time. That's a part of it.  
But I know y'all are asking questions, but I want to say this because I was
sitting here thinking while the girls were talking. I think this game says a
lot for the ACC Women's Basketball, because, you know, we were, what, fifth
seed coming into our tournament. We had a chance to win this game. I just
don't think people realize how great ACC Women's Basketball is. We had eight
teams that made the Tournament, and we really have some unbelievable teams in
this conference.  
So I think, I'm hoping this game made a statement to a lot of people that the
ACC deserves more respect than it's getting, because it's great, it really is
great. I see Matt in the back, great job, Greensboro Coliseum people,
incredible job, thank you so much.  
  
Q. You were talking about the ACC. Just in general, seemed like a great
atmosphere tonight. Can you talk about that?  
COACH HATCHELL: Oh, yeah, sure, it was. I tell people all the time; our
tournament, nobody in the country anywhere close to the tournament we have
here, because Greensboro does a tremendous job and the ACC Conference is here.
Almost every game is like this and they just do a tremendous job.  
But I thought our conference prepared us; the competition that we had in our
conference this year prepared us so well for this game because almost every
game in our conference is like this.  
So hopefully our conference earned some respect because like I said, we didn't
play that much better. We've been playing like this all year, but we've got
some doggone good teams in our league.  
  
Q. What did South Carolina do to hinder the ball movement?  
COACH HATCHELL: Well, we had a lot of drives. So there wasn't a whole lot of
passing because we were able to drive to the basket. So we didn't have to pass
it off for people to shoot because we were able to take it to the basket, so I
think that's a lot of it.  
Now, did we make all those? No. Did their size make a difference at times?
Probably so. But we turned a corner every time we wanted to.  
  
Q. You accomplished a lot during the year and played right to the wire with
one of the teams that was top two or three all year. Is it going to be hard to
look back and wonder after zeal even a's injury what could have been with this
group?  
COACH HATCHELL: Well, you know, I mean, after she was out, you know, I thought
about it, but we don't talk about it that much. I just tried to put her into a
role of leadership with these younger kids, talking to them and encouraging
them and everything like that.  
I think being her and everything will motivate her tremendously. Her presence
tonight made a difference without a doubt, without a doubt. I thought N'Dea
and Danielle did a good job but they don't have the bulk that Xylina has. And,
you talk about fired up to play South Carolina; I mean, she was begging the
doctors the other night in the locker room to let her play, but she's not
ready yet. You know, she would have made a difference probably but I'm not
going to make any excuses.  
But those other kids, they stepped up and did a great job. I'm so proud of
them because a lot of people didn't think we would be able to do what we've
done but just shows when you work hard and you've got a bunch of great kids ‑‑
and chemistry is incredible on this team. That's so important to winning, just
the environment and atmosphere and chemistry and all that, and these kids have
got it. So that's what makes it hard to lose because they wanted to keep
playing.  
I felt like if we could get by this, then the next game, we know how tough
Florida State is but we beat Florida State in the regular season. So we have a
pretty good game plan. My coaches did a great job with the game plan for this
game and they put some tremendous scouting reports together. Because we've
been the underdog in several games that we pulled out this year, and so got to
give a shout‑out to my coaching staff. They just do a tremendous job.  
But, hey, we'll start working and get ready for next year and hopefully make
another run.  
  
Q. What did you tell your team in that last time ‑out with four seconds or
so after they made the layup and what was the exact game plan for that final
shot?   
COACH HATCHELL: Yeah, well, that was going to get it in Jamie's hands and
actually we didn't have any bigs in there but we told Brittany to set her a
screen because if Jamie has any daylight, she can make that.  
Usually you have like one dribble for every second, and so we were going to go
for the win, not the tie. I wanted to go for a three. We weren't going for the
tie. So I was wanting Jaime‑‑ and she did that‑‑ she's done that two or three
times this year but we didn't get the screen set for her there. She hesitated
because I think she was trying to draw the foul, but they are not going to
call a foul unless you throw them up in the bleachers on a situation like
that. But I think she hesitated to try to draw the ball, but it didn't happen
like that. But Jamie is very good at that. She's, like I said, done it several
times this year. You know, you gamble; sometimes it works, sometimes it
doesn't.

_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

SOUTH CAROLINA  67  
NORTH CAROLINA - 65

  
COACH STALEY: We're just truly excited to still be in the NCAA Tournament and
moving to the Elite 8. It was a great game by both teams. We do take our hat
off to North Carolina. I know it's a shame that someone had to lose a game but
we're glad it's not us. We got great contributions, especially from the three
players that are sitting next to me to my left. We're just excited about
continuing to be able to play.  
  
Q. Olivia, have you ever shot a three ‑pointer that kind of nicked the
backboard, hit the rim and still went in? And Tiffany what was your mind‑set
on the final drive?   
OLIVIA GAINES: Three, well, I never shot a three ‑‑ well, I never shot a three
that was for that moment, but I was just ready when my number was called like
always and I just knocked it down.  
TIFFANY MITCHELL: I think Coach Staley drew up a play kind to just run the
clock down and to take the last shot. I think I kind of shot too early because
they still had another possession. I just think we made the well (ph) in last
possession. Ijust saw how the defense was playing and just drove it to the
basket.  
  
Q. This was a game with a lot of lead changes and runs. How tough was this
one emotionally throughout the game for you guys?  
TIFFANY MITCHELL: I don't think it was ‑‑ I mean, it was kind of emotional,
but we just stayed the course and kept our head. We knew North Carolina was
going to give us their best punch and we knew they had runs in them. We just
had to answer them and keep our head.  
ALAINA COATES: I just think that to piggyback off of Tiffany, we kept a level
head and made sure we executed and did what we needed to do.  
OLIVIA GAINES: I just think we executed the game plan and we came out to win.  
  
Q. You seemed to have a really special drive tonight, 18 points, ten
rebounds but you were ten of ten from the free throw line; is that the thing
you were most proud of?  
ALAINA COATES: I do take pride in free throws. We are a team that's trying to
do better with that, and just being that I was able to go a 100 percent from
the line; that's a good feeling just knowing that I was able to stay in my
rhythm and knock down the shots. They ended up working out for our team and
when we needed them.  
  
Q. What does it mean to finally get over that hurdle and be one of the final
eight teams standing?  
TIFFANY MITCHELL: It means a lot just because North Carolina ended our season
last year. We talked about not repeating history in that manner and them
beating us again and just making history and just making it to the Elite 8,
which we did this time.  
  
Q. You were saying you tried to stay the course and focus on what you were
doing, but was it hard not to get a little bit tense or nervous considering it
was 90 seconds and you're down three and very close?  
TIFFANY MITCHELL: Just a little just because of how the game was going back
and forth, but Coach Staley calmed us down and I think we just executed when
we needed to.  
  
Q. Were you trying to pick up a foul with that shot? And do you think that
was the ‑‑  
OLIVIA GAINES: Yes, it may have been one of biggest shots of my career. And I
wasn't trying to pick up the foul. Somehow she fouled me but we just got the
points and (inaudible‑coughing) was set.  
  
Q. Were there nerves at the start? With that racket at the beginning of the
game, can you talk about what it took to get you guys going?  
TIFFANY MITCHELL: I mean, North Carolina came out pretty aggressive. I think
we came out slow. She just told us to kind of take a deep breath and let the
game settle down some and then we were going to be good, and I think that's
what happened. We got in a rhythm and it was good from there on.  
  
Q. Seemed like you were maybe aggressive and I think you had a calf injury.
How did that affect you?  
ALAINA COATES: It didn't affect me. It was a cramp, after training, I massaged
it and I was good to go. It wasn't hurting or anything like that. Just kind of
was a little lull in the game, but besides that it was fine.  
  
Q. You guys held Mavunga to 12 from the field and Gray to three; how big of
an emphasis did you put on ‑‑ obviously you were double‑teaming, but how big
of an emphasis did you put on limiting those players?   
TIFFANY MITCHELL: We made a huge emphasis on trying to take those two out of
the game. North Carolina, a lot of stuff runs through those two players, so we
knew we they were going to get a lot of touches. So we knew if we could limit
their touches, North Carolina was going to have a hard time putting points on
the board.  
ALAINA COATES: We just put a lot of emphasis on them, especially with Mavunga
and the game she had against Ohio State. We knew if we let her keep going, she
was going to keep going and we had to nip that in the bud real quick.  
Same thing with Gray. We know they have got their key players and it's hard
for the rest of the team to revolve around difficulty. So we just made sure we
made it hard for them to be able to do such a thing.  
OLIVIA GAINES: What she said. We just tried to eliminate Mavunga's touches and
keep Gray off the three‑point line, and I think we did a good job of that.  
  
Q. For most teams playing in a game just 45 minutes away from the opponent's
campus, you might thinkthat might be a road atmosphere, but didn't seem to be
the case. Did you notice how much fan support you had tonight and what did you
think about that?  
TIFFANY MITCHELL: We knew coming in we were going to have a lot of fan
support. It's not that far from Columbia, so we knew they were taking buses
and bringing probably, what, six bus loads of fans‑‑ nine? Nine bus loads. So
we knew it was going to be a lot of fans and we were going to see a lot of
garnet in the stands, just going to try to give us as much home‑court
advantage as possible, even though North Carolina was so close to home.  
ALAINA COATES: Just piggybacking off what Tiffany said, we were pretty much
aware of how many busloads of people we had. We just wasn't expecting, you
know, that great of a number, you know, nine busloads. You don't really know.  
But we just really appreciate Gamecock Nation and just the fact that they have
our backs and they followed us all the way out here to Greensboro.  
OLIVIA GAINES: Fan support means a lot. They always have our back and I'm glad
they came tonight.  
  
Q. Piggybacking off of that, to get the win over North Carolina in North
Carolina ‑‑  
TIFFANY MITCHELL: It means a lot. They ended our season last year, so being
that it's a huge win that we get to go on to the Elite 8, and I think it's
even better and a program win for us, being that we lost the past few times we
played them.  
  
Q. During the time ‑out before the winning basket, can you talk about what
you wanted to get in that play? And was Olivia in the play for defensive
purposes? Was the clock running out or did she take it on her own?   
COACH STALEY: In that time‑out, we knew we had one time‑out left. So we made
it very apparent that, you know, we had that just in case they denied us the
ball. What we wanted to accomplish was a play that we had run a lot at the end
of the game, and it's a play that we run our ball screen into a screen for our
shooter or our post entry.  
We wanted the ball in Tiffany Mitchell's hands, and we thought Tina Roy did a
great job of just running our basketball team so she was the one that was
going to initiate it. We tried to get her to delay it to where we took the
last shot, and Tiffany probably went a little bit sooner than we wanted her
to; but if anybody get a basket, we'll take the basket and rely on our
defense.  
And then Olivia was in the game for energy. Obviously she does a really good
job at defending, but she also does a great job of just spotting up and being
ready to shoot the ball and she doesn't second guess it.  
Thankfully as we were walking in, I didn't know if she heard me when she was
in front of our bench before she took that three. I just told her to be ready
to shoot the ball. Being ready to shoot the ball for O means shoot the ball.
She shot the ball. (Laughter).  
It was getting down there, probably around ten seconds, so it was time for us
to take a smooth shot within the flow of things. But our first look was to get
the ball inside.  
  
Q. Tina Roy had a lot of big buckets.  
COACH STALEY: She was huge. I thought she ran our team extremely well. It's
something that she has done for us for many years, and I thought she did not
take as many shots as I would have liked her to take because she got in the
flow of, you know, being the point guard and running our team. For us, she's
one that can stretch the defense out and I just thought she should have been a
little bit more aggressive, like she was in the second half.  
But thankfully she made some shots when we needed to make the shots, and
that's what you want. You want to call on the senior in those situations, and
you know they have been through a lot in our program, and I was happy she just
came through and always stayed ready.  
  
Q. Can you just speak to your confidence in Tiffany in a situation like that
and the way she could execute and make it look effortless in the process?  
COACH STALEY: Any time that the game is on the line, Tiffany Mitchell will be
around the ball. If she doesn't have the ball in her hands, if she's not a
decoy of some sort, she is going to be involved in the play. We knew that. She
can create her own shot at any time, so we drew up the play to put the ball in
her hands and for her to, you know, put the "S" on her chest and be our
Superwoman.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the contribution that Alaina made tonight to help you
get to the Elite 8 and how nerve ‑wracking were those Final minutes for you
personally?   
COACH STALEY: You know, she's been big for us all season long, and we
understand, any time she has big games for us, we usually win the basketball
game. And we wanted to make a concerted effort to get her the ball, because I
believe she made a matchup‑‑ she gave us a matchup advantage against North
Carolina.  
You know, the end of the game, it is nerve‑wracking because you don't want
your season to end. But I thought our team was really resilient. I thought
there was a certain calm over the game where we weren't‑‑ we were poised and
we didn't feel that the moment, in a way that we got too high emotionally. I
thought we just stuck with things. When you're able to stick with things and
stay poised, you're able to see a lot of options out there on the floor and
things don't get cloudy.  
  
Q. Talk about the atmosphere and how amazing that was from your vantage
point.  
COACH STALEY: Gamecock Nation has truly been a blessing for our program.
Gamecock Club does a tremendous job any time that we're at home or on the
road. They figure out a way to bring more people into the games. You know, we
don't win this game if we didn't have our fans creating that home‑court
advantage, giving us the extra energy that we needed to finish the game,
allowing us to feel the presence of their energy. We can't thank them enough
and we just hope that they show up in droves on Sunday afternoon.  
  
Q. Obviously it's big because of how the season ended last year; but do you
think you can play anybody as physical as North Carolina down the road?  
COACH STALEY: Our potential opponents, Arizona State and Florida State, I
think they can play very similar, both of them. And I think for us, it's good
that we saw the physicality of this type of game and we were able to have some
success. Probably a little bit too close for my comfort. But at this point of
the season, you just want to survive and advance, and that's what our team put
ourselves in a position to do.  
  
Q. Free throw shooting, ten of ten at the line, to have a post player as big
and physical as she is, but as focused and talented enough to convert at the
free throw line as well, how much of a luxury is that?  
COACH STALEY: That's a huge luxury. I was looking at our stats earlier today
and I saw that she was shooting 70 percent. She's probably got a big boost
from shooting ten for ten tonight. But she's got a soft touch. We've been
trying to get her to shoot those outside shots, those high post shots all
season long.  
Obviously she's very good at it and she's able to get a little nerve to shoot
it during the game, I think she can be someone that can shut the floor out and
protect what she's able to do in the paint.  
  
Q. You played Olivia Gaines a lot in this tournament, how special is it for
her to hit that shot after earning this time?  
COACH STALEY: Again, I'm truly happy for Olivia. Olivia has been a player in
our program that deserves to play more; that deserves to get a lot more
minutes than we have been able to give her.  
But it's a true testament to the type of person she is to be able to
sacrifice; to be able to sit and wait until your number is called and have the
nerve, the energy and the execution to make plays every single time that we
call on her number.  
You know, I don't think she gets credit enough. She does get credit when she's
able to make plays for us, but I think the credit comes in her ability to be
ready; to when she's not‑‑ when her number's not called and she's just waiting
and she's cheering and in sports, you don't have that very often when you have
players who are as good as everybody but doesn't get as many reps as they
deserve.  
Obviously Olivia deserves a lot of credit for what she was able to help us do
tonight.  
  
Q. Her teammates say Mitchell is a gym rat and how hard she works by
herself. Can you talk about that and how she's improved?  
COACH STALEY: Tiffany Mitchell is a two‑time SEC Player of the Year, one that
she got in her sophomore year, which is unheard of, playing in our league. But
when you see what she's been able to do from year one until year three, the
work that she's put in; I think in her first year, she was just attacking the
basket. She very rarely shot threes or pull‑ups.  
Then she started working on‑‑ she changed her shot between her freshman and
sophomore year to where she got under it a little bit more. She got in the gym
and worked before and after practice and in the off‑season.  
If there is a blueprint for becoming an All‑American, I think she sets the
stage for having the outline for how you become great at your sport. And it is
sacrifice; it is figuring that‑‑ she was at least a 3.8 student, so she does
her work so she can get in the gym and work. When you're as balanced and
driven as someone like Tiffany Mitchell, you're going to be successful.

_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  
Q. Probably not much has changed since yesterday, but what did you see from
film on North Carolina, what did they do different from last time you faced
them and what do you think you'll have to watch out for?  
COACH STALEY: They played the same style of play that they have played for
years, and you know, they get up‑and‑down the floor. They like to play in
transition, they like to speed the game up and they like a lot of possessions.  
For us, I think we just need to be calculating in our approach to the game,
which is run when we have the opportunity and when we don't, we've got to play
halfcourt basketball and pound the ball inside.  
  
Q. Sylvia has been successful pulling players out of the State of South
Carolina. When you were first building this program, how much did you find
yourself going against her trying to win recruiting battles and do you feel
you made a niche for South Carolina and prevented some of those kids from
leaving the state?  
COACH STALEY: When we first came to South Carolina, our staff, we tried to
just corner the market and figure out, you know, the thought process and why
players left or stayed in South Carolina and how we could‑‑ how can we change
that.  
And I think we pound the pavements; we just made sure that we had every
significant person and prospects lives (ph); we tried to make inroads with
every single person. And because of that, that effort, I thought we've done a
tremendous job of keeping our local players at home.  
Some of them, they get away. They have a couple of South Carolina players on
North Carolina's roster. But we are fairly happy with the tradeoff. They got
two and we got maybe eight or nine.  
So it's just a constant battle. But it's one that we've got to keep doing our
job because if we don't, they could easily go out of state.  
  
Q. Was it difficult to turn that tide when you first got here, and how much
of a presence was North Carolina in recruiting women's basketball?  
COACH STALEY: As I look back on it, they got every high‑profile player in the
State of South Carolina over the past few years before we got here.  
I mean, it is difficult. It is difficult I think when ‑‑ Coach Hatchell does a
lot of recruiting. She coached at Francis Marion, so she's had in inroads in
our state.  
But I think when you change the complexion of the program at South Carolina
where we are, and you know, we can be in their backyards; we can invite them
to our games. So when we are that much a part of making sure that we are
constantly pumping South Carolina, come to practices, come to games, come on a
visit, when we are able to have that much access, we find a way to make them
saying no to us very difficult.  
  
Q. When you look at their roster, who really presents a big matchup problem
for you guys?  
COACH STALEY: I think you look at two players that they can score at will.
You've got Stephanie Mavunga and Allisha Gray. Those are two players that have
done extremely well in the ACC just in their league. And when you're able to
play at a high level in a league like the ACC, I think it puts you in a
position to have success across the country because it's a really tough week.
So they could pose some match‑up problems for us.  
  
Q. Greensboro is suppose to be a neutral site and you're a No.1 seed. Does
it feel like that playing north Carolina in their home state in an area where
they have a lot of supporters?  
COACH STALEY: At this juncture, wherever we play‑‑ and we are fortunate to
only have to take a bus ride to Greensboro. So it feels very much like it's
home to us, and hopefully with the close proximity to Columbia, we'll have a
lot of our fans there.  
So whenever we're feeling like you're on someone else's home court, I think
our fans could make us feel very much at home.  
  
Q. Since you already have played against North Carolina, do you feel like
you have an advantage playing against them now?  
COACH STALEY: It's always a tough‑‑ North Carolina is always a tough opponent.
But when you look at our two games that we played against them last year, and
our team this year, we are just a little bit different. We are a little bit
older. I think we understand playing at this level a little bit better because
we have that experience.  
I don't think the game plan changes from how we approached it. I think it's
time for our players just to make plays when the game is on the line, and we
weren't able to do that in the previous two games. So hopefully that changes
this time around.  
  
Q. How many buses have you brought up ‑‑ will you be bringing up tomorrow?
  
COACH STALEY: As of right now, we have nine.  
  
Q. Khadijah, this is kind of the game that made you stay in Colombia all
summer, the opponent that you've been waiting all year. How are you feeling
going into this game and are you worried about maybe nerves taking over the
focus?  
KHADIJAH SESSIONS: No, not at all. I've been waiting for this game, waiting
for revenge, just been‑‑ the time is now. Just ready for it. Just ready for me
and my teammates to go out and prove what we should have proved last year.  
  
Q. Aleighsa, you have a teammate on the other team, former high school
teammates on the other team and I don't think you guys played against each
other in an NCAA Tournament game last year. Do you feel what it's going to be
like going up against her with these kind of stakes on the line?  
ALEIGHSA WELCH: You know, it's always exciting, you know, when I get an
opportunity to play against India. We have some great high school memories
together, but at the end of the day, it's still your opponent and for me, I'm
four years removed from my high school days. So the friendship part kind of
gets put aside until after the game.  
But it will be exciting but at the same time like I said it's still an
opponent?  
  
Q. Have you kept up with her at all? She's played a little bit more of a
role for them as the season has gone on.  
ALEIGHSA WELCH: Yeah, I have I noticed she was getting a lot more playing
team, especially since Xy (ph) went down. I'm happy for her and the
opportunity she's been able to get to really prove herself. But, you know,
this ‑‑ you love them from a distance, especially with the stakes that are on
the line now.  
  
Q. Khadijah, you played against Olivia in practice all the type. What
defensive player is she and how good is she on defense?  
KHADIJAH SESSIONS: She's probably one of the best defenders on the country.
She presser you; she gets up in you. She makes everything difficult. She's
very quick. She makes sure she's prepared and ready for players like Coleman.
Really aggressive, good kid. Yeah, pretty much that's Olivia.  
  
Q. Khadijah, last yearthey impacted the zone ‑‑ shooting outside, do you
think they will do the same this year?  
KHADIJAH SESSIONS: Most definitely. I think they will try the same game plan
playing off of me. But we've seen it all season. We know how to work around
it, get around it. I've been working on my shot. Been working on trying to
make different ways for my teammates to score.  
So we've been seeing it all season and it's going to be nothing different.
Just got to stay in attack mode and run the offense.  
  
Q. Aleighsa, in your four years, have you better learned year ‑to‑year how
to make sure that your legs are fresh late in the season, and was it a
learning thing, particularly early, just how long the season can be?   
ALEIGHSA WELCH: I think definitely, especially coming into my freshman year,
you didn't really know what to expect and you didn't really know how much the
griped of the season took a toll on your body. But as you get older, you do
learn how to take care of your body, especially when you want to play deep
into March and into April.  
We are in, what, 30‑plus games in and playing multiple games a week. So it is
physical but a lot of it is mental. The biggest thing is that I learned is
everybody is physically tired at this point of the season. It's about the
mental preparation coming into the game and giving yourself the upper hand
that way.  
  
Q. For all three of you guys, how have you changed and how has your team
changed since you saw North Carolina in the tournament, and looking at film,
how have they changed?  
ALEIGHSA WELCH: I think we're a more dynamic team. I think we are deeper than
what we were last year. Everybody worked on things that they needed to work
on. North Carolina, I think they are more of a fast‑paced team than when we
played them last year, and they have a different team from what we played last
year, as well.  
I just think roster‑wise and playing‑wise, we're different, both teams are
different than what we were.  
TIFFANY DAVIS: Just to go off what she said, we are a deeper team. I think
last year we were kind of one‑dimensional and it was really easy to play us.
This year I think we have a lot more to threaten North Carolina than what we
did last year. Like she said, North Carolina is a fast‑paced team, so one of
our advantages is controling tempo in this game. We can't really ‑‑ we are not
going to get in a back‑and‑forth track race with them. Just going to try to
play our game that we've been doing all season.  
KHADIJAH SESSIONS: Yeah, I agree with them, too. (Laughter) They said it all,
they did.  
  
Q. Were you guys excited at all that North Carolina was in your region that
you could end up facing them in Greensboro?  
ALEIGHSA WELCH: It was a little excitement knowing that our season ended last
year because of them. I think it's more fun now that we get to play them and
we've been kind of waiting on this game since last year.  
  
Q. Tiffany and Khadijah, you mentioned not getting into a track meet. How
important is controlling the ball and not giving them easy turnovers?  
TIFFANY DAVIS: It's really important. We know they will pressure the ball and
try to make us play faster than what we need to do. So controlling the tempo
is going to be really key. I know if we have it in transition, we'll push it
out but we are not going to go back and forth and take quick shots which we
probably want to do.  
KHADIJAH SESSIONS: Just have to make sure we execute our game plan. When they
are in their halfcourt, know where we're going with the ball. Just making
smart plays, making easy plays and don't do nothing we haven't been doing all
season.

_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  
Q. Winning close games in the NCAA Tournament, how much does that develop
you for winning more close games, as opposed to winning close games in the
regular season, what's the difference there?  
COACH HATCHELL: Well, it makes a big difference. It makes a difference in the
way that your season is over or you're still playing. But I'm hoping that
mentality‑wise, it just toughens you up and helps you grow and get better and
better, because a lot of people didn't think we would be here. But I think it
gives you confidence and just it's part of the growing process that our team
has definitely gone through.  
  
Q. You weren't at the game last year in the Sweet16 last year, but judged on
what you saw from last year's team to this team, does your game plan change in
terms of how you want to attack them?  
COACH HATCHELL: First of all, I still have some dents in the furniture in my
den from watching the game on TV and jumping around and throwing things and
all that. But South Carolina is an excellent team. I mean, they‑‑ Dawn and her
staff have done a really great job rebuilding that program. And gosh, I mean,
they have got kids sitting on their bench that would start at most DivisionI
schools.  
So they really have depth. I think they are talented at every position but
they have so much depth. I mean, none of their players really average that
many points; I'm sure they could. But they are so balanced and with all the
kids playing and everything like that.  
So I just think the depth and then their size, there's no doubt that A'ja
Wilson has added a lot to their team. But they are experienced. Yeah, I don't
see any weaknesses really.  
  
Q. The players from South Carolina earlier said last year they are a one
‑dimensional team and they have added more and it's made them tougher to beat.
What have you seen on film from them as far as that goes?   
COACH HATCHELL: I'm not sure what they meant by one‑dimensional because I
thought they were pretty balanced last year because they had the size inside
and then the guards, the shooters and everything. But they are, they are very
balanced and everybody talks about their inside game but they are pretty good
on the outside, too.  
Like I said, I don't really see any weaknesses. Our kids have to really step
up and play to a really, really high level. And I guess last year they were
probably favored. They were the No.1 or No.2 seed or whatever‑‑ No.1 seed.
Anything can happen. I've watched them all year, and they just destroyed about
everybody they played, and they are just pretty tough.  
But them being one‑dimensional, I don't know. I'm trying to figure out why
they would say that because I thought they were pretty doggone good last year.  
  
Q. All the players said that revenge was a big motivating factor for them
having UNC end their season last year. Are you guys aware of that and on guard
against any additional motivation ‑‑  
COACH HATCHELL: What was the first thing you said?  
  
Q. The players said that this game, there was the revenge factor, UNC having
ending their season last year. Are you guys kind of aware of that and ready
for the emotional ‑‑  
COACH HATCHELL: Well, I guess if we were in that situation, we would feel the
same way. But you know, it's a new year, different teams. We are definitely a
different team than we were last year. I guess if we were in that situation,
we would probably say the same thing, what coaches use for motivation and all.
I can understand that because we would probably be the same way.  
Again, it's different year and a whole different platform. I'm sure they will
be very, very motivated to play us because of how it ended last year.  
  
Q. You've always been so successful at recruiting players out of South
Carolina; is that a challenge now with Dawn in Colombia?  
COACH HATCHELL: Well, you have to understand my background, because I've got
probably more houses and real state in South Carolina than I do in North
Carolina, and my husband is from down there. I won two national championships
at Francis Marion with all South Carolina players. My camp staff in the summer
is‑‑ probably half my camp staff is South Carolina high school coaches. I have
a tremendous background and relationship down there with a lot of people; you
know, I'm South Carolina sports Hall of Fame.  
I've always just referred to the Carolinas, because I do claim South Carolina
a lot. I've always just said the Carolinas because I couldn't be at North
Carolina for 29 years and have had the success that I have had if it wasn't
for what happened to me the first seven years in South Carolina, and I don't
want to ever forget those people because they are so important to me, and like
I said, my husband's from Florence.  
So I have tremendous connections and all with South Carolina. And the South
Carolina kids, I won two championships with all South Carolina kids, so for me
the high school coaches there are my very, very good friends. And success at
anything is about relationships with anything and I have tremendous
relationships with very many people in the State of South Carolina. And we've
had some really good players. I have two of my assistant coaches are from
South Carolina: Andrew Calder, and Ivory Latta is from McConnells, South
Carolina.  
But there's no doubt that Dawn and her staff have really rebuilt that program.
We've always gone head‑to‑head not just with South Carolina but a lot of
people but because there's been a lot of good players out of there. I noticed
in my 40 years of coaching that things go in cycles like this.  
So there have been some years that South Carolina is just loaded with great
players and then there was some years that it was pretty thin, and then all of
a sudden there's great players again. And they have done a really good job
keeping a lot of those players there.  
Of course we have Xylina on our team who is not playing and we have really had
to adjust to her being out; and Latifah, our starting point guard, is from
South Carolina; our starting forward player is from Goose Creek, N'Dea Bryant.  
I just recruit kids that I think fit me, you know, that are good kids and‑‑
the relationships, a lot of times it's with their high school coaches
everything. But recruiting has always been tough, but like I said, Dawn and
them has done a great job of keeping the local kids home.  
I mean, you look at the roster, I was in the room back there a while ago and I
was looking at their roster and all of a sudden, I went down the list, and I
thought, man, half their team comes to my camps. Really, at least five or six
on the roster that came to my basketball camps. But a lot of that's the
relationships that I had with our high school coaches and everything like
that.  
But that's a good thing. It really is good. Recruiting is always tough. Your
basic question was about, is it tougher‑‑ well, okay, it is. But recruiting is
always tough because if it's not South Carolina in there, it's Tennessee or
Connecticut. You know, we thought we had a great shot at getting Kalana Greene
out of there and Geno comes in and takes her out. And I never thought a kid
from that part of South Carolina would end up in Connecticut, but she did, had
a great year there.  
When you've got great players, you're going to have all the top schools there,
but there's no doubt Dawn and her staff have done a good job.  
  
Q. Talking about McDaniel being out ‑‑ is she anywhere near being close to
playing a couple months from now when the season is over?  
COACH HATCHELL: We were hoping she was going to be where she could play but
she's not. We're going to try to get a year of eligibility back for her
because she's right on the borderline with the time period. It wouldn't make a
difference if she was out there the whole year. Really proud of my team for
adjusting. First three or four weeks that she was out, we were trying a little
bit of everything.  
We lost a couple games during that time that we probably should not have lost
but we were trying to adjust to her being gone. But now we have adjusted. I
think N'Dea Bryant from Goose Creek, South Carolina has done a good job.
Danielle has stepped up in there. Sometimes we put Allisha Gray at the fore
position. So we tried a lot of different things but our kids have adjusted and
I really am proud of the way probably the last three or four weeks, how we
have played.  
But there's no doubt that Xylina would help if she was in there but she will
not play. She's not going to be ready for probably another six weeks or so.
But hopefully we'll be able to get another year back for her. And she wants to
play so badly in this game.  
I mean, the other night after the game in the locker room, she was begging the
doctors, begging them to let her play in this game but they said she's not
ready.  
  
Q. Is your team probably more versatile than it may have been if she had
been out there the whole year?  
COACH HATCHELL: That's a good question. There's no doubt that those kids have
gotten better confidence‑wise, everything. Those players filling in there have
definitely improved and gotten better, our team has a little different look
and all.  
So that's a positive for all them. But we definitely miss her being in there,
how tough she is. She's just so physical and tough and the mentality that she
has. She plays like her dad. We definitely miss that.  
  
Q. Is there a difference between coaching against Coach Staley as a player
and her as a coach, because she still seems to carry that same dynamic
personality?  
COACH HATCHELL: Well, when Dawn was playing at Virginia is when I was just
getting started at North Carolina, oh, Lordy, those were some nightmare games
for me because we weren't very good, you know, and Dawn was I guess maybe the
best player in the country at that time, I don't know. But those Virginia
teams were Final Four teams, even though they never won a National
Championship, but they were Final Four teams. She was pretty dynamic as a
player.  
Of course I know Dawn well. We were in the '13 class for the Naismith, she as
a player, me as a coach, so I know Dawn well. I'm sure she carries that
personality into her style of coaching, as well.  
  
Q. You mentioned N'Dea Bryant. How have you seen her progress as a player,
as more has been asked as the season has gone on?  
COACH HATCHELL: Her confidence level, no doubt‑‑ she has a really, really good
jumpshot from like 10, 12, 15 feet. She can just knock them down and knock
them down and knock them down. The one thing I want her to do is go to the
basket more, be more aggressive, taking the ball to the hoop and getting on
the foul line.  
But she has really, really nice sweet jumpshot and she can make threes but
that 12‑, 15‑foot jumper, as people‑‑ lots of teams have tried to double
Stephanie, and N'Dea has had that shot. She does, and then also Danielle, as
well, has that shot. But N'Dea has a really nice shot. She really has. And
she's just gotten better overall. I think a lot of it is her confidence. Great
kid. Great kid.  
Can I say one thing? First I want to say a great big thank you to Greensboro
because no one does it better. We've had our ACC Tournament here for years and
it's great to be back. We were here a couple weeks ago. But these folks do a
fantastic job, and I've been coaching a long time, and trust me, I and
everybody else, we appreciate the commitment that they have made to NCAA
women's basketball.  
Again I just want to do a shout out to the Greensboro Sports Council, the ACC
and everybody involved, because they just do a tremendous job.  
  
Q.How much does playing South Carolina in the NCAA Tournament game mean to
you?  
LATIFAH COLEMAN: It means a lot. It started as a rivalry between the Carolinas
and it's always a fun game to play in. A lot of talk back home about the whole
going to North Carolina and not going to South Carolina thing, so it's always
a pretty good game for me.  
  
Q. What do you remember about playing South Carolina last year obviously
during the regular season and then in the Sweet16?  
THE MODERATOR: Let's start with Allisha.  
ALLISHA GRAY: It was definitely a very intense game, very fast paced.  
STEPHANIE MAVUNGA: I remember both of them were very competitive games. It was
a game of runs, both games. They got their runs on us and we got our runs on
them. It was just really competitive, and it was just two fun games and two
great teams competing against each other and we just happened to win both of
them.  
LATIFAH COLEMAN: Yeah, exactly like they said, it was a very competitive and
very fun game to play in.  
  
Q. What have you noticed they have changed in their team and also have you
changed in the last year?  
THE MODERATOR: Same order.  
ALLISHA GRAY: From what I've seen, they are a better team than what we were
last year but so are we. Wait, what was the‑‑ oh, we definitely‑‑ yeah, we
definitely became a better team. We are definitely more aggressive.  
STEPHANIE MAVUNGA: I think that we have just matured on the court. We are
really blending and we are really‑‑ just we are faster, too. Everything is
just flowing. Though we have lost two players, one to injury, one to a
transfer, I think that we are still strong.  
And I think that a lot of people don't realize that it affected us to begin
with not having Xylina around whenever she got injured. But I think that now
we are really coming together and now we really settled down and really know
each other's games now and we look like we have played together for much
longer than we really have.  
And if South Carolina, they have gotten a lot better. I think they are a
little more post‑oriented than they were last year, and they have gotten
quicker, as well. They just look like they are really flowing out there. They
really know the tendencies of one another and they just really look like a
real team, like a real unit, and I think that that's kind of scary, as well.  
LATIFAH COLEMAN: And I can't really follow that up. Pretty much said
everything.  
  
Q. You said you're a better team than last year and I agree with you after
watching both of you play a lot of games yet you lost an All ‑American player
early and you've been able to compensate for that. Why do you think y'all have
been able to make yourselves a deeper team and also more of a versatile
team?  
ALLISHA GRAY: This year we definitely played with a chip on our shoulder
because from the start we've been doubted. Many people didn't think we would
make it this far from the beginning of the season, and we just came together
as a team to show and prove people wrong that we are a better team than what
we were last year.  
STEPHANIE MAVUNGA: I agree with that and also I think that now we are much
more of a team and we don't really look to one or two individuals to just
really show up every single day, and I feel like maybe one player is going to
have a bad game every now and then or such.  
But I feel like on any given day any given player can step up on our team and
that's really big for us. It's not always one consistent leading scorer; it's
not always one consistent leading rebounder, steals, whatever. We have someone
that leads in every category in different ways and different games, and I
think that's really big because we look for five people on the court at once,
not just one or two players now. We really play as a team, as a unit and we
are all together, rather than broken apart, and I think that really shows.  
  
Q. Considering this is almost like a home game, do you think y'all have an
advantage for this game ‑‑  
ALLISHA GRAY: Not necessarily. I just think that being North Carolina is neat
just because people don't really have to drive as far as maybe they would have
had to as other teams playing in places in the Sweet16.  
But South Carolina has brought a lot of fans to their games this year, so I
think that it's going to be pretty even in terms of fans that they are
bringing to the game as we are. So I think there's going to be a lot of red
and there's going to be a lot of blue, too.  
  
Q. Stephanie, you mentioned South Carolina's more post ‑oriented this year.
Already in the Tournament you faced a lot of height and physicality and a
really fast post player in Ohio State. What specific challenges do this team's
post players bring?   
STEPHANIE MAVUNGA: They have more height than Ohio State this. I think they
have more height than just one person, whereas Heart for Ohio State was their
tallest player and maybe their fore player wasn't as tall.  
With South Carolina, their starting post is tall, their bench players are tall
and they all really come in there and just really pose a challenge in the
post. But they are really poised and they really know exactly how to guard a
post player. And so it's going to be a nice challenge but then again we'll
just see how it goes.  
  
Q. Talk about the fans ‑‑ the rims and the shooting background and the floor
and things like that, having played in here so many times, should have be a
big advantage? Is it usually?   
LATIFAH COLEMAN: It is an advantage like being used to the gym. I don't think
they have ever had to play here so it should be just kind of an edge for us,
just coming off the ACC Tournament here, so it should be kind of an edge.  
  
Q. For any of the players, when you played Stanford this year, do you have
any feelings ‑‑ from your season last year that those feelings may be the type
of feelings that the South Carolina players had‑‑ can you remember back to
that?   
STEPHANIE MAVUNGA: You always really come out with a different attitude when
you're playing someone who has previously beaten you, especially when it's a
season‑ending loss.  
When we played Stanford earlier this year, of course we really wanted to beat
them to sort of give us a type of revenge for them beating us the year before.
But then again, it's not the same Stanford team. It's never the exact same
team that you're playing, because Stanford lost some players and they are a
whole different basketball team when we played them down in Hawai'i than when
we played them at Stanford last year.  
So of course it always feels good to beat Stanford because it's still the
Stanford program. It's not the same exact team or same situation; otherwise
you would have rather beat them in the Elite 8 and in a tournament game.  
But here, I think that South Carolina has the same exact situation, four seed,
one seed; Sweet16 game against the same exact team. So that game is really set
up like the same exact way that the one last year was set up. Of course I feel
as if they really want to beat us, and in a press conference I heard the
different quotes and some of them saying that this is exactly what they
wanted.  
I think it's going to be a really good game. It's going to be a tough game, of
course, and they are going to be out to get us and they are going to play with
a chip on their shoulder just because we ended their season last year and that
brings a lot of pain from that experience last year.

_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  
Q. Something the Arizona State coach said was the good teams are the
simplest to prepare for; it's not that they do a lot of things but they do a
few things extremely well. Do you agree with that statement?  
COACH SEMRAU: Do I agree with the statement that good teams‑‑  
  
Q. Are the simplest to prepare for?  
COACH SEMRAU: Are the simplest to prepare for. Not all good teams. I think we
are relatively simple to prepare for in the types of things that we do, and we
do try to do a few things extremely well. That's our philosophy and it's been
good to us.  
  
Q. Speaking of the things that you do do well, is rebounding probably the
biggest strength of the Florida State team so far and how has it served you
throughout the tournament?  
COACH SEMRAU: Obviously it's the best thing that we do. We are very keyed in
on that.  
I think, Jordan, when you talk about being easy to prepare for, we don't run a
lot of multiple jump defenses; so what if they do, this we are going to run
this; what if they do this, we are going to run this.  
We try to be really, really good at our man‑to‑man defense and I think that
that enables us to know where things are coming and enables us to rebound the
ball very well. And a year ago, we were really easy to prepare for because we
were all dumb. For us it's really just about personnel and who we have.  
  
Q. Does this Arizona State team look similar to the one you played in 2009,
just stylistically?  
COACH SEMRAU: I don't remember 2009. I remember the outcome but I don't
remember the team, the team style as much. But I know Charlie, I know she's an
excellent coach. I know that they are very fundamental. They are physical.
They are tough. They play great defense. They rebound the ball extremely well.
They take care of the ball.  
I mean, not many teams in the country right now can say they have more assists
than turnovers. She's had a great balance of players. She has strength, she
has speed, she has size. I think they are a great basketball team:  
  
Q. Leti Romero, most coaches know that ‑‑ she is one of the first people
they name when they talk about preparing for this team. Talk about what a lift
she's been since she became eligible in December.   
COACH SEMRAU: One of the things we talk about a lot is the American basketball
game: There's a lot of attack; there's a lot of desire to go one‑on‑one,
because that's what you see on television in the NBA and I think that's how we
are brought up.  
In the European game, I think there's much more of a,
let‑the‑game‑come‑to‑you‑type attitude. If you want somebody in Spain to like
not be to crazy‑faced, tranquila, tranquila, and I think sometimes that's what
Leti plays like, tranquilamente. Just checking it out, seeing what everything,
how the game plays out, what comes to her. So she is a special kid and I think
she's a great balance for our team.  
  
Q. Can that mind ‑set almost serve as a calming influence at times on the
floor if it's needed?   
COACH SEMRAU: I don't think so much just a calming influence; I think it's a
great balance for the way that you run your offense. Yeah, I don't‑‑ calming
influence maybe for a coach but I think, too, for her team, they know she has
control and she's waiting for the best moments.  
  
Q. Arizona had a tough game last Sunday. Do you see anything you can take
advantage of or weaknesses in their game?  
COACH SEMRAU: I think we are so different than UALR ‑‑ U‑A‑L‑R, good, can roll
that one off my tongue. But Little Rock is just a motion team. They set a lot
of screens away from the ball. They are very similar to Florida Gulf Coast who
we played last Sunday. I think there's a lot of differences, so not sure we'll
take away a whole lot from that.  
  
Q. Welcome back to Greensboro. Last time you were here, pretty good run.
Have you taken notice of maybe the irony that you could knock through the
barrier and get through?  
COACH SEMRAU: I'll be taking a look at that, absolutely. But I think more
importantly is just the comfort level that we'll have being in Greensboro,
having played three games in the last month on this floor is truly something
special as my team comes back.  
  
Q. Your team plays defense that Arizona State plays ‑‑ how can that manifest
itself in this game in terms of a defensive‑minded game‑‑  
COACH SEMRAU: Say that one more time.  
  
Q. Just the defense that both teams play.  
COACH SEMRAU: I think it's going to be‑‑ it's going to be hard to score on
both sides of the ball. I think for both teams it's going to be hard to score.  
And you know, just the pride that both teams take in their defense, I think
can be really exciting for the fans to much with a. You know, even though
sometimes you think, defense, defense, that's not fun for the fans. But I
think it's going to be a really exciting game.  
  
Q. Curious your thoughts on the influence of the Spanish players and kind of
the influx over the last couple years, obviously you've had a few, and just
kind of what that maybe meant to the sport and to your program in
particular.  
COACH SEMRAU: You know, I think one thing I always felt was important in
coaching was that you blended individual players into a team; that I didn't
want somebody that was just like a Adut Bulgak or just like Brittany Brown. I
wanted someone to complement them.  
We used to look at that in the States. When you look at someone in the Midwest
played a different game than someone in Florida, and so we would work to try
to complement those players.  
Now, to say that we can go worldwide, that is even more exciting. For us
having Leonor Rodríguez a couple years ago, she changed us, and she was a
difference‑maker.  
So I knew I loved that style of basketball. So then to have Leticia, and then
yet another Spanish player looking for next fall, it's really, to me, I've
loved that. I love having Ama Degbeon, someone from Germany. I love having a
Adut Bulgak, who is from Canada. Just a different mind‑set coming together, it
just sharpens everybody on the team.  
  
Q. Did you have to develop a strategy for recruiting in Europe? Is it
different?  
COACH SEMRAU: It is different. We didn't have a strategy originally. Some of
these things just came to us, as our players went over seas and noticed
players and then just mentioned them to us. That's how it started with Leo;
Brooke Wyckoff played with Leonor Rodríguez. Those things are I think
happening all over the country.  
Look at the number of European players that are coming to play in the States.
You are seeing that as the world gets smaller, the basketball influence is
getting bigger.  
  
Q. You just talked about the defensive mind ‑set of the game, but on
offense, if it is becoming a defensive struggle who on your team do you look
to to provide that offensive lift when you have four or five players
averagingdouble digits?  
COACH SEMRAU: Jordan, you know the answer to that. For us it's somebody
different every night and that's the cool thing. I can't tell you who it's
going to be tomorrow night.  
And we, from the beginning, were saying, who is that go to be; who is that
go‑to, go‑to, go‑to. There still is not one, but there is one; we just don't
know who it will be. Does that make sense?  
  
Q. The similarity to Arizona State, too, they have that kind of balance. But
I wanted to ask you specifically about Katie Hempen, their three ‑point
shooter, just kind of what you've seen in her.   
COACH SEMRAU: I love her game. And I was familiar with Amanda Levens when I
was at Wisconsin. I had a player who played at Belvedere when I was at
Northern Illinois. Amanda came to camp. We tried to recruit Amanda. Loved her
as a player. And she reminds me a little bit of Amanda Levens and I know she
came with Amanda. So I'm very familiar with that. I love her game. I love her
style of play. You know, she's a special kid.  
  
Q. Your name comes up a lot when coaches are talking about their game plan
for Florida State. Is that extra pressure on you knowing that coaches are
looking specifically to shut you down when they are playing Florida State?  
LETICIA ROMERO: Not at all because I know I have‑‑ I know my team has depth
and they can't focus on one player or two. They are going to have to focus on
everybody, because if they focus on me, Adut, Shakayala, Maegan, Brittany, I
mean, it's impossible to just down one player, if you are going to stop our
team.  
  
Q. Being a freshman how do you feel about being in the tournament for the
first time?  
SHAKAYLA THOMAS: I feel like one of those great feelings ‑‑ considering I've
got a great team behind me, they are leading me in every direction to show me
what it will be like. Like they are setting me up to win, yeah.  
  
Q. Do you feel like especially since the ACC Tournament and the last few
games in the NCAA Tournament your game has come on even stronger over the last
couple weeks?  
SHAKAYLA THOMAS: I actually do. I mean, like in practice, I've been working
hard trying to get better, banging with the big post, the actual post. I mean,
like, it's just great. Like I'm just really working harder.  
Q. Do you feel like that's come on as a result of the experience that you've
gained and just having so many games under your belt now?  
SHAKAYLA THOMAS: Yeah, I think so, and it feels like I know I have to bring
something to the able so I don't want to just have the same game every time
and show people something new.  
  
Q. And for Adut, you hear lots of teams this time of year say that don't
look at when you look at freshmen as freshmen anymore. When you look at
Shakayla, do you still see a freshman or do you not any longer?  
ADUT BULGAK: In some aspects, like little tiny mistakes. But other than that,
she's really taken on her role and the responsibility that we've handed to
her. And on the basketball court, I don't really see her as a freshman just
because of how she's developing. She's maturing on the court.  
  
Q. Do you know Quinn Dornstauder, at all?  
ADUT BULGAK: Yeah we played together on the Canadian Developmental National
team this summer where we won the Jones Cup tournament in Taiwan. I got to
play with her.  
  
Q. Is it an advantage either way or does it work out even since you both
know each other?  
ADUT BULGAK: Both. I guess I know a little bit of her personnel but then again
we've been playing DivisionI college basketball for, what, six, seven months
now without playing on the same team. So I'm pretty sure she's developed in
areas I don't know about, just like I've developed my game so it will be a
little surprise.  
  
Q. And for all of you, I guess your coach, she think it's going to be
difficult to score because of the way you both play defense. Can you talk
about how you think the defensive side of this game is going to go?  
  
LETICIA ROMERO: Well, I think for us, they are going to press us a lot. I
mean, just in the film that we have seen about them; that they like to deny
the ball; they like to press harder, and I think that's going to be
challenging for us.  
And the way we defend, it's pretty much the same. We picked up the ball really
early and we really put a lot of work in defense and rebounding. We don't let
other teams‑‑ we try to keep other teams from rebounding the ball in offense.
So I think it's going to be definitely a defensive game, like we are going to
see a lot of defense in the game.  
ADUT BULGAK: I think the key is to control the pace. Like we need to set the
tone first, and like Leti said, they will be pressing us, so I guess the most
important thing in the game is to take care of the basketball.  
And watching film, they did a great job of squaring up for their players and
boxing them out, so we are going to have to find ways to get around their
box‑outs and pursue the ball on rebounds.  
SHAKAYLA THOMAS: Yeah, I agree with Adut on setting the tone. We are a
fast‑paced team and we like to play fast but I feel like they are going to try
to slow us down to get us on their levels to set plays and make moves and
stuff. It's up to us to just go out there and play.  
  
Q. You guys watched the game against Arkansas, Little Rock, what did you see
during that game? You obviously are a very resilient team able to come back
from 16 points down; your thoughts on that game and what can you carry that
game into this one?  
LETICIA ROMERO: I mean, that mentality that we were talking about, that we
think we have, too, that mentality that no matter what happens, no matter what
the game is at that point, we want it so bad that we are going to work for it.  
And no matter if we are losing ‑‑ and they have the same thing. They were
losing by a pretty big difference and they came back. So I think that's going
to be‑‑ like our game is going to be pretty tight and we both are similar
teams in that way. So it's going to be interesting.  
ADUT BULGAK: We can't be complacent. Obviously no lead is big enough. So we're
going to have to play the entire 40 minutes and not like look past any little
thing they do. So we've just got to stay consistent the whole game.  
SHAKAYLA THOMAS: We can't be satisfied with what place we're in right now. I
mean, this is up for grabs. Anybody can win. So I feel like we should just
keep our hands up and keep playing the whole game.  
  
Q. You said you've been in a bit of a rebounding slump, you had 13 against
Florida Gulf Coast; is that a jumping point to move forward for the rest of
the tournament?  
ADUT BULGAK: I guess it's just a reminder of, hey, you've still got it. I
wouldn't say it's a big confidence booster, but it definitely is a reminder of
my identity on the basketball court, so, yeah.

_GREENSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  
Q. Sue said she thinks it's going to be really hard for either team to
score. Can you talk about the similarities of the teams on defense and sort of
the even ‑balanced scoring on offense?   
COACH TURNER THORNE: Yes, I agree with that. Watching quite a bit of film at
this point. I mean, they have five people in double figures; they average 75
points a game; they are a great offensive rebounding team.  
But actually, their defense stood out. They hold teams. They play great team
defense. They do a great job of limiting you to one shot. Little different
than us in terms of the style but very similar in the results.  
So I think both of us want to push the tempo, get transition. So I think
transition defense and limiting‑‑ the team that takes away the transition game
and limits the other team to one shot the best is going to have the advantage
for sure.  
  
Q. How are you preparing different from the last game that you had?  
COACH TURNER THORNE: Well, I feel like the last game was good for us. I think
having a game like this where your offense, you are missing shots that you
normally make and you struggle, and you really have to flex your toughness
muscle and find a way to win. In all my years in deep runs in the tournament,
that's helped us. Last time we actually came to Greensboro in 2007, we were
the third seed ‑‑ we were in L.A. and we struggled to win both of our games.
We just didn't score well.  
And then we came here and won it fairly easily in our first game. I think
those close games can really help you. Obviously we are a good team and we
know how to stay with things, and our defense can usually keep us in any game.  
Very different game to prepare for. At the same time, we also need to do what
we do. We need to rebound better. We need to have a better transition defense.
I think we could be better in just about every area from the last game except
for our toughness. And even in the first half, I don't think we were very
tough and very together like we usually are as a team.  
So I think the fun thing for us right now‑‑ you know, we were at home, I think
we all felt a little bit of pressure. We had the top seed and we only have one
senior. We're a younger team and we kind of expected to win. Our
administration made an incredible move to allow us to host because we were
supposed to host Pac‑12 gymnastics that weekend. I don't know, I think our
team was just really tight.  
Now we are across the country, nobody's picked us to win. Sometimes, in my
experience, that's not a bad thing.  
  
Q. You talk about coming across the country. Your team is from much further
away than any of the other schools. Do you consider that a disadvantage,
especially since Florida State just played here in the ACC Tournament?  
COACH TURNER THORNE: We're certainly not at an advantage, you know, when you
look at these three teams, and I'm sure that they will draw well. Their fans
will travel well. Although, we have got some pretty loyal fans; we have got
some Midwest people that are not afraid to drive. But yeah, I think a little
bit of an advantage.  
At the same time, it's a regional. It's a neutral site. It's the NCAA
Tournament. We're used to getting shipped out. Every deep run we've had, we've
been shipped out. We've been in Greensboro and we've been in Trenton and we've
played well. We've played teams that have been in their regions.  
And this team, our Sun Devil team has been a great road team. We play in the
Pac‑12 Conference. We are used to tough environments, big crowds. Won't be
anything that we haven't senior dealt with, so we are excited.  
  
Q. They are No. 3 in the country in rebounding. Can you talk about why they
are such a good rebounding team and maybe if there are some of their players
that individually stand out to you?  
COACH TURNER THORNE: Well, they are relentless and they use all their
athleticism. They are relentless. They work. They obviously value it and they
understand the importance of it. They have got really‑‑ from the guard spot,
Brown is an incredible rebounder. She reminds me of Jamie Weisner; averaging
almost basically three offensive rebounds a game.  
And then all of their posts are fantastic rebounders, and so they are kind
of‑‑ I called Thomas Rodman in the film session today, because she is sitting
on that weak side block getting position before the shot even goes up. So Sue
has done an amazing job. They understand. You look at Florida State's stats,
and they are the stats of the teams that you usually see in the Final Four:
Plus 12, plus 13 on the boards, and their field goal percentage is fantastic.
They just do a lot of things really well, and the biggest thing is rebounding.  
  
Q. A freshman like Shakayla Thomas, how much does she stand out to you?
She's leading the team in scoring throughout this tournament right now and
she's coming off the bench. How much does they stand out to you as a coach?  
COACH TURNER THORNE: She stands out. I mean, wow, she is talented. I had heard
about her but now I've actually watched her quite a bit, and she's‑‑ it's hard
to believe when you watch her, she's just a freshman. Because she plays‑‑ not
only is she talented in scoring the basketball and she's rebounding the
basketball. But just her energy and her intensity while she plays and
sometimes you don't see that in a first‑year player. Very impressive.  
  
Q. How about Romero, what do you think she's brought to them in terms of her
style of play?  
COACH TURNER THORNE: Yeah, Romero is a great leader for them. I watched
Florida State only one time before we knew we were going to play them and that
was against Washington in Cancún where Washington in our conference beat them,
and they didn't even look like the same team.  
And you know, sometimes it's an early game and I don't think they played well.
But I think Romero has done a fantastic job coming in and just running that
team. She's an aggressive scoring point guard, very savvy. Making great
decisions, obviously a great find, get, whatever you want to say; they have
had a number of transfers.  
And I think she's a huge‑difference maker for that team. And I think she plays
beyond her years. I don't know if that's her international experience, but she
doesn't seem like a sophomore out there, that's for sure.  
  
Q. What do you know about Florida State and from what you've watched so far
can you compare them with anybody you've seen?  
PROMISE AMUKAMARA: I notice‑‑ well, we all notice that they are a great
rebounding team. So we are going to have to really control the boards in this
game. I'm not really sure the comparison. They are a different team‑‑  
KATIE HEMPEN: Yeah, I'm not for sure either.  
SOPHIE BRUNNER: I would say probably a mixture of Stanford and Oregon State,
just how hard they play and rebound and just how good they are.  
  
Q. Will there seem to be quite a few similarities between the type of
defense they have and also the balanced scoring; do you see that when you
watch them on film?  
PROMISE AMUKAMARA: Yeah, I think they all‑‑ like there's no one you cannot
guard. They are all scorers.  
And what was the other question? Oh, yeah, they are a great defensive team.
Like I said, they do a really good job of rebounding and stuff. We really need
to do well in our game, rebound, as well.  
KATIE HEMPEN: Just like what Prom said, rebounding is key. But in comparison,
they love to run the floor. They love to hit 1‑4, 1‑2‑4\. They like to go
inside to their post. They can kick it out to the three.  
In comparison so us, we do the same thing. We look in transition; we like to
shoot the three. Everybody on our team can score, and Florida State can't back
down off any of our guards or in our post because everybody is a threat, which
is nice.  
Even our bench players are a huge threat and Florida State's bench is also a
good threat for them. So I think it is going to be fun. We are both really
tough teams going head‑to‑head.  
SOPHIE BRUNNER: Yeah, in comparison to them, I think second shots are crucial
to both of us, so that's a big key, and we're both going to have to box out
for it to be a good game.  
And just taking away their tendencies on defense, I think is going to be huge
for us, and running them and just being ready to attack them on offense.  
  
Q. I know you're 15 points away from 1,000 points for your career, but
you've also been honored numerous times for your defense. Talk about your
pride in being a well ‑rounded player and what do you think is the strongest
part of your game?   
PROMISE AMUKAMARA: I think the strongest part of my game is just being able to
lock down on defense. And then offensively, I think just getting to the basket
and beating my player.  
  
Q. What feelings do you have about reaching this level? You watched this
tournament growing up and this is where you want to get to, and now you're
playing in the Sweet16. Can you just talk about the emotions you're feeling at
this stage?  
SOPHIE BRUNNER: For me just being a sophomore, it's just a great feeling
knowing that all of our hard work has paid off. We've been working at this
from even last April from when we lost in the first round.  
So I think it's just a really big feeling of excitement, but also knowing that
we still have a lot of hard work ahead of us to get done and that we are not
just coming to play for the Sweet16. We are coming to play for the Elite 8 and
go on from that. We are just excited as a group and just filled with joy.  
KATIE HEMPEN: For me personally, I think it's a blessing. The blessing comes
from just being with my teammates, and it's awesome having teammates that work
as hard as you and really work to be a better person off and on the court.  
And playing in the Sweet16 is every kid's dream, every kid's like basketball
dream, anyway. And going to the Elite 8 after this is another dream. Like what
Sophie said, we are here to play for the win. We are not here just to play for
a Sweet16.  
PROMISE AMUKAMARA: Like Katie said, it's been a blessing. Personally for my
senior year, I've never been this far the whole four years‑been at ASU, and so
I'm really excited‑‑ I'm just excited.  
  
Q. For promise, how do you feel being the only senior on the team? Do you
feel there's more pressure each day and that each game could be your last
game?  
PROMISE AMUKAMARA: Not really pressure. Just put it in perspective that I need
to work hard every play because, you know, it could be my last game. So just
taking it play by play and just going 100 percent.  
  
Q. This is for all the players, if you can address this. Just wondering if
any of you have been to the Greensboro area before? Are you familiar with it,
and how do you feel about travel so far, is that a disadvantage or is there
some excitement?  
PROMISE AMUKAMARA: This is my first team being here and it's amazing out here.
It's very pretty.  
I think it's‑‑ I think it's an advantage, actually, because we get to focus
and really be locked into these games, and just not have any distractions
while we're away.  
KATIE HEMPEN: Same thing as Prom. I look at it as an advantage, too. We become
more focused and I think our connectedness and togetherness really shows when
we are away.  
And for the traveling part, coming from Illinois, this is just another ride
home that we come for Christmas or Thanksgiving for Sophie and I. I don't
think traveling really bugs us. Our coaches and our trainers do a great job of
keeping us healthy and making sure we have the right food in our system and
making sure we are hydrated. I don't think there's a disadvantage in traveling
this far.  
SOPHIE BRUNNER: Yeah, going off what they said, I agree with that they say.
And to add to it, I think it's just fun. We get to be more connected and with
each other and on the same page. We are not worried about what someone is
doing or anything like that. We know where we are all at, and I think it's
just a big advantage.  
And we get to play closer to home, so we'll have people that come support us
and we have a good following with that, so I think that will be fun, too.  
  
Q. You have a couple common opponents, Washington, Miami; is there anything
you can draw off those at all, and also for Sophie, the other night, I don't
know if I've ever seen you quite so excited. Wondering what you were feeling
at the end of coming back from getting that victory.  
SOPHIE BRUNNER: Yeah, to answer your question about the game, I was just
really excited knowing that we came‑‑ we were down 16 at one point and we came
back, and I knew, you could just feel the momentum.  
Yeah, I don't really get excited like that but it wasn't really excitement for
me per se. It might look like that but I was just excited about our team; like
I knew at that point that we were going to come back and win it, just like
with the momentum and excitement and how together we were playing.  
So that's just how excited I was, and just knowing that we overcame that lead
that they had.  
KATIE HEMPEN: I guess the fact that there's a couple teams that we've both
played, it kind of shows how they played against Washington or Washington
played against them, and Miami, same thing.  
I don't know if you guys remember, but Miami was very athletic and Miami is
very quick. And so just to see the pace and how they controlled it was an
advantage to us to see, you know, because we like to transition a lot, just to
see how they handled transition and how they handled quickness is helpful to
our advantage.  
And Washington has some great shooters and some great posts, so I think the
fact of how they handled their great shooters and their great posts helps us
in seeing what works for us and what doesn't.  
  
Q. From your experience in the last game, are you more focused on this game
after the last home game?  
PROMISE AMUKAMARA: I think we're more focused in on this game because of we
weren't‑‑ we didn't really key on the points that we were supposed to key on
during that game, and so it kind of showed up. So I think this game, we are
really locked in on what we need to get done.  
KATIE HEMPEN: And then towards your comment, I want to say that we weren't
focused our last game. Just like what Promise said. We just need to be able to
shut down their tendencies a little bit more. I think this game, being away‑‑
I mean, we are always focused more on away trips because it's easier to stay
focused. There's not many distractions. Our coaches do a great job of keeping
us down‑to‑earth and making sure that we hear the right things.  
SOPHIE BRUNNER: Yeah, going off what they said, I think just being now the
underdog in the tournament, I think that will go to our advantage because we
have been used to that throughout the whole year.  
So yeah, I don't think we took Arkansas lightly. I just don't think we were as
focused as we needed to be and we need to key in on key players, so we are
going to make that adjustment this next game and have more success.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  

Notre Dame  77  
Baylor - 68

  
MUFFET McGRAW: That was amazing. I think that was one of the best games in
terms of our persistence, our relentless approach. We got down early and we
just never quit, and we kept coming back, kept coming at them, did what we had
to do. I thought Lindsay Allen was just the best point guard in the country
today, just an amazing game, tournament MVP. What a great job by this young
team that we thought maybe was a year away, and now here we are back in our
fifth straight Final Four.  
  
Q. Jewell, talk a little bit about the performance by Lindsay and how close
the two of you are on the court and off.  
JEWELL LOYD: Well, she's like my twin, really, and she's unstoppable. I think
people have really underestimated her, and for us she's been awesome all year,
it's been awesome to see how talented she is. She's great, and she's my big
sis. I'm older, she's my big sis. I look up to her on the court and off the
court. She's very humble. She's the MVP.  
  
Q. Jewell, for you and Lindsay, I know you guys are excited about tonight,
and if you could describe how excited you are just to have this and get back
again, but also I guess looking forward, how much maybe last year drives you
going back to the Final Four and how much you still feel like you have left
out there.  
JEWELL LOYD: I am enjoying the moment right now with this team and this
program. We were just so excited to get this job done right now. We're a big
family, we're all still kids and we're loving it. Michaela also in the game
was great, so we're just enjoying the moment.  
LINDSAY ALLEN: Yeah, like Jewell said we're excited to be in this moment. When
we're looking back, we're just excited to be making it to another Final Four.  
  
Q. Brianna is not here, but did any of the three of you see what happened
with the flagrant foul in the first half, and can you talk about the momentum
shift that happened after that?  
MADISON CABLE: I didn't see it.  
JEWELL LOYD: Yep, it happens in basketball, but we were focused and ready to
play team defense and team basketball.  
LINDSAY ALLEN: I didn't see it. I can't comment, sorry.  
  
Q. Lindsay, have you ever played two better games back to back do you think
in your career?  
LINDSAY ALLEN: Not that I remember, no. Today was‑‑ this weekend was just a
really great weekend. Our posts set really good screens for us in both games
and the guards got really great free‑throw line jumpers in both games, so this
was a really good shooting weekend overall.  
  
Q. Madison, with about six minutes left in the second half you had a huge
block after a Baylor transition play. What did you see on that play and do you
think that turned a little bit of momentum for you?  
MADISON CABLE: Yeah, I was probably one of the people supposed to be back not
letting them get down in transition, so I ran back and jumped in and got lucky
and got the ball. I think it was good for us that they didn't score there.  
  
Q. Could you speak to adjustments that were made at halftime because you
were trailing on the boards and so forth, and you completely out ‑boarded them
on the offensive and defensive glass significantly in the second half. Can you
talk about what you did to accomplish that?   
LINDSAY ALLEN: I think we changed a little bit of our defense on the ball
screens. It gave the posts a better chance to get the rebound because they
could actually stay with their man on defense. So we just focused on boxing
out and getting rebounds and being tougher inside I would say.  
JEWELL LOYD: Yeah, definitely. I think after I got knocked out, everyone just
got tougher. Everyone was like, we're playing hard, fighting to the end, and
that's what we did. Everyone settled in and we executed our game plan. We
listened to Coach, and she knows what's best.  
MADISON CABLE: Yeah, they're a big, physical team, and we talked about at
halftime that if we don't win the rebounding boards or at least get close
we're not going to win the game, so we came out and we battled.  
  
Q. Jewell, what occurred at the end of the first half that you ended up on
the floor?  
JEWELL LOYD: I mean, it was just a screen against a wall, I don't know. It's
part of basketball, part of sports.  
  
Q. Jewell, is there almost an expectation at this point for you guys? It
seems like there wouldn't be a Final Four without you. At this point is this
almost what you guys expect every season going in?  
JEWELL LOYD: Well, our whole program expects to win. Our program breeds
champions on the court and off the court. For us we're very competitive, and
for us we just want to win.  
  
Q. Lindsay, there at the end when you guys were celebrating you go up the
ladder and they're chanting MVP and you're taking your piece of the net.
Describe what that moment is like and really the whole celebration.  
LINDSAY ALLEN: It's just a great moment just for our team overall to make it
to another Final Four. We fought so hard in this game and we knew coming in it
wouldn't be easy because Baylor is a really good team. We rebounded really
well down the stretch and we were just really excited to win, no matter who
was going to be MVP or who scored the most points.  
  
Q. Madison, talk about the offensive rebounding that the team did in the
second half, and you came up with a big rebound. There were a couple big
offensive rebounds for the team.  
MADISON CABLE: Yeah, kind of like we already said, they're a big, physical
team. We talked about at halftime that we really want to get on the boards if
we want to compete, so we did that, and I think I just kind of crashed.
Sometimes the balls get knocked around, so I tried to get in there and grab
one, and that's what happened on that one offensive rebound.  
  
Q. Have any of you heard whether on Twitter or Facebook or directly, perhaps
even an old ‑fashioned phone call from any of the Notre Dame alum about the
success that you've had this season, particularly in the tournament?   
LINDSAY ALLEN: No, we haven't heard yet but we normally do emails after the
season when we're finished playing with a lot of alums, especially women alums
emailing us and telling us how proud of us they are, so we'll see after the
season.  
JEWELL LOYD: Former players will always give a text after a game or something
like that, or like on Twitter or if we're walking around on campus someone
will come to us and stuff like that. But we're still pretty close to the alums
that were here.  
  
Q. Jewell, was this about as physical of a game as you've had to play?  
JEWELL LOYD: As far as one of the top five probably. Yeah, it was really
physical, and we knew that coming in. You're playing for more than‑‑ you're
playing for your team, you're playing for a chance to go to a Final Four, so
you play with a lot of passion, and that's what the game is going to be like.  
  
Q. How big of a play was Madison Cable's play in the second half for you
tonight?  
MUFFET McGRAW: You know, I thought she had two huge plays, the block on Nina
Davis in transition which was just a huge stop that we had to have at that
point, and then she hit the three at the other end. I thought those two were
really key for us down the stretch.  
  
Q. On that transition play, I thought I was going to be roadkill, so you
might thank Madison for not having run me over. Could you please speak to the
adjustments that you made at halftime, and how did the game itself shape up in
comparison to your scout?  
MUFFET McGRAW: I thought we used the last play in the half as a momentum ‑‑
let's say a motivational point. We talked about guarding the ball screen,
which we did not do effectively at the beginning of the game. Our first plan
was not effective. We went to the zone. That was not effective. We guarded the
screen a different way. That was semi‑effective. We came out in the second
half and we tried to stay with the posts instead of hedging, and I thought
that was much more effective. The guards had a little more trouble getting
around it. We went to the triangle and two. I don't remember what time it was.
Maybe around the 10‑minute mark or so, from 10 to 6 we played a lot of
triangle and two during that stretch, and I think that was very effective. I
thought it took them out of rhythm. They took a few possessions to get
comfortable in it, so we stayed in it. We went back and forth with man, and
then we completely switched all the ball screens late in the game, probably
two‑and‑a‑half minutes and under.  
  
Q. Muffet, I know there's probably more time for reflection between seasons
and after seasons, but does it get more and more satisfying as these Final
Four appearances keep racking up?  
MUFFET McGRAW: You know, it really does. I'll tell you, this one was the
hardest. We had to work the hardest to get to this one. I thought we lost so
much from last year, and we've lost really good players throughout the years,
but last year's experience and not having any senior starters, you know, you
just didn't know how the season was going to unfold. We had so many tough
games. I think we played the toughest schedule in the country, so we learned a
lot throughout it. I thought they came into practice every day ready to learn,
but I still felt we were going to take some lumps at some point, so when we
kept on winning, it just really built our confidence, and I guess in
retrospect, it was better for a young team to build the confidence of winning
rather than to have a learning lesson of losing a game maybe at the end of the
year. I thought the Miami game was kind of a tipping point for us, and ever
since that game I think we've been on a pretty good run. But this one is
incredibly satisfying to see what this team was able to do together.  
  
Q. You've got a lot of contributions, not all of them even show up in the
stat sheet from your bench. At the same time you were able to really limit the
perimeter shooting that was a big three ‑point shooting team but they get that
contribution on a regular basis between Wallace and Prince, really held that
down. Was that part of the game plan and were you doing that specifically?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Well, I was disappointed early on when they made a lot of shots
that we really were hoping we were going to guard them and not let anybody get
a hot hand, that we would kind of key on Davis, try to slow Johnson down a
little bit, but they were the focal points, but we didn't want anybody else to
get hot, and they did. They came out firing. That's who was doing most of the
scoring early were the other players. I thought we adjusted fairly well to
that by getting out on them. But trying to double‑team Davis, that's a
monumental task. She's a great player. She is phenomenal. She is so hard to
guard. She's quick up and down the floor, scores in so many different ways,
really a challenge for us defensively. I don't know if I answered your
question because I've forgotten it.  
So for us being able to rest some people with Hannah Huffman coming in, with
Madison Cable coming in, with Kathryn Westbeld coming in, it gave our starters
a quick rest, and I think they did some good things while they were in the
game, too.  
  
Q. I know next week is next week and you'll get there soon enough, but right
now if you could just describe the comfort level, confidence level that you
have with this group, taking them in.  
MUFFET McGRAW: Well, as a coach, I always see what we can do better, and this
time I'm planning on celebrating it a little bit more because they need that.
They need to understand how special this is, and I will enjoy watching the
freshmen enjoy it because for them it's the first time, and it's going to be a
really special one. I think for the whole team, they had a goal at the
beginning of the season, they got most of the way there. They're not going
into this just happy to be there. We have been there a number of times and not
been able to finish. Each year we feel like maybe this will be our year. But I
think definitely celebrating this whole week of what we accomplished all year
long because only one team is going to win.  
  
Q. Talk a little bit about the development of your young team, but
particularly the development of Lindsay Allen as a player. Do you feel like
this weekend a new star was born in women's college basketball?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Yeah, I think the best point guard in college basketball, but
I've been saying that throughout the year. She really showed it throughout the
night tonight. Last year she was able to come in and simply run the team
without having to be vocal. She had experienced players all around her. She
helped her, they got her comfortable, she took us all the way to the national
championship game by not making mistakes, by not trying to do too much. This
year we asked her to do more. We asked her to score more. We asked her to be
more involved in the offense, to be more vocal, to be the true leader of the
team. And that was a challenge for her, because with a young team there was an
awful lot of talking needed and she's not a very vocal person. So I think to
see her develop, she worked incredibly hard this summer. She came back the
most improved player off the summer. She really looked great when she came
back, looked to score more, I thought was doing so many really good things,
and I think got more attention from the defense with all the players that
graduated. So she was going against better players and playing better.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the defensive mindset of your team, the adjustments
you made and the role defense played in turning the game around after they got
ahead by nine?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Yeah, I thought we kind of held our patience. I thought we were
okay. I thought we looked a little panicky on the court for the first probably
six or eight minutes, and then I thought we calmed down, we played our game.
That's what we kept talking about in the huddle, do what we talked about, do
what we've been doing all year, and defensively we've gotten so much better
holding teams under 70 I think for a long time now, so that was a big goal for
us, and we were able to accomplish it I think because we started to play more
team defense. When Madison comes in she's going to rotate over and take a
charge, and that's the kind of thing‑‑ the blocks and those kind of plays I
think get everybody really fired up defensively.  
  
Q. You said that you didn't put Michaela back in after the game because she
was feeling dizzy. Do you know what happened and if she'll be fine for next
weekend?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Yeah, she's going to be fine. She started and played a couple
minutes and then said she felt light‑headed and one of the assistants said
she's done for the day, not feeling well. I think she's going to be fine,
probably didn't eat enough before the game. I think she's going to be fine.
She sure looked good in the first half.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  

Notre Dame  77  
Baylor - 68

  
Q. Sune, do you think that perhaps you were a marked woman tonight in some
ways because of the flagrant on Friday? Did that affect your game?  
SUNE AGBUKE: You know, I didn't really understand what I could do different,
and it happened, and I don't know, it rattled me for a minute. But I was just
trying to play and trying to get to where I was going. I don't do things‑‑ I
don't throw elbows. I just felt like the rest of the game, the refs kept
telling me don't give us something to look at, don't give us something to look
at, like I was doing it on purpose, and I wasn't.  
  
Q. Nya, you were right in there, right down to the last minute. Talk about
not being able to finish.  
NIYA JOHNSON: That's just on us, not finishing. That's part of focus, and I
thought they beat us with offensive rebounding, so that's something we have to
work on.  
  
Q. Nina, just expanding on what Nya just talked about, the offensive
rebounds they were able to have, I think it was only 16 ‑12 in second chances
but did you feel like that took away chances for to you score?   
NINA DAVIS: Definitely. We knew coming into the game we knew that was
something we couldn't let happen. We couldn't let them get offensive rebounds
and we kind of let that happen in critical moments at the end. They had two or
three critical rebounds at critical moments at the end, and that cost us the
game in the long run.  
  
Q. Late in the game, three starters were playing with four fouls apiece on
your team. Could you talk about how that might have impacted the rebounding on
both ends of the floor?  
NIYA JOHNSON: I don't know, like four fouls you have to play smart at the end
of the day. I guess we tried to stay off of them. They was calling it pretty
tight at the end, and I don't know, it was just difficult playing with four
fouls.  
NINA DAVIS: I cannot even say it really affected us, we all had four fouls,
but you just can't let the fouls stop you. Like Nya said, you have to play
smart but you have to keep battling, and it was a critical moment and we kept
battling, but we just fell short.  
SUNE AGBUKE: Yeah, I have to go with Nina. That's the game, playing with four
fouls for all of us. You've got to keep playing hard, and that's what we tried
to do.  
  
Q. Sune, just talk about this team in general. You guys were picked second
in the conference. You guys roll off a 20 ‑plus game win streak, incredible
run to the Elite 8. Kind of sum up this journey with a team so young. It looks
promising from here to the next couple years.   
SUNE AGBUKE: I've just learned so much about life from this team. We weren't
always the biggest, we weren't always the fastest, we weren't the most
talented, but we battled every day. You know, and we were always‑‑ we always
could learn lessons. We lost two games in a row late in the season, but we
were able to bounce back. That's what we were all about. We just continued to
get better all year from every loss and from every win. We just kept
improving, and there's just not another group of girls that I'd want to go to
war with, and I'm excited for them because next year they'll make it better,
and the year after that they'll only get better, and that's just Baylor for
you, and that's just the kind of program that Coach Mulkey has built here,
that this year we made it to an Elite 8 and we're disappointed because we
couldn't make it further, but next year, man, they're going to be so great.  
  
Q. Nina, in the second half did they do anything different defensively or do
you feel like some of the shots that you were getting weren't falling?  
NINA DAVIS: It was just a game. I was going about it the same way, some shots
went in, some shots rolled out. It happens.  
  
Q. Nina and Nya, obviously outsiders coming into the season didn't
necessarily expect you guys to get this far. I know Coach has talked about the
next couple years are going to be incredible with you guys. Given the fact
that the expectations outside of the program weren't this high, how much do
you think this is going to springboard you guys, making it this far and giving
Notre Dame a run for their money?  
NINA DAVIS: I think right now we really can't see it because we're in a lot of
pain because we fell short and we thought we had a great opportunity to get to
the Final Four, but we had a great season. It was a great journey, and I
wouldn't trade anything in the world for this team or anybody. This is going
to give us a lot of confidence. We have a great class coming in and we pretty
much bring everybody back except for Sune so this is going to give us a lot of
confidence once we get over this right here, and we're going to be all right.  
NIYA JOHNSON: I think it's just motivation and just will make us work harder
in the off‑season and just put in work.  
  
Q. Sune, you talked about having learned a lot from this team. What would
you say that you've learned that you might apply to your career as a lawyer as
you go forward, and what will be your best memory of your time at the
program?  
SUNE AGBUKE: What I've learned that I can apply to my career? We have‑‑ I
think everyone on the team has a great personality and we find ways to laugh
like at times when maybe we shouldn't laugh. So I think that lightheartedness
that sometimes we can use in moments that like we're broken like this and our
hearts are broken but we can go back in the locker room and someone can say
something and we can all kind of crack a smile, and I think that's something
I'll really take with me about not taking everything too seriously. What was
the next question?  
  
Q. What will be your best memory?  
SUNE AGBUKE: I think just getting on everybody's nerves.  
  
Q. I don't want to get you in trouble, but would you comment at all on the
considerable disparity in the number of trips to the foul line, particularly
in light of the fact that you guys were so clean during the standpoint of
collecting personal fouls in the first three rounds of this tournament? And
also, on the difference that that made in rebounding and the momentum of the
game.  
KIM MULKEY: Well, I'll answer it this way so that I don't get in trouble. I
think there were three things that really were critical in the difference in
the game. I thought when you have two teams of equal ability and they're
playing their hearts out and it's back and forth and it's back and forth, in
critical moments, the team that does something‑‑ make a play, usually wins,
and I thought Notre Dame got several offensive rebounds, long rebounds that
gave them another opportunity, and if you look at the stat sheet, it may not
jump out at you because it's really pretty similar, but it's when they got
those offensive boards.  
I thought role players for Notre Dame just absolutely killed us. When you can
hold Jewell Loyd to five for 18 and 13 points, you can't let Mabrey go five
for five, you can't let Cable hit a three, or four for four, but they were
five for five between the two of them, so that's, what, 15 points right there.
And then the third thing is we didn't get to the foul line enough. We got
there nine times and they got there 24, and I thought those were the three
things that stood out to me.  
  
Q. Did you feel like maybe you missed a chance in the first half? You're up
nine with a chance to extend it, and then they kind of got right back in it?  
KIM MULKEY: Well, you have the flagrant, so you had things that are‑‑ I can't
control that over on the sideline, and Sune is just not a dirty player. I just
find it funny that in two games she got a flagrant 1. Those mistakes do hurt
you, but we stayed in the game. We stayed in the game. We were in the game up
until the last minute of the game, but when you look at the last three or four
minutes of the game, I just thought those long rebounds when we'd make
defensive stops, and it was a four‑point, six‑point game, we just couldn't get
them, and then we stepped back, and you look at the big picture, you take away
the role players' points for Notre Dame, you take away some of those free
throws, it might have been a different game.  
I know that we're young, but guys, Notre Dame is young, too. So they'll have a
good team back, as well.  
  
Q. Coach, like a lot of players have mentioned, your team has a very bright
future. They're a young team. What are you looking forward to taking from this
experience?  
KIM MULKEY: Oh, I think we've got to get better defensively still. I think
that we have got to understand the importance and the value of just one play,
one rebound, and that comes with time. That comes with time. You've got a
player, and I just mentioned Jewell Loyd, we hold her five of 18, but the
truth is Jewell Loyd makes all those players get those points, and we don't
have that player, so we've got to get it from a bunch of different places.
We'll get better.  
  
Q. When you have players, some of your best players get into foul trouble,
especially late in the game, I imagine that's a very delicate balance between
playing hard and also being cautious to stay in the game. What do you tell
your players in those moments?  
KIM MULKEY: I don't know that I really tell them anything. I don't really talk
to them about don't foul or anything like that. I think I'm just coaching in
the moment on what we need to run, what we're doing defensively. If I feel
like they need to come out of the game, I'll sub in offense, defense, but that
never went through my mind because when they got in foul trouble, it was
really late in the game.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
MUFFET McGRAW: Well, we're excited that we're still dancing and have a chance
to enjoy some of this beautiful Oklahoma City weather today.  
  
Q. Lindsay, can you describe again the game last night and how you got into
the flow and what it was like for you going through this, the way you were
carrying the team in the first half?  
LINDSAY ALLEN: Yeah, in our game plan we really focused on getting those
free‑throw line jumpers, because we knew the way Stanford was playing us, we
were able to get those shots. We worked on that in practice and then
shoot‑around and then the posts really set really good screens us guards to
get those shots and kind of just read the defense a little bit.  
  
Q. Jewell, does last season give you guys any extra confidence, the game
last season against them give you any extra confidence going into tomorrow, or
does that even play a role?  
JEWELL LOYD: Last year is last year. Every year is different. We're a
different team. We have the same mindset, so we're focused and we're ready to
play.  
  
Q. Brianna and Taya, what concerns y'all the most about Nina Davis, a very
unique player, and what will you have to do to keep her under control?  
BRIANNA TURNER: She's super athletic so we're definitely going box her out and
keep her off the boards. She's going to be super aggressive. We know she's
going to play hard, so we're going to have to work with her the whole entire
game and don't give up or don't take plays off.  
TAYA REIMER: Yeah, I think exactly what she said, and for us as posts I think
our biggest focus is going to be rebounding for this game.  
  
Q. Taya, Stanford players said that energy was the difference last night.
Can you talk about the conditioning program and how you guys feel energy gives
you an advantage?  
TAYA REIMER: Yeah, well, our strength and conditioning coach, Craig Cheek,
does a great job, definitely pushing us and getting us ready for making runs
like this, and it's a long season, so he definitely helps us out with that. I
think that we just get energy from each other, too, and just‑‑ I mean
obviously when Lindsay Allen is making incredible plays and we're all just
really playing off of each other that gives us a lot of energy, and I think
that definitely helped.  
  
Q. Michaela, since this is your birthday today, give us a scouting report on
what you see of this Baylor team this year and what you remember from last
year, and how are they different?  
MICHAELA MABREY: Well, they share the ball really well. They know each other
inside and out, and I think their point guard does a really good job of
finding everybody, getting in gaps and finding everyone. They're extremely
athletic, and they bring a lot of energy to the game. We just have to keep
playing the way we've been playing and executing really well on offense and
defense.  
  
Q. Michaela and Jewell, since you are the veterans of the group, can you
tell me a little bit about the tradition of painting the fingernails green and
why you guys like it and why it's a cool tradition?  
JEWELL LOYD: Well, it's just something that we've always done. For us we
walked in and it was paint the nails day, and that's what we do. What's the
name of the polish that we use? We use all different polish, it just has to be
green. I like having my nails done.  
  
Q. Michaela, can you talk about what it means to have Kayla McBride with
you? Is she helping coach? Is she just a fan, encouraging, just what that does
for her to be part of the travel party?  
MICHAELA MABREY: Just having Kayla here, it means a lot to all of us. She's
been in the position that we are right now, and I think just having her here
and her giving us little advice here and there, I think just really maybe
calms us down or whatever she's saying I think just helps us in any way. I
love having her here.  
  
Q. Could you reflect back on last year, the game against Baylor,
specifically when ‑‑ and this is for all of you, specifically when Natalie got
hurt and what you remember about that moment?   
LINDSAY ALLEN: From what I remember last year we were on a really big run at
that time and we were just getting going a little bit, and our home crowd was
really loud for us and we were feeding off of their energy, and Natalie goes
down and it kind of sucks the air out of the room a little bit but she gets up
and gives us that inspiring speech and we know it's an extra deal for her,
make it to the Final Four.  
JEWELL LOYD: Yeah, I definitely agree with that. It was really passionate.
That's when we came together and said let's get it done. Let's play with some
heart. That's exactly what we did. Natalie stood up and walked up the court,
and it's like, all right, someone is going to step up. You know right away, so
we just played together.  
MICHAELA MABREY: I agree with what Lindsay and Jewell said. I think we were
going on a run at that point in time, and I think when Ace went down it kind
of sucked the air out of everything. But I think with her coming up, and I
think our fans really helped us, and I think they just kind of motivated us to
just finish the game and move on to the Final Four.  
TAYA REIMER: I mean, exactly what they said. It was definitely motivation, and
all of us wanted to finish that game out and come out with a W for her.
Obviously it being her senior season it was devastating for her and for all of
us because she was a huge part of our team, but we definitely just got some
motivation from it.  
BRIANNA TURNER: I was at my house watching on TV.  
  
Q. Jewell, can you talk about the guard match ‑up and particularly what you
see from Niya Johnson since you would have seen her last year?   
JEWELL LOYD: She's a really great point guard. She reads the ball really well.
She's very accurate, and the match‑up between her and Lindsay is going to be
awesome. Obviously I'm biased because this is my point guard here, but yeah,
she's a really good point guard. She's done a really good job for them.  
  
Q. Lindsay, Niya had 16 assists and no turnovers yesterday. First of all,
has Coach said anything to you about that stat, and that kind of stat, that
jumps out at you, doesn't it?  
LINDSAY ALLEN: No, Coach hasn't said anything to me about that, but I'm a
little jealous of it. Obviously, 16 assists and zero turnovers is pretty
impressive. She's just a great point guard for them. She knows how to get them
going. She knows where to get her players the ball and she's done a really
great job for them this year.  
  
Q. Stanford talked about energy was the difference last night. Can you talk
about the conditioning, the team effort that goes into getting your team
energy to outlast opponents?  
MUFFET McGRAW: We have such a great support staff in every way. Strength and
conditioning, training room, nutrition, it all goes into it. We travel with a
nutritionist, obviously travel with a trainer all the time, and our strength
and conditioning coach, Craig Cheek does a fantastic job. We've got the new
GPS system that we wear on our backs that tells us how hard we're working, do
we need to maybe take a day off. That has been really helpful to have some
statistical information. It's easy to look at them and know whether they're
tired or not. But I think we're in great shape, especially Jewell and Lindsay.
They can go all day. They've been in phenomenal shape all year long. They do a
great job in the weight room. They're prepared for this kind of game. And I
thought what hurt Stanford was when Lili Thompson got hurt in the first half
and went out, they didn't have another guard to put in, so I thought they got
a little tired in the second half because they had to play so much in the
first half.  
  
Q. Do you feel like you have to be better this time around than last year to
beat a Baylor team that is clearly excited about a rematch, and if so, how do
you feel like you're better?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Yeah, I think we're both very different teams, and both are
playing really well without the stars that graduated last year. I think they
are playing like we played the year that Skylar graduated. We came back the
next year, a lot of people thought we'd be down, and it's the same for them. I
think they've gotten really good contributions from a lot of different people,
so they're much more team oriented in that you can't focus on one person. In
some ways, a lot harder to guard and I think they've been incredibly
successful. Kim has done a terrific job this year. I think Coach of the Year
is certainly in that kind of game where you're rebuilding. You don't know
exactly what you have, so I think she's really done a terrific job.  
We've done a little rebuilding ourselves. I think we're a very different team
than we were last year and you see that in the lack of experience at times,
but a player like Jewell Loyd really can do a lot of things and cover up a lot
of the mistakes that we're making.  
  
Q. As an outsider looking in, how do you describe Nina Davis's game? It's so
unique and what do you have to do to keep her under control?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Well, unique is a perfect word to describe Nina Davis and her
game. She can take it off the rim and get to the basket at the other end as
quick as any guard in the country. She's got great speed. She is a great
rebounder. She is relentless. I think that's the thing about her that I
really, really like. She never quits. If she misses it she's going to go back
and get it. She plays at a high‑motor speed. She's really a tough match‑up for
the post, and that's what you talk about, who's going to guard her. We've been
in this situation a few times this year, but nobody with quite the athleticism
at that spot that she is, so she's a very difficult match‑up I think for
anyone.  
  
Q. You guys are 6 ‑0 all team in Elite 8. I'm wondering what it is about
this situation that works so well for you guys.   
MUFFET McGRAW: I think we go through the year and play every game the same
way, home or away, big game, regular game. It doesn't matter, we have the same
approach. We're not a team that is a fiery, motivational, inspirational, talk
before the game kind of‑‑ I don't have that personality. You know, we're
pretty steady. We take every game the same way, so when we get to this point
we're trying to treat it like another game. We take it in two games. The first
weekend was a two‑game series. This weekend we want to go 2‑0\. So I think we
just look at it and try to make it as businesslike as we can.  
  
Q. Obviously last year the game in South Bend, how much of a difference, if
any, do you think the fact playing on a neutral court and the fan distribution
might be a little bit more evenly spread?  
MUFFET McGRAW: I don't know if it's going to be even. I think last year
playing on our home court was a tremendous advantage, and I think I'm really
glad that the NCAA went away from playing on home courts, even though the
crowds were tremendous and the atmosphere was electric on our side. It really
is an unfair advantage.  
Now we're playing in Baylor's backyard so they have a chance to get us back a
little bit. Not too far from their campus, so I'm sure they'll have a lot of
fans out here, and I'm sure for them, they have a little bit of revenge on
their minds.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the development of your two post players and kind of
what you've seen from them as the season has progressed?  
MUFFET McGRAW: I think the reason that we've been successful this year is
because of the improvement of our posts. I think Taya Reimer is the
most‑improved player on our team. I think Brianna Turner, a fabulous freshman
but still needed some work coming in, and Kathryn Westbeld, our other post
player, the three of them have improved throughout the season. Carol Owens,
our post coach, I think is the best post coach in the country. The way they
fit into our offense, they've gotten comfortable. I think it's tough for
freshman to come in and be comfortable at any point. I think it's probably
taken them until February to really feel that ability that our offense is a
lot of just take what they give you, and that's difficult for freshmen. I
think they've really come a long way in terms of learning when they should
drive it, when they should shoot it, when they should pass it.  
  
Q. After the Connecticut game, of course you didn't have Bri in that game,
but after the Connecticut game you mentioned that you kind of wondered about
the toughness of your team. When did you finally realize that they had ‑‑ were
getting to that point where you liked to play tough, and indeed do you think
they've reached that level that you want them to play at?  
MUFFET McGRAW: I think they've definitely reached that level and then some. I
think we've seen that in a lot of games in the ACC. We saw that in our DePaul
game up in Chicago, which was shortly after the first loss of the season. So I
think they really showed a lot of resilience. But particularly in the posts. I
think our guards are pretty tough. They've been tough all year long, but I
think the post was where we were questioning it, and they definitely have come
along and come a long way.  
  
Q. You get a spark from Madison Cable coming off the bench, and Hannah now
provides that same kind of spark for you last night. Can you talk a little bit
what they mean to your program?  
MUFFET McGRAW: You know, I think it's really important that you have a great
player coming off the bench. I think it's a difficult decision who you're
going to start and sometimes you don't start your best five, sometimes you
start a really good chemistry group but you come in with somebody that can do
a lot of different things. I think the person coming off the bench has to have
the versatility to help you at both ends of the floor, and that's what Madison
Cable has been able to do for us all year long. She's had some great offensive
nights, but she's always steady defensively and she can rebound. So she can
come in and make a difference in the game, as can Hannah Huffman. She comes in
and provides energy. She's going to get a rebound or get a defensive stop.
She's not going to have a great stat line every game, but she's going to be a
very big contributor for us.  
  
Q. Did you sense that Hannah might have a little something extra going for
yesterday, the fact because she was playing against Stanford?  
MUFFET McGRAW: I think the minute the bracket was announced she noticed that
Stanford was in our bracket, and I think having never played against them her
four years, she has some friends on the team there, in fact a high school
teammate is on the team, so I think she was really, really excited about the
match‑up.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the point guard match ‑up and what you particularly
see from Niya Johnson?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Two great point guards, and both up for the Nancy Lieberman
Award, and in the top four in the country. I think that's going to be a really
fun match‑up for the fans to watch. Niya Johnson, the best passer in terms of
assist‑to‑turnover ratio and assists in the country, averaging eight assists a
game. She is just so good with the ball. She's got a great handle and she can
really see the floor. She makes great decisions. She gets her players the ball
exactly where they need it. She does so many things that don't show up on the
stat sheet, either. She gets the assist most of the time, but just to get the
ball and give it to them in such a way that they can be successful with it I
think is a really, really tremendous trait to have.  
  
Q. What was your assist ‑to‑turnover ratio as a player?   
MUFFET McGRAW: We didn't keep stats back then. I think we just had the abacus
that we were keeping score on at that point.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
Q. Niya, you were pretty candid last night looking ahead to the rematch and
talking about it. What do you remember from last year? You guys have talked
about the home court and played on their home court quite a bit. What are you
carrying into tomorrow?  
NIYA JOHNSON: Just the energy Notre Dame had. I guess they were just feeding
off their fans last year, and just adversity they went through, and just
taking us apart, our offense, by reading us and how we defend them and looking
at film from‑‑ well, looking at film today, we'll try to fix that, and it's
another great opportunity to play them again.  
  
Q. Nina, you said that it's kind of personal for you because you didn't feel
like you played that well in that game last year. How excited are you to get a
second chance at Notre Dame?  
NINA DAVIS: It's just a great opportunity just to be at this level and to be
able to play them again. We're just going to go out there and give it our all,
and whatever happens, happens, and hopefully we come out with a win.  
  
Q. Sune, just talk about being back in the Elite 8. Most teams would love to
be here once. You guys are back here again. How fortunate are you guys, and
now this time take care of business?  
SUNE AGBUKE: We're so blessed. We're blessed with the players we have on this
team, we're blessed with our coach, we're blessed to play for Baylor, and
coming here, you knew coming to this program that that's something you were
going to get to do. We're very blessed, and we're just looking forward to it,
to getting to go farther.  
  
Q. Imani, Alexis and Niya, can you talk about defending their guards,
particularly Lindsay Allen and Jewell Loyd?  
IMANI WRIGHT: They're great players. I think if we just stick to our game plan
and what we have to do, we'll do a pretty good job. Just being able to have
this opportunity again, it'll be great for us.  
ALEXIS PRINCE: Yeah, they have great guards. We just have to stick to our
defensive principles and hopefully we'll be able to slow them down.  
NIYA JOHNSON: Looking at last night's game, I noticed that Lindsay Allen was
on a roll, and you just have to stop that early and get them out of rhythm.  
  
Q. What gives you the confidence going into tomorrow that things have
changed since last year? What is it about this team that you feel better
about, maybe, than you did a year ago?  
NINA DAVIS: We're just different. We're a totally different team than we were
last year. I don't think you can compare the team we are this year to the team
we were last year. I think last year we were more focused one player. We
revolved around Odyssey Sims, and this year we have so many different weapons,
everybody steps up and it's really just confidence this year. Everybody steps
up, everybody knows their role and everybody plays their part. You can see
yesterday everybody stepped up on the big stage and everybody was able to
contribute and I think that's what makes us a better team than we were last
year, because you know which one of us to stop. You don't know who the ball is
going to go if we're in a close game at the end. That's what makes us
different from the team last year.  
  
Q. Going off of what Nina said, when you see Sune have a big game like she
did yesterday, having to step up because of the defense they were playing on
Nina, does that kind of remind you that you have to just kind of be prepared
just in case they're shutting down Niya or Nina at the same time and you guys
have to step up?  
IMANI WRIGHT: Yeah, Sune had an amazing game yesterday, and I'm excited when
everybody does well, and just having everybody be able to score and contribute
is big for us.  
ALEXIS PRINCE: Yeah, that's the type of team we are. Any given day, any player
can have a good game or go off. It doesn't matter if it starts on the
defensive end or the offensive end, and yesterday with Sune and Chris at
this's game.  
  
Q. Sune and Niya, can you talk about where the defense has evolved since the
beginning of the year, even looking back maybe at the Kentucky game, how the
defense has evolved since the beginning of the year?  
SUNE AGBUKE: Well, I think number one, we've really bought into it a lot more.
It did take a couple losses for us to really buy into that and realize that
what Coach Mulkey is teaching us every day in practice, she's been teaching us
every year, it's the way to win. And then I think the past couple weeks what's
really been helping us is our help side defense, and knowing that I'm going to
have Niya's back if she gets beat, I'm going to have Prince's back if she gets
beat, I'm going to have Imani's back and then I know Nina is going to have my
back with my man or Niya is going to have my back and we've had a lot of
success doing that, and we've really been communicating, we've been talking on
defense and being able to switch at points where we needed to do that and
knowing when we shouldn't switch. It's just really coming together for us, and
it starts with talking and communicating, and it starts with just really
buying into our defensive principles.  
NIYA JOHNSON: Coach Mulkey coaches a lot of emphasis on defense, and just
those two games that we lost, Iowa State and Oklahoma, we seen that from
watching film, we seen that our defense was horrible so we tried to fix that
in order to win ballgames and also get to a championship. Like Sune said, just
helping each other out, helping the helper, last night we did a very good job
with that, and just trying to help each other out in any way we can.  
  
Q. Kim, the girls were pretty candid last night when talking about having
another shot at Notre Dame, and I could have sworn I saw a little eye roll
from you at one point. Maybe, maybe not. I'm just curious about your thoughts,
if you embrace their desire to have another shot or if you're a little
concerned about maybe emotions being a little overspent coming in or where
you're at on that.  
KIM MULKEY: I don't remember an eye roll. I think like any competitor, you
remember who ended your season, and it's just ironic that we're in the same
situation as last year. I thought your question to Nina was outstanding, if I
can elaborate a little bit more, what makes us confident is they're not the
same Notre Dame team, either. You're playing really basically on a neutral
site. I tend to think it might be leaning a little bit toward Baylor because
hopefully we have more fans here than Notre Dame. But the teams are just
different. Notre Dame lost some great seniors. We lost an All‑American senior,
and that's what makes it a good opportunity for us to get back out on the
floor and play them again.  
  
Q. Kim, can you talk about that match ‑up inside because it seems like
that's where they lost a lot of their players was in the post area.   
KIM MULKEY: Yeah. Reimer and Turner are young, freshman and sophomore, and
they've had to fill big shoes for Notre Dame, and they've done it quite well.
It's a lot easier to fill those big shoes when you can have a Jewell Loyd
leading you out there, and I just think she's the best player in the country.
I think she's a difficult match‑up for everybody. She can just take over a
game at any time. I think that Sune will hold her own in the paint. Obviously
I think that Nina is having a great year. But I just thought Notre Dame's post
play was outstanding, and they've replaced it with outstanding talent.  
But it's a lot like us. Their team is young, too.  
  
Q. How much more difficult are they to prepare for when you see that a
Lindsay Allen can explode like that in the first half and you already have to
pay so much attention to Jewell Loyd?  
KIM MULKEY: Not any more difficult than it is for them to have to worry about
Sune Agbuke. It's just players make plays at this stage. Nobody wants their
season to end. You might throw a twist here and there defensively. You might
run one little quick hitter offensively. But the players win it now. The
players make plays, and it should be an interesting game. You have two teams
that score a lot of points. You have two teams that like transition. You have
two teams that use their bench, and you have two young teams. I hope that it
will be a good game. I hope that we certainly give them a better game than we
gave them in South Bend last year.  
  
Q. Coach, can you comment about the attendance here yesterday? Were you kind
of disappointed with the turnout for the game?  
A.I really can't give you a comment because I didn't pay attention to it. How
many did y'all bring?  
  
Q. I don't think they brought too many, yeah.  
KIM MULKEY: Yeah, well your men are in the tournament, too.  
  
Q. I think the announced attendance after the second game was 3,868 or
something like that.  
KIM MULKEY: Honestly I didn't pay attention to it.  
  
Q. Coach, it seems when I watch ‑‑ the best offense you'll have is when the
ball is moving around and everyone is touching. How big of an emphasis has
ball movement been this season?  
KIM MULKEY: Well, it's big because of what you've noticed. Our team can score
at all positions. We have players coming off the bench that can score equally
as well as those that are in the lineup starting. I just think that our
ability to not just always rely on Nina, she gets a lot of the attention, but
if you watch us play, we don't really run a whole lot of things for Nina. Nina
gets her stuff by going to the offensive boards. She gets her stuff in the
continuity of our offenses. I think we've just got to keep doing what we're
doing that got us to this point and hope that we can defend and just make a
basket or two more than they do.  
  
Q. Talk about your point guard, Niya, and the game that she had last night.
The stat that jumps out at you is 14 assists, no turnovers.  
KIM MULKEY: 16 assists, no turnovers. See you media? I have to get you
straight because you tell half the story. OK? It matters to a point guard, 16
or 14. She is unbelievable. I just thought‑‑ of course I see her every day,
and coaches always think their players are the best, and they should. But I've
seen Niya have 17 assists and no turnovers in 30 minutes of play earlier in
the year. I've seen Niya just lead a basketball team with her ability to find
the open player. She got to go against one of the better point guards last
night who a lot of people think is going to be a top draft pick, but she was
able to gauge herself against the best. I thought she did a tremendous job,
and she just is‑‑ what she would draw up as the facilitator out there, the
true point guard, makes everybody around her better. But she's also a scorer.
If I need a point, I'll tell her, you need to shoot the ball, and she'll do
it. She just thinks pass first.  
  
Q. Following that up, this might be an offbeat kind of question ‑‑  
KIM MULKEY: Not from the media. Come on now.  
  
Q. We try, you know. We like to try to get to the meat of the story. If you
were out to recruit, if you needed to get a particular player, what's the most
important player that you need to recruit for a basketball team in your eyes?
Is it a point guard, a forward?  
KIM MULKEY: It is an offbeat question. I think it depends on your team. I
think personally we have to go look for what our weaknesses are and what our
needs are. But if we're starting from scratch, I think you've got to have a
point guard and then probably after that I think you've got to go with a post
player, and then you fill in the parts around that.  
But that would just be if you're starting a program. If you're a pro franchise
and you're starting from scratch, you've got to have a ball handler. You've
got to have somebody that's the coach and quarterback on that floor. I think
it's the same way in football. You've got to start with a quarterback and then
you've probably got to go to your running backs and then your cornerbacks. I
don't know. I've played the position and I know how valuable it is.  
  
Q. You've talked about Jewell Loyd a little bit. What makes her the player
that she is and how do you go about trying to slow her down a little bit?  
KIM MULKEY: Well, nobody really slows her down. She's that good. She's
probably going to win every Player of the Year award out there. She can
offensive rebound when she needs to. She can defend the best player on the
other team if they need her to. She can elevate above most people guarding her
and score. She pushes it in transition and could play the point if she needed
to. She's just a very difficult match‑up.  
  
Q. You've said before, and we've seen it, Sune can make that shot, but she
doesn't take it a lot. Is it because she recognizes that's not her role, or is
that just what Iowa gave her?  
KIM MULKEY: Well, it's what Iowa gave her. She's never open that much. If
she's open at the foul‑line area, you've seen her, she'll shoot it. It's just
people didn't leave her open that much all year. She's not an offensive
liability, she just doesn't have to shoot it as much as the others. As big as
she is, honestly, Sune is more of a face‑the‑basket‑type of post player than
she is a back‑to‑the‑basket post player that makes great moves. She just had
openings last night and got on a roll, and when you make two or three, you
become more confident, and that rim gets bigger.  
It's good to see a senior play like that.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  

Notre Dame  81  
Stanford - 60

  
TARA VANDERVEER: I think we just lost to a really outstanding team.
Congratulate Notre Dame and Muffet. I thought our team played really well.
They had some outstanding players, and they really played a great game. I also
am really proud of our team, to work to get here, we came out I think with a
really great effort, and we just had a lot of people getting some real good
looks that didn't go down for us. I'm really proud of our seniors and the two
young women that are up here. I think they battled the whole night.  
  
Q. Bonnie, you had five threes, you pretty much kept Stanford in the game
for a while there. I was just wondering what was it like for you? Did you feel
that at some point things kind of ‑‑ you just ran out of gas as a team or
what? What was the difference in the game?   
BONNIE SAMUELSON: I think that in the first half Allen was shooting extremely
well, and in the second half I think we did a much better job on her. But I
just think that some turnovers hurt us, and I don't know, like Coach said, we
were missing some shots that we normally make but I thought we battled really
hard the whole game. Disappointing way to go out. We kind of got within five a
couple times, but it just kind of kept slipping away from us when it got to
that point.  
  
Q. Erica, talk about battling down low and how difficult, because you did a
great job on the boards.  
ERICA McCALL: They had really strong post players, so one of the keys was just
keeping them up top and not letting them get easy buckets. I think our posts
did pretty good as far as not giving them a lot of easy lay‑ups, but it was a
really physical game, and we battled out there and just didn't come out how we
wanted to.  
  
Q. Tara, did you have to change your strategy on Allen as far as coming off
screens, coming in front of the screener or behind? How were you ‑‑ I know you
had a bunch of different people playing her, but did you change your tactics
on her?   
TARA VANDERVEER: Well, I think in the beginning of the game, we had Amber on
her, and we were looking to help off of her a little bit, and so, yeah, we
helped less. She got going, and she got too many open looks. We were really
concerned about obviously Turner inside and Reimer inside, and they did really
well. But we definitely gave Allen too much space. We talked to‑‑ I talked to
Bri about tightening up on her. Amber is our real defensive stopper, and we
only have one Amber, so we kind of made the choice sometimes of who to put her
on. Sometimes she was on Loyd. But we did make some, I think, better
adjustments in the second half. But she got too many open looks in the first
half.  
  
Q. What happened to Lili in the first half?  
TARA VANDERVEER: I didn't see what happened, but I think she bruised‑‑ came
down on her knee. But she was cleared and was good to go, but she didn't seem
to be moving as well as she needed to be.  
  
Q. Coach, as good as Allen was in the first half, it looked like Loyd was
that good in the second half. Was it kind of just choose your poison?  
TARA VANDERVEER: Well, that was‑‑ I think they're really a talented team.
Jewell Loyd is probably the Player of the Year. We were just dodging some
bullets in the first half, and she picked it up in the second half. They have
weapons at every position. They have‑‑ there's no one you couldn't sag off of.
You had to guard every single one of them every minute, and if you just made a
mistake, they made you pay.  
I mean, I think we worked pretty hard, but we did not play the type of defense
that we needed to play.  
  
Q. Talk about what separates Jewell Loyd, and why is she so good?  
TARA VANDERVEER: Well, I don't think she's probably‑‑ if you talk to Muffet, I
wouldn't say this was probably her A game. It might not have even been her B
game. They isolate her. She can knock down the three. She went to the basket
really strong, I think she was 100 percent from the free‑throw line, 7 for 7.
7 for 21 I don't think was probably a great game for her, but she ends up with
six rebounds, second‑most rebounds on their team. She's a fantastic athlete,
and they take care of the ball. They had nine turnovers. They're a very tough
team to guard because at every position they're very, very talented. They're
very skilled.  
  
Q. You've always been known for having a very disciplined offense. Would it
be fair to say tonight maybe some of the individual players were trying almost
too hard individually as opposed to getting the ball to the hot hand and
really the ball movement and that sort of thing that Stanford has been known
for in other years?  
TARA VANDERVEER: Well, this year has been a really different year for us.
Without the post game that we've ordinarily had, whether it's Jayne Appel,
Brooke Smith, you can go back to Val Whiting, you saw sometimes when we had
lay‑ups, and we have to be able to‑‑ we're going to have to develop that part.
We have not been‑‑ we have not moved the ball as well as we need to, and
that's something that, again, you're running some new stuff and you have some
young players. But a lot of it, the credit belongs to Notre Dame. Their
defense was active. They forced us into turnovers. They really shot a very
good percentage, and that's a credit to them.  
But we know that our team, we got some really good looks, and people have made
shots. Lili did not shoot well tonight. Other people, Bonnie, I thought got
some good looks that knocked down, but Bri, 1 for 7, Lili, 1 for 8, Brit, 1
for 4, 0 for 3, you're not going to beat a team like this unless you knock
down shots. It was tough, but credit to them, their defense was excellent, and
we have our work to do.

### [Lisa Bluder](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16868)

### [Melissa Dixon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24378)

### [Samantha Logic](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22973)

  
_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  

Baylor  81  
Iowa - 66

  
LISA BLUDER: It's tough to see the season come to an end. We had a great run.
We had great seniors. Just super kids in our program. I'm so proud of the type
of kids we have in our program. They're incredible role models, they're great
students, they're wonderful to come to work with every day, and I just
appreciate them so much and appreciate my seniors. The effort that they've
given us the last four years has been nothing but amazing, and I'm so
appreciative of those young ladies. It's hard to remember the good times.
Sometimes the last one is so painful, but I'm going to try and remember all
the good ones we had this year.  
  
Q. Samantha and Melissa, as you look back on your four years in the program,
if you had one or two Kodak moments that years from now you want to share,
what would they be and why?  
MELISSA DIXON: Yeah, there's a lot over the last four years. It's obviously
been the best four years, but making it to the Sweet 16 definitely has to be
up there. It was a goal not only for this year but for the last four years,
and to finally do it, it was so special, and it's something I'm going to
remember for the rest of my life. I'm so thankful to have done it with these
people and to have been a part of this program for the last four years.  
SAMANTHA LOGIC: Yeah, probably No.1 would be Sweet 16 basketball wise. Like
she said, we wanted to get here and we've built up to it. It wasn't something
that was just tradition here, and we wanted to start a tradition now for the
future Hawks, and the current ones right now we want them to keep building on
it so badly because they deserve it just as much as we do. There's so many
things off the court that people don't even know. You're going to remember
even more than big wins, probably at Penn State last year, top‑10 team in the
country, besides beating them, like dancing in the locker rooms, the
aftereffects of that. Things like that is what you're going to miss the most,
I think.  
  
Q. Sam, obviously number ‑wise a great performance by both you and Niya
Johnson. I think the two of you combined for 30 assists and one turnover.
Assess your performance, both you and she?   
SAMANTHA LOGIC: Obviously, yeah, she's the leader of that team, great passer,
great leader on the floor, conducts that offense really well, puts her team in
a position obviously to win, and I think any day you're going to take that win
over any other stat. Just congrats to Baylor. Very good basketball team, and
they're going to make a run, I think. The next game, that'll be a fun game to
watch. But I'm just happy to go out with my team. I mean, do battle with this
team. I wouldn't pick anyone else.  
  
Q. Your fans had a 10 ‑hour drive to get here unless they flew. If they
flew, they were flying into a tornado. It still was a remarkable
representation out there. How much does that mean to you, and did you feel
that, and also the enthusiasm from the bench while you were out there on the
floor?   
SAMANTHA LOGIC: Yeah, we always do. Our fans are great. That's why I think
it's a huge part of our 18‑0 at home. We were playing in front of them.
They're so supportive of us and they have been for four years. I think you saw
just a glimpse of that today. That's a long drive and a lot of people not
even‑‑ might not even personally know someone. They just love Hawks. They just
love watching us play, and we love playing for them, but yeah, you always feel
that enthusiasm there. They're just waiting for a run for us. In the first
half, you feel it and our bench we always feel it. They are so great, they're
loud, they're enthusiastic. They want to win so bad that they really just
don't care about their own minutes. I think this whole team is so selfless in
that way. They just want to celebrate for us so badly and I think it's just so
apparent to everyone watching that how much we love playing together, even if
they're not on the floor.  
  
Q. Melissa, talk a little bit about when Doolittle went out, getting hit in
the nose. You guys went on a run and how that changes, and Samantha, talk
about the adjustment you made posting up?  
MELISSA DIXON: Yeah, we obviously felt really bad for Beth when she went down
and we all kind of came together. We're like, we want to do this for Beth. We
want to get it for Beth. I think we just kind of rallied around that and tried
to go on a run for that. We just came up a little bit short.  
SAMANTHA LOGIC: Yeah, without Beth in there, it's tough. She's one of the best
posts in the Big Ten. She's so versatile offensively and defensively, just a
huge part of our team for the last four years, and I don't think I'd take any
other post. But with her out, think we kind of spread the floor a little bit,
and just having a size advantage, I like posting up. I just looked at that a
little bit more across the board because we didn't have that presence in there
to try to make up. Not going to make up too much without her, but just try
what you can do.  
  
Q. You guys went on a really nice run at the end of the first half. I think
you scored 11 in a row to get within two. How big were those two three
‑pointers that they hit at the end of the half to open it back up to 8?   
SAMANTHA LOGIC: Yeah, that was big, going from a one‑possession game to a
three‑possession game pretty much, it was big‑time shots by them. We lost‑‑
one of them we just lost in our zone. You just can't deal with that. We can't
have that happen, obviously, and then the other one was just at the buzzer,
just kind of crazy defense, was just trying to get a steal and they just found
her at the right time. We would have had momentum going in the half and we've
just got to learn to get stops there. Might have been a different game then.  
MELISSA DIXON: Yeah, we were finally taking our run and we were finally
getting stops and were able to push it in transition. We were finally trying
to go up on them, but we just kind of collapsed on some drivers and they got
some open looks that way, and it just kind of cut our run a little bit.  
  
Q. Samantha, did that linger at all in the second half when you came out? I
think you went three minutes without scoring after halftime?  
SAMANTHA LOGIC: I don't think it did, mentally at least, because we were
getting good looks. We're really good shooters as a team. I thought we were
getting good looks, weren't rushing or anything. I thought we still were
taking good shots, they just weren't falling. Their shots were falling, some
uncharacteristic ones so you've just got to battle through that, and I thought
we did a good job trying to make a little run after we knocked some shots
down.  
  
Q. Melissa, they were obviously pretty set on face guarding you all night
and taking you out. Talk about fighting through that and trying to get open
and trying to remain a part of the offense.  
MELISSA DIXON: Yeah, it's happened before, but with our team, you know, I just
kind of have to not let it frustrate me because we have so many offensive
threats on our team, that if they are going to take my three‑point shooting
away, someone else is going to be open and we're going to have four other
great scorers who are going to have open looks, so it's just kind of taking it
and just not being frustrated and knowing that it's helping my teammates get
open.  
  
Q. I don't want to get you in trouble, but could you talk about the
disparity in foul shooting since both teams seemed to be driving the paint?  
LISA BLUDER: Yeah, we really could not get to the free‑throw line. At halftime
that was the difference. They were 9 for 9 from the free‑throw line, we didn't
shoot a single will free throw. You have to go back a ways to probably find
that. That was very unfortunate for us not to get to the free‑throw line. I
felt like even at the end of the game, free‑throw line and second‑chance
points were the biggest‑‑ our biggest problems.  
  
Q. You know obviously that Niya is going to be a big assist part of their
game, but what Sune gave them in points and rebounds, was that debilitating
for you guys?  
LISA BLUDER: I think so. Obviously she was feeling it tonight. She was well,
well, well over her average, and you really can't have that. Playing in one of
these games, you know Davis is going to get hers. We knew that. But you really
need to keep track of everybody else, and she really did very, very well
today. She hit the 15‑foot shot like it was a lay‑up today for her.  
  
Q. Talk a little bit about those two quick fouls early. Did that change
things because it was on Doolittle and Samantha?  
LISA BLUDER: When Beth got the two fouls, that's not good for us. There was a
point we just wanted to get to halftime almost because she's our leading
rebounder, she's our paint person. We're just‑‑ she does so many things for
us, she transitions so well. When she got the two fouls, that was tough. And
then I just had to make the decision to go back in with her. When they got up
11, we went back with her and obviously you could see the impact she made when
she was in the game. In the last two minutes, I felt like we had to take her
out to try not to get that third foul and again they hit those two
three‑pointers at that point. But Beth is a big part of our team. She's been
unbelievable, and I hate that she ends her career here with a broken nose
tonight. It's really unfortunate, and I feel bad for her.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  

Notre Dame  81  
Stanford - 60

  
MUFFET McGRAW: Well, I'm just thrilled that we're advancing to the Elite 8.
It's exciting having both the men's and women's teams in the Elite 8. Today we
did just a good job, so many different contributions. Lindsay Allen, Hannah
Huffman, great minutes off the bench and of course Jewell Loyd, what can you
say about the Player of the Year. She did everything that should could do to
help us win. Really, really pleased. Stanford is a great team. Lili Thompson's
injury in the first half I think hurt them a little bit when she came out,
hurt their depth at guard and I thought maybe a little more fatigue in the
second half without having the rotation when she came back. But just so, so
happy right now.  
I've got to get to bed, so if we could...  
  
Q. Jewell, talk a little bit about Stanford's defense in the first half and
how it allowed you to get Lindsay involved and then in the second half you
kind of took over?  
JEWELL LOYD: I think just the ball screen was really effective for us. We came
out, got great screens from the post. Lindsay is a great guard. She realizes
her shot is right there and she lit it up. It's another day in the office for
Lindsay.  
  
Q. Jewell, with about five minutes into the second half they cut the lead to
about four, and then you guys called a time ‑out. What was the huddle like at
that point and what was kind of the turnaround?   
JEWELL LOYD: Well, we knew we had to refocus ourselves. We knew that we've
been in situations like that before, so we had great leadership from Lindsay
and just everyone else was communicating, it's not over, keep fighting, keep
your heads up and get it done. It was very effective.  
  
Q. Hannah, you were really fired up out there on the court, obviously had a
big second half. What does it mean to you to be able to do it on this stage in
a role just kind of playing what was there and then having the opportunity to
score, as well?  
HANNAH HUFFMAN: Well, Sweet 16 is very exciting and I am just really happy
that I was able to help out my team. When you are feeding off that energy ‑‑
when Lindsay is playing like she is playing, when Jewell is playing like how
she's playing, it's such a fun environment. As a basketball player these are
moments that you live for, so I was just happy I was able to go out there and
help out my team.  
  
Q. Lindsay, do you recall being in a zone like that at the college level in
any way?  
LINDSAY ALLEN: I want to say the UCLA game was also like that, but our posts
did a really great job of setting screens and we were just reading the defense
really well and getting open shots for our offense.  
  
Q. Lindsay, Jewell, Hannah, talk also about the rematch right now. I know
it's right after the game, but you've got a rematch from last year going
against Baylor.  
JEWELL LOYD: I think we're just really excited to play another game. We're
focused, ready. Baylor is a great team. They're very consistent, good point
guards, good post players, and I think we have good post players and good
point guards, too, so we're really excited and we're ready to play.  
LINDSAY ALLEN: You know, we're really excited to make it to the Elite Eight
and play a great team in Baylor. Like Jewell said, they have great guard play,
a great post player in Nina Davis. They're a really athletic team and we're
looking forward to that match‑up.  
HANNAH HUFFMAN: We'll be dialed in at practice tomorrow. Coach will come up
with a great game plan and I cannot wait.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about Lindsay's maturity in recognizing that she
needed to step up and produce some offense?  
MUFFET McGRAW: You know, we came into the game working on the ball screen, and
we felt that Lindsay was going to get a lot of free‑throw jumpers. I didn't
expect she was going to get so many threes. That really surprised me. She is
somebody that's a very selective shooter, and I thought today she just felt
it, and she had the green light, and she kept shooting. And then you saw in
the second half she tried to get everybody else involved, and I think that's
the true point guard coming out in her.  
  
Q. Talk about your defense. You guys really shut Stanford down. They really
struggled a lot with their shots.  
MUFFET McGRAW: Yeah, I thought except for Samuelson. I thought she played
really well. We couldn't seem to find her standing on the three‑point line. I
thought when we started switching, and that's when Hannah came in, and I think
that's one of the best things she did for us. We went with a switching 1
through 4, and I thought that was probably the difference. We were able to
guard them a lot better off the ball screen. I think the posts were able to
loosen up inside and take anybody that came to the rim. I thought that was
probably the difference.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the impact and energy Hannah Huffman brought you
guys?  
MUFFET McGRAW: You know, Hannah has done a great job all year of bringing us
energy. She comes in, she plays as many minutes as we allow her, and she is
thankful and happy to have them. She always gives us 100 percent in practice,
and she came in today, she was a great spark, and I thought with their lineup
with the four guards that we wanted to keep her on the floor. Really, really
pleased with her numbers. Statistically, she makes some great passes, she
doesn't turn the ball over, she rebounds, she defends, she does everything we
need her to do.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Jewell? She's just getting so much attention. People
are getting really physical with her. Talk about how she handles it and how
your team reacts to needing to take some pressure off of her?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Yeah, I think that teams are going to be physical with her.
She's strong, but I thought today she made some really great plays around the
basket. I thought the three‑point play that she had was critical. She got
fouled a couple times in that stretch where they were‑‑ I think they cut it to
four and we went on a little bit of a run. I thought it was almost all her.
She did a really good job in the second half, but she is going to draw the
most attention, which is why you see Lindsay Allen making so many shots.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  

Baylor  81  
Iowa - 66

  
Q. Sune, I'm guessing the game plan wasn't to go to you for 23 points. Was
that just something that opened up or where did that come from, I guess?  
SUNE AGBUKE: They were really crowding down on Nina. I think that was their
game plan to keep her from getting the ball and I was wide open and I did a
great job and my teammates did a great job of getting me the ball, and it was
going in.  
  
Q. I was about to ask roughly the same question or what they put in your
Gatorade because we knew you were a rebounding machine, and last week a
blocking machine. Is this a career high in scoring for you?  
SUNE AGBUKE: Yeah, I haven't gotten into double digits once.  
  
Q. Sune, if you could, describe the emotions from having a game like that in
your senior season and last tournament? What does that feel like?  
SUNE AGBUKE: I think the greatest feeling you have as a player is getting to
come through for your team. Any opportunity you have to do that, you get to
come through for your team, and that's just the best feeling.  
  
Q. Niya, 16 assists tonight, no turnovers. What was clicking for you?  
NIYA JOHNSON: Really just finding the open teammate, trying to drive and
attack, make them close down on me and hit Sune in her sweet spot which is the
free‑throw line, and like I said, just finding my teammates.  
  
Q. Nina, talk a little bit about your focus coming into the game because the
zone spread things out but you looked like you were still attacking and going
to the basket?  
NINA DAVIS: We pretty much knew they would come out in a zone, but we couldn't
let it slow us down. My mindset coming into every game is to keep attacking,
whether they are in a man or a zone. I just had that mindset and I was
attacking and when they were doubling down on me I was getting the ball to
Sune and she did a great job of stepping up today.  
  
Q. Niya, you guys got off to the 8 ‑0 lead, then expanded the lead, and then
late in the first half it got down to one possession, you hit two big
three‑pointers. How big was that going into halftime and carrying that
momentum into the second half?   
NIYA JOHNSON: That was huge. I was on a run and Prince hit a big shot and I
told her good shot and she said, I don't know how that that went in, but that
was huge because they was getting complacent and also getting our excitement,
thinking they could come back and run on us the next half and play with us. I
told Prince that was a huge shot.  
  
Q. Niya, you had the 16 assists but you only needed the one to break
Odyssey's record. What does that mean to you to pass Odyssey and move into
first all ‑time for Baylor?   
NIYA JOHNSON: That's huge, being a leader in assists at Baylor and passing
Odyssey Sims, which she's a great player, I'm just thankful for getting the
opportunity, and it's a blessing.  
  
Q. Sune, was your heart beating a little fast as the officials go to the
screen after the elbow caught the gal, or what's going through your head at
that point?  
SUNE AGBUKE: It was such an accident. I really didn't mean to. I felt bad, but
I was like, is that really a flagrant because I felt like I just kind of
stepped through. I didn't mean to hit her in the face. My teammates kind of
had to calm me down because I did feel bad, but it was completely
unintentional.  
  
Q. Everybody is talking about offense. I thought the defense was phenomenal
tonight. You held one of the leading scoring teams in the nation that averages
80 a game to 66. Could you talk a little bit about the preparation and how you
did that?  
SUNE AGBUKE: We knew that they scored a lot of points a game. We scored about
the same amount in the 70s, but looking at defense statistically, it was night
and day, so that for us was going to be our focus. We knew that if they were
going to score 80 points we're not going to win. And we knew we could score
and we weren't going to have trouble with that, but we did have to limit their
threes and limit their transition buckets, and that's what we did.  
NIYA JOHNSON: I just thought that the guards did well defending their
perimeter players, especially Dixon. She was 2 for 10 from the three‑point
line, and she averages about four a game, and I just thought that Prince and
me and Imani and Kristy, as well, did very good on her, as well as Samantha
Logic, just throwing different bodies at her.  
  
Q. Niya, was it flow of the game, you go to Sune, you go to Kristy, those
are not options A and B usually. Was that just flow of the game or was that
that was open?  
NIYA JOHNSON: Most certainly. They was hot at the moment so I kept feeding
them the ball and telling them to shoot it and attack and just opened up the
offense for us.  
  
Q. Back in the Elite 8, potentially playing Notre Dame again just like last
year. Does that game carry any extra weight going into tomorrow?  
NIYA JOHNSON: Yeah, we didn't forget going to the Elite 8, them beating us at
our home place, and we still talk about that to this day. We're just going to
go out there and attack because we don't remember the wins, we just remember
the losses.  
SUNE AGBUKE: Yeah, we've talked about it, and for us it's not just thinking
about that loss last year, either, but we do have a tradition at Baylor. We're
4‑1 against them, so going in as a group, we feel like we're 0‑1, but we do
have to kind of uphold our end for Baylor and come out and make it 5‑1,
hopefully.  
NINA DAVIS: It's definitely a game that has been in the back of our minds. I
think once we was put in the Oklahoma bracket with them, that was probably the
first thing that popped in our minds. But all tournament long, we just
couldn't overlook the other teams that we had to play. Of course we was
anxious to play Notre Dame but they had to get to the game tomorrow and we had
to get to the game, too, and then when we get that, we can finally focus and
go out there to watch and see if we have a chance to beat them, have a chance
to play them.  
  
Q. Kim, Niya talked about this a little bit, but discuss the game plan for
Melissa Dixon. You guys were able to take her out pretty well. Not a lot of
teams have a three ‑point shooter like that. What was the plan of attack for
her?  
KIM MULKEY: Well, there wasn't a specific one for her. The entire team was
challenged as we have been since the day they put on a Baylor uniform to play
defense, and if you look at the NCAA statistics, I thought that jumped out at
us in that Iowa scores a lot of points. They like to push the ball. They shoot
a lot of threes. We like to push the ball. We score a lot of points, we don't
shoot as many threes. So then you go and look at points allowed, and we're at
58, and they're in the 70, 72 range. I've said from day one in every interview
I've had that defense is going to decide the game, and I just thought we were
very disciplined defensively at all positions. There was no box‑and‑one,
triangle‑two, doubling anybody. I just thought we made them use the shot
clock. They don't like to do that. They like to take a lot of quick shots in
transition and push it, and I just thought we never really gave them a lot of
easy shots.  
  
Q. I looked up, it might have been one of Sune's last shots she hit, but
obviously she had an advantage down low but she was hitting a lot of 15, 16
‑footers, and you kind of turned to the bench and had your arms up like this.
Were you amazed?   
KIM MULKEY: No, Sune‑‑ that is a very good shot for Sune. Sune can face up and
shoot that. It's just she never gets that opportunity because people don't
guard Nina the way Iowa was guarding her tonight. They just were leaving Sune
open, so that's a free throw, and so Sune is a senior, and that's not‑‑ she
doesn't shoot a lot for us because she's not given that opportunity up there.
They chose to guard us that way, and Sune will shoot it every time she's left
open.  
I'm not responsible sometimes for what I do or see or say on that sideline, so
it was probably one of those gestures like, she's a senior and doesn't want
her year to end.  
  
Q. Kristy also, just what you got from her, hit her first seven shots.  
KIM MULKEY: Well, Kristy has been doing that all year. Kristy is a kid that
plays a lot of international basketball. She's on the junior national team
from her country, and she has started many games, both at point‑‑ she can play
the off guard, and I've got basically four perimeter players, and any of the
three can have great nights, or any of the four can have great nights. I just
rotate them in and out of there.  
  
Q. You have a pretty young team, just the one senior, a couple of juniors.
Different group than what you've had so much success with. Where have you seen
the greatest growth from the beginning to where they are now in the Elite 8?  
KIM MULKEY: Defense. I think we're playing better team defense. Didn't see
some of it tonight because they were really concerned about the three ball,
but I just think from the time we started to today and really surfaced during
the conference tournament championship, I just see a team that's just really
understanding what we're trying to do. When they're on help side, when they're
on ball side, when to front, not front, and it usually takes this long when
you have this many young players. We have Prince out there. She hasn't played
in two years. You have Imani who's now starting, you have Kristy Wallace who
came to Baylor, she's a freshman, you've got Nina Davis whose role now is that
everybody focuses on her because Odyssey is gone.  
They've just kind of gone under the radar all year nationally. I don't think
regionally and locally Baylor has gone under the radar, but I just‑‑ to think
I've had the opportunity to watch Niya Johnson have 16 assists and no
turnovers and have to guard people like she did, and she did it earlier in the
year, she had 17 and no turnovers. I played the position. That's hard to do.  
  
Q. At about the five ‑minute mark remaining in the first half, that's when
Sune picked up her second foul, you took her out of the game, Iowa makes their
run. Does a game like this show you how valuable Sune is right there?  
KIM MULKEY: It doesn't show me. I've been knowing that. We're a different team
when Sune is not on the floor. Sune is on that floor because she's super
intelligent, she's big, she alters shots, she helps teammates. She anticipates
things, and yes, I was disappointed at that point. In fact, it was 3:52, I
think, to go at that media time‑out, and I inserted Khadijiah Cave, and I
talked to all of them in that time‑out. At that point I think we had a
13‑point lead and they went on a 9‑0 run, and before they ever went on their
9‑0 run, I told them, guys, this is where games are won and lost, and dang if
they didn't go on a 9‑0 run. I took K K out. I felt like she was not defending
Doolittle very well and I gave a freshman a chance, and I thought Dekeiya
Cohen did good. In fact I think she got two offensive boards down there. I
thought we ended it good with Prince getting the shot there at the end, but at
that moment, runs like that can cost you a game.  
  
Q. You commented on defense a while ago. I want you to talk about this. As
aggressive as you're playing on defense, fighting over screens, etcetera,
tonight in the first half they never shot a free throw. You were 11 out of 11,
you only had three team fouls. Early in the year that was a problem. Talk
about that a little bit.  
KIM MULKEY: I can tell you were a coach because your questions are so
basketball related and I love it. It wasn't just playing defense. One of the
ways for us to win the game was to keep them off the foul line and for us to
get to the foul line, and we absolutely did. I think they were like‑‑ well,
they were 3 for 7 from the foul line, and it wasn't the typical hand check or
trying to block shots. It was the discipline in how we guarded them. We always
had our hands up here because they can get shots off quick. When they drove
back we didn't try to come down and hack, we just made them make shots over us
and we had to do that because our help side was not going to be as good as it
usually is because we had shooters out there. So I thought the discipline that
we showed defensively kept them off of the foul line, and that was one of the
ways we felt we could win the ballgame.  
  
Q. Going back to Alexis's big shot to end the half, how big was that
momentum wise, second half you come out, shoot 50 percent, step on the gas and
never look back?  
KIM MULKEY: Well, it was big because we had lost momentum, they had gone on
that 9‑0 run and I thought about actually putting Sune back in the game
because we'd done that before and she'd been disciplined enough not to pick up
her third. In fact I think Doolittle came back in the game with two fouls and
I chose to stick with a sophomore off the bench when they went on their 9‑0
run. It was big as far as momentum. It was. And then we had the possession
coming out of halftime.  
  
Q. Niya said earlier that you guys don't remember the wins, you remember the
losses, and I wonder the last time you played a Sweet 16 game in this
building, it obviously was one of the more disappointing losses for you,
Brittney Griner's last game. Has that game been on your mind at all since
you've been here?  
KIM MULKEY: No.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
TARA VANDERVEER: My team is very excited to be here. We've had a season that
has been, I think, a great learning opportunity for us, and we're playing
against an excellent opponent in Notre Dame. I feel that our team is working
very hard, and we expect a great game.  
  
Q. Can you talk about your relationship with Coach McGraw when you two are
together? You're picking each other's brains about basketball, or is there
more to the respect and the relationship?  
TARA VANDERVEER: Well, I remember Muffet as actually a young player when we
worked Cathy Rush Basketball Camp together, and so we kind of go way back. But
it's amazing to me that in all the time we've been in the tournament and in
all the time they've been in the tournament, we've never been in the same
bracket together. So we see each other maybe sometimes on the road, we talk,
we're on different committees together, and we've seen each other at the Final
Four. But for the most part, you know, it's some Xing and Oing a little bit,
but most of it is just kind of how are you doing, how is your family doing,
that kind of thing.  
  
Q. Considering Stanford and Notre Dame's academic and athletic similarities,
are you surprised that you haven't played more than just twice in all these
years?  
TARA VANDERVEER: You know, I really am. Muffet and I actually were talking on
the phone before the bracket came out, and she's like, we've never been in the
same bracket together, and now here we are.  
But we did play‑‑ it was like a way back, home and away, and I know our
football team does, and I think that it would be a really good thing. She does
a fabulous job. They have a great program, and I think it would be a good
thing to get going. I'm saying that before we play them. I might change my
mind after.  
  
Q. I know it's a long time ago, but how much (inaudible)?  
TARA VANDERVEER: I think it's always a benefit to beating a really good team.
It helps people's confidence. You have to ‑‑ everyone, in order to beat a team
like Notre Dame, you have to do what you did against Connecticut, and it's
good for our team to know that they're capable of playing that caliber of
team.  
  
Q. How did the bus from the airport go? I understand you were pelted with
hail during the storm.  
TARA VANDERVEER: Well, we fortunately landed before the storm broke, and it
was extremely dark, and I said something to our bus driver, could this be a
tornado. And he was like, oh, no, no, and it really was quite a storm with
hail on the bus, and we were getting the tornado warnings on our phone. We
were thankful to get to the hotel.  
  
Q. And what do you see from Notre Dame when you see the tapes, especially
Loyd? What do you think of them?  
TARA VANDERVEER: You know, they are really talented at every position. Loydis
‑‑ I watched Jewell Loyd play as a young player. She's an absolute phenom.
It's more than just her, and it's more than them individually, they play
extremely well together. Again, I think Muffet does an excellent job. They
really pass the ball. Their team, if you weren't playing them, would be really
fun to watch. They pass the ball, they move the ball really well, they play
very up tempo. They're very skilled players. I think they have very high
offensive efficiency, very unselfish, they work at both ends of the floor.
Quite honestly they really don't have any weaknesses.  
  
Q. (No microphone)  
TARA VANDERVEER: Well, you know, obviously you don't like to get down, but
sometimes we`re ‑‑ our team is in a lot of ways a young team and not a‑‑ we
haven't had a set starting lineup all year. We play a lot of different people,
and sometimes it takes us a little while to kind of figure out what's working,
who's working, putting ‑‑ kind of figuring out the puzzle. And then I will say
that I think our team has really demonstrated some outstanding resiliency in
that if we're down, they don't get discouraged, they don't get frustrated,
they don't get on each other, they just keep just digging a little deeper and
playing a little harder.  
  
Q. (No microphone)  
TARA VANDERVEER: You know, this has been a little bit of what I affectionately
call a roller coaster season for us in that we have been able to beat great
teams, and we've played very well against them, really good teams, even if we
lost. Beating Connecticut with a couple of free throws we beat Texas early
when they were healthier. We have opportunities to win in, I'd say, five games
that we lost. And then we lost some games that were really disappointing, and
then we kind of got a little run going by beating Oregon State at Oregon
State, which was our PAC‑12 regular season winner. And then coming out in the
tournament, our team played really well in the PAC‑12 tournament, and I think
the tournament has given us a springboard into the NCAA Tournament of just
like, hey, this is what we need to do, and let's get it done.  
There's really a very unselfish group, but we're not sure who it's going to be
that day. Some days it's been maybe Taylor Greenfield; other days it`s been
Bri Roberson; another days it's been Erica McCall. It's been different people
stepping up in different games.  
  
Q. How do you feel about the return the NCAA made returning to pods, one;
and two, late tip ‑off times, it doesn't affect you so much, but East Coast
teams, 10:00 games are a little difficult.   
TARA VANDERVEER: You know, I think being in it this long, the first question
was about‑‑ you know, playing at the home site, I think, is probably something
that we need right now in women's basketball. We've experimented with other
things, and that seems to be a good thing and it seems to work. As far as the
game times and all the decisions that are made by the higher‑ups at the NCAA,
I'm excited to be playing, and our team will play anywhere, anytime, however
we can do it.  
I just don't even bother worrying about it, thinking about it or complaining
about it. You know, we are so thrilled to be here and so excited to be playing
and have just the tremendous opportunities that‑‑ someone else is figuring
that out, and that's not me.  
  
Q. Amber, does the fact that you played UConn and beat them give you a
little bit more confidence against another top team like Notre Dame?  
AMBER ORRANGE: It does. It shows us that we're capable of playing with anybody
in the country, but it's up to us to play to the best of our abilities, play
to that level.  
  
Q. Amber, I saw in your bio that you listed your hometown as being Houston.
Does that mean you're going to have some family in town for the event or will
you have a little bit of backing because you're closer to home?  
AMBER ORRANGE: Well, my parents and my sister will be here, and some family in
Dallas will also be here. But I think that's about it.  
  
Q. For any of you, could you talk a little bit about what your visit was
like to the Oklahoma City Memorial today?  
BONNIE SAMUELSON: It was extremely emotional. I think that the whole museum is
really amazing and the memorial is really amazing, as well. It was really cool
to kind of walk through and just see what happened that day and everybody that
was affected and the response that kind of the city and the country had to it.
I know a lot of people on our team were kind of like teary‑eyed going through,
but I think it was really kind of a great thing that we were able to do.  
LILI THOMPSON: Same, very emotional. A really well‑done memorial, and we were
very fortunate to get the chance to go and to experience that. And I think
that it just puts a lot of things in perspective, and we just wanted to be
grateful for all the opportunities we've been given and to try to take
advantage of those.  
AMBER ORRANGE: The same. It was very moving, and there were times where I was
just at a loss for words at what I was seeing and just seeing the humanity of
it, everyone who responded. It was very touching.  
  
Q. This is really for all of you. Y'all have been behind in a lot of your
games this year, and I think five times you've come back from double digit
deficits. What is it about you guys that enables you to not panic when you get
so far behind?  
BONNIE SAMUELSON: I think we kind of have the sort of season that talks a lot
about grit a lot, and it's just‑‑ all those games have really kind of prepared
us for this time of year. And I think that our team has a lot of heart and we
just never give up, kind of when we're down, we know that we have the
potential to come back and that it's kind of on us where we're at in the game.
And like Bam kind of said, we know we can play with anybody, but we know we
can lose to anybody. I think especially now all that experience has only
helped us, and we really just are looking to play hard kind of throughout the
entire game and never let it drop off.  
AMBER ORRANGE: Going off what Bonnie said, I think she used the word grit. I
like to use the word resilient to describe our team. We've been in a lot of
games where we've lost close games and we've won close games, and I think that
experience really helps us. We never really panic in those types of situation.  
LILI THOMPSON: I would say we have a lot of people on our team who have
stepped up and who can step up, and if someone is having a bad shooting night
and maybe missed a defensive match‑up, we stay with them and surround them and
give them positivity. We know they'll come back and they'll bounce back, and
we've seen that time and time again.  
  
Q. Lili, Tara was saying about Jewell Loyd that she's an absolute phenom,
and I was wondering what it's like for you when you watch her. Are you going
to be guarding her or is Amber? Who's going to be taking her?  
LILI THOMPSON: I don't know if it's supposed to be a secret, but I'll start
out on her and I'm sure we'll move around match‑ups and everybody will take a
crack at it if need be. She's obviously a phenomenal player, and she scores in
so many different ways. And I think that our job is just to make it difficult
for her and to give her a tough night, to have to go against the five of us
and our team defense and not just necessarily one person. I think that we play
really good team defense, and we get really focused on our preparation, and I
think that's something that will help us in this game.  
  
Q. In the OU game to get you guys to this point, you go into halftime down a
few points and then turn it around for the ten ‑point victory. What was the
key for you and your scoring effort to get you guys to this place?   
AMBER ORRANGE: I'm just always trying to be aggressive. Sometimes I score a
lot, sometimes maybe not as much, but if I remain aggressive, I may get on
another defender and someone else is open, so I think going with that kind of
mentality is really important for me.  
  
Q. Amber, reading through your bio, I saw that your mom was an Olympian, a
triple jumper. What kind of influence did she have on you?  
AMBER ORRANGE: She's always just supported me. She always told me you can do
anything you put your mind to. There's nothing you can't do, but you have to
work hard for it, and she's been like the greatest example in my life, and
she's my role model because of it.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
Q. Coach, seventh straight year in the Sweet 16. Talk about getting here and
like you told us before, you don't take this for granted.  
KIM MULKEY: Well, we're excited. There are a lot of‑‑ I wouldn't say a lot,
but there are significant players that play a lot of minutes in our locker
room that have never played in the Sweet 16, so they're extremely excited. The
first ones that come to mind are like Kristy Wallace and Dekeiya Cohen. This
is their first Sweet 16, their first NCAA Tournament, so they're excited, and
they should be.  
  
Q. For all of your great teams at Baylor, considering the players you've
lost, the talent you've lost, where does this team sort of rank in terms of
satisfaction, frustration, all of those sorts of things for you?  
KIM MULKEY: Well, they've done the unexpected. I didn't have‑‑ I didn't place
expectations on them because I really didn't know what was fair. There were
too many question marks. There were too many roles that were going to have to
change, so basically they have coached me into how good they can be. The
program has expectations because we've built an elite program there the last
15 years, so you always write the word championships and tradition and all
those things, but when you break it down to just how good can they be, could
they win a Big 12 championship, I don't know that any of us thought they
could. Could they have won it by as many games as they did? I don't think any
of us thought that. But those of us in that locker room obviously did. They've
had a great year. We've been very fortunate to stay away from injuries, and I
don't know how far they can go in this NCAA Tournament, but I know that I sure
like my chances because they have really done a lot this year.  
  
Q. You talked a little bit about their style the other day, Iowa's style.
How do you expect them to defend you?  
KIM MULKEY: Well, from what I've seen on film, they play man‑to‑man and they
play a 2‑3 zone. Sometimes you see a half court 2‑3 backed up to‑‑ when you
say half court, they extend it, but a little bit of 2‑2‑1, back to a 2‑3\. But
I've learned that no matter what you see on film, we've seen defenses that
some teams have never played before, so we will prepare for anything and
everything that we think we could possibly see.  
I don't know other than what I've seen on film, and that's what I just shared
with you.  
  
Q. When you're watching that film, what do you see out of Iowa's Samantha
Logic?  
KIM MULKEY: Oh, a tremendous player that makes everybody around her better.
She is a triple‑double waiting to happen every game. She's a strong player,
and then I see around her players that can score, and I see a team that likes
to run and get up and down the floor, and they're averaging, what, 79.9 points
a game? They are very confident at what they do offensively.  
  
Q. For those of us who haven't seen Nina Davis, how would you characterize
her play, and how does she stack up against some of the great players you've
had in the past?  
KIM MULKEY: First of all, if you haven't seen her play, I'm not sure I can
give you a great description. I don't know how to describe Nina. I can`t tell
you watch her good looking shot because she's got an ugly shot. I can't tell
you to watch how she blocks out because she doesn't block out. All I can tell
you is if you haven't seen her play, come to our game tomorrow, and when you
leave, you will go, wow, because she's a competitor, she guards bigger players
than her, she scores on bigger players than her. She had 17 rebounds against
UConn. So she's not just doing it against teams that are not very talented. I
can't give you a scouting report. My suggestion is for you to come see her
play and then you write what you think because she's one of the most unique
players that I've ever coached.  
  
Q. I know you're focused on tomorrow and just the game tomorrow, but since
this is one of your younger groups, do you have to say anything to them about
possibly not looking ahead to a rematch in the next game?  
KIM MULKEY: No, because I think your teams, no matter how young or how old,
are a reflection of coaching staff. We do our homework. We're very thorough
with our scouting report. We don't talk about the next opponent.  
What sometimes makes it difficult is when you start a tournament and you don't
know who you're going to play, so you kind of have to double up and do
homework on both teams, and that's what took place in the first and second
rounds. We know who our opponent is next, and that's all we have focused on,
and then tomorrow the coaches will already have done their work. After
tomorrow, Saturday, we will present the scouting report and go to work prior
to playing the opponent on Sunday should we win on Friday.  
  
Q. Kim, you've never not been in the postseason as a player or a coach or an
assistant in college. When was the first time you remembered what winning and
losing and the difference between the two was like as a kid?  
KIM MULKEY: Probably had nothing to do with basketball. It was the rejection
of not being able to play in the All‑Star Game when I was a Dixie Youth
All‑Star as a 12‑year‑old because I was a girl, and I had to stand outside of
the dugout and watch my team play. I just remembered what a horrible feeling
that was, and I didn't like the attention that was being placed upon me. And I
was trying not to cry, because you sure didn't want to cry as a girl in front
of a bunch of 12‑year‑olds, and then my dad and my mom and my family had to
make a decision. Do we fight this right now on this baseball field or do we
fight it later in the courtroom and make your team forfeit? And I remember
making the decision‑‑ my dad had confidence that he would do whatever I
wanted, and I said, oh, no, we won't penalize the team. And I stood outside
the dugout and watched us play that game.  
So I don't know that it had anything to do with winning and losing and the
impact. Just life, and somehow, sometimes, it can be out of your hands and out
of your control.  
  
Q. You strike me as a slick fielding second baseman ‑‑  
KIM MULKEY: Actually my first year of Dixie Youth, I was the first player
taken in the draft, so that meant I went to the worst team, and I played
shortstop, pitcher and catcher. Then I moved up to Pony League and played
second base and made the All‑Star team my second year.  
  
Q. I was right then, second base.  
KIM MULKEY: You got it. Same position my son plays at LSU.  
  
Q. Last week you sang for a press conference ‑‑  
KIM MULKEY: What do you want me to sing today? Name a country song and I'll
sing it for you.  
  
Q. Are you by nature a singer?  
KIM MULKEY: I can't carry a tune anywhere but the shower. I love music. I know
the words to lots and lots of songs that you guys have probably never even
heard of. I just like music. I like gospel music, I like country music, I like
modern music. Some of that music I don't care for, but I don't know, I'm a
country girl.  
  
Q. You talked about Nina's shot, you called it an ugly shot, I've heard it
called an interesting ‑looking shot. What makes it look like that, and is that
something you've wanted to correct or just leave it alone?  
KIM MULKEY: I think she had that shot when I recruited her. Why would I change
it? At this level in all sports, you don't change things in players unless
it's something that is not very effective. She gets shots off against players,
and I sit there just like you guys do, and I go, how did she just do that? No,
I don't fool with anybody's shot. She misses her share of free throws, but
when you look at games, she never costs you a game from the foul line. And
she's going to be the one you really probably want at the foul line in a tight
game because she comes through in the clutch. But no, I don't fool with her
shot.  
  
Q. 35 games into it, are you still looking for a perimeter ‑‑ that perimeter
stopper, and then also on Imani, if you look at her stats the last three or
four games, she hasn't shot the ball very much at all. Is that something ‑‑
not getting enough minutes or what?  
KIM MULKEY: Yes. Back to‑‑ I'll answer the perimeter stopper first. I think we
are getting that from several players. I think we get that from Prince because
she's 6'2" on the perimeter and has length, and then sometimes we get it from
Imani, Kristy, and Nya, so I would say it's probably a combination of all of
them. Imani thinks she's the ball sitting over on the bench by me. Kristy
Wallace has been on a tear of late and Kristy has subbed in for Imani, and
it's probably more of that than anything.  
  
Q. Did you have any weather ‑related problems getting here yesterday?   
KIM MULKEY: Actually we were scheduled to take off at 6:30, and we were on the
runway, and we were told there was a tornado, and the airport, I think, had
been closed down in Oklahoma City. So we sat on the runway, and then they
decided that we had to go back and refuel, so they took us back to the
terminal, and, fortunately, we were able, when we got back to the terminal, to
get off the plane. And so I can't remember how long we were in the terminal,
but we didn't get to our hotel until 10:00 p.m., around that time, last night.  
  
Q. Last year the Big 12 Tournament was played here. The fans traveled very
well for you guys. Four and a half hours, I guess, is the closest school
that's in proximity. What do you expect from the fans tomorrow, and I'm sure
it'll be almost a home ‑court advantage for you guys since you are so close to
Waco?  
KIM MULKEY: I don't know that you ever have a home‑court advantage when you
reach this level. I think that you would assume that we would dominate the fan
base because of proximity, and I hope that we will. You're in Big 12 country
here, and I would hope that the Oklahoma fans would support and come out no
matter if their team is playing or not, just be here. I like that the first
and second rounds were back on the Top 16 host schools' campuses. I thought it
just looks better for television. The women's game is not ready for neutral
sites, and I hope that we do our part because of proximity and people will be
here, and it will be something that looks really good on television.  
  
Q. With all the winning you've experienced as a player and a coach, here,
everywhere, do you kind of feel like maybe that carries over, the comfort
level maybe carries over to your players, with the winning and being on this
stage, just the overall comfort level?  
KIM MULKEY: I don't know if comfort is the word. I think maybe confident. I
want every player that when they walk on that floor to have an inner
confidence about them that we're prepared. Knowledge makes for confidence, and
I told you just a minute ago that we're going to do our homework as a coaching
staff, and we're going to present that knowledge to them, so the knowledge
makes them more confident when they get on that floor. I just think the
program and what we've been able to establish there for 15 years, those
expectations bring a level of confidence to those players, and they don't want
to disappoint the previous players. They don't want to disappoint the future
players. They want to hold their own, and I think when they walk out on that
court, no matter what our deficiencies are, you came to this program to
continue on and be a good program, and I think that's probably a lot of it.  
  
Q. With the Final Four in Tampa Bay this year ‑‑ Oklahoma City, kind of a
similar type of market. I think there's some aspirations to maybe have a
women's Final Four here at some point. You've been here for tons of events
here over the years. What's your impression of this as a similar site to a
Tampa or another place where a Final Four has been?  
KIM MULKEY: I've never been to Tampa. I don't go to the Final Four unless
we're playing in it because I'm a single mother, and I always wanted to be
with my children as soon as my year is over and get out in the yard and do
some things. But I've never been there to be able to compare the two cities. I
have been to Final Fours, and things that jump out at me are hotel spaces, not
just for the teams but for coaches, for the WBCA, for the media and all of
that. If you have great hotels, those tend to attract the committee to places.
If you have an emphasis and an interest in women's basketball and you can sell
those tickets, those tend to be places that attract Final Fours. I've had
success in Oklahoma City and I've had disappointment here, but the one thing
that has remained constant is that they do like and love women's basketball in
this area, and I think that has to be a big selling point for future Final
Fours and the possibility of hosting one here.  
  
Q. Niya, with the role that you play with this Baylor team, what's the right
balance you try and find between passing and looking for your own shot?  
NIYA JOHNSON: Really just knowing when to pass it and knowing when to shoot
it. You know, people know I'm a passer, so they're going to set up for me, so
that's when I try and take advantage of it by shooting the ball in the
mid‑range and just spreading our offense and making them guard me.  
  
Q. Niya, I'm curious, how comfortable does Coach Mulkey make winning, and
being on this stage, how comfortable does she make it?  
NIYA JOHNSON: She makes it very comfortable. It definitely has been a
tradition here, and coming to Baylor, you know it's a program that's used to
winning. She never let us settle for anything less, never let us not work hard
and settle for anything less. She lets us know we're here to win and not to
lose, and basically makes us comfortable and know that this is a winning
program.  
  
Q. Niya and Alexis, Coach Mulkey was just telling us that Nina's shot is
kind of an ugly ‑looking shot, and I was wondering if the two of you would
care to describe it.   
ALEXIS PRINCE: First off, I don't know how the ball goes in. But it's like she
shoots it from the top of her head with two hands. And then again, I'm like,
Nina, how the heck did that go in, what are you doing, and then sometimes
she's like, I don't know, and sometimes she'll be like, I've just got it like
that. I don't complain, but I just say, as long as it goes in, I don't
complain.  
NIYA JOHNSON: It's just awkward especially when she`s at the free‑throw line
teams usually jump in early because I don't know what she's going to shoot,
but it is kind of awkward.  
  
Q. Niya, can you talk about the challenge of facing Samantha Logic, a little
bit more of a touring point guard than you, and I talked to Kim about it, have
you stepped up as one of the perimeter defenders, kind of a stopper, that type
of role?  
NIYA JOHNSON: First off, Logic, she's a great player. I've seen the film on
her, and I see what she does. You know, I try to come out in a role‑‑ whatever
it takes for me to do, I do it in order to win a game, I try to take advantage
of that whatever Coach Mulkey wants me to do, I'm going to do it.  
  
Q. Nina, they've got nine players over six foot, long, athletic team. What
have you guys seen on film that could possibly give you guys trouble?  
NINA DAVIS: I'd definitely say that the outside game, there are a lot of
shooters. They have, I think‑‑ four out of five of their starters average
double figures. We are going to try to make them use screens more. They like
to shoot. I think everybody in their starting five can shoot threes and we're
going to make them drive and get them out of their game. I think the game is
going to come down to defense honestly, both us averaging almost 80 points a
game, so defense wins games, and that's what it's going to come down to
tomorrow.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
LISA BLUDER: Well, like everybody, we're glad to be playing here this weekend.
We know we're coming in as the underdog, but my team kind of likes that feel.
We're kind of the last ones to the party here. The other three schools are
used to being in this environment, and actually they've won a national
championship except for me, so everybody should be for the Iowa Hawkeyes, low
man on the totem pole here with the other coaches. So we'll take everybody's
support from Oklahoma City.  
  
Q. Coach, any travel problems getting here because of the weather
yesterday?  
LISA BLUDER: We had absolutely no travel problems. We landed about 2:30, we
were in our hotel‑‑ we were at dinner actually when the storm hit, so we had
tornado sirens going off and the roof started on fire of the restaurant, but
the food was good, so it was okay.  
  
Q. Coach, in 2011 your program lost Kachine Alexander, a tenacious, do
‑everything player. Sam stepped in the very next season. Talk about what she
had meant to the program and what's that been like to have two players like
that back to back?   
LISA BLUDER: Yeah, they're kind of similar players because they're both just
tenacious players, great rebounders, do everything for you type of players.
Sam Logic has been‑‑ ever since she stepped foot on our campus has been a
starter for our basketball team, has been an integral part of our success the
last four years. She is an unusual point guard because she's a do it all point
guard. She can pass, she's the third best passer in America according to
assists, she can defend anything on the floor. She's even had to defend a
center at times. She is a strong, physical player. She can rebound, she can
score.  
She's not your typical point guard. There's a statistic that I've quoted
already before, but it bears merit again, that she's the only woman player
ever in history, NCAA history, to score 1,400 points, have 800 rebounds, 800
assists and 200 steals. So in my mind, Sam Logic is just an all‑around
basketball player, not just a point guard.  
  
Q. I know you're happy to be here, but do you have to guard with this group
at all against being happy to be here, and do you have to talk to them at all
about that this week, or is it even a concern for you?  
LISA BLUDER: No, we talked about that right away at the beginning of the
season with the goal to be in the top 16. Too often you see teams set goals
and when they reach the goals, it's like, it's over now. We did not want that
to happen. We believe we can go farther, and we quickly reset our goals on
Monday and set our sights on moving on, and I have not felt a letdown
whatsoever with our players in their preparation for the week.  
  
Q. So successful at home this year, 18 ‑0\. Is there anything that you
brought with you from Carver, a good‑luck token, anything like that?  
LISA BLUDER: Well, I know a lot of players brought a piece of the net that we
cut down from Carver. We did cut down the nets in Carver because we were
celebrating our first Sweet 16 in a long time and going 18‑0 on our home
court. We have a tradition where we always ‑‑ in our locker room, we have a
sign that's a tiger hawk that every one of our players slaps on the way out of
the locker room, and we have that sign in our locker room at home that's
permanently affixed. And then we have a traveling one that we affix in every
visiting locker room that we travel to, and basically we all give it a high
five on the way out, and basically it locks us in. We're leaving everything
else behind when we hit that tiger hawk and we're giving everything we have to
the Iowa Hawkeyes right then. That's kind of a tradition we have. We talk a
lot about ‑‑ really home is about the people, and we have everybody we need
with us right here to make this a home‑court advantage.  
  
Q. Going back to Sam, what was the process over the past four seasons of
kind of getting her to look for her points more, that balance between pass
first and scoring?  
LISA BLUDER: Yeah, she did do that for‑‑ she was really more deferring to the
older kids when she first came in, because we had some really good scorers at
Iowa when she first arrived, so she was kind of an assist‑first mentality. And
I think this year was the first year that she really began looking for her
points as well as assists. I think she realized we needed to have that for us
to be successful. We've always talked about we want five people in double
figures. That's our goal. I think people start defending Melissa a little bit
harder, trying to take away Bethany, and she`s kind of like, I've got to step
up and score as well as pass the ball. So I think this year was the first year
that I think she became more an aggressive mentality offensively in the
scoring aspect.  
  
Q. Just wondering what are the things that impress you the most about
Baylor?  
LISA BLUDER: Well, I think their transition offense is extremely good. I know
they like to get out and push the ball. Their rebounding is very impressive on
both ends of the floor. Obviously their point guard, she leads the country‑‑
we think we have a pretty good point guard and she's third in the country in
assists, and with their point guard leading the country in assists, that's
pretty amazing. Obviously Davis, an incredible player, Player of the Year in
the Big 12, is only a sophomore, and she's so effective offensively, shooting
58 percent from the field. That's an incredible number. And so she's obviously
something that we have to be weary of.  
  
Q. You were talking about Nina Davis. A little bit of an unorthodox player,
have you figured her out, how she does it at that size?  
LISA BLUDER: That's pretty amazing what she's done at that size, undersized,
playing inside, posting up a lot, but she can put the ball on the floor and
attack, as well. She has a 15‑foot shot that's very nice, but most of her
scoring coming off the free‑throw line and offensive rebounds[ and post area
moves. And when you're 6'1" and kind of thin, that's pretty amazing. Have we
figured it out? Probably not, but we've seen it, and our players have seen it
on film. I don't think anybody in the Big 12 has figured it out yet, but we
definitely respect her and know she's just an incredible athlete.  
  
Q. Was hoping to get a clarification on your comment of the roof catching on
fire at dinner. What happened there?  
LISA BLUDER: Yeah, I think we were at Manny's‑‑ no, what was it? The Mantle.
We were there having dinner last night, and all of a sudden, quite a few fire
trucks pulled up in front, and my daughter got up to go to the restroom, and
she said, Mom, I just saw a fireman run through with a ladder in his hand.
That's when we figured out something was wrong. But they never got us out, and
my steak was still medium rare, so it was all okay.  
  
Q. Talk a little bit about the weather that greeted you when you got here
yesterday.  
SAMANTHA LOGIC: Well, right when we got here it was actually really nice,
especially compared to Iowa. It was, I don't know, probably 70 outside, but
then when we got to dinner, got some notifications to our phone about extreme
weather warnings and some tornados. So that was kind of different. We don't
really have that in Iowa too much. We weren`t too worried about it, though. I
think we were more ready to eat more so.  
  
Q. Sam, could you describe what you look for as greatness in a basketball
player? What attributes do you think make up a great basketball player?  
SAMANTHA LOGIC: Well, I think that the most important thing, I mean, to me is
helping your teammates be better, making the team better. You know, a lot of
people can work on their own game and a lot of people do, but when you make
your team better, I think that's just so much more important than any
individual thing that you can do.  
  
Q. Are any of you surprised to be here in the Sweet 16, or was this kind of
the plan all along, what you expected all season?  
SAMANTHA LOGIC: Well, at the beginning of the season, we kind of set more
short‑term goals first, and then kind of pre‑conference, conference goals, and
then postseason goals. But I think from the beginning of this year, we felt
like it was something that we should be at talent‑wise, experience‑wise, you
know, just having a lot of good games to put ourselves in a good position
seeding‑wise to hopefully play at home. And then we thought if we played at
home, we'd have a pretty good chance to win there because we played so well
there.  
  
Q. Melissa and Bethany, what do you know of Baylor, and how do you feel like
you need to play against them tomorrow night?  
MELISSA DIXON: Yeah, we know Baylor is a really great team. We know the key
for us is just going to be on the boards and really making sure we box out and
get some offensive rebounds, so we know that's going to be a big thing for us,
just to really work on for tomorrow's game, but we're just so excited to be
here. We're excited to play them, and we're really looking forward to
tomorrow.  
BETHANY DOOLITTLE: Yeah, like she said, I think that rebounding is one of the
most important things for us in this game. They're obviously a really good
rebounding team, and that's an area we've struggled at during the season. Just
to focus on the boards a little bit more, boxing out their good rebounders,
and stopping their transition offense because they're pretty good at that. I
think that those are kind of the two keys that we're going to focus on. We're
more than capable and I think we're just excited to get out there and show
people what we can do at this level.  
  
Q. Sam, it looks like you got your tooth fixed. When was that done and so
forth?  
SAMANTHA LOGIC: Well, I think Monday. Did we have off‑‑ I think it happened
Sunday, so yeah, Monday morning. The University did a really good job just
getting me in, got it glued back on, got some extra love on there to make sure
it stays there, so that's what we're hoping for.  
  
Q. (No microphone)  
SAMANTHA LOGIC: Well, I like watching pass‑first point guards, so getting to
play against one at that elite of a level, obviously leading the nation in
assists, like you said, it's just fun. I think that you get your teammates
more involved, like I said before, that's what I think makes a great player.
Haven't watched them too much during the year, but obviously she's been a
great passer, and so I always respect those kind of point guards just a little
bit more, just because that's how I like to play and what I like to watch.

_OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA_  
  
MUFFET McGRAW: Well, we're excited to be here and ready for a great turnout by
the Notre Dame fans in Oklahoma.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the process of how you guys got here? I know you were
delayed, but what you did during that time?  
MUFFET McGRAW: We took off from South Bend about 5:30 eastern standard time,
on our way to Oklahoma City with a plan that we might have to spend the night
in Dallas. We were on our way to Oklahoma City and then they saw Lawton
Airport was a little bit closer, so we decided to land there and bus over from
there, so the buses came and picked us up, and a little minor inconvenience.
We hung out, we ordered pizza. It was a very small airport. We were the only
ones there, and we had about 95 with the band and cheerleaders and our whole
party. We made the most of it, and our condolences to the people that were
seriously affected by the storm.  
  
Q. What have you seen from the Stanford team this year? This is the first
time they haven't had a Ogwumike sister in seven years, and I'm just wondering
how you saw that change the dynamic for them?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Well, they were both very special players. They have put their
name in the Stanford record book in a big way. Great players in the WNBA, so I
think two huge losses for them. But they've really recovered well. I think
they're a very balanced team. They're a very perimeter oriented team, and they
shoot the three extremely well. They're very disciplined, extremely
well‑coached, a very smart team.  
  
Q. You haven't played Stanford since '92 or '91 season. Why is that? Is it
just one of those scheduling quirks or have you tried or they tried to book a
game and it just didn't work out?  
MUFFET McGRAW: You know, I don't think we've really tried. In fact, I was
talking to Tara a couple weeks before the ACC Tournament, and I said, it's
kind of funny we've never met in the NCAA Tournament, and I probably spoke too
soon because it's not a team that I really want to play. I really like Tara. I
think it'll be a‑‑ it's kind of a great experience where it's nice to go to
the NCAA Tournament and play teams you haven't already played. We had to get
by DePaul which was sort of a rival for us, which was a very different kind of
game. I kind of enjoy being in the NCAA Tournament and playing teams we
haven't played in a while.  
  
Q. Have you tried?  
MUFFET McGRAW: No, we haven't. We talked about going west, but we've been
going to Southern California basically for recruiting, for recruiting players
in Southern California we try to go there, so we don't have a lot of players
from Northern California.  
  
Q. I just heard a little bit of talk that Oklahoma City might be interested
in getting a women's Final Four. I wonder what your thoughts are on the city
and if you think something like that could work here.  
MUFFET McGRAW: I think it can work anywhere that there's fans of women's
basketball, and that's what we need to cultivate. The Tulsa Shock is not too
far away and I think they`re getting a little more exposure because of that.
With the NBA team here, it`s obviously a great basketball city, and it will be
interesting to see what kind of fans turn out, and I think your answer,
probably you'll find out tomorrow night whether it would be a good idea.  
  
Q. (Inaudible.) What stands out to you about her?  
MUFFET McGRAW: I think she's still a student of the game. She loves to talk Xs
and Os. I remember one time a couple of coaches and I were just kind of
sitting around doing a little doodling on a note pad in the lobby of a hotel,
and she just kind of dropped by and said do you mind if I join you? I know
this summer she went out and talked to a lot of different coaches at all
levels because she wanted to change her offense. So she is someone I have
great respect for, what she's done for the women's game, how she's represented
the women's game with USA Basketball and with what she's done at Stanford. I
think she's a class person, does everything in the right way, and is really
good for our game.  
  
Q. You have a little bit of a relationship with somebody at Stanford, Condi
Rice. You've played some golf with her and things. I wonder if you've had any
conversations with her since this pairing showed up, and could you maybe
relate a little bit of your golfing exploits with her?  
MUFFET McGRAW: The relationship might be a little bit more than it is, but I
hope she'll be here supporting both teams. When we were both in the Final
Four, she changed her shirt, I think, after the Stanford game, put on the
Notre Dame colors because she's a graduate of Notre Dame. I would love for her
to be here. I'm not sure if she's going to be here or not. I haven't had any
correspondence with her lately. We did have an exciting round of golf where
she was able to get a hole in one, so that was a memorable day for all of us
on campus.  
  
Q. What was your first wow moment (inaudible) the way she plays?  
MUFFET McGRAW: I would say last year in the ACC Tournament, she went down the
floor in transition and got the alley‑oop and somehow managed to put it in
left‑handed on a pass that was a little hard to catch and control and at a
really important point in the game. And I think that was probably the one
moment on the sideline that I just thought, oh, my gosh, that's a SportsCenter
highlight, during the game. I think we were clapping and cheering, and it was
really an amazing play that we went afterwards to watch quite a few times.  
  
Q. A little scouting report, what you've seen of Stanford and what concerns
you might have?  
MUFFET McGRAW: You know, I think the biggest concern is how smart they are.
They're just a really disciplined team that ‑‑ they run their offense, but
they're also really good at recognizing personnel and seeing some mismatches
and weaknesses and really exploiting them. So they're not a team that you can
say they're actually going to run this when I think they're very flexible in
what they do.  
  
Q. With Notre Dame such a national brand, do you have a pocket of fans
everywhere you go pretty much?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Yeah, we do. We had a nice turnout in Greensboro at the ACC
Tournament. We have a lot of fans in that triangle area. Everywhere we've gone
this year I've been really excited about the fans that have come out in the
ACC schools. So we've had a big turnout everywhere. I know the club offered
200 tickets as soon as the bracket came out. I'm hoping that they need more
and they want to come over and give us a welcome and do whatever they can to
help us. So hopefully they'll come out in full force.  
  
Q. What's allowed you to (inaudible) as well as they have?  
MUFFET McGRAW: You know, I think when you come into a program, the expectation
level is set pretty high, and so I think everybody coming in knew that there
was going to be a lot expected of them. We talked to the freshmen early on
that they weren't going to be able to play like freshmen. We were going to
need them right away. I think the leadership that Jewell Lloyd has grown into
has really, really helped our team. And I think our point guard, Lindsay
Allen, has just done a masterful job. She seems very quiet, but when you get
close to the court you can hear her talking, and she does a really great job
of staying poised and keeping us levelheaded, and I think the post game has
really just exploded. I think our posts, all three of them, Taya, Bri, and
Kathryn, have really played well of late, and have just continued to get
better.  
  
Q. What has Hannah Huffman added to your team the last couple of years?
She's one of our Bay Area kids.  
MUFFET McGRAW: Hannah is having a terrific year for us. She is somebody that
comes off the bench in certain situations and has really played well. She
gives us energy. She is a player, the fans love her because she is such a
hustle player. She gets a lot of things that don't show up on the stat sheet.
She'll come up with some big rebounds. She is a defensive player that, when we
need a defensive stop, we'll put her in the game for that. She gives us great
energy. She helps us on the break in transition when the other team is
pressing because she handles the ball very well. She's a really good passer,
got a great assist‑to‑turnover ratio. But I would say mostly it's her defense
and just a spark that she gives us off the bench.  
  
Q. (Inaudible.) How difficult is it to prepare for a team (inaudible) that
has so many?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Yeah, it's really difficult. You just kind of cross the zone
off the list of things that you're probably going to do. We've got to figure
out how we can stop the penetration and the kick‑outs, which is very difficult
for us just having played DePaul which was a five out team. I think we came
away with a lot of things we need to do better.  
It's a difficult challenge for us. I think that defensively man‑to‑man,
containing the ball, has been somewhat of an issue for us this year, so I
think that's something that we hopefully have fixed this week.  
  
Q. Could you comment about the strength of this region? Three really strong,
traditional programs in yourselves and Baylor and Stanford compared to maybe
the other four throughout the ‑‑  
MUFFET McGRAW: Yeah, if I'm not mistaken, I think the ESPN analysts said this
was the toughest region. It didn't say it was the toughest bracket to start,
but I thought the toughest region. We're looking at Baylor, a team that's
basically, we`re playing in their backyard; Stanford, a team that's been to a
number of Final Fours, consecutive Final Fours; Iowa, a team from the Big Ten
that has had a fantastic year. I think all four teams have been ranked all
season, and it definitely is I think the most difficult region. But I said
that before the other brackets were announced, but I still feel that way.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about what you guys did (inaudible) and what
you did on the bus?  
LINDSEY ALLEN: Well, when we first landed in Lawton, we really didn't know
what was up at first. And we get off the plane and it's like really, really
windy, I remember, and then we just go inside to all the vending machines are
and just the general lobby of the airport, and so we were just playing card
games, Spades, chilling out, watching a little bit of Netflix on our computers
and all that stuff.  
JEWELL LOYD: We were just hanging, you know, we were being kids. Everyone is
laughing, dancing, we had was food delivered to the airport and we were
watching like the storm as it continued to rain, just the colors of the
clouds, stuff like that, and we were kind of just relaxing. It was a day for
us to just be kids.  
  
Q. Were you aware that Fort Sill is nearby and that's where the Buffalo
Soldiers were and it's actually where Geronimo is buried?  
JEWELL LOYD: Yeah, actually our trainer, Ann, she was telling us that as we
were playing Spades. We were actually learning a history lesson while playing
spades, so it`s the best of the both worlds.  
  
Q. You didn't know anything about what was going on when you landed in
Lawton, you thought you were in Oklahoma City?  
JEWELL LOYD: Well, we knew that we weren't in OKC. We knew that we landed
there, so we were just kind of like we'll wait for the bus, okay, just like a
normal day. And like I said before, we were just playing cards, enjoying the
moment and enjoying the time with teammates and the cheerleaders and the band,
so it was pretty fun.  
LINDSEY ALLEN: Oh, yeah, well, we were getting ready to land in OKC, the
captain just told us that the storm has really picked up and we're going to
land somewhere else. So then we waited, we flew another like four, I think
hour ‑‑ 40 minutes maybe to Lawton and landed and like Jewell said, just
chilled out a little bit and waited for our bus and the pizza to get here.  
  
Q. What do you know about Stanford? What have you seen of them? What kind of
team are they? What are you going to have to be prepared for?  
JEWELL LOYD: Well, they're very disciplined. They run a highball screen. They
drive and kick to shooters. They have two really good fast guards that are
very experienced, so we've been watching them and learning personnel,
obviously have really good shooters. They're very well‑coached. We've been
doing our preparation, and we feel pretty good going in.  
LINDSEY ALLEN: Just like Jewell said, they're a really disciplined team. They
know when they get their shots and where to get their shots, and they're going
to make you pay if you sign off them a little bit. They`ve been a little
inconsistent this year, but it`s tournament time and we know that we're going
to get their best game.  
  
Q. What did you take from the first two games of the tournament that you
played in South Bend? What did you take out of those two games as far as where
you are as a team now?  
LINDSEY ALLEN: I think we took each game individually. We just looked at the
results individually for each game, and we're just taking it one game at a
time right now, but we realize that we have to take the little things
seriously because we're going to get everyone's best game, and the intensity
really picks up around this time, so just taking it one game at a time and
focusing on us.  
JEWELL LOYD: I think as a whole we're playing with more heart and more
passion. People always said that we were really young and right now I don't
see that in us at all. We're very confident, motivated, and we're taking it‑‑
we're going along with the ride and we're having fun. That's the main thing.  
  
Q. (No microphone) how do you describe your leadership role with this team
versus what you did last year?  
JEWELL LOYD: Actually it's pretty easy when you have the team that we have and
coaches here. I didn't ask for the role, it just kind of just happened. Little
did we know we just kind of looked up, and oh, I guess it is me. But when you
have unselfish players on the team and everyone is learning from each other‑‑
I'm learning from Lindsay and Lindsay is learning from me and vice versa‑‑ it
makes it fun. It's a learning process. I like to learn. I'm a student of the
game so I'm learning from a different point of view than I was last year.  
  
Q. Game time is 9:00 here, which is 10:00 Notre Dame time. Any issues or
problems with that at all?  
JEWELL LOYD: I mean, it's game time. You've got to be able to play, whatever
the time is, wherever you play. You've still got to go out and play your game,
so you can't get caught up on the time.  
LINDSAY ALLEN: Yeah, we played late games this season. We played a few at 9:00
this year, 8:30, 8:00. So we just have to take what we have right now and just
make the best of it.

_SEATTLE, WASHINGTON_  
  

Stanford  61  
Cal  60

  
THE MODERATOR: Congratulations to the Stanford Cardinal, and Coach Tara
VanDerveer, Lili Thompson, Taylor Greenfield, and Kaylee Johnson.  
COACH VANDERVEER: I'm really excited for our team. Very proud of the effort
our team made. First I just want to congratulate Cal on a great year and an
excellent game. Lindsay does a great job with her team, and I think they
they'll do a great job in the NCAA Tournament.  
But our team really came out and showed some real grit. We got down, I don't
know how many we were down in the first half. But we started a little bit
slow, and people dug in. I thought Lili and Taylor really carried us in the
first half, and we got more contributions in the second half. I thought
different people stepped up.  
We didn't play necessarily a pretty game, but a gritty game. I'm really proud
of our team. Great tournament for Taylor. Kaylee, getting used to winning a
tournament. Lili stepping up big. Amber, our whole staff I thought did a great
job scouting, and we're very excited to be the automatic bid to the NCAA
Tournament.  
  
Q. Lili, you had to find your grit quite a lot during the course of the
season. Talk about doing it today against Cal. And I also wonder how you felt
the game was impacted when Boyd was out for a long stretch?  
LILI THOMPSON: Us being gritty is something that's been a season‑long thing.
We know that teams are going to come out and play us hard, and we really
wouldn't want it any other way. So when we get on to the court we know that
the 15 of us versus anyone, our coaching staff and all of our support staff,
and we know that if we go out and play the way we need to and play with grit
and play with heart that we can succeed, and glad we got that done today.  
With Brittany Boyd out, I hope she's okay. I saw she had a bandage on her
face. We didn't really want to focus on what was happening there. Just
continue to have the same game plan and just get it done.  
  
Q. After you beat Oregon State, you talked about relishing the role of the
underdog. You came into this tournament as the underdog again. But do you not
think of yourself that way and your team that way?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Not really. Honestly, you're going to do same thing
regardless. You prep with all the video, you do the walkthrough, you're in the
gym getting up shots. When they toss up that ball, you're just playing hard.
Not just playing hard, but playing smart. Trying to really make adjustments
during the game. You know, if someone starts out slowly, other people on the
team I think picked them up and just, you know, this is an extremely rewarding
feeling for our team to have accomplished this goal.  
  
Q. Tara, there was a stretch in the second half Amber had a couple of steals
and lay ‑ups, Lili had a hustle play when she got back. I thought changed the
tone of the game. Taylor was doing great things, but those guard plays‑‑  
COACH VANDERVEER: Just a hustle play on that loose ball that maybe would have
been an over‑the‑back. I think that did set the tone. You know, Lili attacking
the basket. In the beginning of the game I thought she was maybe settling for
some jump shots and she got aggressive, and that's her game. She attacked the
basket, finished. I think Amber did a much better job in the second half. But
I mean, Taylor's stepping up for us. Especially with the fact that Karlie
Samuelson was out, and we needed Taylor, and she responded.  
  
Q. Taylor, coming in, Coach said that you were needed, but what were you
maybe even visualizing before that tournament started? Was it this? Having the
net draped around yourself?  
TAYLOR GREENFIELD: Absolutely. The way our Pac‑12 season kind of went this
year, I don't think a lot of people maybe had the highest hopes for us, but we
definitely didn't let down on that. Before coming to the tournament, we were
all talking about like last year we didn't win the Pac‑12 Tournament and we
had our superstar Chiney, and this year we don't have that person that you
were like, oh, you need to win. So we really embraced that and it was like
let's just go out. Our theme this year has kind of been to crash some parties,
and I think that's exactly what we did here.  
  
Q. Taylor, this is kind of in the same light: You personally, did you ever
imagine coming into this tournament being named MOP?  
TAYLOR GREENFIELD: I hate to say I imagined it, but I knew it was possible.
It's not what I was looking for, but if that's what it took, I'll take it.
Like she said, I knew what needed to be done, and I knew I was very capable of
doing that, and I had the opportunity to do it, and I took it.  
  
Q. What did it feel like for you to hold that trophy and turn to the crowd
there?  
TAYLOR GREENFIELD: I don't even know. I was just thinking about celebrating
with my team. I mean, we love each other so much and we have so much fun
together, for me personally it was a great accomplishment, and I'm extremely
happy and blessed to have that. But all I was thinking about is what we just
did out there two games in a row. Battled through a lot, and I would not want
to do it with anyone else. I'm so glad that I have these girls around me, that
I can be myself with and appreciate what I have and they're happy for me, and
we're just, yeah, we're all happy for each other and I love it.  
  
Q. As far as attacking the basket in the second half, it looked like things
were clogged up in the first half. Did you feel things opened up and there
were opportunities or did you feel like you had to miss those opportunities?  
LILI THOMPSON: A little bit of both. The coaching staff let me know that
Reshanda Gray was in a little bit of foul trouble and to just go at her. There
was one lay‑up that I just completely missed. As we were coming back to the
timeout Taylor was like, "Take it, you have it. You'll knock that down and you
have it." Next time I was able to get it.  
So it was really keeping that positive mindset and maintaining aggressiveness.  
  
Q. First of all, if you could have some comments on Taylor and anything you
saw that she was doing different this week than she had. And secondly, your
rebounding a lot of people think it's kind of a mental thing, a toughness even
more than a physical skill. Have you always enjoyed rebounding? Have you
always been good at it?  
KAYLEE JOHNSON: Well, we've kind of coined the nickname "Tournament Taylor,"
so I guess she's just living up to that. But I think Tara's always emphasizing
how sometimes different people need to step up in different games, and I think
Taylor really showed that this weekend.  
Yeah, obviously I'm not the biggest post out there trying to rebound. But I
like it, it's fun. I know it's going to be a battle, and I always like rising
to the occasion. I guess it is more of a mental thing knowing I have to go
battle, and coaches thinking I can outjump someone.  
  
Q. Tara, yesterday Lindsay gave you a lot of praise. She said she thought
this was one your best coaching jobs because your team so different. Has it
felt to you like maybe not your best coaching job, but just a really tough
year, a different year? Have you grown a lot as a coach this year, do you
think?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I think I have. I think Taylor talked about it a little bit,
but it has been hard. We don't have the give‑ins that maybe we had in the
past, where you throw it into Jane. We have young, young players that have to
play big roles. I think our seniors have really stayed with things. They knew
it was going to be tough, and they kept battling. We had to run a whole new
system, and it's taken a while to get it figured out.  
To play in this league, you've got to come out very energetic every single
night, and we've learned sometimes when we weren't as energetic as we needed
to be or we weren't as focused as we needed to be. But this is as rewarding a
championship as I've ever sat up here and felt because we definitely had to
really scrap for it and battle, and I'm really, really proud of not just the
three that are here, but the other 12 that are in the locker room and our
staff and our coaches.  
  
Q. Do you like the spot your team is in right now heading into the NCAA
Tournament?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I would like one thing that won't happen, but I wish Karlie
was healthy. That is the only thing. Going into the Tournament for me, you
know this is the most important thing as being healthy. So we're going to be
really careful in practice, and we're going to work really hard, get a lot of
shots up, do a lot of review and have people rested and excited and ready for
the NCAA Tournament.  
But this is, in some ways I don't want to say this is a dress rehearsal, but
this gives you the Tournament feel. It's a great tournament, and it's
something that I think really the close games have really helped us grow as
coaches and a change so that we're really ready for the next step.  
  
Q. Taylor, we're all dying to know, what is in Huxley, Iowa?  
TAYLOR GREENFIELD: I mean, nothing, honestly. Maybe that's why I was always at
the gym. That's about all we have. My parents are actually moving, so I won't
even be returning to Huxley, so that's going to be extremely weird. But
truthfully it is what people think it is, corn fields and not a whole lot.
Very small town. I think we have like 3,000 people, and now we're losing four
more, I guess.  
  
Q. How many people were in your high school?  
TAYLOR GREENFIELD: I think in my graduating class we had like 80, and we were
combined with the junior high, that made the whole high school, so not a lot,
but I liked it.  
  
Q. (No microphone) athletically and educationally, but Iowa State, I presume
was dying to have you. Did you consider them at all?  
TAYLOR GREENFIELD: For sure. I mean, I lived ten minutes away from there. So
growing up that's what I went to watch. We had season tickets. It was right
there. They have a great basketball program. We knew a lot of people. But
until Stanford got on the radar, that changed the game for everything.

_SEATTLE, WASHINGTON_  
  

Stanford  61  
Cal  60

  
THE MODERATOR: We've got the California Golden Bears with Coach Lindsay
Gottlieb, Brittany Boyd and Reshanda Gray. Coach, an opening statement?  
COACH GOTTLIEB: Sure, first just want to start out by congratulating Stanford.
Sometimes I think in this world we live in we focus only on our own team and
our own season, but I think if we can change perspective, they've had quite a
journey, and for them, this is a tremendous win. Credit to Tara and her
program.  
I've had a lot of times where I've stood up here with these two, and we've got
triple‑doubles and double‑doubles, I'm just as proud of them sitting here
today when their numbers weren't what any of us would expect. I thought it was
a really good game. I thought Stanford was a little bit better than us in some
critical moments and made some plays. But, gosh, we took a punch literally and
figuratively. Our leader and our point guard goes out with blood gushing and
everybody else rallied. That was something I'm proud of.  
Then I thought when it could have gotten away from us in the second half, we
rallied again. Just made too many mistakes and credit to Stanford, they make
you pay when you make mistakes. We couldn't get it going on offense. I thought
we had one more run in us, and we just couldn't get over the hump in the
second half. Should have had a bigger lead at halftime. All those little
things I can go back, but right now is not the time for that.  
It was a great championship game. We're sad we didn't win it. It's a lot more
fun to cut down nets and dance and cheer, but you know something about your
team when you still want to be with that same group and fight another day.
That's what we'll do when we have a little rest, go home, and get ready for
the NCAA Tournament.  
  
Q. Lindsay, I want to ask Brittany how she was feeling, but I think she's
probably going to tell me she was okay. What did you think about how she was
feeling, because I saw Reshanda go over and you were kind of talking to her.
She didn't look like she felt very well.  
COACH GOTTLIEB: I mean, she took stitches to the face in the middle of the
game; I imagine she didn't feel great. I think probably she was a little out
of sorts, also. But I mean, I'm going to ride with these two till the end of
time. She's still at one point in the second half I said, "Hey, affect the
game how you affect the game. Don't overthink it. Just do your thing." I
thought she got us going with some defensive plays. But you know, she's the
toughest person I know, so I don't think there are a lot of other people you'd
expect to play through that, and I just expected her to because that's who she
is.  
BRITTANY BOYD: Yeah, it's a little sore, but I just wanted to get back on the
court and kind of mad that it happened because I kind of lost rhythm. But
everything happens for a reason.  
  
Q. When you talk about wanting to get back into it, too, do you kind of
still feel that your offense hurt because of that?  
BRITTANY BOYD: No, I don't like to make excuses or nothing like that but it
just wasn't my night, I guess.  
  
Q. Brittany, I was curious, is your face swollen? Is it hard to see when you
came back on the floor?  
BRITTANY BOYD: No, not really.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk a little bit about how your younger players stepped
up today?  
COACH GOTTLIEB: I thought they were tremendous. Obviously, Mikayla, Jefflo,
and Courtney have great numbers, but it was more like a feel. Like I said, I
don't think anyone buckled when Boyd was out. I saw them look tough, and I saw
them say, okay, we have to step up, and that's a really good thing because,
No. 1, it's great to see growth, but also because we have more basketball to
play. And I think we are at our best when our two All‑Americans are surrounded
by other really great players, which is what I think we have.  
So we never quite could get it all together tonight, but I think there are
pieces of that that bode well for us.  
  
Q. Brittany, were you 100% coming into this game? You had taken some shots
throughout the tournament.  
BRITTANY BOYD: Yes, I was a hundred percent.  
  
Q. Obviously you've played Stanford a lot. Was there anything different they
did to you tonight?  
BRITTANY BOYD: No.  
COACH GOTTLIEB: They changed a little, sometimes they would sag in from the
guards. I think this time there was a little pressure from the guards and they
brought in a really strong double on Reshanda from the four player, which is a
little bit of a different look.  
  
Q. Coach, you have a tendency sometimes to start the game slow. Tonight you
were getting a lot of shot attempts but just weren't connecting. Talking about
that, was that something that you emphasized, to get a fast start instead of
going slowly?  
COACH GOTTLIEB: Yeah, we talked about being the aggressor, kind of punch‑first
mentality, and I thought we came out great. The shots didn't, like you said,
they didn't fall right away, but they were good looks. I felt we were in a
good rhythm early. Like our flow was good. I thought we controlled the first
half, it's just unfortunate that we had a two‑point lead instead of a 10‑point
lead, which is what it felt like. You know, second half we thought we were
playing catch up a little bit, and couldn't get over the hump.  
Again, credit to them, they made big plays.  
  
Q. Could you talk a little bit about after the stitches, the medical people
back there, did they give you a choice of do you want to come back? How did
they test to make sure you were okay to come back to the game?  
BRITTANY BOYD: Yeah, I took a‑‑ I'm not sure. Something similar to a
concussion test. That took me a couple of minutes, and then I was good to go.  
  
Q. Brittany, a lot of us didn't see exactly what happened. How did you get
that?  
BRITTANY BOYD: I was going up for a rebound and caught an elbow coming down.  
  
Q. When you talk about big plays that Stanford made, they were 0 ‑for‑5 from
the three‑point line in the first half, and then Taylor comes out and hits
that. Can you talk a little bit about Taylor and just her play today?   
COACH GOTTLIEB: She's had a great tournament. She's kind of been a role player
for them over the course of her career. But she's still in it. Sometimes that
happens with seniors. We talked about Lili and Amber needing to score for
them. For Stanford, that's what they do by not letting anyone else sort of be
a hero. I think we've done a great job on Bonnie when we've played them. And
we really were focused on trying to stop Taylor's production, because I don't
think as good as Amber and Lili are, I don't think their 25 points is what
beats you combined. It's somebody else. And we just weren't able to do a good
enough job.  
  
Q. Reshanda, to be out there without Brittany for a long stretch in the
first half, obviously you were competent in your teammates, but what did it
change for you guys in terms of being out on the floor and not having her out
there?  
RESHANDA GRAY: I just told my team to just do the normal stuff that we do.
Even though Brittany was out, we still had Jefflo and Gabby to run the point.
And our main focus was just not to fold and go under pressure just because our
point guard was out. So basically stay composed the whole time.  
  
Q. Looking forward to the NCAA Tournament, despite this disappointment right
now, what can you take from this tournament moving forward? What did you know
about your team now that you didn't know before this tournament?  
COACH GOTTLIEB: Yeah, I told them I'm really proud of who we are now. We
didn't like start the season as this perfect team. I think sometimes there is
a lot more significance and growth, and I think the team that we've been this
weekend and really over the course of the last month, some hiccups here and
there, we've improved a ton. I think you know we want to be jumping and
celebrating and cutting down nets, but I think there is significance in who
we've shown who we are and on this platform. We've always bounced back well
from a disappointment this season. So we're fortunate that we're going to be
in the NCAA Tournament and have a chance on the next stage.  
I wanted really badly for these seniors and this team to feel this because I
think that would have been great for them, but it doesn't change where we are
as a group and a team, and I think we've come a long way. I'm looking forward
to the next time we get on the court in the NCAAs. I do think they've earned
it.  
I think everything we've been through this weekend will help us when we step
on the floor for the NCAA Tournament. I don't think there are going to be a
lot of teams that want to see our name come up as their opponent.  
  
Q. Coach, do you feel that you guys lost an opportunity to host the
tournament? For a long time you were in the discussion to host.  
COACH GOTTLIEB: Do you feel we have? From what you've seen here? I think if
you're watching games and you're following women's basketball, and you've seen
us play, and you don't get to see us live that much, I think you would think,
wow, that is a team that's a top 16 team in this country and they should be
hosting, as is Stanford. At some point the discussion was one of us. I think
we both deserve to host. And we were both in the final, so I think that
solidifies both people as some of the top 16 teams in the country.  
I don't know what's going on around the country, but I don't think we've done
anything this weekend to make ourselves seem any less worthy of hosting. If
anything, again, I think if the Committee is watching these games and we just
lost the final with our best all‑around player gushing blood and playing not
as much, I think they'd say that team is a host. That is my feeling. That
being said, if they send us somewhere, we'll get on a plane and we'll be a
tough team to knock out in somebody else's gym, too.  
  
Q. When you opened you commented a lot on Stanford's journey. There are a
lot of links between your programs. What is your impression about that journey
that they've taken?  
COACH GOTTLIEB: You know, there is a lot said about the rivalry and stuff. I
see it as, No. 1, my relationship with Tara; she's been great to me. What I've
learned in these four years is that it's really, really hard to be that good
for that long. We've done some‑‑ these kids up here have never finished lower
than third in the Pac‑12 Conference. We've finished tied for third this year,
we've been first or second every other time. We've gone to the NCAA
Tournament, and we've done some great things. It just teaches me how hard it
is to be at that level all the time, and Stanford has been winning
championships.  
So this year to have a little bit of not quite the same level of dominance how
I think they've handled that, to be standing at the end as the team that wins
it, great for them. I think that's significant, and I think that speaks to
Tara's ability to run that program, and the players in their program.  
We root for them except when we're playing one another. It's a fun rivalry.
It's good for women's basketball. The Bay Area is the best place in the
country for women's basketball. I believe that. So to be part of that, I think
we've raised their level, and they've raised our level. We wanted to win
today. We wanted to be the ones cutting down the nets. But if you can get
outside yourself for a second, I'm happy for their success, and we'll be
rooting for them in the NCAA Tournament. Just disappointed that we didn't beat
them today.

# [PACIFIC-12 CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=PACIFIC-12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2015

  

### [Lexy Kresl](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28372)

### [Linda Lappe](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21392)

  
_SEATTLE, WASHINGTON_  
  

Cal  68  
Colorado - 55

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Linda Lappe, and Lexy Kresl. Coach, an opening statement?  
COACH LAPPE: Well, I'm really, really proud of our effort. You know, we talked
in the locker room about leaving everything on the court. Coming out and
playing really, really hard. I really feel like we were able to do that. When
that happens, you're not disappointed with the outcome. Obviously Cal's a
very, very good team. Got to give them a lot of credit for how much pressure
their defense puts on our offense. We had a tough time knocking down some
shots, but in the end we had a chance with the three minutes to go, and that's
where we wanted to be, and just couldn't quite do it.  
But you know, really good efforts by our three seniors. I'm really obviously
sad that their careers are coming to an end. They're three really special
young ladies that have really bright futures in whatever they decide to do. We
were all playing and coaching for them, and it was just not meant to be today.  
  
Q. Coach, both teams seemed to struggle here and there. Brittany Boyd seemed
like she was really a catalyst for them. What were you maybe trying to do in
the final few minutes to maybe try and stop her from taking over the game or
winning it for Cal?  
COACH LAPPE: I thought we did a pretty good job maybe from the 8:00 to the
3:30 minute mark on her. We were keeping her out of the paint a little bit
better, but she's a nice player. She made plays for them. She got to the rim
when she needed to get to the rim. She hit that really key shot at the
free‑throw line when we needed a stop and really come out of the timeout. That
was probably the biggest shot of the game, I think.  
But you've got to give her credit. She plays hard. She plays with a lot of
heart and goes after it. We were trying to do everything we could to keep her
in front.  
I thought Jen did a nice job on top of our zone defense of being able to keep
her in front. She contested a couple of jumpers. She missed a couple jumpers
in there, but she made the one that really counted, so give her a lot of
credit.  
  
Q. Lexy, did you feel at any point that you guys were running out of that
energy that propelled you the first two nights? It's a lot to keep that going
game after game after game.  
LEXY KRESL: It was a little bit less energy I would say physically today, but
mentally we were still focused and we were all there. Our bodies might not
have been able to give us as much as we would have wanted in this game, but I
think the effort and everybody's intensity was still there today. It might not
have appeared that way on the defensive end because our game plan was a little
bit differently, and not as much pressure on the ball, so it might not have
appeared that way.  
  
Q. Lexy, can you talk a little bit about what Cal was doing on defense that
was so effective against your team today?  
LEXY KRESL: They do a really good job of playing the passing Lane. They force
you to kind of break them down kind of one‑on‑one and then you can distribute.
But you really have to attack their defense because they leave the gaps open,
and there's not many passing options, so that kind of disrupted the flow of
our offense.  
  
Q. Coach, what do you see as your postseason now? WNIT, things like that?
What do you see as far as going forward here?  
COACH LAPPE: Yeah, I think we're done. We have to have over .500 to get to the
WNIT. We won't make it to the NCAA Tournament, obviously. So this was
definitely our team's last game.  
  
Q. Do you feel like all things considered you held your own pretty well with
Reshanda Gray inside?  
COACH LAPPE: Yeah, she's a key. She's a great player. She works hard down low.
I thought our team defense was pretty effective on her. I thought we gave her
a couple of easy looks but really made her work for everything that she got.
Jamee did a nice job on her. Everybody else did a nice job on her of trying
not to let the ball go inside. Obviously when you do that, you're going to
give up some open jumpers, which we did. But we kind of had to pick our
poison.  
I think we did a nice job on Gray. I thought we could have done a little
better job on Boyd of not letting her get to the rim quite so easy and make a
lot of lay‑ups.  
  
Q. Coach, you guys had a great start to the game. Can you talk about what
happened and how you came back in the first half?  
COACH LAPPE: Well, we were getting stops, so they were playing their man
defense, and we were moving the ball really well and just taking open shot and
hitting the open player. Then we stopped getting stops, and so they were able
to get in their 1‑3‑1, and I thought that disrupted us. Obviously, we knew it
was coming with about 24 hours, not even, to prepare. There is not much you
can do on the court. You just have to talk and think about different things
that you want to do. That kind of disrupted our flow. So when they went back
man, we were a little bit more rushed. We were a little bit more
uncomfortable. I think what Cal does well is they keep you uncomfortable all
the time. It's hard to really get in a flow offensively. Some shots that we
normally knock down, you don't knock down when you're not sure what 6'2" hand
is going to come at you next.  
They're super long. They switched up some screens really well. So they do a
nice job of keeping you guessing, and you have to really just be in the attack
mode but make sure you're moving open gaps. I felt like in the second half we
did a much, much better job with it. In the first half, we struggled with it.

### [Amber Orrange](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23449)

### [Tara VanDerveer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14565)

  
_SEATTLE, WASHINGTON_  
  

Stanford  59  
Arizona State  56

  
THE MODERATOR: Stanford Cardinal, Coach Tara VanDerveer, Amber Orrange and
Taylor Greenfield. Coach?  
COACH VANDERVEER: We're really excited to be playing tomorrow. I thought we
really showed some great resilience with our team. We got a lead, we lost the
lead a little bit. But to get the lead was great. The people on either side of
me did a lot to help that.  
Amber is just her usual steady self, and I think Taylor just likes
tournaments. She played really well yesterday and she played even better
today. I told her we'll need her to play even better tomorrow. I thought
Taylor was really aggressive. She took the ball to the basket. She helped us
on both ends of the floor. She got a big rebound at the end of the game. So
I'm really excited for the two seniors that we're going to be playing in the
championship game.  
I also want to congratulate Arizona State. They have a great team, and I know
they'll do very well in the Tournament.  
  
Q. Amber, how important was it to you guys to win this game and to get back
to the championship game?  
AMBER ORRANGE: It meant a lot to us. You know, we talked about how last year
we were the No. 1 team in the tournament and we still lost. So we knew coming
in, even if we didn't win the Pac‑12 Conference, anybody could come in and
win, and we could do it.  
  
Q. Arizona State started coming back on you, was that something they were
doing? Was it something breaking down on your part? Or was it something they
were doing to get back in the game? How did you see it?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Basketball is a game of spurts. We had gotten the lead and,
you know, they're a very challenging team. Obviously they have a great record,
and they took it to the basket. I just thought that they made some shots. We
had a couple of charges, we had a couple turnovers. Just some plays that we
just needed to be a little bit sharper down the stretch.  
But credit them for making some plays, but credit us for staying with things
and getting the ball in when we had to, going to the free‑throw line and
making some free throws when we had to. I thought Bonnie's three was a huge
basket for us. That was really big. But just people, we've played in a lot of
close games this year, and I think our team showed some really good poise.  
  
Q. You guys obviously lost to ASU twice during the regular season. What did
you change for this game to be able to pull off the win today?  
TAYLOR GREENFIELD: A big focus of ours was on the inside game, especially on
the previous game. Dornstauder kind of hurt us quite a bit. So we paid extra
attention on the inside, and you could see that. With our defense, we were
focused on them, but offensively it was just like lay‑ups. We've got to get
lay‑ups. We've got to attack them.  
I would say definitely the biggest thing was just our mindset. We totally
changed it. Like we have to go to the basket. We've got to draw contact, and
that really helped our momentum in general when we're getting lay‑ups.  
  
Q. Taylor, what do you think about your coach's statement that you're a
tournament player?  
TAYLOR GREENFIELD: I love it. I mean, honestly, it would be great to‑‑ I don't
want to just limit myself to tournament player, but I get so excited for
tournaments. I was praying that we would get to play ASU again, especially
just in general they're a fun team to play, but because we've lost to them
twice. I know everyone was excited, but I was ready. I was so pumped for this
game.  
I get extremely excited for the Pac‑12 Tournament. I love Seattle. I love
coming here. I think it's just a great start for what we have coming forward
in the NCAA Tournament, too.  
  
Q. Tara, I'm going to test your memory a bit here. In 2005, the Pac ‑12 sent
five teams to the NCAA Tournament; all five won their first round games. The
next year in '06 they sent six; five won their first round games. Is the
Pac‑12 even better now than it was a decade ago?   
COACH VANDERVEER: Thanks for bringing that up. Quite honestly, the Pac‑12 has
always been really good. With Pac‑12 Networks, now people are able to watch a
lot more of our players, and I think that Pac‑12 Networks has been a game
changer for people to be able to follow our teams out here. We have great
players, great coaches, the best schools possible. I mean, who would not want
to be going to one of the Pac‑12 schools?  
But a lot of times, people have not heard of some of the players, maybe with
the exception of some of the East Coast players like maybe Val Whiting or
Jennifer Azzi or some of the people that came from the East. But I think we've
had such tremendous talent in this conference. Going back from the very
beginning this is the conference where Cheryl Miller played, the greatest
player ever. So I'm glad that you brought that up. I hope that five or six
teams go this year.  
  
Q. You called timeout with 27 seconds left. Arizona State was going to have
to foul, foul, foul, because they only had the one. What did you tell your
players? To watch out for this or look out for that? Did you know what was
going to happen in that situation?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Well, I'm trying to think of the last basket. Was it
Taylor's basket that put us up one? So Taylor's basket put us up one. When we
got the stops at the end we knew we had to get the ball inbounds and they were
going to do everything they could to foul us. Because in some ways the fact
that it was I believe 17‑1, which I have never, ever seen, ever, that worked
against them a little bit. The fact that they didn't foul the whole game by
the end then when they needed to, the clock was going.  
But we just said, hang onto the ball. Knowing how many timeouts we had, Bonnie
took one, I think. We had timeouts and it was our possession if there was a
tie‑up. Just don't let them rip it out of your hands.  
  
Q. As a follow ‑up, this year there have been a lot of teams getting
attention. 14 have been ranked in the top 25. Is it coaching? Is it good
players on the West Coast staying home? Is it Pac‑12? What is it this year?   
COACH VANDERVEER: I think it's always been really good. Like you point out
already that the teams have gone. I can go back to 1990, Washington was such a
good team. Went to the Elite 8. But I think with Pac‑12 Networks people watch
more and also more teams are playing a national schedule, like a team like
Washington State going and beating Maryland. You know, teams, you've got
Washington beating Texas A&M. So with ourselves beating Connecticut, we've
beaten teams.  
So playing a national schedule, being on television, having the talented
players like Amber, and Taylor, and someone like Kaylee. Who knows about
Kaylee? What a great freshman year she's had. But we have players in this
league that can play with anyone. Look at Arizona State, plays for Indiana,
whom I think of the guard‑‑ no, the guard that plays for Indiana pro team.
Right, January.  
You know, she was totally under the radar, and look at what a great player she
is. So I think a lot of our, maybe not Stanford because we've gotten a lot
more attention, but I've always felt that the Pac‑12 gets you ready for the
NCAA, and that is one of the reasons we've been so successful because of the
other teams in our conference and how talented they are and how much they push
you.  
  
Q. You talked yesterday about being the underdog and really for the first
time here and liking that feeling. Is it a different feeling now going into
tomorrow and back into the championship game?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Well, I mean, playing either one of these teams, we split
with Cal and we beat Colorado. They're both great teams. I feel like with the
schedule that we've played with the success that we've had it's all good
tomorrow. There is no underdog. You're playing for a championship.  
But I really like our team's focus. I think different people are stepping up.
We had Karlie get hurt, and look what Taylor's done, Brittany McPhee came in
and played really well for us as a freshman. So tomorrow, it will be all about
grit tomorrow. Come out and battle.

### [Brittany Boyd](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23421)

### [Lindsay Gottlieb](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23422)

### [Reshanda Gray](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23448)

  
_SEATTLE, WASHINGTON_  
  

Cal  68  
Colorado - 55

  
THE MODERATOR: We welcome Cal, Coach Lindsay Gottlieb, Reshanda Gray and
Brittany Boyd. Coach an opening statement?  
COACH GOTTLIEB: Just really excited to be playing for a Pac‑12 Tournament
championship. It's been since what I call our freshman year, the year we all
came in together. Most importantly, the growth of this team to be standing
here at the end with such a great conference and have a chance to cut down
nets is really special.  
I thought tonight was an incredibly tough battle. Credit Colorado. If you're a
coaching staff that has their team playing the best basketball at the end,
especially when they've gone through rough patches, it says a ton about the
resilience of those players and coaches. They weren't backing down tonight. I
love our team's mentality right now. These two, I think you know how I feel
about them. I think they're the best guard‑post combination in the country.
They just keep doing it over and over. Really proud of them. But also the
supporting cast really stepped up.  
Our defense has been tremendous, and just going to try to get some rest
tonight and try to take advantage of an incredible opportunity tomorrow
against an obviously well‑coached and terrific Stanford team.  
  
Q. How much of what you saw from Colorado tonight did you expect you were
going to see?  
BRITTANY BOYD: Everything that they came out with. They had their runs, and we
were kind of expecting that. Just based off of nobody wants to go home, and
everybody's going to play their best basketball at this point of the season.
It was gritty. The thing about us is we have to overcome and try to get those
50‑50 balls and get on the floor and get banged up a little bit, if you want
to win the game.  
  
Q. There was a point in the first half where you kind of smacked your hands
and told your team to wake up. What were you kind of maybe trying to get out
of them or what did you see from them? And then you kind of took over the
game, it seemed like you kind of took over the game a little bit and had those
key baskets. Were they ever woke up?  
BRITTANY BOYD: Yeah, definitely. At that point in the game I think our defense
was being too lazy, not wanting those 50‑50 balls. Our defense leads to our
offense, and that's why we weren't making early baskets in the beginning of
the game. I think you saw as our defense picked up, started getting steals and
started getting our hand on things, and stuff started falling for us. We
started getting out in transition and making plays that we knew we were
capable of. It was like, let's go. That was their little section of getting
points and now it's our turn. We don't stop. We keep on going up from there.  
  
Q. Reshanda, what do you think it could mean for you guys? Or what does this
opportunity mean for you guys to have the meeting with Stanford again here,
the third one in Seattle for the Pac ‑12 Championship?   
RESHANDA GRAY: This is going to be fun. We brought the Bay to Seattle. This is
a really good team, and we split conference. So this should be really fun.  
  
Q. What would you say for your program?  
COACH GOTTLIEB: The main thing is that we're in a Pac‑12 Championship game in
a conference that's as good as it's ever been. So that to me is more
significant. And oh, yeah, it happens to be against Stanford, and I think a
lot of people will want to talk about that. I think it's neat there have been
so many great teams this year, and it hasn't been all Stanford and all Cal. So
the fact that we've been able to make it to this point is special. There is
nobody that has more respect for Tara than me. I think this is one of her best
coaching jobs to completely revamp the offense and find a way to be a top team
in the country without Ogwumike, who they had for so long.  
But we're just excited to be among the last two teams standing in a conference
that's going to have several teams that I think are going to the NCAA
Tournament.  
  
Q. Brittany, will you talk about playing against Amber Orrange? You guys
obviously had four years of playing against each other. What do you think of
her game? What do you think of her competitiveness and what that match ‑up is
for you?   
BRITTANY BOYD: I like playing against her. She's a very fun competitor and
somebody to go up against. From freshman year till now I've seen her game
grow, especially with the pull‑up jumper. She's knocking it down like it's a
lay‑up. You know, so it's a battle every time we step on the floor. I think we
both have a mutual respect for one another, but I really think she's a great
player.  
  
Q. Coach, yesterday Mike Neighbors talked about how he preferred it if
Brittany was a scorer and not a distributor. So she's been playing really well
getting the team involved lately. Do you think that's what the team needs when
she distributes that well, like seven assists, no turnovers, across the board
like that?  
COACH GOTTLIEB: Yeah, there is not too much I can find fault in the stat line.
She's been brilliant the whole tournament so far, and I think she's had a
season that's up there with any guard in the country. I'll say that to any
All‑American Committee, right? I think she's had that kind of year. But
tonight when you're looking at 18, 10, and 7, four steals, playing 40 minutes
with one turnover, that's pretty impressive.  
I think people try to take different things away from us. What Brittany has
really learned is that decision making. She can control the game by passing
the ball ten times in a row, and she might need to score six or seven baskets
in a row.  
I think she has such a good feel that she's in a rhythm where if someone has a
better shot than she does, she's going to give it up. When it's her time to
score, she's going to score. People do a lot of different things to scheme
around this two, but as a team we are in rhythm because we know we have five
threats on the floor now, that is something that I think is unique about this
Cal team, and that's what we're trying to take advantage of.  
  
Q. Brittany, you mentioned yesterday, if I understood correctly, that you
wanted to use this tournament to show who this Cal team is. I'm guessing
because some of the losses you had in the season weren't the greatest finish.
Was this an example of you guys?  
BRITTANY BOYD: Yeah, this is our platform right here. This tournament is kind
of a showcase of showing our talent, and what we are actually kind of made up.
We still have some bumps. I don't think anybody's perfect, I think from where
we started to where we are now, I think we've made a tremendous step, and I
think everybody's invested. Everybody wants to win. Everybody is, "What do I
have to do for this team to win?" So I think in March, that's a good‑‑
something good for your team to have. I'm enjoying it.  
  
Q. Lindsay, what do you think are the stakes tomorrow beyond playing for a
title, which obviously you both will want to compete for a championship? Do
you feel like you're both fairly secure as host seeds? What do you think?  
COACH GOTTLIEB: The first thing is not to sound cliché. To have a chance to
win this championship tomorrow is the most important thing. Sometimes you're
working about positioning and things like that. We are just focused on this
team taking advantage of this opportunity. I've said it before. I think we
were disappointed that we didn't win the regular season championship. It
wasn't our time yet. We weren't ready yet. We didn't come out of the gates as
the team we are now. And that's okay. Sometimes the growth is as significant
as anything else. We want to win a Pac‑12 Championship.  
What's that mean nationally? I think our conference is really deep and really
good. So, yeah, we'd love the opportunity to be one of the 16 teams hosting
NCAA Tournament games. I think that's something that obviously these wins in
the tournament gives us a boost with that, but that's beyond our control. So
we're worried about trying to be the best team for 40 minutes tomorrow.  
  
Q. Speak a little bit about how your team's growth is with mental toughness.
Teams have come back against you guys time and time again. But it seems lately
when teams come back against you, you guys stay calm and push through. Talk
about that, please.  
RESHANDA GRAY: The main thing I tell my team is don't panic. When you panic,
bad things start happening. I tell my team to stay composed. We've got it.
It's fine. It's not like we haven't been in this position before. So I think
constantly implanting mentally in their heads that everything's going to be
okay. We may not start off good, but it's all about how you finish.  
  
Q. Brittany, is your hair supposed to be blue?  
BRITTANY BOYD: Well, shout out to Gray Gray Salon, Reshanda dyed my hair. It
was supposed to be like a gray and greenish/blueish color, but the story
behind it is I promised Jefflo‑‑ when Mercedes Jefflo first dyed her hair, I
told her I was going to dye my hair like hers. So she was like, "You still
haven't dyed your hair. You still haven't dyed your hair." So finally I just
dyed it, and shout out to Gray Gray Salon.

### [Sophie Brunner](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28348)

### [Charli Turner Thorne](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24830)

  
_SEATTLE, WASHINGTON_  
  

Stanford  59  
Arizona State  56

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Charli Turner Thorne, Sophie Brunner, and Promise
Amukamara. Coach, I'll have you make an opening statement.  
COACH THORNE: Yeah, I mean, I'm just really proud of our team. Obviously we
were having kind of a tough day offensively shooting a really low percentage,
and we worked hard, got to the free‑throw line. Hard to beat a team of
Stanford's caliber shooting 31%.  
But we still fought back, gave ourselves a chance to win, and just kind of
heartbreaking. I mean, we really had our eyes set on winning the Pac‑12
Championship this year, and we have fallen short for the second time just a
little bit, but credit Stanford. They're obviously a very good team with a lot
of postseason experience. There are a lot of good things we'll take from this
game heading into the NCAAs, that I know we're going to be that much better
for it. We haven't lost a lot this year, so some good learning opportunities.  
  
Q. This is the third time you've played them; you won the first two. What
did you think was the difference in this game the third time, and what was
different about this game the third time?  
PROMISE AMUKAMARA: Like Charli said, Stanford's a great team. I think shooting
the ball, like Charli said, we're only shooting 31%, and our defense really
wasn't there. I know personally I was hitting a lot of screens on defense.
I've got to get better at defending on‑ball screens.  
  
Q. Coach, what was the conversation before that missed free throw from
Johnson that ended up being rebounded by Stanford? What was the conversation
before that and what happened during that conversation?  
COACH THORNE: Well, I mean, we called a play. Obviously, things like that you
see every day in basketball season where you have your hands down, you have a
soft box‑out, and the ball bounces right to the other player. We just didn't
get our box‑out. We didn't have our hands up to go grab the ball. We knew‑‑ I
mean, we know games are won and lost by rebounds and rebounds on the free
throws. So tough pill to swallow for us on that one.  
  
Q. For any of the players, Promise or Sophie, when you're down double
digits, the clock is running down, what did you have to do to get back into
the game? How would you assess that?  
SOPHIE BRUNNER: I just think we knew we had to go at that moment. We couldn't
keep waiting and waiting to get the lead back. So we just started chipping
away slowly but surely, and we gave ourselves a chance at the end, but we just
couldn't finish.  
COACH THORNE: We called a timeout at 7:30 or so, and we were down by 13.
Basically told them, like, you better decide if you want to win this game or
you're going to get blown out, and they decided. I think from that point on,
if you look at it, we had a huge run. We came back, and we even took the lead.
So that's just such toughness and resiliency for this team.  
You know, we haven't been in that situation a lot, and again, I'm just really
proud of the day when we were really off and they were really on, how we
fought back and gave ourselves a chance to win. You can only put so much
pressure on our defense.  
  
Q. Along that line, did you feel like both teams were ‑‑ I mean it seemed
for a while there was a lot of tough defense being played. They were defending
you well. You guys defended well. It was really a back‑and‑forth from a
defensive standpoint. Is that what you saw as well?   
COACH THORNE: Yeah, that was a little like our second game too where both of
us were really taking away each other's strengths pretty well. Yeah, that's
in‑season basketball. You're not going to score 20 points in transition. It's
going to be half‑court execution, great defense and rebounding, and obviously
we're down to that last possession and we just fell a little bit short.  
  
Q. I would imagine most coaches would love to be in a situation in the last
minute of the game where only one team fouled. Just talk about that a little
bit whether you've been in a situation like that before.  
COACH THORNE: Yeah, I actually liked it because I thought it gave us a lot of
opportunities to get a steal, and we finally did. Honestly, at that point I
really thought we were going to win the game, and so did our team. We just got
a little too deep. Obviously they came over and made a great defensive play at
the end, so, again, credit Stanford. We just kept saying, get the steal, get
the steal, and we eventually did.  
So, again, I thought just a great job of our team of staying with things and
giving ourselves a chance to win the game. And that's something we pride
ourselves on, playing great position defense without fouling. We were very
disappointed in yesterday's game. We had four starters with two fouls in the
first half. Just we had to adjust, and we did today, which I thought was
great. We did the same thing the last time we played Stanford. We didn't give
them any free throws. I mean, even at the end it's because we had to. So I
thought that was a highlight, definitely, of our defensive performance today.  
  
Q. I saw the official talk to you about that one out ‑of‑bounds thing that
they reviewed for so long. What did he tell you?   
COACH THORNE: They just said that they all agreed it was off of us. You know
what? I thought it was too, it was just what happened before that that I had a
problem with. I mean, it was a physical game, whatever. But, yeah, yeah. They
just said they reviewed it. They all thought it was. Yeah.

_SEATTLE, WASHINGTON_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We've got Stanford Cardinal here with Coach Tara VanDerveer,
Amber Orrange and Lili Thompson. Coach, an opening comment?  
COACH VANDERVEER: First I want to congratulate UCLA on a great season. They're
young. I think their young talent and their coaching staff has done a really
good job. They've really improved a lot. We had to play really hard and really
well to win.  
Having said that, I think Amber and Lili put our team on their back, and I
thought we worked very hard defensively and we did a good job defensively. We
did one of the things that we really came in to do, and we got back into
transition very well. We did not do a good job keeping them off the O boards.
They're an extremely physical team.  
But having said that, we knocked down some big shots. Made some free throws
down the stretch. Kailee and Bonnie making those big free throws. Our team
just stayed with it. Even though things were not clicking on all cylinders for
a while there. But I think the leadership that Amber and Lili showed out there
was one of the main reasons why we won.  
  
Q. Amber, things were clicking offensively for a while and you still had
that double ‑digit lead. Did they make an adjustment? What happened to the
offense?   
AMBER ORRANGE: I guess sometimes shots just don't go in. We had a couple looks
and the ball just didn't go in. Then they'd come back on the other end and
score. So I think we just did a good job of staying together when they made
their run and sticking with it.  
  
Q. Amber, what do you remember about that three you made after they had tied
the game?  
AMBER ORRANGE: What do I remember? Do you remember who passed it to me?  
LILI THOMPSON: I passed it to Kailee. Kailee kicked it out to you.  
AMBER ORRANGE: I don't remember anything about it. If I was open I was going
to shoot it, and it went in.  
COACH VANDERVEER: Good idea.  
AMBER ORRANGE: Yeah.  
  
Q. Did you have an expectation that they'd make a run at the end of the
game?  
COACH VANDERVEER: You know, I think that had been kind of the way the game had
been going. We had gotten them down in the first half and they came back.
They're just extremely aggressive. I just thought that we had to just hang in
there.  
Like Amber said, we missed some shots but we made some big stops. We took care
of the ball for the most part. It was an extremely physical game, and we have
to adjust to that if that's how it's going to be.  
But I think Amber and Lili did a really good job showing good guard leadership
and Bree also came in. I think our big kids played well. Offensively Bird
going 5‑for‑9, and with Kailee going 3‑for‑4\. I thought they really helped
us.  
  
Q. What were you looking to take away on that final defensive possession?
What did you think of your execution?  
COACH VANDERVEER: On the very last one on the eight seconds when they were
going for the three? We didn't want them to get a three, and I think Bree did
a really good job chasing her. Amber was right on Fields. Bree was right on
Korver. Who ended up taking that shot? Was that her? I don't think that was
the person they wanted taking the shot, but I think she was well guarded too.  
  
Q. Going into tomorrow against ASU, you guys lost to them twice early this
season, once by three and once by one. What are going to be the keys to
success to finally get this one?  
AMBER ORRANGE: I think you said it, we right there the last two times that we
played them. The first time they got up big and we came back in the second
half. The other time we kind of had the lead and we let it go. So I think
everyone's excited. We've shown we can play with them, so we'll go out and
play hard tomorrow .  
LILI THOMPSON: We know that they play pressure defense, so we're prepared for
that. Also just getting on the glass. We know they like to rebound and we'll
have to box out and make sure we beat them on the glass.  
COACH VANDERVEER: This is the first time that I can remember that we would be
wearing a dark uniform in the Pac‑12 Tournament, and that we're the underdog,
and I like it. I think it's going to be really exciting. I think our team,
this is the team we want to play. So, you know, we've got to come out and get
the job done. They're an excellent team. Charli does a great job. You have to
be able to execute against their pressure defense, and they've got‑‑ they went
inside on us, and we've got to do a better job of stopping the inside game
than we did last time.  
But I have a lot of confidence in our team and how we battled with them. I
think we just have to really‑‑ we just have to come out with a lot of
intensity and a lot of focus, and when we have done that, we've done very
well.

_SEATTLE, WASHINGTON_  
  

Colorado  68  
Oregon State - 65

  
THE MODERATOR: We've got Colorado Buffaloes. Coach, I'll have you open.  
COACH LAPPE: Great game for our team. Really excited for our three seniors who
have been battling all season long. So fun for us as coaches to be able to see
our team, so excited about a great win, and really playing well. We thought
for about three weeks now that we're playing our best basketball, and we're
really preparing for this point. We felt ready going into this game and you've
got to credit the heart and hard work of our team, and for them to go out and
do what they did was pretty amazing.  
Just really, really happy for our entire team and our university. It's all
about surviving, and we survived. Now we get to move forward.  
  
Q. Lexy, you look at your record, and you guys haven't had the kind of
season that would suggest that you guys come in here and knock off the No. 1
seed. What happened tonight and where has this team been all year?  
LEXY KRESL: What happened tonight is we just played together. We had a lot of
confidence. We don't really view it too much of an upset because we knew it
was something we've been capable of when we play well and we play together.  
  
Q. Coach, there were a couple times in this game it looked like you guys
could have really folded when Oregon State went on that 15 ‑0 run going into
the second half, and then another run later in the second half. What happened
that your team was able to not fold?   
COACH LAPPE: Well, we've been through a lot of situations this year. We had a
really tough non‑conference schedule. This conference is tough. By the time
you get to this point of the season, you're tested. You've been through
everything. I feel like we've faced a lot of adversity so far this year. It's
one of the things that we thought that we could cause OSU to be able to see if
they could handle adversity. We've been able to do it.  
You know, you really at that point really rely on the togetherness of your
team. At no point really this season have we ever come apart as a team, even
in tough situations. Even though we maybe haven't always handled them the
right way, we've attacked it the right way, and now it's starting to come
together. Ultimately you want to be playing your best basketball in February
and March. We're playing our best basketball. And we have for a few weeks now,
even though maybe we haven't seen the wins come, we've seen it in practice.
We've had fantastic practices and you rely on your seniors, Lexy, and Jen, and
Jazz have been in so many different scenarios in their four years that they
took it in stride.  
When we went into the half, we could have come out at the half with our heads
down, feeling like we let go of the lead, and we didn't want to come out
feeling like that. We wanted to reset at halftime, forget about the first
half. Get ready to play 20 more minutes and try to limit their runs. I thought
that's what we were able to do in the second half, is they had very few runs,
and we matched every run that they had.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Jen's stretch in the second half, hitting shots. How
huge was that for you during that stretch?  
COACH LAPPE: Great momentum. We needed to go offensively a little bit. By the
time the second half rolled around, she was ready to go. I thought our team
did a nice job of hitting her when she was open. She did a nice job of moving
off the basketball.  
I thought her focus, she had laser focus in the second half on that basket.
She scored in different ways. She didn't just take her jumper. She got a
couple nice drives and some post finishes in there. Our team rallies behind
our three seniors, and I thought they really rallied behind Jen in that
segment. They rallied behind Lexy to start off the game, and it was a lot of
fun to watch.  
JEN REESE: Yeah, it's credit to all my teammates. Great passes and you've just
got to find open gaps and knock the shot down when you have open shot. But
when we're moving the ball and playing great basketball like that, it's easy
to knock down shots like that, no matter who is shooting down our team.  
  
Q. Lexy, Oregon State came in here and said they felt you guys had way more
energy to start the game. How did it feel for all of you guys and then for you
specifically, since you started off with 11 points in the first three or four
minutes?  
LEXY KRESL: Yeah, it definitely helps to start strong, but we were really
focused coming into the game, and that's why we were able to start with so
much energy. We knew the game plan. We were playing their personnel. And we
just came out with a lot of intensity, and that just came from being confident
and knowing that we could win this game.  
  
Q. Judging from the statistics and scores, you've been playing better
lately. But it looked like a pretty rough game against Oregon State down at
your place. What was the difference between ‑‑ I didn't see that game‑‑ what
was the difference between that game down there and today?   
LEXY KRESL: The second half. We were tied with them at halftime the last time
we played, and we kind of had a little bit of a mental letdown in the second
half defensively. We gave them shots that we knew we should have taken away,
and we didn't execute our game plan as well due to fatigue or just not
focusing enough. This time around we came out stronger, actually, in the
second half.  
  
Q. It was very apparent sitting behind you guys on the bench that your
entire staff and team were completely locked in and focused for the entire
game. How were you able to come into this tournament as an underdog and win
and come and beat Oregon State and stay so focused throughout the game? What
did you tell your team?  
JEN REESE: We're just a team, and we all love each other and we're family. Our
coaches do a great job of drawing up plays and personnel, and we listen to
them and understand the game plan. But we focus more on ourselves. We don't
consider ourselves underdogs because we know what we're capable of, and that's
kind of just how we do it.  
  
Q. Coach, when they say they don't consider themselves an underdog and they
don't consider this an upset, there are a lot of teams that live on that
underdog label because it fuels them competitively. Are you sort of the
originator of, don't feel that way? Don't feel be an underdog? Don't view this
as an upset?  
COACH LAPPE: Well, we have high expectations. I think this group understands.
These guys have both been to the NCAA Tournament, so they understand what
high‑level competition is. They understand what high‑level basketball is. To
be able to stick together even through adversity, it is really key. If you
came and watched our practices in January and February when we were on maybe a
five‑game skid, you wouldn't see anything different than if we were going to
the NCAA Tournament. That is a credit to these guys for coming to work every
single day, playing hard.  
It's kind of like Jen said, it all goes together. Our staff is a really
tight‑knit staff, and our team is a tight‑knit team. We think of ourselves as
a team that has more to prove. We haven't proved anything yet this year, and
we've got more to prove of who we are as a team and what we want to do.  
  
Q. Oregon State is a great three ‑point shooting team but tonight they were
awful. Was that something that you focused on in this game to shut them down?
  
COACH LAPPE: We wanted to take away Weisner and Wiese's threes. We thought
that was a huge key for us, not letting them get open shots. Felt like they
got a few too many attempts in the first half. We wanted to do a better job
with them in the second half. And then I felt like a lot of their other
players also had open threes that you kind of bank on them not knocking down.  
But our defensive intensity, that is the reason why I think we're playing our
best basketball. Our defense is finally playing better. We were giving up far
too many points at the beginning and middle of the season. We've started to
understand the importance of being able to lock down and making teams
uncomfortable. Making them rush. Anytime a team gets comfortable, they make
shots, and then everybody makes shots.  
So I feel like just our focus. Like Lexy, we have a different focus level. We
didn't give up things that were easy to Oregon State all night long. Once you
stay in that and stay in that and stay in that, it plays to our side mentally.

### [Ruth Hamblin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26571)

### [Scott Rueck](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24817)

  
_SEATTLE, WASHINGTON_  
  

Colorado  68  
Oregon State - 65

  
THE MODERATOR: Oregon State is with us, Coach Scott Rueck and Ruth Hamblin.
Coach, an opening statement and then we'll go from there.  
COACH RUECK: Hat's off to Colorado. They played a great, inspired game
tonight. They brought great energy from the beginning. It took us a while to
match it, and I liked different stretches of this game. I thought we really
competed hard at times, but they made plays when they needed to. I felt like
we had control a little bit. 60‑59 coming out of the timeout, I think, and it
felt like an opportunity for us to separate just a little bit. We didn't take
advantage of that, and then they made big plays down the stretch and hit big
shots.  
So hat's off to Colorado. They played a great game.  
  
Q. Ruth, did you feel like you guys maybe didn't match their energy in the
early part of the game?  
RUTH HAMBLIN: I think we started out a little bit ‑‑ they had the advantage on
the energy from us. But we came out and we answered. But then whenever we had
a chance to gain momentum, I thought they answered right away.  
  
Q. Coach, what did Colorado do that caused the most problems for you?  
COACH RUECK: They made shots. I thought their post did a great job. I mean,
Swan had a great game; finished well. Then Jen Reese took it over. For a
stretch in the second half I thought that was a key stretch for them. It was
kind of a segment of the game, just like the first time we played these guys,
that's when we got away from them. Early in the second half, and then just
gradually pulled away. During that stretch where it was like we were trying to
get momentum, she kept answering, hitting big shots and kept them in.  
So, you know, they hit big shots. If you look at the shooting numbers,
obviously, we did not have a great shooting night tonight. And ultimately that
was the difference in the game, I thought.  
  
Q. Ruth, what do you feel the difference was down the stretch? As Coach
mentioned, you guys kind of looked like you might have the advantage and then
just weren't able to create that separation.  
RUTH HAMBLIN: Yeah, just making plays I thought we had good looks and we just
didn't hit the shots, and they did.  
  
Q. Have you guys had to learn how to be the frontrunner? How to be the team
that everybody goes after?  
COACH RUECK: Well, I think it's a different perspective, for sure. But we've
been that way for quite a while now. I don't think that factors in today. I
really don't. I thought they brought better energy than us early. We didn't
settle in and shoot the ball. I mean, they played here yesterday and won. They
come in feeling good and loose and nothing to lose. By the time we settled
into a rhythm, they had already‑‑ they felt like they could win this game, and
we needed to come out with a little different defensive mindset.  
I thought we needed to be‑‑ I don't know. We needed to dictate the game a lot
more than we did on that end of the floor. I know that. They were very
comfortable, and that's something we need to be better at.  
  
Q. Ruth, you mentioned the energy level at the beginning of the game. I
mean, being the Pac ‑12 outright champ for the first time in school history,
having that new banner, did you feel a little lax coming into this game? What
was the mentality and energy level?   
RUTH HAMBLIN: I thought coming into this game we were all a little excited.
Obviously they came in a bit higher than us, and they hit us first coming in,
so that made a bit of a difference.  
COACH RUECK: Kresl, Kresl set the tone. She came out and just shot lights out.
This team scored 18 points in the second half against us two weeks ago, three
weeks ago on their home floor. Today they had 18 points in 4 minutes. That is
a trend in the wrong direction.  
  
Q. Can this be a good thing or does losing two of your last three cause you
some concern?  
COACH RUECK: Well, once to Stanford ‑‑ well, anytime you lose, you certainly
need to look at things, no question. You have a choice of making it a positive
or a negative. This group has always turned those into a positive. That's just
obvious life lessons. So we've got to look at this and understand, hey,
postseason basketball. These guys are fighting for their lives. This team
knows that they've got another day to live. No matter what happens, now it's
one and done from here on out.  
So when this team comes out with that mindset, like I mentioned last week and
we're the hunter, like we did against Cal the other day, and like we have most
of this season, we're a really good basketball team. When we take the foot off
the gas pedal just a little bit, then teams have played with us.  
So I think it's a great lesson. There is basketball to be played, and so we
need to approach it the right way and learn from it.  
  
Q. Both this loss and to Stanford you guys really struggled from three. Do
you worry you're settling for too many threes?  
COACH RUECK: Looking back on it, I mean, it's something that makes you think
that when they miss. But we're dealing with incredible shooters. We got so
many good looks tonight. I mean, we got so many good looks; the ball just
didn't go down.  
I thought we could have attacked more. We did get to the line quite a bit. We
shot 19 free throws tonight and made a good percentage of them. Could we have
done a little more? Maybe. But a three for us is like a lay‑up. So that's been
true all year. It's always going to be a big part of what we do.  
  
Q. I have a feeling I know the answer but I'm going to ask anyway: How
disappointing is it to come into this tournament and leave after one game?  
RUTH HAMBLIN: It's huge. Obviously, coming in last year we made such a deep
run and we know what that feels like, and to have it shut down so early, it
hurts a lot. But we know there is a lot of basketball ahead of us. And the
only thing we can do from this is learn, adapt and change our game and prepare
for the next game ahead of us, because that's all we've got at this point.  
  
Q. Scott, in your first year at Oregon State you had a lot of conversations
with the media about being the team that surprised people. Now your role has
flipped. How do you balance making sure your kids understand you can't lose
games like this but not completely depleting their confidence?  
COACH RUECK: I think from any perspective, hunter or underdog or favorite, I
think it's foolish to focus on any of it. I think you better just play the
best possession you can. Honestly, that's my perspective of it. With this team
we've learned we're going to get everybody's A‑game, and that's a privilege to
be in that spot. And this team for most of the season has handled that very
well. We've seen everybody's A‑game. So you miss some shots, they have a great
night, you lose. That's all it is. So it's like okay. What can we do to
improve? Let's move on.  
  
Q. Ruth, it's going to be a while before you guys play your next game. How
do you hope this team responds and utilizes the next week and a half, two
weeks before you play again in the NCAA Tournament?  
RUTH HAMBLIN: I hope we'll find a renewed energy in the basketball that's
ahead of us, because postseason play it's anyone's game anytime. We know who
we are as a team, so resolidifying our identity and defense is going to be
huge in the next few weeks of practices that we have, and I think that will be
key for us.

# [PACIFIC-12 CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=PACIFIC-12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

### [Jazmine Davis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24833)

### [Mike Neighbors](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28339)

### [Kelsey Plum](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28340)

  
_SEATTLE, WASHINGTON_  
  

Cal  69  
Washington  53

  
THE MODERATOR: We have the Washington Huskies, Coach Mike Neighbors, Kelsey
Plum, and Jazmine Davis. Coach, I'll have you open and take questions.  
COACH NEIGHBORS: I thought Cal was really good tonight. I thought they were
playing great basketball for the right time of the year. Boyd really had them
focused. I think they really executed it. Took us out of what we wanted to do
a little bit.  
We got off to a great start. We took advantage of having played yesterday, and
then they got settled in and made a big run. Then we did the same thing to
start the second half. So I think our kids have had a great year. I think we
had a bad day today.  
  
Q. Kelsey, at the end there fouling out, it seemed to be able to calm you
down. Can you talk about that last minute on the court.  
KELSEY PLUM: I was just frustrated at the call. It wasn't a foul. I think just
frustrated in the flow of the game. If that's a foul at the end of the game,
it should have been a foul at the beginning of the game.  
But I think it was just a frustrating game in general. Me personally I didn't
play the way I needed to play, and I think everything just got to me for a
second. But thank God for Jaz to calm me down. That's all I have to say about
that.  
  
Q. Mike, what makes that zone ‑press defense so hard to beat?   
COACH NEIGHBORS: Their length. They're really long and they're active. They
can really cover a lot of territory, and it makes us passive, and we're not
normally a passive team, but it's hard. We can work on it. We try to simulate
it all we want. It's just hard to do that, because they have such good length
and they really cover a lot of ground. It makes us play far away from the
basket, and it's worked against us. They're confident. So when they get into
it‑‑ for us to have 18 turnovers, that's too many. But that's really a
reflection of how hard they played in it and how many balls they tipped, and
just how many times they literally took it from us, live ball turnovers.  
  
Q. After Colorado you guys watched the end of Colorado knocking off OSU. Did
you take anything from that in terms of maybe being upset minded? The team
that played last night having some momentum going into today, did you feel
like that could give you any kind of a lift?  
JAZMINE DAVIS: Yeah, yeah. We saw Colorado upset Oregon State, and it was just
the first thing that came to our minds was, wow, the team that wants it the
most is going to get that win, and Colorado was a perfect example of doing
that. They came in, and like Neighbors said, they had the advantage of playing
the day before, and they gave it to OSU. So first thing we thought about was,
okay, this is a great opportunity, but we had to focus on Cal and we couldn't
think about Colorado's next.  
So we did try to motivate ourselves from that, but we couldn't really sit on
their win.  
  
Q. Coach and for Jaz, what did Cal's defense do in terms of maybe speeding
you guys up a little bit? Seemed like you were playing a little fast?  
COACH NEIGHBORS: I really don't mind us playing fast. In fact, the faster, the
better. I thought they slowed us down, to be honest with you. We weren't able
to attack the basket like they normally do. They normally crowd it and they
get to us before we get to the paint. Then they can affect our shots without
fouling. Again, with the length we were talking about on the defense.  
We get to the foul line 15 times, but a lot of those were late in the game
when the contest was kind of decided and officials tend to call a bunch of
them then. I think they slowed us down, to be honest with you. For us to score
53 points; we averaged 73 or 74. I'm going to say we played 65 or 66
possessions. That's normally a Utah pace. Not like we normally play.  
  
Q. As far as the experience here in these two games, what can you take from
those to prepare for the next tournament?  
COACH NEIGHBORS: At the NCAA Tournaments, you get to play a day and rest a
day. I've said all along, I don't know that we have a team that's built to win
four games in four days. It's not the style we play. There's only one time a
year you have to do that. The NCAA Tournament you play a day, you rest a day;
I think we're more built for that.  
We've played a lot of different styles here the last few weeks. We played
Utah, who does play it slow. We played some fast‑paced games. If we can get
invited to the NCAA Tournament, we'll be ready. The Pac‑12 has had a great
year. All the teams prepared us for whoever we might draw in the Tournament,
if we get invited.  
  
Q. Every game seems like Boyd and Gray are going to get theirs. How touch is
Cal to beat when they get contributions like 16 from Jefflo and Courtney Range
with 11?  
COACH NEIGHBORS: Jefflo has been all world against us. She has played really
well. We kinda made it our game plan to do that. To hold Reshanda to 13 points
and 3 out of 11, that's a win. She played 35 minutes at 13 and 9. Boyd 20 and
10. That's her number. Four assists. We tried to make her into a scorer more
than a passer. I think they're really dangerous. But I think they're one of
the best teams in the country when they get contributions and she starts
spreading it around. I think they can beat anybody. With the right draw, this
is a team that can go deep. They're really good.  
  
Q. The past two tournaments haven't been exactly the way you'd want them to
be, but you've had a good season this year. So how long does it take maybe to
reflect a little bit on the season and what are your thoughts maybe on leading
up to this point?  
KELSEY PLUM: I think our team's done really well. We've handled our business.
We beat the teams we've needed to beat and we've had some upsets. So I don't
think one game can take that away. It is a little bit disappointing just for
me personally how I played tonight. But we've got a good, significant time
off, and that's a little time just to rejuvenate, get back in the gym, get
yourself set up and hopefully get in the Tournament and see what happens.  
But I think overall our team has done a really good job this year, and I'm
really proud of what we've accomplished.  
  
Q. Do you think you guys are going to go to the NCAA? Do you think they'll
take you?  
COACH NEIGHBORS: I do. Yeah, I think so. I study it pretty closely. I've been
doing it for about 15 years. Gary Blair and I have had a standing contest to
see who can predict the most teams and I'm 2‑0 the last two years.  
I think we'd break precedent if we did not get an invite. With our RPI where
it's at, and the number of top‑10 wins we have, and top‑25 wins. We had 11
wins in a conference that's really deep this year. That number normally gets
you an invite. I also think the bubble is really soft this year. I think if
you look across the country there are teams that they're talking about getting
into the Tournament who our resume is much, much better than.  
So it's going be to a long ten days waiting to find out. But I will rest
pretty easily thinking that it should happen.  
  
Q. (No microphone).  
KELSEY PLUM: It better be.

_SEATTLE, WASHINGTON_  
  

Arizona State  67  
Washington State  48

  
THE MODERATOR: Washington State Cougars here with Head Coach June Daugherty,
Mariah Cooks and Tia Presley. Coach, an opening comment?  
COACH DAUGHERTY: Yes, first of all, I want to shout out and thank the Pac‑12,
the Pac‑12 Networks for everything that they've done throughout the year and
this incredible tournament. It's been a great experience for our
student‑athletes. It's a conference of champions with so many great teams in
it. It's been a wonderful, except for the outcome today.  
Congratulations to Arizona State. They are as tenacious as advertised. They
get after you defensively for all 40. They are in great shape. They are very
strong competitors, and they just go to a whole different level once their
defense is going.  
I thought we really grinded it out in the first half. I know we didn't score I
think the first eight minutes of the basketball game. I love the fact that the
leadership to my right with Mariah and Tia and obviously Shalie, all along
they brought this younger group along, understanding that show poise, play to
your identity, which is our defense, and something good will happen. Stay with
it, and we were able to be right in there after not being able to score the
first seven or eight minutes of the ballgame.  
Felt pretty good going into the half only being down five or six. The locker
room was excited about it. But second half we had to weather some adversity
with Tia going down, Lia going down. Kind of ran out of gas, and they really
took it to us inside in particular. Their front line is a very, very good
front line and it was tough to overcome that.  
  
Q. Coach, this team has always been sort of so go as the two guards, and
when your two guards go down, how does that affect you and how does that
change your game plan?  
COACH DAUGHERTY: Yeah, gutsy performance by Lia and Tia to come back out and
play. They were obviously in a lot of pain. They weren't themselves. They
weren't able to be as explosive as they usually are. But we just kept rotating
the bench in and trying to find an answer and today we just didn't find an
answer, and that makes it tough for us.  
But what a career Tia Presley has had. This is her second Pac‑12 Tournament
she's ever played in. For a kid to be the fifth leading scorer in this league
at her size and to play the way she's played, I mean, hats off to her and the
career that she's had. Just really, really proud of her and to be named
All‑Conference last year, honorable mention this year. Pac‑12, we're going to
miss‑‑ obviously Washington State and Pac‑12, we're going to miss the Tia part
of the Tia‑Lia show.  
She's been phenomenal. She went out, I don't know if she broke the ankle or
what happened, but she found a way to come back out and play, just a gutsy
performance. That's what it's all about. I just can't say enough about Tia and
her career.  
  
Q. Tia, you had a great performance today, shot 50%, 16.7 steals. Can you
please explain the mental process to this afternoon's game?  
TIA PRESLEY: Yeah, I just think I wanted to be aggressive and try to help my
team get this win. I knew it could be my last Pac‑12 game if I didn't play
hard, so I just tried to come out and be aggressive. It's really hard to play
against Arizona State and match their intensity. So I think that's what I
tried to do and my teammates tried to do as well.  
  
Q. What happened on that drive with your ankle? You were only out for a
couple minutes there.  
TIA PRESLEY: Yeah, I just landed wrong. It happens.  
  
Q. Mariah, can you describe the emotions when you saw Tia and also Lia go
down?  
MARIAH COOKS: Initially with Tia, I thought it was her knee. Like I just saw
her buckle. Yeah, I wasn't sure what it was, so obviously we were a little
shaken up. But the coaches did a really good job of bringing us together to
play through adversity, like we've been doing all season. So we had to
continue to do that and the same thing goes with Lia. They're very tough
players. Some of the toughest I've ever played with and you saw that today.  
  
Q. Tia, just take a minute or two to reflect on your career at Washington
State coming from Gonzaga prep, playing the two ‑plus years through the
injuries and now the finale?   
TIA PRESLEY: Yeah, it's kind of crazy that I just played in my final Pac‑12
game. I feel like I've given this speech a couple of times, but it's been an
honor to be a Coug the past four years through injuries and all the adversity
my team has faced and stuff. I'm just so proud to be a part of the group of
girls that I got to play with and the strides that we made in Cougar
basketball is amazing. To even be in the second round competing for a chance
to play in the NCAA Tournament isn't something that was in the plan when I
first got here. So, yeah, it's a lot right now.  
  
Q. June, where do you feel you guys are in terms of what's going to happen
now? What tournament and where?  
COACH DAUGHERTY: Yeah, obviously our a body of work is done and it's up to the
Committee to decide. We'll wait and see. Everybody's got to wait and see. But
I'm excited about the fact that no matter what, this program will be back in
postseason play for the second year in a row. Last year was the first time in
two decades.  
So together with Shay and Tia and Mariah and the rest of the group, they
really have done remarkably great things for our program. Whatever it is, I'll
guarantee that we'll play hard and represent Washington State as best we can.  
  
Q. You still feel you have a chance with the NCAA?  
COACH DAUGHERTY: You always have a chance. Just because of the schedule that
we played and the success we had in preseason, knocking off Dayton and number
5 or whatever Maryland is, on and on and on. We had a great preseason at 9‑2\.
We'll continue to always take on a challenging preseason schedule to put us in
position.  
I thought we improved greatly throughout the year. Every week we got better.
Looking back I think maybe our best basketball was in January. But I thought
we started coming out of that and dealing with all the adversity that we dealt
with.  
I mean, we lost five players this year, and I thought at home in particular
against USC the week before in Seattle, I think we played some of our best
basketball.  
So I'm looking forward to whatever we do postseason to keep practicing, keep
improving and get ready to make a great run.  
  
Q. For clarification, I know she had tape on her knee. Did Lia sprain her
knee? Is that what she did?  
COACH DAUGHERTY: Yeah, I think Dr.Garcia was here with us and he's an amazing
doctor. He was able to check her out and didn't feel like it was damaged in a
sense that she couldn't go back out there. Of course you wouldn't have seen
her go back out there.  
So she definitely tweaked it a little bit, but what the extent of that was, I
don't think it's that serious or there's no way they would have cleared her to
go back out. But what a warrior. What a performance again by her and Tia to
play with all the adversity that they were under physically.  
Once again, to the Pac‑12, and Pac‑12 Networks, thank you for this amazing
experience for not just our student‑athletes but our coaches and fans. We
really appreciate everything that you do to make it the conference of
champions.

### [Jordin Canada](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28323)

### [Cori Close](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24856)

  
_SEATTLE, WASHINGTON_  
  

Stanford  65  
UCLA  62

  
THE MODERATOR: We are here with the UCLA Bruins, Coach Cori Close, Jordin
Canada, and Kacy Swain. Coach, some opening comments?  
COACH CLOSE: Media, thank you for being here. We need you at our game. So
thank you for your coverage of this tournament.  
It's my least favorite thing to do is ending the conference tournament and not
ending it the way you wanted and looking at the tears of especially my
seniors. You know, just not wanting it to end. But I will say it's a lot
easier as a coach when you see everything you've asked of your players from a
character standpoint, from a fight standpoint, from a belief standpoint, from
uncommon choices beyond effort and sort of our rally cries, and I saw all of
it today.  
We have five words as a program that we wanted to embody this year. We talked
about not having it with an open hand. We talked about coming together with
our five character words and packing a really serious punch, and we packed it.
Didn't show up in the final score, but I could not be more proud of our fight,
our togetherness, our mental focus. That was the closest to 40 minutes of
together basketball that we've had all year. I'm very disappointed it didn't
come out in the outcome I wanted, but it doesn't take anything away from the
process and the character I saw in my team.  
  
Q. Jordin, can you talk about getting down double digits and what it took
for you guys to get back in that game?  
JORDIN CANADA: I mean, we pretty much for most part of the season have been
down double digits in most of our games. But Coach always talks about staying
together and just fighting through adversity. Stanford is a really tough team,
but I believe that my teammates and we all believed in each other and we just
stuck together and we battled. I really thought that this was the first time
we've ever come back and fought, and you can tell that we had it in us. It's
pretty sad that we didn't come up with the win, but I'm very proud of our team
and the way we battled back.  
  
Q. Can you talk about what shot you were hoping to get on that last
sequence.  
COACH CLOSE: Yeah, we were trying to run sort of a‑‑ we just missed the
screen. We were trying to run a separation play where Nirra was coming all the
way across the court because her speed is so great, trying to give her a
shuffle pick. But instead of going to the post‑up and trying to separate her
all to the three‑point line and setting a stagger away for Kari Korver.  
We just missed that second one. You know, it's just it was a little bit of a
breakdown in our execution on the backside, but we'll learn from that. But we
were trying to get a second stagger away, and then the last screen for Paulina
Hersler out. She just popped a little too soon. She did great. She was put in
a tough situation. And honestly we might not have had time to get that off. It
was .7 by the time we went out of bounds, so it would have been close either
way.  
But we were trying to get three looks at the three‑point shot. Nirra coming
off all the way to the three, Kari coming off the stagger, and Paulina Hersler
coming off the last screen on a flair. That was the goal, that didn't happen.  
But I think the one thing you have to learn is in postseason there is a lot‑‑
it's going to be very physical, and we've got to learn to finish through
contact, and I thought we had so many great offensive rebounds in that second
half where we came up empty, where we didn't get that either and‑one or get
the bucket. That's going to be great.  
I'm so proud of those. Adversity, first half, Kacy Swain 0‑for‑8 and she
finishes with a double‑double. That is the definition to me of mental
toughness, when your circumstances are difficult and you make adjustments and
you find ways to help your team. I saw a lot of that tonight.  
  
Q. Cori, did you come into this game thinking you may be able to get them on
the boards like you did?  
COACH CLOSE: Yeah, well, I think that's been the thing I felt like we've
underachieved on the most all year. I really feel like what you saw tonight
should be who we are all the time. We have so much depth, especially in the
forward spots. We have so much athleticism, there just has to be a
relentlessness about us and a toughness about us.  
But definitely, I did not think we could win the game if we weren't +10 or
better. I thought they shoot so efficiently, so if they get the same amount of
shots on goal as we get, they're probably going to win. But I think if we got
more opportunities by getting offensive rebounds and we can get out and attack
them on the break when we control the defensive board. So I thought to give
ourselves a chance to win, we had to at least be +10.

_SEATTLE, WASHINGTON_  
  

Cal  69  
Washington  53

  
THE MODERATOR: We've got the Cal Bears, Coach Lindsay Gottlieb, Brittany Boyd,
and Reshanda Gray.  
COACH GOTTLIEB: I got a lot of text messages last night when I was scouting
the Utah‑UW game that I looked tired on TV. I don't feel as tired right now.
I'm energized. Really proud of our team for a lot of reasons. March basketball
is a different level of basketball, and I thought we raised it up tonight.
That was Cal basketball, and our players always define what that is:
Toughness, pace, defense, togetherness.  
Washington is a tremendous team, especially how they score the basketball. And
I told their players going through the line, especially the seniors who have
changed that program and Kelsey, they have a lot more games to win in an NCAA
Tournament, and that's a credit to them. We're just fortunate that our players
came out so tough.  
Did a great job on the defensive end and played the way we wanted to play, and
we're excited to be moving on. Really, really can't say enough about these
two. They're just winners and leaders. I thought Boyd set the tone tonight,
and Reshanda's such a beast in the paint. We're just going to take this one,
enjoy it for five seconds and work on the next one.  
  
Q. Coach, coming out through the gates, UW goes on a little bit of a run.
They come up firing a couple of shots. Media timeout comes and you guys get
into your zone. I believe it's a 1 ‑3‑1\. Forced a lot of turnovers. I think
you did it at your place as well, went to the 1‑3‑1\. What is it about that
defense that's allowed you guys to be successful against them?   
COACH GOTTLIEB: I think takes advantage of our length in the trap. So Gabby
Green, Mikayla Cowling, Courtney Range bring a ton of length. It's hard to see
over that when you add Jefflo and Boyd, who are just great pressure defenders.
It's a different look for people that I think they're uncomfortable with.  
Washington gets in such a rhythm with their man‑to‑man offense, that we wanted
to just keep them off kilter a little bit, and I think it was effective for
us.  
I was really proud of the fact that they came out and hit some shots and we
didn't waver. Boyd in particular never tried to do too much. Kept the team
steady. Okay, that's their run. Let's chip away. It started with our defense,
and that got us going.  
  
Q. You guys are seniors. Does entering this tournament feel different than
it has in year's past?  
BRITTANY BOYD: I just, I don't think it's different, but I think it's more of
a different kind of a mindset. Just basically, you know being fourth, I think
that's not something that we're okay with, and I think just the past games,
our past games they kind of helped us define who we are. And I think this
opportunity right now to play in a Pac‑12 Tournament is giving us an
opportunity to show who we really are, we want to win a Pac‑12 Championship,
and that's always been our mindset coming in, so, yeah.  
RESHANDA GRAY: It feels different because each year we played, we had a
different team and different players and different plays and defense, and I
look at it as another opportunity. Once the Pac‑12 Conference starts, it
doesn't matter about your record; it's win or go home basically. But it's
different, because we have a new team.  
  
Q. Lindsay, did you like the way the trap defense can energize you guys or
provide an extra boost there?  
COACH GOTTLIEB: Definitely. It's a gamble in some ways. You might give up some
looks, but I think it kick starts our energy and our emotion. When we can
score in transition, I think that's really tough on other teams. So when we
turn people over and score, it takes the pressure off us having to execute in
the half court, though I thought we did that just fine tonight with four in
double figures and a lot of scoring across the board.  
But certainly we'd rather play in an up‑and‑down track‑meet pace, and it helps
when you're pressing to do that.  
  
Q. Brittany, unless you guys play in the NCAA Tournament, it could be your
last matchup going up against Jaz. I know in the last few years you've had a
lot of match ‑ups. What's it like going through the battles with her like
tonight?   
BRITTANY BOYD: Jaz is an excellent player. She's really changed the UW program
since freshman year just battling against her. I have so much respect for her.
I wish her the best of luck in her future.  
  
Q. Lindsay, this may be a simple question, but how do you choose what games
you want to use that zone and when do you like to hold it back and keep it in
the back pocket?  
COACH GOTTLIEB: I don't think that's a silly question at all. Anytime you're
game planning, you think about what's in your arsenal and what you do well and
how you want to tinker with that compared to another team's skillset. So we're
in some kind of pressure‑changing defense pretty much every game, so I think
that's good for us. But obviously you have to kind of make tweaks and
adjustments off of what you think the other team can handle, off of what
happened last time.  
But it's a little bit of what's working for us and what we're confident in,
and also what we think can really get the other team out of sorts.  
But this time of year you want to feel good about what you do and try to do
what you do better than what the other team is bringing to the table.  
  
Q. This is a question about Mercedes Jefflo: She had a great start in the
first half and had a rough opening in the second half, but she was able to
shake it off and play well again. Can you talk about her growth as a player?  
BRITTANY BOYD: Yeah, she's grown a lot since freshman year. I think one thing
about her is she's willing to get better and she's willing to learn. She wants
to be great, and that is something that I really respect about her. You know,
like I think also she's always on top of stuff. She knows the play. She just
knows her X's and O's pretty well. And I think she's invested into this
program, and I think if you're invested in something, then you're going to
produce well. And I just think she's stepped up big time for us.  
RESHANDA GRAY: To go along with what Brittany was saying, yeah, she's very
coachable and she's very invested in the game plan and just all about winning.
When she was a freshman, we told her, "You're not a freshman, you have to play
like a sophomore." Now she's a sophomore and we tell her she has to play like
a junior. She did a really good job accepting her role and stepping up to the
plate.  
  
Q. Coach, Colorado has kind of emerged as the dark horse of this tournament
and you guys are facing them tomorrow. What do you see as the most dangerous
aspect of their game and how do you plan to prepare it?  
COACH GOTTLIEB: First thing is the most interesting thing has to be their
mentality. I heard Linda when I was still in the locker room on TV. She said
they know they're playing for a postseason berth. They're probably not in
unless they win this thing. And that can be a very powerful tool, that
motivation. They have seniors who don't want it to end, Lexy, and Jen Reese.
So that is the first thing we know when we're facing somebody, we always have
to surpass their toughness and their desire. So I'll challenge our players to
do that.  
The other thing is they have a good inside‑out thing going on right now. We
had played them the first or second game in conference and haven't seen them
since. So Swan has really emerged as a low‑post presence, and then they put
shooters around her. Reese really shoots it well for a small forward, and
Kresl she was one step over half court letting it fly tonight at the beginning
of that game.  
So I think that's the balance that they've had in these last two games has
been tremendous. You've seen it on film. They've done it in spurts in the
regular season, and now it's coming together for them. So we'll have our work
cut out for us.  
  
Q. Lindsay, do you guys ever talk about the opportunity of hosting the first
two rounds at home and kind of what these games can mean to that?  
COACH GOTTLIEB: I sort of try to find the formula of what I need to kind of
get our players going. These two in particular, they like the big stage. They
like challenges. So there have been times where I've said there is a lot on
the line for us, too, to be able to play games at home. Whatever happens with
that, we're going to be ready to go. But certainly we want to cut down nets
here, and to do that you have to win the first game, which we did tonight.
That's all we're thinking about. Next we'll think about Colorado.  
I have at times put that out there to them because I think our teams can
handle it in terms of understanding what's at stake and going out there and
getting it.

_SEATTLE, WASHINGTON_  
  

Arizona State  67  
Washington State  48

  
THE MODERATOR: Welcome, Arizona State. Congratulations, Coach. Some opening
comments, please?  
COACH THORNE: Wow, it's just nice to stay here more than a day. We haven't
built much history at this tournament in Seattle yet, so very proud of our
team. We've been a little slow starting lately offensively, and then we've
been able to get it going in the second half this last week or so. So I
thought we did a great job in the second half just settling down, taking care
of the ball, and kind of doing what we can do.  
Great atmosphere. Getting the kids in here. Thank you to the Pac‑12 Conference
and everybody here at Key Arena because we haven't really found a great home,
and I thought this was a good start to the tournament, even though all the
kids had Cougar signs. We're going to work on that for next year.  
  
Q. Coach, in that first half, both teams kind of struggled to score. But did
you feel fortunate to be up after those 20 minutes?  
COACH THORNE: Incredibly fortunate. Yes, obviously we were in major foul
trouble, so I thought our bench held down the fort pretty well, because they
played a lot of minutes in the first half. We got great looks. I mean, we were
getting shots in the paint, so that's what we were talking about. In the
second half we settled down and finished and got Sophie back, which helped a
lot.  
So the foul trouble really hurt us. Also, Washington State, they do a great
job of turning people over. We haven't played them in a long time. We weren't
really sure who we were going to play, and I thought we adjusted well in the
second half not getting turned over.  
  
Q. Charli, given that you guys haven't gotten settled at this tournament in
Seattle the last couple of years, what conversations did you have leading into
here about what you wanted to do and what your mindset was going to be as a
team?  
COACH THORNE: Well, I think I don't know that we talked a lot about hey, gee
‑‑ I mean, there wasn't much that needed to be said, really. I think this team
is obviously more consistent and more mature and had the most success of any
team we've brought to Seattle. So we absolutely expected to come in here and
play some really good basketball.  
But we just don't save anything. Don't save anything. At halftime we just
talked about that; we're not playing hard enough. So I thought we still were a
little tight, I thought in the first half. Then we did relax. One of the
things we talked about is the first game is the hardest. I asked them last
night who has the advantage, Washington State because they've already played a
game or us because we're fresh? And we just talked about that getting that
first game under your belt, I feel it's the same way in the NCAA Tournament,
it's almost sometimes the hardest game. Then you kind of get okay, got that
over with, and I feel like you can relax a little bit more. At least that's
been my experience in 26 years or whatever.  
So it feels good to get the first game under our belt. I think we're relaxed
and play two halves of basketball.  
  
Q. Kelsey, I wonder if you could talk about, you guys obviously weren't as
involved in the offense in the first half. Changed dramatically in the second
half, but for what reasons?  
KELSEY MOOS: I think we weren't wanting the ball enough in the first half. We
knew that we needed to get the ball into the post from the top. And the post
just wasn't wanting the ball. So we talked about that at halftime and came out
and wanted the ball and the guards got us the ball.  
SOPHIE BRUNNER: Well, in the first half considering I was in so much foul
trouble, I wasn't aggressive and I was just going soft. That was on me, too.
The guards, we weren't helping them, and we just weren't playing successful in
the first half. In the second half we worked well together and ran the floor
and got easy looks.  
COACH THORNE: Well, Sophie only played four minutes in the first half, so.  
  
Q. Kelsey, somewhat of a hometown team. Talk about the physical play inside.
There was one time I think Dornstauder got tied up with Louise Brown. But talk
about it physically inside.  
KELSEY MOOS: We have a pretty good rivalry with Washington State. So we knew
coming into this it was going to be a really physical game. So we just knew
that we if we got the ball inside, we'd have to chin it because they're pretty
scrappy in trying to take it from us. So we knew it was going to be physical
coming into it. I thought we did a much better job in the second half
adjusting to that and playing strong.  
  
Q. You guys have a chance possibly tomorrow to face Stanford for the third
time this season, and it was the first time in 30 years that you guys were
able to sweep that series. How are you guys going to prepare to possibly face
them again?  
COACH THORNE: Great question. If Stanford does win it in their game which, of
course, they're favored to. It's really hard to beat a team three times,
especially a team that's as good as Stanford in that tradition. But at least
we've played them twice. We played them recently. Unlike Washington State, I
think we have the familiarity and we kind of know what we need to do to win.
The second game we didn't play well. We were fortunate to win that game. There
are things we can do better. It's going to be a great opportunity for us to
play a great team on a neutral floor and play better basketball.  
  
Q. Promise and Charli, could you talk about Promise's defensive play and
what you had planned in terms of facing Galdeira?  
COACH THORNE: The plan was to Promise shut her down. No, Promise, it's such an
incredible blessing for our team to have someone like Promise. Whatever the
match‑up was, if there's a perimeter player, a 20‑point a game player, a
dominant player, we have Promise. We try to help and we play great team
defense, but Promise just does an amazing job of making them work for every
touch, making them work for anything and everything that they do. You know,
the only thing that hurt us a little bit on that was a few fouls early, but we
have not had a game this year when we needed Promise to step up and shut
somebody down that she hasn't done it. So that's an incredible, incredible
accomplishment to date.  
  
Q. Obviously Lia did have a huge game yesterday and has had a really good
season. What challenges does she pose for you and how do you feel you handled
her?  
PROMISE AMUKAMARA: I think yesterday when they played, they didn't really
guard her. They left her open a lot. So I knew today I had to deny her the
ball, make her feel uncomfortable on every catch, and my teammates had my back
if I got beat when she tried to take me to the basket. So it wasn't
one‑on‑one. It was like one against five.  
  
Q. (No microphone).  
PROMISE AMUKAMARA: I think Charli said I wasn't playing hard.  
COACH THORNE: No, I said you need to step up and deny her the ball.  
PROMISE AMUKAMARA: I don't know.  
COACH THORNE: Because the standard for Promise is so high. So if there are
like two touches and they're easy, then.  
PROMISE AMUKAMARA: I get yelled at.  
COACH THORNE: We talk. And then, yeah, she had a steal, scored and I don't
think Galdeira touched the ball for like three minutes.

### [Anthony Levrets](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21838)

  
_SEATTLE, WASHINGTON_  
  

Washington  75  
Utah  64

  
THE MODERATOR: We've got Utah Coach Anthony Levrets, Tanaeya Boclair, and
Joeseta Fatuesi. Coach, an opening statement?  
COACH LEVRETS: I'm really proud of our team. I told them after the game I
wouldn't trade them for the world. We've been through an unbelievable up and
down here with all the stuff that's happened to our group injury‑wise over the
last six months, and figuring out a way to fight and compete night‑in and
night‑out after you've gone through what we've gone through is incredibly
difficult. I couldn't be prouder of our efforts.  
Obviously the result is disappointing, but I'm not going to let some numbers
on the scoreboard define who we are. Hopefully we'll get everybody back and
healthy and move forward.  
  
Q. In the second half it seemed like Davis was really the difference maker
for UW. First half 4 ‑for‑10 from the field. Obviously in the second half she
scores 18. What was the difference for her in the two halves?   
COACH LEVRETS: She's really good. She's very difficult to contain. They did a
great job of moving their parts around and letting her play off on‑ball
screens. She made big shots. She made tough shots. She got to the rim. She
made a couple plays for other people. She's just a really talented guard and
you're not going to shut her down. But she's just a really good player.  
  
Q. Coach, what adjustments did UW make in the second half?  
COACH LEVRETS: They made a few more shots. They moved their parts just a
little bit. They changed who their on‑ball screen was and where it was coming
from. But we, I think we guarded them for the most part okay. Kids made shots.
They made a bunch of contested ones. We were going to live with them getting
to the rim a little bit. We just didn't want to give up some threes. To their
credit, every time they're open, they knocked down a three. I thought that
stretch and we kind of ran out of gas there and they got three back‑to‑back
possessions in transition which is really big. Other than that, I'm pleased
with what we did.  
  
Q. You mentioned that the three transition buckets in a row that kind of got
them going in the end. In the first half though it seemed the game was more
your pace. What were you able to do in that first half that slowed them
down?  
COACH LEVRETS: Well, we just were fresh. We got the ball inside more. In the
second half we took more threes, and missed threes lead to transition. We
missed 15 of them, which my guess is most of those turned into some sort of
positive possession for them at the other end.  
But they're a really, really quality team, and as good offensively as anybody
that we've played in a long time.

_SEATTLE, WASHINGTON_  
  

Colorado  75  
USC  63

  
THE MODERATOR: Congratulations to Colorado. We've got Coach Linda Lappe, Haley
Smith, and Jamee Swan. Coach, an opening statement and then questions.  
COACH LAPPE: I thought it was one of our better games of the season. Really
proud and happy for our team, especially our three seniors for them to play
like they played and the rest of our team to really come together. I feel like
we're a really close‑knit team and you could see that tonight in how we played
and shared the ball offensively, how efficient our offense was and how we
defended.  
We've talked a lot the last couple weeks about playing defense and getting
stops. I thought we defended USC really, really well and really made a
commitment on the defensive side of things. So just extremely excited to be
moving on and get ready for the next one.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Jamee's performance tonight? It seemed like her
intensity and physical play really gave you guys a spark especially early in
the first half.  
COACH LAPPE: Yeah, I thought Jamee played like an All‑Conference player
tonight. She's tough to defend down low. I thought she did a nice job of
letting the game come to her at the beginning of the game. Had a great first
half. We needed her to play a lot of minutes with Jen getting into some early
foul trouble. She stepped up and did a nice job defensively. Really being a
presence in the paint and blocking shots. On the offensive end, being a threat
both on the outside and on the inside. You could see her versatility in how
she plays.  
I thought her teammates did a nice job of getting her the ball. She always had
the ball in great positions to be successful as well.  
  
Q. You probably knew that they were going to come out a little more intense
in the second half, but you kept your composure, your players did for most of
that time and really handled things. Is that what you had told them at
halftime, to expect that kind of thing?  
COACH LAPPE: We talked about it was 0‑0\. Didn't matter what the score was. We
wanted to come out and really reset a little bit. I put our beginning things
that we talked about on the board. I put those back on the board. We talked
about the same things that we talked about before the game, so just be able to
reset our team. Sometimes in the second half you can get ahead of yourself and
forget why you were successful in the first half. So even though they might
change and we might change, you're not going to change that drastically.  
To be able to continue to play transition defense was huge for us. Their run
in the second half was because they were getting out in transition and getting
too many lay‑ups. I liked how we responded under the 12‑minute mark. I thought
everybody stepped up. I thought we were in attack mode, and we were composed
tonight. We were extremely focused, mentally tough, and really composed. Even
when USC did make runs, we didn't let it affect us. We've been in that
situation before and everybody stepped up and had a little bit more grit to
them, and got a little bit more determined.  
  
Q. What about the impact that the three ‑pointers had on the game? Lauren
Huggins in particular.   
COACH LAPPE: That's funny, we were talking about that on the way over. It was
a huge part of the game. Two by Lauren and one by Alina, back to back to back.
It was a huge turning point to the game. We hadn't been scoring to that point
very well, and that really just opened the game up and really stretched their
defense out a little bit, and we were able to go back inside and get some
lay‑ups.  
So those were three huge shots. Again, all of them were good shots out of the
offense, good passes, and they were ready. They stepped up and knocked them
down.  
  
Q. Haley, would you talk a little bit about your game and how comfortable
you felt?  
HALEY SMITH: Yeah, I think what Coach just said was really just how we felt
composed, letting the game come to us. We didn't need to force anything. Our
offense was working really well, especially in the first half. We were able to
just find open players, hit open shots. So I think really just the flow of the
game was really easy.  
We talked about before the game just keys to success or how we could win this
one. One of those was having three, four players in double figures. So when we
were sharing the ball like that is when we're most successful. So I think
definitely the stats really show that after this game.  
  
Q. Jamee, can you talk about your game tonight? USC is a physical team. Did
you know that you were going to have to bring that physical play and match
what they do? How were you able to be successful out there tonight?  
JAMEE SWAN: Yeah, we talked a lot this week about being tough and playing
Colorado basketball. Going into this game we definitely knew it was going to
be a tough game. Always Pac‑12 Tournament games are always big games.
Everybody comes to play, it doesn't matter if you're a 12th seed or a 3rd
seed, you're always going to bring your best.  
So going out there today we just needed to be tough and play as hard as we
could and not let their play affect us.  
  
Q. I think you had three blocks in the first half. I don't know how many you
finished with, but did you feel like those three kind of altered their
presence or their mentality when they came inside?  
JAMEE SWAN: They kept attacking afterwards, so I would have to say kind of.
They used more pump fakes in the rest of the game. So they adjusted really
well. I think that I would have to say yeah, to answer your question, I think
it did.

### [Jazmine Davis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24833)

### [Mike Neighbors](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28339)

_SEATTLE, WASHINGTON_  
  

Washington  75  
Utah  64

  
THE MODERATOR: Wrapping up day one. Congratulations to the Washington Huskies,
Coach Mike Neighbors, Jazmine Davis, and Kelsey Plum. Coach, if you'd open
with a few remarks.  
COACH NEIGHBORS: I thought second half we were as good as we've been maybe all
year. Focused offensively and defensively efficiency; I think we had one
turnover. Rebounded it +2 in the second half. We all know that Utah is a team
that guards us as well as anybody that we play, and for us to have that type
of efficiency against what I think is one of the best‑coached teams in our
league, I'm really proud of our team for that.  
  
Q. Jazmine, you had a big second half. Was it something where you wanted to
take over the game or was it something that Utah was giving you?  
JAZMINE DAVIS: I just wanted to do whatever I could. It got to a point where
we needed energy, and we needed it from somewhere, and I think that maybe if I
started it somehow ‑‑ we all respond to each other really well. So I'm just
glad that my team, I was able to lead them and they trusted me with bringing
that.  
  
Q. Coming out of this halftime there was about three minutes left. Coaches
are sitting on the bench, you guys are still in the locker room, what was said
during halftime before you guys came up for the second half and before you
guys were able to make your run and hopefully win?  
KELSEY PLUM: We've been in this position before. In Utah we call it being
"Utahed". So we knew what we needed to do; it was really on the defensive end
to get stops and rebounds and I think we did a good job running in transition.  
We knew. We didn't really have to say anything. I think people knew they
needed to win their match‑up offensively and defensively, and play
collectively and it would turn out the right way in the end.  
  
Q. Do you feel a sense of relief then now to have gotten this win?  
COACH NEIGHBORS: I do, absolutely. Yeah. Our team has a mutual respect for
this team. They came in after they beat us down there. It was good to hear our
team say that. They've got a lot of respect for how they play, their players
specifically, how they approach the game, and it is a relief.  
It's hard to play in Seattle for your tournament because you have a lot of
expectations, and we had a great crowd that was tremendous. I had goose bumps
when they were doing the starting lineups. The cheer that went up for our kids
was amazing. You spend all year talking about it and it gets here. We honestly
had a bad taste in our mouth from last year, and to get that out, yeah, there
is a sense of relief.  
But that relief goes away pretty quick, and it becomes a sense of pride that
our kids can find a way to play against somebody that you respect as much as
we do them.  
  
Q. (No microphone).  
COACH NEIGHBORS: It's already gone, unfortunately. We'll have a lot of time
next week, and I told the kids that. We'll have a lot of days in between the
end of the Pac‑12 Tournament and see what happens next to reflect on not,
again, not what we're doing, but how we're going about doing it. That's so
much fun about being part of a team and having a team like this is how we go
about doing it.  
We don't practice a lot. That's been talked about a lot because we talk about
it a lot. But we're very efficient in what we do, and it takes a special group
to be able to do that, and they have to. I leave the locker room way early
because they talk to each other so well and they listen to each other so well
and they respond to each other so well. Anything I point out is usually
tactical. I may question their effort sometimes, and sometimes they agree and
sometimes they get it already fixed. When you don't have to try to inspire and
motivate your team and you can just coach them, that gives you a chance to be
pretty good.  
I can't do both of those things. I'm not good enough yet to inspire and to
coach. I can do one or the other, but it's hard to do both. We don't have to.
This team inspires themselves, and they come in focused and ready. Everything
that comes up next practice, next shootaround, whatever is next. We can really
spend our time as coaches on the tactical side of it.  
  
Q. Kelsey, second half it seemed like you were able to get going on the
offensive end as well. What changed for you in the second half, and how much
of that is Jaz getting going and spreading the ball around?  
KELSEY PLUM: It was Jazmine Davis from the tip. She really got us going. She
scored on three or four straight possessions in a row. I think that gave us a
lot of energy, and I think when that gets going, the defensive end gets going,
and we were able to get in transition. We hit some threes and kind of opened
up the can for everyone else.  
So really it was Jaz that made the first big punch, you could say thrown, and
then we went from there.  
  
Q. Coach, you guys start, you're down 7 ‑0 with a timeout. Chantel comes in,
you guys make a run. It seems like in the second half you make a run as well.
She doesn't score any points, but it seems like when she's in, that's when you
guys are able to do some damage? What is it about her that makes you guys do
so well?   
COACH NEIGHBORS: She gives us another point guard on the court. She thinks the
game like a point guard. She passes it. She's an outstanding rebounder. She is
the spark. We made the decision to bring her off the bench, that was the
reason, because we knew we'd always get a lift when that happens. Her
efficiency numbers are unbelievable.  
For a post player to be almost 2‑1 assist‑to‑turnover ratio is unheard of, and
she does always give us a sense of energy. It's not just been once, it's all
the time.  
I thought the timeout we just needed it. We just didn't look right. So I
thought taking the 60 then was important to refocus. We went on a 12‑0 run at
some point in the first half. Not right then, but at some point in the first
half we had a 12‑0 run, and like Jaz and Kelsey were saying, all of that was
dictated by defense. Getting stops and getting out and running in transition.
I felt like we had‑‑ again, you don't score 75 on Utah very often. For us to
do that, you've got to take advantage of those transition opportunities.  
We missed about eight lay‑ups tonight, if you all think about it. We renamed
an inbounds play "Smoke" because Jazmine smoked the lay‑up down there. It was
a good pass. Kelsey could have added another assist. But I thought we played‑‑
the spark that Chantel gave us was huge and then sustained throughout the
game.  
  
Q. Is that because of the way you were playing or Utah's defense?  
COACH NEIGHBORS: We were in dribble drive, so we don't get a lot of assists.
We usually get most of our assists on kickouts after a rebound. The way they
were playing us, they were staying on our shooters. When we'd drive it, they
were forcing us to make shots.  
So our number of assists, I don't look at that very often because we're not
going to get many because we do dribble it so much, and we don't throw it to
the post a whole lot. So the numbers I always look at is assists to turnovers
and how they were doing there. So always when we have 9‑4, I'll live with
that.

### [June Daugherty](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23417)

### [Lia Galdeira](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24831)

  
_SEATTLE, WASHINGTON_  
  

Washington State  66  
Oregon  64

  
THE MODERATOR: Welcome, and congratulations to Washington State. We have head
coach June Daugherty, and Lia Galdeira and Tia Presley.  
COACH DAUGHERTY: First of all, congratulations to Kelly Graves and University
of Oregon. First year he's taken over that program, and we watched them get
better and better, and better. The three games we've faced them, I think the
point total has been 6 total.  
Being able to beat them today was, back in my day it was a barn burner, that's
what they called it. Back and forth, and the ties, five minutes to go, and
both teams battling it out as far as both teams played.  
I'm just really proud of the fact that I thought our team turned it up a notch
defensively, and we were able to get the stops that we needed. We were able to
get into our running game a little bit, and it seemed like Lia put on the
Superwoman cape again and said let me take it from here and had a career high.
So really proud of our team for the win. Congratulations to Oregon on their
season, and looking forward to getting it done tomorrow.  
  
Q. Lia, looked like you ate your Wheaties this morning and you had a career
high. Did you change anything with your mentality coming into this game?  
LIA GALDEIRA: No, not at all. I was just focused on getting the win for the
team and focused on playing to Tia and Sha out there.  
  
Q. Lia, speaking of Sha, can you tell the audience why you wore her
number?  
LIA GALDEIRA: Because she should be out there playing and things happen. I
want her to feel like she's out there with us even more than she's on the
bench.  
  
Q. And Tia, being that you're a senior, how does it feel to move on?  
TIA PRESLEY: Yeah, it's the best feeling ever. I'm just so proud of how hard
the girls fought tonight. We always battle with Oregon, so it feels really
good to be able to come out with the win.  
  
Q. Lia, so Lexi Petersen guarded you most of the night but you were hot the
majority of the night. How were you able to create separation and find open
shots?  
LIA GALDEIRA: I just took what the defense gave me, what any scorer would say
to anybody.  
  
Q. You've seen the Ducks three times this season. How have you seen them
change game to game to game? Do they do anything differently tonight that you
felt like?  
COACH DAUGHERTY: I know that they had some injuries and kids came back off
injuries, like Loera has been instrumental, Bando has been hurt for a few
games, but they all came out and I thought they played their hearts out.  
The only thing that was different about them because the offensive sets were
what we expected. But I thought pretty much just how hard they were playing
and with great intensity. They left it out on the floor, no doubt about it.
But that team, we saw them really early in PAC‑12 in January, and they've just
improved immensely on both ends of the floor.  
  
Q. Coach, they shot 64% the first half?  
COACH DAUGHERTY: I know.  
  
Q. How do you defend that? Obviously 20 points lower in the second half.  
COACH DAUGHERTY: Well, as a coaching staff, we weren't really happy when 64
went up on the whiteboard in there, and our defensive coordinator had a lot to
say about that. You know, these guys, especially upperclassmen, they've really
hung their hats on the identity of being a better defensive team this year.
We've been top 5 in all defensive categories, we've made a huge shift that way
as a program. And we just reminded ourselves we're not ourselves out there
right now. We really aren't. Let's get refocused, talk more, get the rotations
right, and the shifts.  
Because of that we didn't give up the threes that we normally gave up the
first two games against them, and we were able to get a little bit of help on
Jillian Alleyne. She's an amazing talent. It's not one person that's going to
be able to guard her. You saw us digging down and mixing it up a little bit,
but we tried to limit her touches as best we could. She's come off a 33‑point
game two games ago, and also I think overall this was probably the best that
we've ever done on her even though she had a great game and a double‑double.  
  
Q. Sticking with that, what was the plan in trying to limit her, as you
said? There were a lot of bodies on her. First off, she had just four shots.  
COACH DAUGHERTY: I thought we were really efficient on the pick on ball and
the roll because she's the one that's rolling. We were trying to show it as
best we could and get back into the passing lanes. You saw, we had four
straight steals in that and then they got out of that set for a little bit.
But it really helped us with the pick on balls on the front line to kick it
out and show a hedge to the guards and get back to the high side so we were
able to make them. It was good for us in the first half, not so good in the
second half.  
  
Q. It's tournament basketball. So you've got another one tomorrow. What
about tomorrow and how do you prepare now?  
COACH DAUGHERTY: Well, we haven't seen them for a long time. We only had the
opportunity to play against Arizona and Arizona State once this year. But we
remembered that we didn't play our best basketball down in the desert. We've
been working hard to improve as a basketball team. We've gone through some
adversity. We've been adjusting our lineups, adjusting what we do offensively
and defensively.  
We have some young kids, true freshmen that are helping us, and get some
really valuable minutes like Caila Hailey, for example. I thought she had a
tremendous game for our freshmen out there. So we're looking forward to the
rematch with them. Obviously with Arizona State, you have to handle their
pressure defense, move the basketball, move the cutters, and they'll let the
ball sit on one side because they're too good at denying the passing lanes and
with the pressure of the basketball. But I think we're going to be up to it,
and we're looking forward to the challenge.  
  
Q. In the second half of the game, you were looking over the bench and
shaking your head like no one could guard you out there. Was there something
you were seeing or feeling about Oregon's defense that made you feel
unstoppable at times?  
LIA GALDEIRA: Absolutely not. I was looking at the bench for Sha because I'm
playing out there for her and Tia, like I said.

# [PACIFIC-12 CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=PACIFIC-12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 5, 2015

  

### [Jordin Canada](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28323)

### [Cori Close](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24856)

### [Kelli Hayes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28324)

  
_SEATTLE, WASHINGTON_  
  

UCLA  80  
Arizona  62

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Cori Close, Jordin Canada and Kelli Hayes. Coach, an
opening statement and then we'll go from there?  
COACH CLOSE: Sure. First of all, thanks to the media and the PAC‑12\. We need
you for our game, and this is a first class tournament, so I want to thank you
for all of your efforts.  
I also want to say how much respect I have for Arizona. I think Niya Butts is
spectacular, and we are really close to her staff. So we knew this was going
to be a battle. We knew coming into this game that they were going to be
prepared, they were going to compete hard because they reflect their great
head coach. So we came into this game knowing that it was going to take a big
effort.  
But what I'm most proud of as a coach is you don't know where those effort and
those punches are going to come from. And the selflessness that our bench has
shown all year long, they never know when their number's going to be called,
but they continue to work the same way in practice. They continue to give to
their teammates the same way. They continue to be coachable, and therefore
they're ready.  
Kelli Hayes is a perfect example of that. I thought our first half, our bench
scoring and our bench punch on rebounds was the difference in the game. It's
when the momentum turned in our favor. So I'm really pleased with the
selflessness of our bench, and the readiness of our bench to be willing to
step up when the pressure's the highest.  
  
Q. Coach, it seems like you guys really wanted to get out in transition and
push the tempo. How important was that as part of your game plan going in?  
COACH CLOSE: I just think it's who we are and when we play best. I was
disappointed we didn't do more because we didn't rebound well enough. If we
had rebounded better than on the defensive end of the floor, I thought we
could have gotten more defensive transition opportunities.  
Credit Arizona for how they ran down long rebounds and out‑of‑area rebounds.
But I thought every time we controlled one of those long rebounds, we got run
out transition baskets. So that's who we are, that's how we play best, and so
that's why defense and rebounding are so important for us, because it allows
us to be our best on offense.  
  
Q. You held them to 34% shooting. You have to be pretty happy with that.  
COACH CLOSE: I am. I think our zone has been our best defense most of the
year. They've struggled to stretch that zone out, Arizona has, and make enough
threes to really pull us out of that. I still thought in the second half we
had some lapses in that, but overall our defense was definitely our anchor.  
  
Q. What can you say about Nirra Fields?  
COACH CLOSE: Well, I think Nirra is someone who just keeps growing. I thought
in crunch time in the second half, when things got tight and they made a
little bit of a run, I think she scored seven straight points. I think that
just shows her maturity, and I think the biggest thing is she's our only
returning All‑Conference player. She's the only one who has been in this
environment before with these kind of minutes. She's the only one on our team.
So she really has to be someone who is most confident when those things
happen.  
  
Q. Then for Jordin and Kelli, just being in a situation where single
elimination, and you guys need to win the tournament in order to keep your
season alive, how do you guys feel about that so far?  
JORDIN CANADA: I think there is a lot of emotion going into this game just
because for the seniors and this being potentially their last game. We just
wanted to go in and play for them. I know that was one of the things that
coach emphasized, what are you going to give up or what is the one thing that
you're going to do to.  
COACH CLOSE: What are you going to give up for the sake of the team?  
JORDIN CANADA: Yeah. And I wanted to just play hard for the seniors and give
it my all. I think the team wanted to do that as well. So I think that was the
big motivation for us coming into this game, and I think we did a pretty good
job tonight. Although we were down on the boards, we've got to do a little bit
better job of that playing against Stanford, they're a great team, so we need
to keep up our intensity that we had today, I think we should be in good
shape.  
KELLI HAYES: To piggyback off what Jordin said, I think that we just focus on
we don't want to have any regrets, and we've had a lot in the past from
preseason to regulation or whatever the heck it's called, PAC‑12, and now the
tournament. We wanted to just go all out because all we had is one loss and
we're out.  
With this team, this is a team that we have and we need to work with what we
have. I think we can continue to do that and continue to play as a team.

# [PACIFIC-12 CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=PACIFIC-12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 5, 2015

  

### [Niya Butts](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21931)

  
_SEATTLE, WASHINGTON_  
  

UCLA  80  
Arizona  62

  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. We've got the Arizona Wildcats, Coach Niya Butts,
Candice Workman, and Breanna Workman. Coach, an opening statement?  
COACH BUTTS: Obviously I want to thank these two young ladies to my right.
Candice, who is a senior, who will be leaving us, I appreciate everything
you've done for us and done for this program. Brea, obviously you've got a
little more time left, but you work hard, you're a grinder, and I appreciate
what you do.  
Obviously the season didn't turn out the way we wanted. This game didn't turn
out the way we wanted. Want to make sure I give credit to UCLA for coming out
and playing a great game and doing the necessary things it took for them to
win. But at the same time, I share with our team, I'll say the same thing to
you and the media, I want our players to know, I don't want you guys to hang
your head, because in this thing it's about opportunities, and that's what
life is about. Life is about opportunities, even the ones you miss. Sometimes
it's like that. But you've got to be able to push on and continue to grind.  
  
Q. This is for everybody, what about UCLA's 2 ‑3 was disruptive?   
COACH BUTTS: Oh, boy, it slowed us down a little bit. We felt like in
preparing for it that we can get open looks in it and get into the gaps a
little bit. But they were able to slow us down. We missed shots, but we got a
lot of rebounds, we just didn't capitalize on those rebounds like we should
have.  
So, certainly, credit to them for doing a good job and staying with it.  
  
Q. Coach, talk a little bit about what you just told your girls in the
locker room at the end of the season?  
COACH BUTTS: Just obviously we're all disappointed, disappointed in this last
game. But I told them not to focus on the negatives. Focus on the things that
we didn't do well, focus on the things you did well, especially to you're
seniors. I want them to know that life is about ups and downs and you need to
have perspective.  
Again, we're blessed. We have great opportunity as coaches, as players, as
members of this great conference, and it's about those opportunities. A lot of
people don't get them, so we want to make sure that we keep life and this
stuff in perspective as much as we can. But understand for those that are
moving forward and for those that are returning, you know, we have to make
sure that we get ourselves ready and we're better prepared next year.  
Thank you very much, and look forward to seeing you around.

### [Jillian Alleyne](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26499)

### [Lexi Bando](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28321)

### [Kelly Graves](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23609)

  
_SEATTLE, WASHINGTON_  
  

Washington State  66  
Oregon  64

  
THE MODERATOR: Welcome, we've got the Oregon Ducks head coach Kelly Graves,
Jillian Alleyne and Lexi Bando. Coach, some opening comments on the game?  
COACH GRAVES: Thank you. Sorry it took us so long to get here. First of all, I
want to congratulate Washington State. They played a great game. They deserved
it. I thought down the stretch especially they appeared to want it maybe a
little bit more, and they made some of the bigger plays.  
But I'm really proud of our basketball team. I thought we fought hard today
and we fought hard all season. I think one of the traits of this group is we
never gave up. We had a lot of games where we were down big and we always
seemed to find a way to come back. It's always hard this game when you know
it's the last for the seniors and we have a really gracious and great group of
seniors that we just said goodbye to a second ago.  
  
Q. Jillian, could you tell us what was going through your mind when you made
that three pointer, your first career ever?  
JILLIAN ALLEYNE: I just knew there were two seconds on the clock and I didn't
have time to pass the ball or give the ball to anybody else, so I just shot
it. Lately we've been doing this drill in practice where we have ten seconds
down the court to shoot. And that's the only chance I've ever had to take a
three, so I saw an opportunity, and I took it.  
  
Q. Coach, can you take us through that last sequence there, the last few
seconds obviously just trying to get a shot up at that point and no timeouts?
What was going through your mind?  
COACH GRAVES: Well, you know, you work on that. We know that's what we want to
do, it just took us a little bit to get the outlet to Drea and then, you know,
I think she wanted to make the pass a second earlier and couldn't quite get it
out of her hands. But she saw Lexi there. At that moment, that's what you do.
Even if you have a timeout, you push the ball as quickly as you can. But had a
pretty good look, it was just a half second too late.  
  
Q. After the win against Stanford, you guys talked about how you thought
you'd be able to carry the momentum forward here in Seattle. What happened?
What was the mentality set up for today?  
COACH GRAVES: Well, I thought we were ready to play. We came out and had a
good start. It was a fun game in terms of runs. I mean, both teams would get
leads and the other would battle back. And then in the late second half, it
was just a basket‑for‑basket game.  
So I thought we were ready. I thought we were prepared. We met a good
basketball team who had an elite level basketball player who led an amazing
game. I mean, Lia Galdeira does that, and there is not a whole lot she can't
do. We probably gave her too many good looks, but once she gets in a rhythm,
even the bad looks become good because the basket becomes really big for her.  
No, listen, I'm proud of how we competed and played and conducted ourselves
all year. On and off the court, in the classroom, this has been a really good
group.  
  
Q. Jillian, Lexi, is there a moment in this season that really jumped out to
you? A game, a play, a basket? Something that you think that this whole season
embodied?  
JILLIAN ALLEYNE: I would probably say when we played UCLA I thought that was
one of our best games we played at home, and it came down to the very last
second and Lexi Petersen and Jill were in a pick and roll, and Jill hit the
last‑second shot. I think that game showed everyone that we were ready to
compete, we were ready for more. And we had a six‑game losing streak in the
beginning to start out PAC‑12\. But we came back.  
I mean, it's been a really great year. It's been a year of development and
learning, so that would probably be the game.  
LEXI BANDO: For me, I would say it was the Stanford game because everyone
contributed every single play. I think that also showed because we had just
lost to Cal by some odd number of points and to come back and beat Stanford
who is an elite team and ranked like that just shows the heart of our team and
how hard we can compete and how good we can really be.  
It's been a lot of fun. The seniors have been the greatest class that I've had
go before me, and it's hard to let them go, but it's been a fun year. It's
been a lot funner than a lot of people expected.  
  
Q. Coach, in the first half, you dropped 64% and then 44%. What in your mind
was the difference there?  
COACH GRAVES: I thought all night we got pretty good looks. I thought we
handled the pressure better in the second half. But the first half, I thought
the entire thing was we had too many turnovers. When we did shoot, we shot a
good percentage and got, for the most part the, shots that we wanted.  
Second half, still 44% is pretty good for us. That's not awful, but you
can't‑‑ you know, I think when you turn the ball over, you never really get it
to the rhythm that you want, and offense sometimes is a lot about rhythm.
Especially us, we don't have a ton of play‑makers, quite frankly. We have to
do things right. We have to set screens and space the floor and make baskets.
Even so I thought we had some good shot at the end of the game, the one that
would have tied it was a lay‑up. Contested but it was a lay‑up shot at the
rim.  
  
Q. I guess, Jill and Lexi, what are you most proud of that you feel like you
accomplished this season?  
LEXI BANDO: For me, I would honestly say I think I've learned so much this
year. I have obviously three more years left. The coaches have been awesome
with us. We basically went back to the basics and started over with developing
a new offense and learning the basics on defense again because we weren't that
good at defense all year. But we got better.  
I think just seeing us develop as a group, which is awesome, we got better and
better each day at practice and in the games. It was just a great group. Hat's
off to the seniors. They were awesome, and they were a great group to look up
to, especially all the upperclassmen. But overall I thought it was a fun year,
and I can't wait for the next three.  
JILLIAN ALLEYNE: For myself, I would say my development as a player. I think
that I've made a lot of leaps and bounds, and that's because of my teammates
and my coaches. I think this year compared to my first two years, I was really
pushed to my limit. Before it was kind of just like Jill's going to do Jill.
But this year, whether it was Coach Kelly or someone else, I had them always
on me, and that really brought out the player inside of me that I can be and I
will be in the future. And I credit all my teammates because I couldn't have
done that without them and without the coaches.  
Ultimately, our record is 13‑17, and I think that is the best 13 games that us
as a team have played since I've been here at Oregon.  
  
Q. Lexi and Jill, you guys mentioned seniors as you looked up to them.
Obviously you guys are returning for next year. What can you take from the
season? What is the biggest takeaway you can bring into next season?  
JILLIAN ALLEYNE: The biggest takeaway is to have a leader on the floor at all
times. Amanda did a really good job with that, as well as our seniors. They
were the glue to our team and kept us in check. Just to be a leader and now me
about to be a senior and knowing what college basketball's about, just leading
my team and being an example and working a hundred percent in every practice
and trusting more and more what Coach Kelly has for us. If he has a great
offense and defense, just a great basketball play for the University of
Oregon, so just going forward and building.  
LEXI BANDO: Piggybacking off what Jill said, I think it comes down to every
possession counts and every practice you've got to like play it like it's your
last in every game. I think that's what I'll take away from this year mostly
and bring to next year. We just have to step up and play hard every game
because four years goes quick, as the seniors were saying.  
  
Q. Lexi, one last question. Keeping it on the perimeter and stuff. I wonder
if you could comment on Lia's game. Seemed that she got open quite a bit for
somebody that hot.  
LEXI BANDO: She got what?  
  
Q. It seemed she got open quite a bit for being as hot as she was. Why did
you think that was happening and what did you think of her performance?  
LEXI BANDO: Lia Galdeira is definitely a player I look up to. She played an
amazing game and hit some tough shots that I didn't even think that would go
in. She played great. I think Lexi Petersen was starting for the most part and
she was crowding here. But Lia made space for herself. She's such a high‑level
athlete, and she just went off tonight and played her best.  
  
Q. (No microphone)?  
LEXI BANDO: I subluxed my shoulder, so it partially came out at practice. So,
yeah, but I played today and don't need surgery or anything.  
  
Q. Is it just a partial separation?  
LEXI BANDO: Yeah, but it's fine.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=PACIFIC-12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 5, 2015

  

### [Jordan Adams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26751)

### [Brianna Barrett](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28331)

### [Cynthia Cooper-Dyke](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26477)

  
_SEATTLE, WASHINGTON_  
  

Colorado  75  
USC  63

  
THE MODERATOR: We've got USC here, Coach Cynthia COOPER‑DYKE‑Dyke, Jordan
Adams and Brianna Barrett. Coach, some opening remarks?  
COACH COOPER‑DYKE: It was a tough game. Hat's off to Colorado. Executed their
game plan to perfection. They played really hard for 40 minutes, so you've got
to give credit where it's due. They did a tremendous job for 40 minutes. I
thought we didn't shoot very well in the first half. Came out in the second
half with better intensity but really couldn't get over the hump. Every time
we made a run, Colorado came back and either got to the free‑throw line or
knocked down a three‑point shot.  
So it was a tough loss, tough game. I want to thank our seniors, Alexyz
Vaioletama, and Kaneisha Horn, who have just done a tremendous job for us. And
wish we could have sent them out in a better way, but still doesn't diminish
the hard work and sacrifice that they've given both to our university and our
program.  
  
Q. You mentioned you guys struggled shooting the ball in the first half.
What was Colorado doing defensively that made it so hard for you guys?  
COACH COOPER‑DYKE: Well, Colorado is a very physical team. Then they played a
sagging man defense, which stopped us from penetrating. We like to get to the
basket.  
The other thing that they did was execute offensively. They knocked down some
shots offensively, which didn't allow us to rebound the ball or get
deflection, steals and then get out in our fast break. So with the execution
with the way they shot in the first half, it really kind of stifled our
offense a little bit and made us become a half‑court basketball team, when we
really wanted to get up and down the court.  
Second half I thought we brought the right level of intensity but we weren't
consistent, and we didn't force the issue when it came to running the ball and
really getting into transition. So we came up short.  
  
Q. Jordan, going forward do you feel like there is a good foundation here, a
good, young foundation for this team?  
JORDAN ADAMS: We have a lot of really good freshmen. We have some that are
coming back. We're just losing two. We're not losing half of our team, so I
think we'll have a good foundation.  
I think this is a learning experience for a lot of us, and we're just going to
use this going forward and hopefully have a better season next year.  
BRIANNA BARRETT: Same thing Jordan said. We have a lot of freshmen that are
coming in and that are here that they got a lot of playing time. So we're
hoping that they learn from what they did and their mistakes, and take from
the good that they did also and expand on that. Also the returners that are
coming and step into our roles and become more of leaders for the freshmen
coming in and the freshmen we have now, that are going to be sophomores next
year.  
I don't know. We just need to build off what we did this year and take from
the good and build off that for next season so we can have a better season.  
  
Q. Coach, what was the message at halftime? It was pretty clear you guys
came out with more intensity and, I think you got the lead down to six at one
point. Did you change the game plan or just give your team a strong message at
the half?  
COACH COOPER‑DYKE: I think it was a strong message at halftime. We talked
about our defense. We talked about getting deflections and steals and
rebounding the ball so that we can get out in our fast break. We made some
tweaks offensively because of Colorado's sagging man defense. But ultimately
it was up to finish around the basket. It was up to us to force the issue when
it came to transition. We weren't able to do that because I just really
thought Colorado came out and played an extremely well‑planned,
well‑thought‑out, and well‑executed game.  
Their intensity early on in the game, their intensity, we didn't match their
intensity which gave them an opportunity. It really allowed them to have a
rhythm offensively that we could never really overcome. So, back to the
drawing board.

_NORTH LITTLE ROCK, ARKANSAS_  
  

South Carolina  62  
Tennessee  46

  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by South Carolina head coach and
student‑athletes Aleighsa Welch and Tiffany Mitchell.  
Questions.  
  
Q. Dawn, from where South Carolina was when you took over till now, can you
just explain the joy in finally toppling Tennessee and becoming the league's
new elite program?  
COACH STALEY: I mean, it feels good. It feels pretty good to be where we are
today because we still feel every bit of seven years ago, six years ago when
we were just trying to jump‑start the program.  
These are the times in which we look forward to, we envision sitting here
today being SEC tournament champions. It feels great.  
  
Q. Aleighsa, for how low the team felt last week at Kentucky, winning today,
describe the difference of emotion, and the fact you earned MVP honors.  
ALEIGHSA WELCH: It's kind of hard to put the excitement into words. This is a
goal we set for ourselves at the beginning of the season. Coming in off of a
loss, three games in three days, it's not easy. For everybody to kind of lock
down, put their mental focus in, it pays off. Moments like this, it's really
hard to explain.  
As far as the MVP, it means a lot to me. I wasn't expecting to get it. I'm
thankful. But I owe a lot of it to my teammates, especially picking me up when
I was down when I missed a couple easy ones. It was a team effort and I just
appreciate it.  
  
Q. Aleighsa, when the game was still close, seems like you were getting your
hands on every offensive rebound. Like you said before, it's not about the
talent it's about the want. How much did you want to get those boards?  
ALEIGHSA WELCH: I wanted every rebound that came of the boards, offensively or
defensively. I made sure that I attempted to go for every rebound. That's
something I just love to do. I knew we needed offensive boards. My goal was
just to attack the boards, attack the glass every time a shot went up.  
Offensive rebounds is all about effort.  
  
Q. Coach and Tiffany, you held them to 46 points, an SEC low. What was the
key today?  
COACH STALEY: I think the key is coming into a tournament like this, that is
important. I thought Tennessee played a lot of minutes last night against
Kentucky. For us, we were probably a lot fresher because we were able to use a
lot of different people over the past three days.  
We just tried to keep fresh legs on them. We tried to contest all of their
shots. We just tried to make them work extremely hard for everything that they
got.  
Fortunately for us our defense did the job tonight and won us a tournament
championship.  
TIFFANY MITCHELL: She took the words right out of my mouth (laughter). I was
going to say the exact same thing.  
  
Q. In regards to your defense, did you do anything differently? Tennessee
got better shots, made more of them in the game in Columbia. Did you change up
anything at all?  
COACH STALEY: The one adjustment, just coming into the tournament, we knew it
would help us throughout the three games that we would play, just the people
we would face, is to go back to the basics of help and recover, help the
helper. Just really went back to the basics of our defense.  
We knew we would give up some open looks, but we just didn't want to give up
sure twos versus contested threes. I thought we did a really good job at
executing that.  
  
Q. Lisa, Tiffany hasn't been around four years yet, so this is for you.
You've been around this program for a long time. You've been waiting for this
moment. Now that it's happened, can you describe it considering the ups and
downs you've gone through as a player.  
ALEIGHSA WELCH: It's something that was talked to me, Coach Debbie talked to
me about it when I was being recruited. The first year, the excitement we had,
making it to the Sweet 16, to now winning the SEC tournament championship,
everything about this season has kind of just had little check points that I
can mark off things I wanted to accomplish while I've been here.  
It means that much more to me to happen during my senior year, during a year
in which a lot of firsts are going on this season.  
But looking back when she came to my home visit, some of the stuff we talked
about till now, it means a lot that there were a lot of things on that list
that have been accomplished so far.  
  
Q. Tiffany, can you describe where you feel this team can go now confidence
‑wise. Does a win like this today give you the absolute most confidence that
you can cross off that biggest goal on your checklist, which is winning a
national championship?  
TIFFANY MITCHELL: I think this win today was a big confidence booster. It's a
great momentum leading up into the NCAA tournament.  
I think we're in a good place right now. We're going to have a good push in
the tournament.  
  
Q. Tiffany, when you were looking for some scores today, Sessions really
stepped up. She hadn't scored much early on in the tournament, talk about her
sparkplug for you today on the offensive end.  
TIFFANY MITCHELL: We know how teams play Khadijah. The whole season they kind
of (indiscernible) off of her, kind of force her to make those shots. She's
been getting in the gym, taking practice shots. Just knocked them down, she
had the confidence to shoot them.  
  
Q. In the first half when Graves had to sit with two fouls, what were you
thinking at halftime? Did you think it was a lost opportunity or were you
still confident?  
COACH STALEY: I felt we did not take advantage of having such a big offensive
threat in Graves being in foul trouble. We also didn't play our best
basketball.  
We didn't score as many points in the paint where I thought we had our
advantage. But I was still encouraged because the defense was holding up. To
hold Tennessee to 26 points is pretty darn good. If your defense is working as
well as it was, I felt confident that coming down the stretch we could get
some good looks at the basket.  
  
Q. Tiffany and Aleighsa, as big a deal as it is winning the SEC tournament,
does it make it better you beat the established power in the league? Tennessee
has won 17 of these tournaments.  
ALEIGHSA WELCH: It's always big for you to kind of know you've established
your program when you've been able to beat a team of Tennessee's caliber,
especially twice in a season and a game like this where so much is on the
line.  
Like I said, you have the utmost respect for the program they've established
and they've had for a very long time. But our focus was on us, doing what we
had to do.  
No matter who we played today, we wanted to make sure we came out and did what
we needed to do to win.  
  
Q. Coach, you hugged your staff with 45 seconds left in the game. Talk about
what you were feeling in that moment, what this championship means to South
Carolina, and what's next.  
COACH STALEY: I mean, I hugged them because they pretty much do all the work.
They do all the dirty work to get our team prepared for teams in this league.
That is not an easy feat.  
I just wanted to embrace them and let them know that this moment occurred
because of them. For us, our staff has been together for so long. I think that
helps when you have continuity on staff, you work as a family. You win as a
family, you lose as a family. This is probably one of the biggest wins that
we've ever had as a staff. We just wanted to enjoy that moment.  
  
Q. Tiffany, yesterday probably wasn't your best day. Today was just as good
as yesterday might have been challenging. Was that something different or a
difference in the looks you were allowed?  
TIFFANY MITCHELL: I mean, yesterday was probably one of the worst games I've
had wearing a South Carolina jersey.  
My teammates did a great job encouraging me and telling me to stay the course.
Coach Staley told me to stop thinking so much and play basketball. Coach
McCray worked with me before the game getting some extra shots.  
My preparation was a little bit different than yesterday's.  
  
Q. Aleighsa, now comes the time where you, especially as a senior, it's win
or it's over. How much will that drive you once you start playing in the big
tournament?  
ALEIGHSA WELCH: There's not going to be a game we play where I don't give all
that I have as far as effort, doing everything I can do to possibly will my
team to a win.  
Like you said, now it is win or go home. You can't afford to have a bad game.
You can't afford to not prepare the right way leading up to a game.  
For me as a senior, kind of just still wanting to savor the moment, there
won't be a time when I step on the court where I'm not giving 150% for my team
and laying it all out on the line.  
  
Q. Aleighsa, how do you feel how you ended the game?  
ALEIGHSA WELCH: Most definitely. It gave us a lot of confidence going into
halftime, to be able to go on that run. Kind of a momentum shift. Before that
we were down by five. To be able to go on that run leading into halftime, the
energy was up in the locker room. There was a lot more talking.  
I think it fed off into the second half as far as we were still able to keep
that momentum when we came out. It was really important for us to go on that
run and keep that momentum going into halftime.  
  
Q. Coach, from your perspective, talk about what Aleighsa has meant to this
program, how she's factored into this turnaround.  
COACH STALEY: Aleighsa has been a mainstay. It's almost hard to believe that
it's already been four years. What you've seen is someone who has grown into a
leadership position because she wasn't always that. But that's what you want
to instill in young people when they come into your program. You want to give
them tools that they'll be able to use out in the real world.  
Obviously the platform for her to lead our basketball team was a great feat
for her. But we still hopefully got a lot of basketball left in us. She has
been one that if you look at our Kentucky game, she was under the weather, she
wasn't able to give us the effort and energy she usually gives us. It was felt
throughout our entire team.  
Then she comes into a tournament like this and gives it to us. We become SEC
champions. That's a really hard, hard thing when you're a leader and you're
expected to bring it every single night, even when you're under the weather.
It's hard on the team when it's not there.  
I hope she can see that. So she means that much to our basketball team. It can
be a defeat if she doesn't bring what she normally brings to our team.  
You don't want a player to have that much power. But when they understand it
and they bring it, beautiful things can happen.  
  
Q. Coach, do you measure the progress of your program against a traditional
power like Tennessee? If so, where are you at on that path?  
COACH STALEY: I mean, if you look at history, it's not anywhere near where we
feel real good coming into each game. I think we've beat them I think this is
the third time.  
  
Q. Fourth ever.  
COACH STALEY: Fourth ever in 30 years.  
I mean, but I think when you go up against such a traditional powerhouse like
Tennessee, you need opportunities to play them. You got to continue to play
them. The more you play them, the more you'll be able to chip away at some of
the things they're really good at.  
You get more and more talented players like they have 'cause you can't win on
out‑working them because they'll out‑talent you every single night.  
We've been kind of able to even the playing field where it doesn't come down
to us having to play perfect basketball.  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, coach, thank you.  
COACH STALEY: Thank you.

_NORTH LITTLE ROCK, ARKANSAS_  
  

South Carolina  62  
Tennessee  46

  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by Tennessee head coach along with
student‑athletes Jordan Reynolds and Cierra Burdick.  
COACH WARLICK: Hard‑fought game. South Carolina was tough. They played hard.
Very deserving of the game.  
Thought our kids battled. It just wasn't our night.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. I don't know how much South Carolina did differently defensively, but it
looked like it was more on its game defensively than in your first meeting
during the regular season.  
COACH WARLICK: Probably so, because we only scored 46 points. We missed easy
shots. We missed layups. We missed free throws. Our margin for error against
South Carolina is very small. It has to be small.  
You got to make shots that are around the basket, layups. We didn't.  
  
Q. Girls, can you speak on that run they had at the end of the first half.
How did that affect your mindset going into halftime, if at all?  
CIERRA BURDICK: I mean, it's a game of runs. This is basketball. You expect
them to make runs. Then you come in with the mindset that we have to make a
run. We went on a run before they went on theirs.  
Mindset at halftime was the same as always. We have to come out and continue
to compete within the first four minutes. So I commend them for the run they
made. Once they made it, we couldn't really get it back, and that's what hurt
us.  
  
Q. Jordan, the SEC tournament is an area where you've thrived offensively.
Talk about your mindset.  
JORDAN REYNOLDS: Well, I tried to stay in attack mode for my teammates just to
take some of the pressure off of them. I know they've had a great season, you
know. They're so used to the double‑doubles by Cierra Burdick, Andraya Carter,
Bashaara, those big great names. I try to take pressure off of them because I
know the teams are going to come after them harshly.  
I thought it would be a time to step up because anybody can play in the
tournament.  
  
Q. Coach, do you still think this is a one seed going into the NCAA
tournament? What is next for Tennessee?  
COACH WARLICK: You know, it doesn't matter what I think. It hasn't all year.
It doesn't matter.  
We can have the number one RPI, the second toughest schedule in the country,
and it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter what I think and how hard these kids
play.  
We lost Isabelle Harrison and the world has ended for us. That's what's out
there. The world has ended.  
You know, we're stepping up to the plate. We got something to say.  
So I don't know. I don't know what we're going to get. We're going to take
whatever they give us. Seeding and schedule, I'm not convinced that comes into
play anywhere. So we're going to take what we get.  
  
Q. Holly, talk about the difficulty that Welch presents in terms of the
ability she sometimes has the killer second ‑chance points?  
COACH WARLICK: I thought we did a better job on second‑chance points. She's
got a passion to rebound. We got to put a body on her. We did at times, then
she got loose at times.  
She's a tough player to defend and tough player to keep off the boards.  
  
Q. When you're talking about seeding, as though Harrison's loss will affect
that, that's what is out there.  
COACH WARLICK: Yes.  
  
Q. What are you basing that on? Mock brackets?  
COACH WARLICK: That's all I hear in the media. That's all I'm reading, all I'm
hearing. I think this team has proved that it's tough. They lose their best
player, and this team has competed in every game.  
Our bench is probably not as big as everybody else's. I can say what I want to
say, but it's not going to matter if I think we should get a one seed or a two
seed.  
All I know is we can take what we get, then we'll prepare and battle for it.  
  
Q. Cierra, your second game against South Carolina now. How tough is it
banging down low with South Carolina's frontline?  
CIERRA BURDICK: They're a physical team across the board, their guards, posts,
tweeners. They're a physical basketball team. I think that's the way they're
coached up, their mindset. They're blue‑collar workhorses.  
So it's physical down there. Then the fact they can continue to sub in and out
and have a revolving door, I mean, that hurts. They're having fresh players,
and we're having people playing 30, 40 minutes.  
It is what it is. We just got to continue to go back to the drawing board and
get better. I commend South Carolina. They played a great basketball game.
They were the better team tonight.  
But we will come back stronger.  
  
Q. Coach, talk about Dawn Staley, what she's done with South Carolina, what
that means for the league and women's basketball to have another powerhouse.  
COACH WARLICK: It speaks for itself. She came in and has turned that program
around. She's worked hard doing it.  
She's kept players in the state of South Carolina. Those players that were
going to North Carolina, were going to Georgia, she kept them home. That's a
tough thing to do.  
They bought into what she believed and had a vision, so...  
I mean, this league, it's a tough league. This tournament is a testament to
that. It's been a battle.  
You know, I think the bottom five in our league can compete with a lot of
people all across the country, and they won't get to do that because we kind
of beat up on each other. They more than likely won't get in the tournament.  
But I think this is the best league in the country. But South Carolina, Dawn
has done a great job with that program, absolutely, absolutely.  
  
Q. Coach, last night you said that the bench was going to have to be a big
factor today. How much of an impact do you think that had on today's game?  
COACH WARLICK: You know, I think all of us, we missed layups and we missed
free throws. I don't care if you're on the bench or a starter. You can't have
those looks and not win the game. If you don't get stops at key moments, you
don't keep them off the boards, that's key, too.  
I don't know so much if it was the bench. I thought we got good player from
Jaime Nared. I thought she did some really good things. Nia Moore as well.
Alexa Middleton. We needed to make shots that we were open, get stops. It
boils down to those very simple things. We didn't.  
  
Q. What is your message to a senior in Ariel Massengale after a tournament
like this as you look forward to March Madness?  
COACH WARLICK: Well, she's been a major factor for us and our success. I think
she had a tough tournament. It's part of it. We're not going to give up on
her. She'll get back in the gym.  
She's a great leader. She didn't score today, but what a great leader she was
on the court and on the bench. We still needed her, regardless of what her
stat line was.  
I would never tell her to quit shooting because I think she's one of the best
shooters we have.  
  
Q. Tennessee has been Tennessee for so long. If you could explain for
everyone your confidence in how these last two losses are just that, not some
changing of the guard, just two losses.  
COACH WARLICK: I don't know. This team is really a great example of being Lady
Vols. When your back is against the wall, you don't crumble. You have a lot of
belief and faith in your coaches, your teammates and the system.  
I'd really be bothered if it didn't affect us and we weren't upset because
we're competitors. We want to win everything we do. We want to win every
practice drill. We want to win every shooting drill. It just carries over.  
Yeah, we're hurting right now, but I know this team. I know what Tennessee
teams do: we go back to work. We're going to learn from this. We've learned.
We're going to learn from it. We'll be a better team because of it.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, ladies, thank you very much.  
COACH WARLICK: Thank you all.

_NORTH LITTLE ROCK, ARKANSAS_  
  

Tennessee  75  
Kentucky  64

  
THE MODERATOR: We are now joined by Kentucky head coach and student‑athletes
Jelleah Sidney and Bria Goss.  
COACH MITCHELL: What a great basketball game. A lot of effort expended out
there on the floor from both teams.  
I thought Tennessee just played great. They have such talented players,
well‑coached, played so hard today.  
I thought our players gave tremendous effort. We just couldn't get the ball in
the basket. Tennessee made more shots than we did. It was just a terrific game
to be a part of. I can't begin to tell you how proud I am of our team. The
distance we traveled in the last 10 days as a basketball team is really
amazing.  
Proud of our seniors, just the way that they have really taken control of our
team here down the stretch.  
We will enter the NCAA tournament with very high hopes, very excited to get
back and play in the NCAA tournament.  
We wish Tennessee well and South Carolina well. It will be a great champion
crowned here tomorrow.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. It was a real physical ballgame tonight. Was that part of the game
plan?  
COACH MITCHELL: Well, I thought at times the physicality of the game was
disruptive to both teams. It was a very tough game out there today.  
We wanted to be disruptive. We wanted to try to get disruptive with the pace.
I thought Tennessee did a great job of controlling the pace of the game in the
first half with their press. We just didn't handle that very well. That's on
me. We didn't have the team prepared well enough to really attack the press.
We will work hard to get better at that.  
It was a very physical game.  
  
Q. Girls, you've come so close so many times. Talk about the emotion of
getting so close since you all have been here.  
BRIA GOSS: It just really fuels the fire to get back in the gym. We still have
a lot of basketball to play. We're going to look at the film, correct our
mistakes, really focus on us and what we can do better to improve.  
Yeah, like I said, we have a lot more basketball to play. So we'll try to keep
our heads tie.  
JELLEAH SIDNEY: To piggyback off of Bria, we'll go back to the gym. We have a
lot of things to work on. Tonight wasn't our night. We had 20 offensive
rebounds, we only scored nine points off of it. We need to go back to the gym
so we can figure out what to do for the NCAA tournament.  
  
Q. Epps had 31 points last night, 10 points tonight. Obviously Tennessee
tried to frustrate her. What were they able to do to take her out of the game?
Also, Andraya Carter's defense, her being left off of the all ‑defensive
team?  
COACH MITCHELL: The second part first.  
I think she's a fantastic player. She's a really, really good defender. I
don't know how many you get on the defensive team. She's a really good
defender. She doesn't need to be on the team for anybody to know it. Everybody
can see her and watch her out there. She plays with intensity and hustle. I
admire Andraya. I think she's a really good player and plays hard, plays the
way you'd like to see a player play.  
I thought we didn't help Makayla very much in the first half against the
press. The halfcourt trap really slowed us down. Again, that's on me. We
didn't have them ready to attack that. That's not Makayla's fault, but mine.
We'll try to get better at that.  
  
Q. Girls, how did you feel like your start was defensively? Do you feel you
could have taken bigger advantage of that on the offensive end?  
BRIA GOSS: Definitely. We focus on our defense to get our offense going. We
kind of eased into this one. Tennessee made us pay.  
I think coming out, getting the first five points was good, but we didn't let
that carry out for the next minutes.  
  
Q. Coach, with Epps, she's obviously a scoring point guard. Where do you
find the balance with her setting up her teammates or attacking one ‑on‑one
like she was doing last night?  
COACH MITCHELL: She has a really good feel for the game. She has a lot of
games with high assist numbers. She's very productive in that. Just a real
versatile player.  
She finds the balance. She's high IQ basketball‑wise. I just always try to
talk to her about what plays are necessary to win that particular game. Is it
scoring? Is it setting your teammates up?  
I think she's come a long way and learned a lot from this tournament. She had
to play a lot of minutes, had to fight through three games in three days. I
think it will make her a better player.  
  
Q. Could you talk about not being able to put the ball in the basket
tonight. Was that something Tennessee was doing or really was something that
wasn't happening with you guys?  
COACH MITCHELL: My perspective from the sideline, I think Tennessee played
really tough defense around the rim tonight. There's no doubt about that.  
I think those things sometimes it looks like it gets a little contagious,
people get frustrated. After you've missed so many, people maybe start rushing
a little bit. There's a lack of poise is really what I saw out there.  
I thought our turnovers in the first half, we were lifting our pivot foot. I
thought that was a lack of poise. We had a lot of fall‑aways because Tennessee
is athletic and big. In a tough game like this, you have to hang in there and
be tough, find the rim, put the ball in the basket.  
We missed a lot of layups tonight. We counted 18. If you could make half of
those, you're in really good shape. It's a game that falls in your favor. They
didn't go in.  
JELLEAH SIDNEY: Tennessee is a great team. They play great defense. I think we
were rushing a little too much. When we go back in the gym, we're going to
work on that.  
  
Q. Coach, you've beaten Mississippi State this year. You've beaten South
Carolina. This was your third loss to Tennessee. What is it about the matchup
with this particular Tennessee team that's been so tough for y'all this
year?  
COACH MITCHELL: Well, it's been three good games. They've just found a way to
make more buckets than us. It's a very, very well‑coached team. Very prepared.
They play real hard. Just really admire how hard they play. They play
together.  
They're just a tough team. We had a chance all three times and just weren't
able to beat them this particular year. But we will get back in the saddle
next year and see what we can do.  
They're a really good team. I admired how hard they played today. We wish them
the best tomorrow, as we do South Carolina. It will be a great champion
crowned tomorrow.  
  
Q. Matthew, you have almost two weeks to wait to find out what happens. If
you were on the committee, you probably earned the right to host by now, do
you think you've done that? What seed do you think you've earned considering
your varied résumé?  
COACH MITCHELL: Thank you for asking that question. That's a great question.  
I don't know how in the world we would be anything higher than a three seed. I
don't see any indicator, strength of schedule, RPI, quality wins, I don't see
anything that has us outside of the top 12. So I would say a three seed.  
I don't know. I'm probably the least versed and the least knowledgeable about
how it all happens. That's just my opinion of the little that I've looked at
it.  
I won't worry a whole lot about it. I would definitely think we're one of the
top 17 teams. I think we'll probably host, I would think. But I don't know
what else to tell you.  
We played a very difficult schedule. All schedules are not created equal in
the Southeastern Conference. We didn't have one of the easier ones this year.
We had a real tough one. We had a tough non‑conference schedule. We did all
the things you're asked to do to have a tough one.  
I think we were a two at one time behind Tennessee. If they're looking for a
team that's tough and has had to play tough, has answered the bell, had some
great wins, that's us.  
We'll look forward to getting selected to the tournament. I would say for us
right now, those of you who follow us know it's been a very, very emotionally
draining and physically draining last 10 days after the Ole Miss loss. The
transformation in our team has been amazing. I'm so proud to coach 'em.  
If there was a team that ever needed a couple days off to rest and really get
refreshed and get their spirits lifted, it's our team. I think we'll really,
really benefit from some rest.  
I just look so forward to coaching this team in the NCAA tournament. It will
be a lot of fun. They're a great, great group of young people. They've so
impressed me with how hard they've worked in the last 10 days.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.  
COACH MITCHELL: Thank you.

_NORTH LITTLE ROCK, ARKANSAS_  
  

South Carolina  74  
LSU  54

  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by South Carolina head coach and
student‑athletes Tina Roy and Olivia Gaines.  
Questions.  
  
Q. Olivia, you don't get a lot of minutes. When you come in, you always seem
to make an impact. After the first 15 minutes, what was your mindset?  
OLIVIA GAINES: Pretty much I have to get stops, just trying to help my team.
Like coach said, always be ready. I was ready at that moment. I just brought
the energy.  
  
Q. Dawn, I know your résumé continues to grow over the years. I know how
frustrating last year was. We heard the celebration in the hallway. What does
it mean for you to get to the championship game?  
COACH STALEY: It means that we're doing the right things. We're doing it the
right way. Sometimes doing it the right way requires you to be a little bit
more patient than we would like.  
It takes time to get to this point. I thought we played extremely well all
season long. We used our depth out there today.  
But it means that our program is continuing to grow. It's a little bit more
popular to come to South Carolina because we can tell people that they'll play
in SEC championships, to win SEC tournament championships, which is something
we want to do. That's what young people want to see. They want to see you
tangibly win. This affords us that opportunity.  
  
Q. Coach, talk about what happened offensively. You shot 31% for most of the
first half, finishing with 80% from the field. Outside of making more shots,
what changed offensively to create opportunities to score?  
COACH STALEY: Well, we picked up our defense. We got some easy buckets created
by the pressure that we put on LSU. You look at Olivia Gaines who spearheaded
that pressure. She got us some steals. She just gave us some much‑needed
energy, a boost of energy that our team needed.  
From that energy, we were able to get some easy buckets. Once we start making
shots, it became contagious. Our low post players started scoring in the
paint. Outside shooting, Tina Roy in particular, started knocking down shots.
When we gain that momentum, it's hard to offset that.  
  
Q. Girls, Tiffany was out of part of the first half because of foul trouble.
Does that throw you off when she's not out there? How do you respond when
she's struggling?  
OLIVIA GAINES: We pick each other up. We have enough to build each other.
Other people just stepping up.  
COACH STALEY: We're not fazed as much by Tiffany Mitchell not having a great
night because of the depth we have on our basketball team.  
Last year I don't think we win this basketball game because our bench wasn't
as I wouldn't say strong, they just didn't get enough playing time.  
This particular year, they've been in situations where they had an impact on
the game. They can draw on those experiences if Tiffany Mitchell had a night
like tonight.  
  
Q. Coach, 47 points in the second half. The SEC Player of the Year only
finishes with four. What does that say about the rest of your team?  
COACH STALEY: Every time we take the floor, I always (indiscernible) key to
winning each and every game is our bench production. I do believe we have the
best bench in the country. We insert that confidence in them because we feel
that way. We truly feel like that. To have our Player of the Year not have the
best night, we were really encouraged about who we were able to bring off the
bench. We called their number, and they answered that number time and time
again.  
Depth plays a really big part of any three‑day tournament. Obviously it paid
big dividends for us tonight.  
  
Q. Tina, the thoughts were there throughout, but you were left shaking your
head after you missed a couple in a row. How did it feel when you started
nailing them?  
TINA ROY: It felt good. But like coach said, if you're a shooter, never stop
shooting.  
The second half my teammates encouraged me to keep shooting the ball, and they
started falling.  
  
Q. Tina, seems like you always hit a couple threes against LSU. Something
about playing your home state team?  
TINA ROY: Well, that could be a reason. I'm from Louisiana, so I like playing
against them. That could be a reason.  
  
Q. Tina, does the team have a nickname for you for what you can do outside?
You're able to fill it up at any moment and get hot?  
TINA ROY: Sniper. Snipers usually don't miss. I miss some, but I guess I make
them when they count, so there you go.  
  
Q. Do you feel like tomorrow's game is for a number one seed in the
tournament? Do you worry about that too much? Do you think you've done enough
to get that?  
COACH STALEY: I have no idea. Obviously if you look at some of the predictors,
maybe some of the predictors think tomorrow is for a number one seed.  
I just need to remind people that we play in the best conference in the
country, the best conference in the country. Both Tennessee and our program,
we've done better than we did last year. We've done better. We both got number
one seeds.  
I'm not saying Tennessee is going to win tomorrow. But if you're looking at
the top teams in this conference, you look at what we were able to do last
year, for us to get in the championship, we did a little bit more than we did
last year, so...  
Hopefully it will be a great championship game no matter who wins out there.  
  
Q. Coach, what was your message at halftime?  
COACH STALEY: Well, I was pretty calm. I think over the course of 40 minutes
we relied on our depth. I told our team we're probably going to shake up the
lineup a little bit and get people out there with a little bit more energy to
start the second half.  
For our team, we've been preaching sacrifice all season long. Here was an
opportunity for three of our starters to come off the bench in the second
half. They were okay with it.  
When you're able to trust your coaches and your teammates to get the job done,
it makes for a great situation. And they delivered. It makes everything look
like it was the right call to make.  
  
Q. I know we don't know the opponent yet, speak a little bit about Kentucky
and Tennessee, what challenges they would present to you.  
COACH STALEY: Kentucky and Tennessee are two of the most storied programs in
our conference. They've had tremendous success.  
I hope they go to quadruple overtime.  
But to play any of those teams is always going to be a challenge. Kentucky
just beat us at their place on Sunday. Tennessee took us to the wire at our
place.  
We're looking forward to it being a competitive championship. Hopefully other
teams play as well as they do. If they shoot like they did in the second half,
I like our chances.  
  
Q. Tina with a lot of minutes at the point, is it Khadijah with her finger
or...  
COACH STALEY: At this point Tina is playing some good basketball. We could go
with the lineup just because it's the lineup or we can take advantage of what
players are doing out there on the floor.  
We prefer to win basketball games. Tina gives us a good offensive option.
She's a big guard that can see over some defenses.  
But it's nothing against what contributions Khadijah gives us.  
  
Q. Dawn, how far would you say Alaina Coates has progressed in the
repertoire of moves you feel she can do and your general assessment of how
she's progressed as a sophomore?  
COACH STALEY: Honestly, I really haven't seen Alaina make the moves that are
in her repertoire. I work with her almost every day. The moves that she's able
to make, the mobility that she has, she is not able to do that in games
because they collapse on her so much.  
But for her to be able to score with two and three people around her
constantly, I'd say she's progressing nicely. Now we have to give her an
opportunity to make some moves while being collapsed on time and time again.  
But for her not to get frustrated, for her to deliver the way she did tonight
I think is only going to be a confidence booster for all of us.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, ladies, thank you very much.

### [Nikki Caldwell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21947)

### [DaShawn Harden](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26528)

### [Raigyne Moncrief](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28352)

  
_NORTH LITTLE ROCK, ARKANSAS_  
  

South Carolina  74  
LSU  54

  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by LSU head coach along with student‑athletes
Raigyne Moncrief and DaShawn Harden.  
COACH CALDWELL: I thought our team played extremely hard. We fought till the
end. Our game plan in the first half was very efficient and disruptive. In the
second half we got away from being that aggressive team with our defensive
play, and South Carolina being one of the best teams in the country took
advantage of that.  
A lot of credit to South Carolina and their team. It was a well‑fought game
for about 30 minutes there. This team, my young team, they've got to learn and
grow from this and understand that you have to play with that same intensity
for 40 minutes.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. DaShawn, you got loose for 17 points in the first half, only one in the
second. What did they do to take away your looks?  
DaSHAWN HARDEN: They just went to like a really tight defense, their best
defenders. They were just really close on me, I guess.  
  
Q. DaShawn, how fun was that first half, given the two earlier blowout
losses? Did you think you could continue it?  
DaSHAWN HARDEN: It was fun. I mean, it wasn't enough. I mean, it's nice not to
get punched first. But it wasn't enough.  
  
Q. Coach, you spoke yesterday about wanting to get off to a good start.
Obviously you had that tonight. Speak to your mindset both before the game and
through the different stages tonight.  
COACH CALDWELL: Well, before the game, you know, we wanted to be one of the
best running teams on the floor. In the first half, I thought our transition
game was really good, as far as pushing tempo. Talked about pushing the ball
halfcourt in three seconds, we were doing that.  
Defensively to defend a very athletic and tall South Carolina team, being
undersized, I thought we battled inside. I thought we really tried to get to
the places first and establish our presence on the low block and on the help
side. We did that for the first half.  
The second half, as the game was moving along, I challenged the team to really
not be afraid to be successful, to really not leave anything out there, and
don't make excuses for the outcome of the game.  
We fell short of our goal.  
  
Q. Coach, considering what happened in the first two meetings, I imagine
limiting them inside was a focus. How hard is that to do against them for 40
minutes?  
COACH CALDWELL: It's difficult. It's a major focus that you have to have when
you are an undersized team. We can't miss our defensive rotations. We can't
miss our assignments because they will make you pay.  
They have Coates who established them in the second half as a go‑to. You keep
the ball high. She does a nice job of doing that. She's the one that really to
me in the second half made a big difference.  
Tina Roy coming into that position as there go‑to player on the perimeter, she
made some threes that opened up that perimeter game for them.  
We wanted to really try to take away the paint. We actually in the second half
gave them both paint and perimeter.  
  
Q. Do you feel like the last couple games and the improvement you showed in
the first half today is enough to maybe help you get over the hump and get in
the NCAA tournament? Do you feel you needed that additional help?  
COACH CALDWELL: Well, every game is helping your résumé, especially in the
SEC. This conference is extremely competitive. It's not easy to get 10 wins in
a regular season, in our conference play.  
I know playing a team like South Carolina who potentially has the rights to be
a number one seed, it exposed our weaknesses. But we also saw all the things
that we did very well, and we should carry that with us going into the NCAA
tournament.  
  
Q. You took Tiffany Mitchell out of the game right from the start. How hard
is it to try to scout South Carolina and everything they have on the bench?  
COACH CALDWELL: You've got to make sure that your intensity and your level of
effort is there for 40 minutes because they can bring waves and waves of
people in, and you can't take a possession off against a team like South
Carolina. They're going to keep fresh legs. They're going to have the size
inside.  
They brought in their shooters. They have a very balanced attack. We didn't
stretch our bench as much as I would like to. But I felt as though the players
that did play, they exhausted everything that they had.  
  
Q. Can you speak to South Carolina as a program, their rise to prominence.  
COACH CALDWELL: Well, Dawn Staley is one of the most competitive people I've
ever played against. We played against each other back in the early '90s. Just
her contribution to women's basketball at every level, she's a superstar.
She's a superstar on the court, as a player, representing our country. She
does a phenomenal job with her team. She has all the right tools to make a
strong run at a championship this year.  
I know that her competitive drive, her team takes on that personality. You can
see it.  
  
Q. After DaShawn kind of went off in the first half, she was limited to 12
minutes in the second half. What was going on there?  
COACH CALDWELL: Well, we wanted to make sure that we established our running
game. You're not going to run the basketball as much when you're not getting
the defensive stops.  
In the first half, that's what we were doing. We were able to alter their
percentage. They were shooting in the 30s. But it's going to be hard to run
when you're allowing a team to shoot almost 80% in a half.  
We're a running team. I thought in the first half we did a nice job of pushing
tempo and finding DaShawn early in our offense. She's one of those players
that can make plays.  
In the second half, we had some looks. We had some opportunities to make some
extra passes. We didn't.  
We tried to be aggressive to the basket. I thought Ballard and Moncrief did
exactly what I asked them to do. Obviously in recent games we've been able to
get those calls and go to the free‑throw line more than what we did in the
second half.  
  
Q. Raigyne, will the disappointment linger for a while and then will you
think ahead to the selection show Monday? Are you concerned about that at all?
Do you feel you'll see your name show up next Monday night?  
RAIGYNE MONCRIEF: Yeah, I would think so. But once again, we just waiting. We
preparing for whatever we have for two weeks. We just going to practice hard,
just wait for the results, see what's going to happen.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, ladies, thank you very much.

_NORTH LITTLE ROCK, ARKANSAS_  
  

Tennessee  75  
Kentucky  64

  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by Tennessee head coach and student‑athletes
Jordan Reynolds and Cierra Burdick.  
COACH WARLICK: It was a fun game for us. They stuck to our scouting report and
what we needed to do. We didn't start off real good, but we stayed focused.  
This group, I keep saying they play so well together, we don't have to rely on
one person. They're truly a team. They're fun to be around. When you win like
this, we heard a lot about beating a team three times, we talked a lot about
that. It's about playing in the moment.  
I think this is what this group does. They play in the moment. We know the two
games that we played earlier, we could have gotten better. We just did some
really good things as a team.  
Excited to move on to the championship game.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Cierra, you had your fingerprints all over this game, playing with a swag
this year. What changed for you particularly with your mental game?  
CIERRA BURDICK: Just trying to be confident. Yesterday I didn't shoot the ball
well. I knew I needed to have a bounce‑back game today.  
I think in previous years and games, if I didn't have a good shooting night,
you know, a previous game, I would let that affect my next game.  
I think I'm just trying to mature on and off the basketball court. I think
that's helped me. My teammates and coaches have done a great job of keeping me
confident, telling me to continue to shoot the ball.  
Obviously with Isabelle going out, that's like a sister to me. It's hard for
me to see a sister go out. I think I'm playing with a chip on my shoulder.  
  
Q. How proud are you of this group to get back to this point and have the
opportunity tomorrow to showcase yourself on a national stage?  
COACH WARLICK: This team understands and respects Isabelle's talent. She's
been our All‑American. But I think you see the talent that we have.  
We've never at Tennessee built a program around one person. We say that in
recruiting. So this instance right here has facts that we don't do that.  
These young ladies, we've got a great group. We've got a lot of All‑Americans.
It's difficult. Cierra didn't play a lot as a freshman. Jordan didn't play a
lot as a freshman until Ariel got hurt.  
They step up, they do what they've always done, they compete. They're very
talented. As Cierra said, Isabelle is still so much a part of our team. We
take really offense to this team is not going anywhere without Isabelle.  
So it's up to these young ladies to fight and scrap and claw. That's what
they're doing. They're competing. That's all we ask them to do, just compete,
play every possession like it's your last possession.  
  
Q. Jordan, it looked like Kentucky more so than any team since you lost
Isabelle really was determined to take Bashaara away inside, take away the
post play. You countered by hitting three ‑pointers. Can you talk about that.
  
JORDAN REYNOLDS: Well, our coaches really harp on playing inside‑out. So when
we get the ball inside, you know, people tend to triple‑, quadruple‑team
Bashaara and Cierra on the inside. When we when we play inside‑out it allows
us to get open shots as we did today, and we knocked them down.  
  
Q. I think the game in Columbia was one of the best games in the nation this
season. Here are the top two teams playing for a championship. Can you reflect
on that game.  
COACH WARLICK: I thought we played hard, we played smart, but we didn't finish
with a box out.  
I just feel South Carolina, it's not the first shot that's going to get you,
it's the second, third and fourth attempt.  
I thought for the most part we took care of the ball there, we just didn't box
out. We attacked. We got good looks.  
I think they understand it. They get it. They watched it. We keep preaching
it. That's the key to us. Don't give 'em transition points, and box out.  
  
Q. Coach, Dawn Staley said this afternoon that she's got the best bench in
the country. Obviously their depth has been a weapon for them this year.
You've gotten some good minutes for your bench the last two games. How
comfortable are you going to your bench tomorrow, particularly with Nia
Moore?  
COACH WARLICK: We're going to have to go to our bench. That game, the flow was
so different, we had five or six people that were really playing well
together. I didn't see an opportunity to Nia in. It wasn't anything she didn't
do. We're going to need her tomorrow.  
I think our bench, we're young. But they contributed tonight. They got great
minutes tonight. They were part of the team. We needed them to play.  
We're going to need them tomorrow, so...  
I think Jaime Nared is playing a lot better. She played well in Columbia, as
well. We're going to need our bench.  
  
Q. Girls, obviously you would like to be in the final against anybody. The
fact that it is South Carolina, have you been wanting to get another chance at
them? Does that make it more exciting or satisfying?  
CIERRA BURDICK: I think anytime you lose to a team, you want another shot at
them, at least if you're a decent competitor. You want to prove yourselves
against them.  
We wanted it. We asked for it. Now we're getting what we asked for.  
We have to prepare tonight, recover, get our rest, then we have to come in for
another war.  
It's going to be a fun basketball game. When we were in Columbia, it was great
basketball. I'm looking forward to tomorrow's matchup.  
  
Q. Cierra, even though you lost that game in South Carolina, did you come
away from it feeling confident about a rematch?  
CIERRA BURDICK: I definitely did. We did some really good things. We just
didn't finish like Coach Holly said. We didn't finish with a box out. That's
important. We learned from it. We'll definitely continue to harp on that,
making sure we limit their second and third chance opportunities, limiting
their transition, limiting their inside game. I think if we do that, we'll be
in business.  
  
Q. You've been involved in almost every SEC tournament. Maybe one stretch in
Nebraska you weren't. Tennessee is going for its 18th. Talk about what it
means for a program that has had so much success in the NCAA tournament
putting emphasis on having success in the SEC?  
COACH WARLICK: I think it started when I was a player. The SEC tournament was
so valuable to us and important. I think Pat always stressed the idea of
winning your conference, winning the tournament. We take a lot of pride in it.  
It's always, always a part of our goal to win an SEC championship. So
instilled in these young ladies. We preach it. We go in and practice and we
see those banners every day. I don't think there's one kid in our program
that's been in our program that hasn't gotten an SEC ring.  
We think it's the best conference in the country. It's the most competitive.
This tournament is so hard. At times it's harder than the NCAA tournament
because you have to play back‑to‑back. It tests how good of shape you're in,
what your mental game is all about. That's why we love it. We want to compete
in it. We take a lot of pride in getting to this game tomorrow.  
  
Q. Coach, Makayla had 31 points last night. You limited her to 10 points
tonight. Talk about the game plan, particularly the defense of Andraya
Carter.  
COACH WARLICK: We knew we were going to do it by committee. We have a lot of
respect for Makayla Epps. Especially watching what she did last night. We
tried to limit her touches. We had different people on her. We switched. We
attacked her.  
We wanted to make sure that she worked for every shot she got. Let's face it,
Kentucky, this is their third game. Their style is playing up and down and
playing hard. They didn't back away from that those three games.  
I think the fatigue factor came into it a little bit. We knew it would. We
wanted to attack them.  
I thought Andraya, she's our defensive stopper. When she plays well and does
the things we need her to do, we're in business.  
I thought Jordan did some good things, as well. She's becoming a really ‑ I
hate to say it in front of her ‑ but she's becoming a good, solid defender as
well. All of us, because we're learning to play angles and keep them in front
of us.  
We don't have to be great at defense, we just got to be solid and good. I
think this team understands that. We've really, really worked at it.  
I think you're seeing the results.  
  
Q. You mentioned the slow start. It was a really slow start at the
beginning.  
COACH WARLICK: Yes.  
  
Q. Looked like a baseball score for a while. You said this team doesn't get
rattled at all. Expand on that a little bit.  
COACH WARLICK: I was worried about our fans really. They stood up for an awful
long time.  
I thought we were getting good looks. I would be kind of nervous about it. I
thought we were getting good looks. The shot didn't go.  
This group has had to learn your offense should not affect your defense. The
beginning of the season, if Cierra or Jordan would have missed two or three
shots, we got our head down, we're in trouble.  
But I think they understand that now defense can come back and get them easy
buckets. I thought we were getting good looks. They just weren't going down
early.  
Bashaara scored our first point on a free throw, so...  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, ladies, thank you very much.  
COACH WARLICK: All right. Thank you.

# [SOUTHEASTERN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=SOUTHEASTERN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 6, 2015

  

### [Vic Schaefer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22176)

### [Victoria Vivians](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28376)

  
_NORTH LITTLE ROCK, ARKANSAS_  
  

Kentucky  76  
Mississippi State  67

  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Mississippi State head coach and
student‑athletes Martha Alwal and Victoria Vivians.  
COACH SCHAEFER: Well, I'm disappointed. I think at about the 14‑minute mark he
called time‑out, had some choice words down there. I thought his group really
responded.  
I thought they played harder, took us out of a lot of stuff offensively.
Started with defense, which is that's where it starts for us, too. I thought
they took us out of a lot of things because of how hard they were playing
defensively.  
Obviously we had a hard time guarding Epps. She probably was (indiscernible)
best out of seven because she's had two really good ballgames against us. It's
a team that has three great guards. They go 17 for 34 with their starting
guards, and one of them went zero for three. Those three are hard to deal
with. We really have a matchup issue with them when you play them obviously.  
You have a lot of respect for O'Niell, Goss and Epps. I hate to put Tori on
somebody that's going to give me too many issues because I don't need her
chasing somebody around.  
At the same time she's a freshman and still learning her way. Martha was five
for five at half time. We got her two touches the second half. That's a key
stat as well.  
You have to give them credit. They're up there pressuring my point guard. We
only had 12 turnovers tonight, y'all. That's about as few turnovers as we've
had in a month. I'm proud of my team, so proud of my fans.  
The Bulldogs traveled tonight. We had so many people in the stands. I'm so
disheartened and disappointed for them. For those of you that don't follow us
or don't know. We have been drawing tremendous rate. 7300 on Sunday and
averaged almost five thousand fans a game in conference.  
So proud of my fans for providing a great atmosphere for us tonight.  
Got to take your hat off to Kentucky and Matthew and his staff. They played
hard. I thought they upped the juice tonight midway through the second half
and we didn't match it.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Victoria, can you tell us what was wrong with your thumb and if you
remember when that happened.  
VICTORIA VIVIANS: I don't know what happened to my thumb. I know my whole nail
came off. It was just blood everywhere, so I had to get off the court. All
right, though.  
  
Q. How big was that stretch when Victoria was on the bench?  
COACH SCHAEFER: We couldn't score. Obviously they were. I think Epps took the
game over during that run.  
What I'm disappointed about there, y'all, we talk about all the time making
them use the screen. We allowed her to get to the rim so much and so often.
She's such a big, physical guard, once she gets down there, she's got such
great body control. She just can finish.  
We didn't hedge on ball screens. We didn't hedge them properly. She's a great
player. She made everything she looked at. Hey, I've seen it before about a
month ago. It wasn't like anything we didn't know was coming.  
It was just a tough stretch where we obviously were having a hard time at both
ends. When we made our run, we were in passing lanes, we were doing what we
do. We were taking the fight to them.  
I'm sure that's what his conversation with them was about when he called
time‑out is we were taking a fight. They flipped it around on us. We were in
passing lanes. Tori got a steal. J.J. got a couple steals. We were getting
transition. We were doing some awfully good things.  
But, again, I felt like those veterans, they got some veteran players, some
great players, they just said, Hey, enough's enough. That's what you want out
of some veteran kids. I thought they did that.  
  
Q. I know you're disappointed right now, but you know you still have a lot
to play for going to the NCAA tournament. Talk about that. Also talk about
Victoria.  
COACH SCHAEFER: Well, I'm certainly thrilled for my players and my staff and
my university for being able to go to the NCAA tournament. To go 26‑5 in year
three. We, in most games, with two freshmen, two sophomores and a senior on
the floor. We're a really young team. I'm going to miss this one right here
whenever that day comes. She's been such a big part of our resurrection.  
The ability for young kids to change, it's hard, it's hard for older people to
change. Martha really has been a part of that. She's changed herself for the
better.  
Again, just thrilled. Again, we're the third seed by ourself in the SEC. I
think that warrants a top four seed. I think we're one of the 16 best teams in
the country. We've been ranked in the top 16 all year long. I know they don't
look at that, but somebody needs to. There's not two groups of idiots out
there. AP poll people and coaches. You got to respect those people that are
voting and realize that we are.  
We navigated the gauntlet in the SEC, gone 11‑5\. We're two free throws from
being 13‑3 in the league instead of 11‑5\.  
I'm telling you, if we could host, I really believe there wouldn't be an empty
seat. I just feel like we sell it out. We had 7300 on Sunday. Our fans are so
infatuated and in love with our players, and rightfully so. Our kids play
their hearts out. We just didn't play as well as Kentucky.  
The ability to be in the NCAA tournament, I'm so happy for Martha. I promised
this when I took the job. She's from Worthington, Minnesota, a long way away
from home. Tough first year. I come in. I'm a little different than what she's
used to. We had some heart to hearts on many a day and many a night. She stuck
it out. I promised her if she would, we'll get to the NCAA tournament. We're
going to get there. It's going to be a great run.  
I'm really happy for my players, obviously, and my staff. I know there's two
parts to that. Did I hit both of them?  
  
Q. Talk about Victoria.  
COACH SCHAEFER: Obviously you're talking about a prolific scorer, just a kid
that can get it done in a lot of different ways. You saw her come out tonight.
I've seen her do that many, many times. It's nothing unusual. She's such a
confident kid for being so young, inexperienced. She's so experienced in the
game of basketball.  
You put the freshman label on her, she doesn't play like one. Her high school
coach, Chad, did a tremendous job with her. She's made so many big shots in
her career, it's just another shot. It's just in a different arena at this
level.  
But she's made so many big shots in her career. You're looking at the all‑time
leading scorer in the history of girl's high school basketball. She's
obviously been somebody we go to a lot. Made the game winner against A&M,
scored 39 the last time we played this team.  
She's meant a lot to us and, again, played well again tonight. Hey, I'm glad
she's on my team and I don't have to figure out a way to guard her.  
  
Q. You played zone a little bit in the first half. Did you think about using
zone a little bit more in the second half?  
COACH SCHAEFER: We tried to play zone. We just weren't very focused and into
it. I mean, I had some senior guards out there kicking it around, not getting
matched up right.  
Really wanted to do that. Left them open. A couple times they made some
wide‑open threes. At this level, you're going to lose the horse game. Kids can
make shots if they're unguarded.  
That in essence is what happened. It happened in the first half, then again in
the second half. Yeah, I wanted to play some zone, but you got to communicate.
This has not been a team that communicates well on the floor. We'll go back in
the locker room, back to the hotel, there will be a ton of communicating going
on. On the floor they've struggled with communicating.  
I tell you, we work on it every day. Three‑on‑two, two‑on‑one, it's all about
communication. It's just been an Achilles all year.  
Here is the other part. That was during the 30‑to‑four run. It's hard getting
back in zone. When you're scoring, you can get back in it when you're not
scoring, it's tough.  
When we played them the first time, down 10 with 10 to go, went back to the
matchup. We were scoring, getting stops, coming back, getting our defense set.
Tonight, for whatever reason, we really lacked the focus, man or zone, we just
really lacked focus defensively I thought. 76 points. Anybody that knows me
knows that ain't my forté.  
  
Q. Victoria, how difficult was it to have the injury when you were kind of
in the zone? How frustrating was that injury when it happened?  
VICTORIA VIVIANS: It was very frustrating. But I can't blame it. I got to play
ball. Just got to come out there and play, play through whatever injury you
have because it's the game, you got to win.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, ladies, thank you very much for joining us.  
COACH SCHAEFER: Thank y'all. Praise the Lord and go Dogs.

_NORTH LITTLE ROCK, ARKANSAS_  
  

Tennessee  75  
Georgia  41

  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Tennessee head coach and student‑athletes
Ariel Massengale and Bashaara Graves.  
COACH WARLICK: Just a great effort by our basketball team. We talked about
just doing everything. This team, we want them to make a statement. We talk a
lot about it. We talk a lot about playing in the moment and playing the game.
We don't look ahead. We don't look behind us.  
They do an unbelievable job of staying focused. They did a great job sticking
to the game plan. Just really, really proud of them and what they did today.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Ariel, do you feel there's a comfort level when you get to this
tournament maybe more so than during the regular season?  
ARIEL MASSENGALE: I think so. We had some freshmen, underclassmen who were a
little nervous today. As upperclassmen, we stepped up from the beginning,
showed them the way, showed them there was nothing to be nervous about.  
Coach Warlick showed us before the game this is why what we've been working
hard for, this is why we train, run on the track, (indiscernible) back on
campus in the summertime to prepare for this moment.  
  
Q. Last year you had three come ‑from‑behind wins. Do you feel like you
almost got tonight off?  
COACH WARLICK: I feel a lot better. Last year, it was tough. But these young
ladies battle.  
Yet tonight, you know, I think we were focused. This team is extremely focused
and we've got great leadership, we really do. I talk a lot about this. Our
seniors have great leadership.  
Bashaara has really stepped up and took up the slack for Isabelle. They police
themselves. When they do that, hold each other accountable, it's fun to be
around. You get to coach. Really that's what I've been doing, that's what we
did tonight.  
You know, Ariel makes calls. I totally trust her what she calls. She's a coach
on the floor. I've been there. She sees things that I can't.  
So just have a lot of confidence in them. They're in. They're all into this
team and the program, so...  
As I said, just proud of how they played tonight.  
  
Q. Girls, early on in the first half you got 11 straight defensive stops.
Speak on how you were able to make a statement with defense, set the tone.  
ARIEL MASSENGALE: Well, it's something we pride ourselves on, something we
worked a lot on this entire year.  
So for me, myself, to do something about that, to be able to make that happen
in the game, it's very comforting. Very rewarding to know that our hard work
is paying off in practice.  
COACH WARLICK: I love that. I'll comment on that. I love that. I didn't
realize that. I'm glad you brought that stat. We have a drill that's called
the persistence drill. It's extremely difficult. We don't get it too often. I
think we've gotten it, I don't know, one or two times all year. It's just
hard.  
Love to hear that.  
  
Q. You struggled a little bit, giving up points in the paint the past few
games. Georgia had 12 tonight. Was that a focal point coming in?  
COACH WARLICK: It was. It was. I think Georgia does a great job of getting
inside. We had three things we really wanted to focus on. That was transition
points. I think they do a great job of getting to the basket, so we wanted to
make sure we took away transition points.  
Not putting them at the free‑throw line. I thought yesterday they went 26
times. That was huge. We didn't want to put them at the free‑throw line.  
We didn't want them to have second‑chance points.  
Those are the things we talk about, that are points in the paint. We've been
giving up a lot of points in the paint because of not rebounding and boxing
out. We spent a lot of time on it this week, talked about it, emphasized it
until they were probably sick of hearing about it. But it paid off. It paid
off.  
Our guards rebounded. We've been preaching about them to rebound, as well. We
did the little things to help us win today.  
  
Q. You came out in that halfcourt trap and it really seemed to rattle
Georgia early. A few quick turnovers. Momentum going right away.  
COACH WARLICK: Yeah, we were going to use it to kind of delay and disrupt. I
thought we did.  
Really I thought we didn't exert a whole lot. I didn't want to keep it going
because I thought we would exert too much energy. But we moved, we talked. We
were in the passing lanes. We did a great job with it.  
It was working. We kept it on. It really separated us because it got us easy
buckets to layups. Anytime you can score off your defense, that's huge for us.  
  
Q. Coach, you said in your opening remarks, you're here to make a statement.
What kind of statement are you wanting to make?  
COACH WARLICK: You know, we hear a lot about we're not the one seed, we're the
two seed. We don't really talk about any seeding.  
When your star player goes down, they just kind of forget about you. These
young ladies are so much a part of this team, and we talk about making
statements.  
I told them, Look, you won an SEC championship just as much as South Carolina
did. We need to go out to continue to do what we need to do to win. Isabelle,
huge loss for us.  
We got some unbelievable talent and unbelievable basketball minds. I just want
to make sure that these young ladies have the opportunity to show their skill,
their love for this team and this program.  
I tell them all the time, I wouldn't trade our team for anybody. Making a
statement means that someone needs to fear to play against you, you play hard,
you're relentless. That's the stuff we want to make sure that we know when we
leave the floor, they say, That is a typical Tennessee team that laid it all
out there. They went after loose balls. They played as hard as a team can
play. May not always win, but we had a tremendous amount of effort.  
  
Q. Ariel, you hit the 500 assist plateau today. Cierra hit the thousand
‑point barrier. Talk about reaching those milestones together.   
ARIEL MASSENGALE: I think it's a great accomplishment for the both of us. You
know, Cierra is the fourth person this year on our team to reach a thousand
points. I think it's the first time it's been done in a while at the
University of Tennessee. Just a credit to our coaching staff and teammates how
hard we worked over these past four years. It's great to have our names in
great company with other players.  
  
Q. How important is Jaime Nared to this team after Isabelle went down?  
COACH WARLICK: She's huge. Jaime, she's so quiet, she doesn't show a lot of
emotion. But she has really come into her own. She does a lot of good things.
She's a great passer. She can shoot the three. She's strong rebounding. She
has a great pull‑up jumper.  
She's extremely quiet but is solid for us. She's had to be. She's had to be. I
think she's becoming more confident in her defensive assignments.  
I love what she's doing right now. Absolutely love it.  
  
Q. Bashaara, Holly talked about you trying to be more of a leader now. Are
you conscious of trying to be more animated, expressive, more vocal?  
BASHAARA GRAVES: I've definitely been trying to be more vocal. I'm used to
really staying in the background, just trying to get things done. Now I know I
need to step up and be a leader.  
COACH WARLICK: She hasn't gone anywhere. I love when Bashaara shows her
emotion. She's our workhorse. She has really taken up the slack. She still
played hard when Isabelle was here.  
She demands the basketball. When you demand the basketball, the guards better
get it to her. She wants the basketball. Tonight I thought she worked so hard.
I mean, she was getting bumped and hit. She acted like it didn't even faze
her. She's pretty tough.  
  
Q. Coach, that was the third meeting with Georgia this season. You could
potentially meet Kentucky for a third time tomorrow. Do you prefer that or
would you rather face a team like Mississippi State?  
COACH WARLICK: You know, it doesn't bother me really to meet a team three
times. It's how you present it. We try to stay in the moment.  
I always think we can play better. The two games we played Kentucky, I always
think we can play better.  
I think they're two similar‑type teams. They're so athletic. They play very
hard. They push the ball. They rely on their defense. I think they're two
similar teams.  
Either way, I mean, I'm excited we get the opportunity to play one of them. I
think they're two similar teams. Maybe preparing for Kentucky may be easier
than preparing for Mississippi State because we played them not too long ago.  
It's going to be a fun game. It's going to be a battle. It will be fun to
watch, especially if we win, it's really fun to watch.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much.  
COACH WARLICK: Thank y'all.

_NORTH LITTLE ROCK, ARKANSAS_  
  

Kentucky  76  
Mississippi State  67

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Kentucky head coach and student‑athletes Bria
Goss and Jennifer O'Neill.  
COACH MITCHELL: It was a great game tonight, a fantastic victory for us. We
had to overcome a lot of adversity in the game. I thought our opponent,
Mississippi State, was very, very tough tonight. I thought they were
well‑prepared. I thought they were really hustling and giving us all sorts of
problems.  
You saw the lead grow to 15 in the second half. But I was real proud of our
team. We got back to our full‑court press, really started pressuring, and it
really changed the game.  
Happy for our kids. We're glad to survive another day at the tournament.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Talk about toughness and how you think this victory epitomizes what you
want from your kids.  
COACH MITCHELL: Well, we asked them to be tough tonight. I thought you saw a
lot of toughness from our team. When we really made the run, we were playing
Gelleah Sidney out of position, Kyvin Goodin‑Rogers out of position. People
were having to dig deep in situations they weren't comfortable in. I think
that's the definition of toughness, when you can find a way to produce and to
succeed when you are outside of your comfort zone. I think that's a great
definition of toughness.  
Our team showed that tonight. We need to continue to show it. We've been
asking them in the last 10 days really to get tougher. They have done a great
job. We've put a lot of responsibility on them, and they've handled it well.  
This has been a good stretch for our team. I think they have shown toughness.  
  
Q. Coach, Makayla, what is with her against Mississippi State?  
COACH MITCHELL: She had two good games against Mississippi State scoring. The
thing I was most proud for her today, I spoke with her this morning, I really
wanted her to be positive tonight no matter what happened. I wanted her to
speak positive things into our team today. I wanted to her to continue to try
to mature as a leader.  
Our seniors have shown a great example of that. I wanted her just to come out
with a great attitude and play the game tonight and don't worry about the stat
sheet.  
Her contribution was significant. I was most proud about the way she handled
herself. If there was ever a time to get negative and down, it was with 15
minutes left in the game and we were down 15. We did not have anything going
at all. We hung in there as a team. I think she was a part of that. Real proud
of that.  
  
Q. Jennifer, you picked up your fourth foul about the 10 ‑minute mark and
you were out for about eight minutes. As a senior, seeing the young girls out
there, what did you think about that stretch?  
JENNIFER O'NEILL: I thought it was great. It was really good to see them play
with that kind of energy and being that intense on defense especially.  
Makayla did a great job of getting in transition, getting to the bucket. Like
Matthew said, when J.J. and Kyvin, phenomenal. The first time they play, J.J.
is picking up the point guard, Kyvin is playing the three. They were out of
position, but they were committed to doing their job.  
  
Q. Coach, it seemed like Makayla was hobbled most of the game, but still
gutting it out. Talk about that aspect of her performance.  
COACH MITCHELL: Yeah, I just really tried to encourage her. I think she can
play through it. Obviously she did. We just keep telling her to stretch it
out. It just tightens up. You'd have to ask her exactly how painful it is. It
just tightens up.  
I think more than anything, it gets in her mind that maybe it's limiting her
mobility. You saw tonight, you know, she was very capable of playing.  
We're just telling her in all those dead‑ball situations to really stretch it
out so she can play. It may look like she's laboring more than she actually
is, but that's just an effort to keep that thing going.  
I don't know how you would say it, but it's a pretty pronounced stretch. All
of you see that going on, and I think she's just trying to make sure she keeps
it where she can have confidence in her game.  
She looked really good tonight. She had some good defensive plays. She was
able to get on the board. She obviously scored a lot. She's doing a nice job.
We as a team need to continue to battle in this tournament, keep working. It's
the reason we worked so hard this year to be in such good shape we can play so
we can be ready.  
  
Q. What was the conversation like when you were down 15? Was there ever a
moment of doubt since you couldn't get anything going?  
COACH MITCHELL: Well, the only thing that you're wondering as a coach is, Will
we finally start playing? I was really upset with Jennifer. I thought Jennifer
had lost focus defensively. I think when a coach can really challenge one of
the best players, one of the leaders on the team, and they accept that, I
think it helps everybody.  
I thought Jennifer really got determined. I thought her determination sparked
the team. I thought Bria was really, really determined. We were able to make a
run.  
Just really proud of some players. Everybody is going to talk about Epps. Epps
had a great game. Jelleah didn't have much on the stat sheet, but what she did
tonight was incredible. Makayla could have scored 38, and if we couldn't get
something going defensively, we would have lost.  
So really just a good team win.  
Once we were able to get the press going, started disrupting Mississippi
State, you could see the momentum shift, and we were off to the races.  
  
Q. They started out so hot, had the momentum going. Did you say anything
special to the kids to try to get that defensive trigger going?  
COACH MITCHELL: I said an awful lot. There's many things that I said, packaged
it different ways. I was trying to get them to play.  
Our post players were very, very unfocused at the beginning of the game. I
thought Azia and Jelleah got off to a poor start defensively. Azia has to stop
letting her offense affect her defense. She missed a couple layups there
early. It deflates her. We have to work on her.  
Jelleah just let Richardson drive the ball. We spent the entire day talking
about what Richardson wanted to do.  
They made some threes there early. They came out with a great start.
Mississippi State is a very good team. I just thought we were a little
unfocused defensively.  
I was very proud. I thought when Vivians went out with her second foul and
Williams went out with her second foul, there was a lineup on the floor for
Mississippi State, I told our kids, This is where we need to make our run. We
really need to make a run here. Got it back to four.  
Mississippi State dominated the first half. I felt pretty good going in only
down four. Then they had that huge run to start the second half.  
We did at about the 15 media time‑out, the kids were saying it, We got to get
up in the press, start fighting. It really changed the energy for our team. A
great job.  
We didn't turn 'em over a bunch, but we really started affecting them.  
  
Q. Y'all have had some heated battles with Tennessee recently. You meet them
for the third time tomorrow. Can you and players both talk about what you're
expecting in that matchup.  
COACH MITCHELL: We expect it to be a real tough game, SEC semifinals. Wouldn't
matter who you're playing. If you play on Saturday in the SEC tournament,
you're playing a really good team.  
We will just take care of our bodies here. We'll go back to the hotel, go
through the same process we went through today and get ready to play a good
game tomorrow.  
We'll focus much more on Kentucky than our opponent.  
  
Q. Linnae Harper, what is her injury?  
COACH MITCHELL: Knee‑to‑knee contact. I don't know which Mississippi State
player, maybe it was one of our players. Hyperextension. She stayed on the
bike. We're optimistic about her return tomorrow.  
She got a couple of plays where she lost focus offensively and got those
charges. There wasn't much there. When you extend your arm even the slightest
bit, it's a pretty simple call for the official.  
Really I thought the foul trouble limited her more than the injury. She's a
tough kid. She'll bounce back. We expect her to be ready tomorrow.  
  
Q. Was there any point during this game where you thought, This isn't our
night?  
BRIA GOSS: Really just bringing the team together, saying, It's not over,
there's a lot of time left. Saying little things like that. Taking it one
possession at a time. Getting to our bench saying, We need your energy, your
effort off the bench.  
When they came in, like they've been saying, J.J. and Kyvin, outstanding
performance. The game is not over till it's over. This game is about runs.
They had their run, we had ours. We ended up winning. We were happy about
that.  
JENNIFER O'NEILL: We were having productive talks in the huddle. It wasn't
people being tired, Okay, good job. It was, We're going to go in here, who you
guarding. We were communicating a lot more effectively.  
COACH MITCHELL: I always thought if we could piece together any defensive
stops, our advantage was in transition offense. I thought the pace was our
pace, 41‑37 at halftime. Mississippi State played really hard. I just felt
like at the end of the day we still would be successful with the faster‑paced
game, kind of proved to be right.  
We just needed to get our defense shored up, and we finally did. They started
missing some shots. We were in transition. That's when it really got going for
us.  
What I just told the team, I'm really proud of our team, they worked hard in a
short period of time. But we told them before, Listen, Saturday is a workday
in the SEC tournament for Kentucky and you need to do your work tomorrow night
6:30 against whoever you're playing or we're going back to Lexington.  
I'm just so rooted right now in helping this team be their best. Again, I
wasn't really thinking about, Oh, gosh, this isn't our night. I just knew we
could play better basketball than we were playing. We eventually did. I was
proud of the team for doing that.  
  
Q. Did you call the press you went to black?  
COACH MITCHELL: It's our black press.  
  
Q. They went 10 minutes without a field goal, only 12 turnovers. How
disruptive you were trying to be on defense, is that what you wanted?  
COACH MITCHELL: I thought they stopped taking the shots they wanted to take
and they started taking the shots we dictated to them. They did that for a
large majority of the game.  
There was a time in the 13‑2 run we weren't being very tough. They had a
really good stretch. I thought they started taking some shots. Then again I
thought they missed some shots close in. Maybe the pace affected them. When
the momentum shifts, it's tough, too.  
Combination of all those things, I guess.  
  
Q. Can you talk about playing Tennessee for a third time this season, being
back in the semifinal.  
BRIA GOSS: It's our next game, so it's the most important game on our
schedule. Like coach said, we're going to go in tomorrow with a focused
mindset, just really wanting to go out there and start the game off well, do
the little things right, encourage each other, staying positive, having a
positive attitude, all those good things we're used to.  
It's a big game, but it's another game. Tennessee is a great team, but so are
we. It's going to be a great competition.  
JENNIFER O'NEILL: I'm excited. I think it's a great rivalry we have with them.
I'm a competitor. I like to compete. I know the whole team is like that. So
we're looking forward to seeing Tennessee in the next round.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, ladies, thank you very much.  
COACH MITCHELL: Thank you.

_NORTH LITTLE ROCK, ARKANSAS_  
  

Tennessee  75  
Georgia - 41

  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Georgia head coach and student‑athletes Tiaria
Griffin and Erika Ford.  
COACH LANDERS: It's pretty simple, it's short and sweet: we didn't compete,
they kicked our tail. End of story.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.  
  
Q. Andy, you played Tennessee a tight game in Athens. What was the
difference in this one?  
COACH LANDERS: We didn't compete. We came out in a fog, in a daze, didn't
compete. Turn it over a couple times, didn't get the offensive rebound. Did
all the bad things in the first three or four minutes of the game. In the
first three or four minutes of the game we did all the bad things you don't
want to do. They've already gotten it down off of a turnover and laid it up.  
Rather than it upsetting us, I saw no positive reaction to that. I mean, the
things that happened were foreseeable if you do not address those things
before they happen. You don't box out, you're going to give up offensive
rebounds. Same person didn't box out the same person three times in a row on
the same frigging possession. Unbelievable.  
  
Q. Coach, with regard to the rebounding differential?  
COACH LANDERS: That's hustle. That's hustle. That's hustle. That's hustle.
That's us missing a lot of shots. Early in the game, that's us putting up a
lot of outside shots, missing 'em. I just told our team, there was once
tonight when the ball hit the rim, I looked up, we had three people running
back on defense. It wasn't because we were excited about playing defense. You
could tell we weren't too excited about playing defense. We just didn't want
to go rebound.  
  
Q. When the run started in the first half, did you feel a letdown within the
entire team?  
TIARIA GRIFFIN: I don't think we came out ready to play from the start. A lot
of us just wasn't on the same page.  
  
Q. Erika, was there anything in particular that contributed to a lack of
effort from the players' point of view?  
ERIKA FORD: I don't think so. I think it's just what we've been saying. No one
came ready to play. No one had any energy. Our faces were dead. In the
time‑out, you could definitely tell it was just draining.  
  
Q. In a tournament setting like this, playing in back ‑to‑back days, could
that have something to do with it?  
COACH LANDERS: Sure, it could. It could have been soft good, not being focused
good, not caring enough good, not being together enough good. It could be a
lot of things. All of them should be on the table.  
I'm sorry, if you were asking them, I'd like to hear their answer. I jumped in
there and answered the question. I didn't know if it was for me or them.  
  
Q. Andy, do you feel like now you've done enough to get in?  
COACH LANDERS: No, no, no.  
  
Q. Andy, was this a case of Tennessee playing really great defense?  
COACH LANDERS: No, no, no. Same two teams that played those other games. Both
those games, as I recall, last four or five minutes of the game, two, three
points of each other. Same two teams.  
I don't think they played any better tonight than they did before. I think
defensively we were awful. They shot 60% the second half. 47 to 23 on the
boards. We fouled 17 times. You know why you foul? You foul because you're out
of position, so...  
They subbed. I mean, she was nice the last seven, eight minutes of the game.
She was nice. She felt sorry for us.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, ladies, thank you.  
COACH LANDERS: Thank you.

_NORTH LITTLE ROCK, ARKANSAS_  
  

South Carolina  58  
Arkansas  36

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by South Carolina head coach and student‑athletes
Elem Ibiam and Alaina Coates.  
Questions.  
  
Q. School record 15 blocks for you. What was working for you on offense?
Keying on Jackson or trying to pack the lane?  
COACH STALEY: I thought we did a really good job. We just made some
adjustments from the first time we played them. Just tried to give Jackson
different looks. I thought it disrupted what they were trying to do.  
But I thought it was a tremendous team effort on both sides of the ball. I
like our defense. I like the fact that we only gave up 36 points. I like we
only allowed them to shoot 19% from the floor. When your defense is working
that way, it really puts you in a position to win basketball games no matter
what you do on the offensive end.  
  
Q. For either player, can you describe the confidence you gain from a game
like this.  
ELEM IBIAM: I think it's always just a good thing when we come into the SEC
tournament and get our first win. It's a good feeling for the whole team to
have that first win under our belt.  
The coaches told us what they expected last night. It was an emphasis for us
tonight. We talked about it last night. We just came here and got it done
today.  
  
Q. How confident were you after that first game in terms of what you could
do with all the blocked shots today? Did you feel you could put that advantage
to what you ended up doing today?  
ELEM IBIAM: Well, yeah. Like I said, our coaches always tell us what they
expect from us. We talked about getting back to the basics. We blocked a lot
of shots at the beginning of the year. We faded away from that, being more
cautious in the paint, staying out of foul trouble.  
That helped us tonight, helping our guards a little bit. It worked to our
advantage.  
  
Q. So many shots were being rejected, what's it like being part of game like
that?  
ALAINA COATES: I personally have never been part of a game that involved so
many blocks. But it really gives you a lot of energy. We're just knocking even
back into the stands.  
It's a real energizing feeling.  
  
Q. Dawn, do you feel this squad is at a comfort level where they can win no
matter what the style of game is?  
COACH STALEY: Yes, I'm comfortable with saying that depending on what style.
We've seen it. We've seen it in our league. We've seen it in the
non‑conference schedule that we've had.  
I think the biggest thing, our offense has fluctuated at different times
depending on what the style of play is. I thought Arkansas tried to take the
air out of the ball and run their sets a little bit longer and wait for us to
be undisciplined defensively. It took a couple of possessions that we usually
have away from us.  
I just thought it ignited our defense. It made our defense focus in on each
possession. If it took 30 seconds, it took 30 seconds. But we had very few
letdowns. We were able to see different styles like this. It helps you going
into games knowing that whatever it is out there on the floor, we're able to
get it done.  
  
Q. Coach, Coach Dykes made a pitch for his team to be in the NCAA
tournament. Do you think they're an NCAA tournament team?  
COACH STALEY: Now, that is probably out of my pay grade.  
But I like to politic for anybody that's close in our league because we play
against each other all the time. I know what this league is all about.
Arkansas has played well enough I think to get into the tournament with the
amount of wins they got just in our league. They got a few other wins outside
of our league.  
But I can speak highly on what we do to each other night in and night out in
the SEC.  
  
Q. Coach, what did you want to see from your team in the five days since the
Kentucky loss, and how did they respond to that?  
COACH STALEY: What I wanted to see was I wanted them to be mad, I wanted them
to be angry like I was. That wasn't a team that I've seen in years. So when
you have that kind of performance, that kind of lack of effort, you want them
to feel that.  
At this stage of the game, you don't really have a lot of do‑overs. You have
to get it done. You have to bring it every single day. We had two days off,
then we practiced the last two days. We saw the energy. We saw the focus. We
saw the togetherness, paying attention to details to get it done. They
executed today.  
  
Q. Dawn, that being said, it got to seven. Are you satisfied with how they
answered, made it a game again, took control again?  
COACH STALEY: Arkansas is a team that's not going to go away, like any other
team in this league. You always going to have a fight on your hands.  
But I think when teams go on runs like that, I feel real confident in our team
to be able to get a good shot. Whether we make it or not, I don't know, but we
can get a good shot. I know we did get some good shots, especially when they
went on the run and cut the lead.  
Yes, I'm really proud of how we responded. I'm proud of the players that came
off the bench, opened up the game a little bit more. When you have that kind
of depth to be able to change the outcome of a game, it's something that I'm
glad that took place today.  
  
Q. Elem, what was it like being around coach these past few days when she
described how mad she was from what happened Sunday? How did that help you get
ready?  
ELEM IBIAM: I've been here so I'm kind of like used to when she gets angry.
Not too many jokes, but joke just a little bit to pull her out of it.  
It was something we needed. I think it got our team back on focus knowing what
she expected us, how angry she expected us to be so we had to reevaluate
ourselves. If we weren't angry, we had to ask ourselves why.  
Made us go back to the drawing board, watch the film. We got with our buddies,
we have a buddy system. We talked about what we could have done better. When
we came to practice, we were more focused and ready to come to the tournament.  
  
Q. Elem, people always say that making shots can be contagious. Is blocking
like that?  
ELEM IBIAM: Definitely, I think so. When we see that one of us is getting a
lot of blocked shots, we're like, Okay, we can go for it. We can be a little
bit more aggressive.  
I definitely think it's contagious. It's fun. We want to at least go for it.  
  
Q. Alaina, you seemed to get it back together, started putting those inside
buckets when the team needed it. Is that the kind of situation where you start
demanding the ball?  
ALAINA COATES: One of the main things is a confidence thing. When you're
missing, you can get frustrated.  
At the end of the day I know my team is going to need for me to make shots. I
know if I'm in a position where I need to be scoring, I'm going to do what I
have to do in order to do that, just making sure I don't let my frustrations
take over.  
  
Q. Coach, Gillmore looked like she limped off. Was that an ankle?  
COACH STALEY: Mitchell?  
  
Q. Mitchell.  
COACH STALEY: Mitchell is good to go. I think she took a shot on the left side
of the court in the second half. I think her foot got stuck on the court. But
she's fine.  
  
Q. Coach, do you prefer entering the tournament as a top seed and being the
hunted?  
COACH STALEY: I prefer us being SEC regular‑season champions, yes. But we
played in the driver's seat all season long. It's not anything different from
what we've been used to.  
For us, it doesn't matter because all of that being the regular‑season
champions, it goes out the window. We have teams here that's trying to win an
SEC tournament championship. They don't care if you're number one, number
three, the top seed. They're trying to win.  
We approach it the same way.  
  
Q. Coach, is remaining angry the mentality you want your team to keep
knowing you haven't won that SEC championship yet or made it to Sunday?  
COACH STALEY: I don't know if it's anger. It's focus, it's expectation. My
expectations are really high for our team. When they don't live up to that,
yes, I think it's a cause for the alarm to go off.  
We have a really good basketball team. They have to understand that. They have
to live up to being a really good basketball team.  
As their coach, I have to force them to, even when they want to take days off.
For me, I'm just going to continue to coach. I don't coach any differently
after being here for seven years, having this team for as long as we have. I
don't coach any differently.  
Basketball has a certain look, it has a certain sound, and it has a certain
feel. When those things aren't in order, it's our jobs to make sure they get
in order.  
  
Q. Do you remember playing in a game with your teammates where you had 15
blocks?  
COACH STALEY: I don't remember being a part of a team that recorded 15 blocks.
I looked at the stat sheet, I think we had eight or nine in the first half.
That was the first thing that jumped off the stat sheet.  
I know a lot of times we get on the officials. But kudos to the officials
tonight for allowing us to do such a thing.  
  
Q. Coach, describe what the rest of the day is going to be like for you. Do
you have a preference of opponent tomorrow, either A &M or LSU?  
COACH STALEY: We'll watch the game, then we'll go back and we'll prep for the
winner. At this stage it doesn't matter what our opponents look like. It's
about our approach. It's about playing South Carolina basketball. Whatever
team shows up at 4:00 tomorrow, we'll be prepped to play.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_NORTH LITTLE ROCK, ARKANSAS_  
  

LSU  71  
Texas A&M  65

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Texas A&M head coach and student‑athletes
Courtney Walker and Courtney Williams.  
COACH BLAIR: When you get down 22‑4, that's like being down in football 28‑0\.  
But I loved the fight, how we came back, not just in the second half, but how
we came back in the first half to cut it to 13 and had numerous other
opportunities.  
That's all on us about being able to handle the thing. But when they open up
and hit as many shots as they hit here and hit Sunday at Baton Rouge, that's
good offense and that's not very good defense.  
LSU has turned into a very good ballclub late in the year, and a lot of it's
Ballard because there's not a guard in our league that goes to the boards as
well as she does. She just wills her way in there. Give her a lot of credit
about how she goes. She had a lot of sidekicks.  
When we had a chance at the end of the game, it was the loose balls, they got
every one of them down under their basket and every offensive board after our
defense was forcing them to miss. That's on us. Give praise to them for how
well they got all the loose balls.  
Our kids fought. But it's like going into a horse race or a track meet. You're
running long and you're 40 yards behind, you finally catch up to them, they
look over in your eye and say, Is that the best you got? Then they take off a
little bit more because they got a little bit more left in their tank.  
I thought it was a very good college basketball game. Both teams handled the
ball a lot better. They had one turnover at half. I thought that was the
difference.  
We could not force a turnover either with our press or halfcourt defense. When
you get behind 24‑4, you cannot think that you're going to make every shot.
You have got to be able to force turnovers and get into transition like we did
in the second half and be able to score.  
Most of that transition was off of long rebounds. We were doing a good job
getting it off to Williams, Walker or Knox. We were shooting layups. That's
what it's going to take.  
Love the effort. First time in 10 years we haven't been in a semifinal. I'm
really disappointed on that. But if I had to lose to someone, LSU's our rival,
and they've outplayed us twice now in six days.  
But we're getting better. We're going to put things in place. We'll be on the
practice floor Monday afternoon.  
Open it for questions.  
  
Q. You cut it down to three with a minute and a half left. What was the call
there at the end?  
COACH BLAIR: Sometimes you don't need threes as much as you need baskets,
okay? I'm trying to remember the play exactly. I knew Walker had one over in
the left corner, but Curtyce just handed her the ball instead of penetrating,
giving the defense a little bit of a chance to take her, then you get the
penetration. Arkansas did a great job of that, penetrate, kickback.  
We would pass around and sometimes you had to shoot a contested shot.  
The shot, I think I'm with you, the drive she took, not the three. She passed
up the three, didn't feel confident. The drive was not a good shot at all. She
should have passed out to somebody on the backside. She didn't have a good
look.  
But give the kid credit. For what she's had to go through in this last week,
she's having to put on her big‑girl shoes. She's growing and getting better.  
Like it is, when you look at her stats, three for seven, two for three, four
for four, two rebounds, two assists, three turnovers. Most people would enjoy
that. She's a scoring point guard. I've got to get her to take more of the
leadership role as we're going on because right now Williams is having to take
the leadership role almost exclusively during the ballgame. We need it to be a
joint effort.  
Curtyce is going to get there. Her stats look good. There's more to
basketball, particularly at the point guard position, than stats.  
  
Q. You said yesterday that you were happy your team didn't get the double
bye because you wanted another game of experience. After the sluggish start
today, do you still feel the same way?  
COACH BLAIR: We're going to have a heck of a game Monday afternoon with our
men's practice team. We're going to keep going back. I got two kids that are
sitting out this year. I've got a good men's basketball team.  
We're going to keep playing, not just drilling, okay? I play a lot of kids. I
play a lot these two, 38 minutes, whatever it takes to get them to play.  
We need to play to get better. We will scrimmage hard against the men's
practice team. That will get you ready for the elite teams that you have to
see in the NCAA tournament.  
  
Q. Courtney Williams, talk a little bit about what the team has been now
through the last week and a half, two weeks. Do you feel like you're now
really starting to understand how you need to play without Jordan?  
COURTNEY WILLIAMS: Yeah, I think we understand how we need to play without
Jordan. Especially in the second half of the LSU game, we cut down the lead to
about three points. We see what we need to do to beat any team we play in the
future. We need to get stops. We need to really rebound 'cause LSU has some
good rebounding guards.  
Me, Courtney Walker, Chelsea, Curtyce, we need to get in there and battle with
the post players, rebound.  
Offense, we need to take our time, read the defense. Jordan, she ran the
offense when she was playing. Other than that, we need to make a combined
effort and have a leadership role, like Coach Blair said.  
  
Q. Coach, you mentioned yesterday about the crowd turnout here in Little
Rock. What did you think about that today?  
COACH BLAIR: I thought it was good. What I think they ought to do is have a
consolation game for Arkansas and ourselves. Just kidding (laughter).  
I thought this weather, the atmosphere, 4800, pretty good. Give credit to the
people who promoted the tournament.  
People need to realize you're fixing to see two more good games tonight, and
you're going to see two great semifinals on Saturday. People need to come out
and support women's basketball, not just University of Arkansas, okay? Come
out and support women's basketball at the highest level.  
Give Arkansas credit for getting to the second round, playing with nine
players, basically seven the majority of the year. Give Jimmy a lot of credit
for what he's done with his team. He's created an atmosphere, again, that
people want to come out and see the University of Arkansas play.  
Love the crowd. Love the atmosphere in the game. If we would have pulled this
one off, we'd have been talking about it for a long time.  
Our job now is to get better as a basketball team, okay? Get better. We can
still go a long way. We lost by three to Baylor. We lost three straight times
to them. 2011 we get hot in the tournament, a lot of different people stepping
up. Why not again?  
That's what I'll be trying to get these kids, their teammates, to believe in.
We'll just keep working.  
  
Q. Courtney Walker, seemed like Jordan kind of called you together right
there coming out of the half, held you in a huddle. Can you share anything she
said?  
COURTNEY WALKER: She just wanted to get our energy up. We can call X's and
O's, anything we need to do, as long as we don't put our energy into it,
there's nothing that can be done to fix that.  
The way we started, we had made a good little run going into the half, then
lost it again. Second half, we just wanted to bring more energy than they did,
be able to play harder.  
Once we started doing that, we were able to make a run with some good
execution. Jada came in and did a good job for us. That's how we were able to
come back in the game.  
  
Q. Coach, where do you see your team being on the line?  
COACH BLAIR: Six. Usually I got all 64 teams right last year. I'll be pretty
close again. When I was at Arkansas, I was always the bubble team. We haven't
been the bubble team at Texas A&M. We've earned our way in. This will be our
lowest seed we've had in the last 10 years. But that's where we deserve to be.
We'll play our way out.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much.  
COACH BLAIR: Thank y'all.

_NORTH LITTLE ROCK, ARKANSAS_  
  

South Carolina  58  
Arkansas  36

  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Arkansas head coach and student‑athletes
Jessica Jackson and Calli Berna.  
COACH DYKES: First off, we didn't come here to play the game today. We weren't
just happy being in the quarterfinals. We came here to win.  
I thought our effort and our fight and everything we did as a team poured
ourself into that process from the time we met last night at dinner till the
time of the opening tip. Couldn't ask any more of our team.  
We had a difficult time scoring obviously. Shot 19% in the game, only scored
36 points. I still feel like we play like an NCAA tournament team.  
It's only the third time all year that South Carolina has been held to below
60 points, and we held them to 58. The other times it's happened has been
against ranked opponents. Defensively we're about as good as anybody in the
country. Nothing has changed since yesterday. We won 17 games against a
strength of schedule was eight. It will probably drop now after playing South
Carolina. We did everything the Selection Committee tells you over the years
you're supposed to do. We scheduled very aggressively in the non‑conference.
We had six wins in non‑conference play away from Bud Walton Arena on the road
or neutral floors. That ties for second in the nation from the power five
conferences. Our résumé is really, really strong.  
They tell us all the time they don't even consider where you finish in your
conference standings. We played in the eight‑nine game. We have six wins, now
seven wins in the SEC. Our wins against Oklahoma, Iowa, at Middle Tennessee,
on down the board, looks to me like an NCAA tournament résumé. I hope the
Selection Committee rewards us.  
I say that because I know our players deserve to be in the tournament. They
have poured themselves into a process over the last six months with only nine
of them. You can't ask any more as a coaching staff than what we've asked out
of them, how tight they've been, how tough they've been, together they've
been. They never look for an excuse. The most resilient group of
student‑athletes I've ever been around.  
They were dialed in at 8:30 this morning trying to take down South Carolina. I
know in my heart they deserve to be in the tournament. I hope that holds true
for us.  
South Carolina obviously is as good as anybody in the country. I told Dawn
afterwards, I hope you win the whole thing. I think they have as good a chance
as anybody in the country to do it. They have size, kids that knock down shots
when they need them, they defend their tails off.  
They were better than us today. When we had 38‑31, the building was alive. I
know that. So I felt good about our effort.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
JESSICA JACKSON: I think defensively they did what they were supposed to do,
just played good defense.  
  
Q. Calli, I know they had 11 blocks against you. What was it like playing
against that size inside?  
CALLI BERNA: It's not a question when you look out on the court, you see they
had a definite size advantage. We knew that going into it.  
Our goal was to try to get in the paint, get some kick‑outs. Once you get in
there, you don't see them coming.  
They have a very good inside game. I know they do that to just about everybody
they played. One thing I can say for my team, we didn't back down, we kept
driving it.  
Unfortunately it didn't fall for us so much today, but we didn't back down.  
  
Q. Coach, you mentioned that sequence where you got it within seven, the
crowd was getting loud. What did you think you needed to do to get over that
hump? Just a matter of making shots?  
COACH DYKES: Yeah, I mean, when you shoot 19%, that was a big part of it.  
We tried to shorten the length of the game today. The more possessions in this
game, it's going to favor the size and the depth and the talent and the
All‑Americans that South Carolina has on the floor.  
We were trying to shorten the length of the game today by running motion,
running our 'pig' action we call it. We didn't want to shoot quick, early in
the shot clock. It's difficult. It's very hard. They had 15 blocks. I mean, 15
blocks in the game, that's hard to overcome. We only got to the free‑throw
line 15 times.  
We had to play today to beat South Carolina, we were going to have to play our
best game. At moments we had really good stretches, but we just weren't quite
powerful enough, strong enough to finish it off.  
  
Q. What are these next few days going to be like?  
COACH DYKES: If I'm not mistaken, it's going to be a week from Monday. It's
going to be long. I'm going to go recruiting as soon as I can get out of here,
keep building this program. That's what I came here to do. That's what we're
going to do. I can tell you that much.  
So for our players, we're going to take three or four days off, then we're
going to work out next week. We expect to be in post‑season play. I know we
will be. I'm sure hoping it's the NCAA tournament.  
It will be an anxious Selection Monday for us. We're right on the edge. One of
the last four teams in as of yesterday. It's amazing to me how accurate they
are in those early projections.  
  
Q. Jessica, like coach said, you're playing for a spot in the NCAA
tournament. How do you feel the way you competed in these two games in the
tournament and how confident do you feel about your chances?  
JESSICA JACKSON: I think we've competed pretty good as a team this whole
season. I think we deserve to be in the NCAA tournament, as well, so...  
  
Q. Coach talked about your defense. What did you think was the biggest key
defensively?  
CALLI BERNA: We know that defense is what's going to win you games. When
you're not hitting, when we're shooting 19%, you know you have to close in on
them. Our goal was to pack it in, make them hit outside shots. We did our
best. They're obviously some tall girls. That was our goal, to make them kick
the ball out.  
  
Q. Coach, obviously you feel like you should be in. Sitting here right now,
do you think you are?  
COACH DYKES: I think if it was Selection Friday, we'd be one of the last three
teams in. I think we deserve that. We won 17 games against a strength of
schedule that's number eight as of this morning. We just played arguably one
of the top two teams in the country. We had 31‑38 in the second half. We held
that team for the only the third time or fourth time all year below 60 points.  
We're built to win games on a neutral floor. If that Selection Committee is
watching, what kind of team could have success in this tournament? They look
at Arkansas, they say they're the kind of team that can have it. We have the
same schedule next year, because you have to do that to get ready for this
league.  
Those wins are quality wins. Oklahoma is in second place in the Big 12. Iowa
was in second place the last time I check in the Big Ten. Middle Tennessee was
leading their league or one game behind in their league. Tulsa, good wins. We
won on the road in the SEC, LSU, beat Georgia when they were ranked, took down
Ole Miss yesterday.  
If we're not in, I know this, there will be teams that get in I think that
don't have the résumé that we do. I trust them. I've been through the
selection process before, when I was at ESPN, the mock selection process.
They're very dialed in, very dialed in. I know they want the best teams there
in terms of the at‑large teams.  
I trust them. Our athletic director Jeff Long was in charge of the College
Football Playoff Selection Committee. Those people, they take it very serious.
They know what's at stake. They want to reward the teams and student‑athletes
that belong to be there. It does matter to me because it matters to them. I
want them to be in there.  
But if they put in the teams that deserve to be in there based upon the
criteria they have always said over the years, what I went through in the mock
Selection Committee, we deserve to be in the tournament.  
  
Q. How many teams do you think will get in from the SEC if Arkansas is one
of those teams?  
COACH DYKES: I know what tradition has said. For the most part, there's
between six and eight teams every year out of this league that get in. The
Selection Committee doesn't look at that at all. They don't factor in there's
eight teams from this league, take another one from that league.  
Your résumé stands on its own from everybody else. I'll say it again. Our
résumé is stronger than some teams in this league that are still under
consideration. Dawn Staley told me the same thing, You deserve to be in, I
hope it falls your way on selection night.  
I can't give you a number. All I can think about is our team. I'm pretty sure
South Carolina, Tennessee, A&M, Kentucky, pretty sure about those guys. A
couple of them have a chance to win the whole thing. I hope they do if we
don't.  
I was very, very proud again, pleased with our crowd today. In central
Arkansas, for a noon start, had our tip time been at 6:00 at night, no telling
how many Hog fans would have been here. Razorback fans are the best fan base
in the country. We've got a lot of great things going for us. Mike Anderson's
team is getting to go on a roll in the NCAA tournament. That's a very good
men's team.  
One of the great things that happened to us last night, Bret Bielema called
us, called the Hogs. We're a close‑knit family, and I'm honored to be a part
of that family.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, ladies, thank you for joining us.  
COACH DYKES: Thank you.

## March 6, 2015

  

### [Danielle Ballard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26925)

### [Nikki Caldwell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21947)

### [Raigyne Moncrief](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28352)

  
_NORTH LITTLE ROCK, ARKANSAS_  
  

LSU  71  
Texas A&M  65

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by LSU head coach and student‑athletes Raigyne
Moncrief and Danielle Ballard.  
COACH CALDWELL: Very proud of our team for fighting for 40 minutes. Texas A&M
is a very explosive team. They're seasoned. They have great leadership in
Coach Blair. They have unbelievable players.  
I was proud of our group for staying the course and sticking to our game plan.
We were able to make the plays down the stretch that we needed to solidify the
win.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Coach, you started out hot. What went into that? How were you able to
attack early?  
COACH CALDWELL: Well, in the first half we were shooting the ball extremely
well. We were shooting 52% from the field. In the second half we struggled a
little bit. But we wanted to make an attempt at the basket so we talked about
really penetrating, getting in the seam so we could get ourselves to the
free‑throw line.  
We knew Courtney Walker and Courtney Williams, those guys were going to try to
take over. They did just that. Offensively they got on the glass, got a lot of
second and third opportunities. I felt as though that really changed the
momentum and rhythm of the game in their favor.  
  
Q. Danielle, what about your mentality allows you to go in there and battle
with these taller players?  
DANIELLE BALLARD: I just know when my teammates shoot it, it's a 50/50 chance
it's going to go in. I try to crash the boards as many times as I can because
I'm capable of getting rebounds. That's one thing I'm good at is getting
rebounds, so that's what I do.  
  
Q. Coach, talk about the matchup tomorrow with South Carolina, where you
think you have an advantage.  
COACH CALDWELL: With South Carolina, they're a very deep team. Their first
five, you've got to be aware at all times where Mitchell is. Ibiam has played
very well. Welch gives them a lot of energy.  
Our team defense has got to be there. It's got to be done by committee. All
five people have got to be able to defend the basketball. All five of our
players have to be committed to rebounding the basketball. Once you get
through the first wave, here come the 'Twin Towers'.  
Defensively we're going to have to extend our defense, try to disrupt them
away from the basket because they are so good in the paint.  
Offense we've got two very explosive guards here with Danielle and Rai. They
do a nice job of just slicing through people's defense. Their ability to make
jump shots, we're going to have to have that. To make the extra pass, we're
going to have to be that team. When we demand a double‑team, find your
teammates. But it's going to be equally as important for our team, Anne
Pedersen, to knock down shots, Sheila Boykin, DaShawn Harden, the supporting
cast has to be on top of their game as well.  
  
Q. Danielle, do you recall the rebound when you pulled the ball away from
Jada? Talk about that play. Do you recall being able to make that play, what
you saw there?  
DANIELLE BALLARD: Well, I saw her about to go up for the shot. I tried my best
to try to take it from her because coach was staying to stay physical till the
end of the game.  
I tried my best to get the ball from her. She's a very strong post player.
Luckily I came up with it.  
  
Q. Coach, you lost three out of four before winning these last two against A
&M. What has been the difference?  
COACH CALDWELL: The difference is we've gotten off to better starts. Our two
losses on the road to Ole Miss and to Arkansas, we were in the hole 9‑2,
11‑2\. It's a 40‑minute basketball game. We have to give ourselves a shot at
the very beginning of the game.  
We've moved Raigyne Moncrief to tip for us. She's done a good job of getting
the tip the last couple of games. That's led to baskets.  
We're a team, again, that's finding our way and understanding it's a 40‑minute
game, not a 30‑minute game. Today we put together a 40‑minute basketball game.  
  
Q. Coach, you've seen a lot of really talented rebounders from the guard
spot. Can you put what Danielle is able to do when she's able to crash the
boards, the aspect that brings to her game.  
COACH CALDWELL: Danielle, when we moved her, she's playing in the back of our
zone, we feel very confident that she's going to come up with the rebound. She
has a toughness about her. She's physical. But more importantly, she's
confident in knowing that she can go up against anybody.  
Her ability to hone in and follow the basketball, that's something that you
can't teach. That's something that you've learned at an early age and you just
have worked at it and you become very good at it.  
When you look at guard play across the country, I don't know of any guard
that's rebounding the basketball like Ballard. I know that at the beginning of
the year Raigyne Moncrief took on that responsibility for us, as well. She,
too, is capable of bringing six, seven boards from that guard spot, too.  
  
Q. Seems like every time Texas A &M started to make a run, you made a big
play to stop the momentum. How did you maintain composure during those
times?  
COACH CALDWELL: Our composure is through practice. We've talked about how
we've got to be better in late‑game situations. Down the last four minutes of
the game, we want the ball in Ballard's and Moncrief's hands because they are
just great play‑makers. They finished out the game for us. They've shown they
can do that time and time again in our conference.  
Again, a lot of credit to A&M. We were ahead and they did not quit. They kept
fighting and fighting. The momentum was going their way, but we made a charge
of our own and were able to finish out the game through our defensive pressure
and we also made free throws down the stretch.  
  
Q. Raigyne, you were in and out of the game a lot because of foul trouble.
How were you able to not get frustrated and still help your team?  
RAIGYNE MONCRIEF: My players, my teammates, the ones that were on the bench,
they were keeping me in the game, Stay with it, your time is going to come.
Coach Tasha also telling me. It's basically my team, the family aspect.
Everybody was telling me to stay with it.  
Then Coach Niki trusted me to put me back in the game and things started
happening for me.  
  
Q. Coach, a win like this, you're up to 17 wins now after winning 10 in
conference. You don't want to just stop here with a big game tomorrow, but you
have to feel pretty confident at this point of a bid?  
COACH CALDWELL: Texas A&M is one of the best teams in the country. We have
been able to put a body of work together in the last 10 games which has shown
our competitive nature.  
These young ladies have worked extremely hard. We have a lot of basketball
left in us. We do not want to cut our season short.  
Obviously we have another big task ahead of us tomorrow in South Carolina. But
that's the beauty about being in the SEC, is that when you're competing, it
feels like an NCAA tournament. That game today felt like an NCAA tournament
game. Two teams going at it with great players.  
Williams and Walker are two of the best players in the country. I have two of
the best kids in the country, as well, with Moncrief and Ballard.  
That's what you want to see. That's exciting to see players excel at this high
level and be able to compete on a national stage.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
COACH CALDWELL: I told these guys, we win, you have ice cream and cake. You
lose, you don't. I tried to make them understand if mommy is happy, we're all
going to be happy.  
  
Q. South Carolina had 15 blocks this afternoon. Does that change your game
plan at all or are y'all going to attack the paint?  
COACH CALDWELL: The one thing about South Carolina is their size is very‑‑ I
don't know of anybody bigger than them. We want to be smart and attack at the
rim at the right time with great spacing, but be aware you need to make the
extra pass.  
We're going to have the ball in Ballard's and Moncrief's hands quite a bit.
They're explosive off the bounce. But when they bring that second defender, be
play‑makers out of that. Or you have to go to your jump shot immediately.  
We definitely want to be aggressive because that's a strength of ours.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, ladies, thank you very much.  
COACH CALDWELL: Thank you.

## March 5, 2015

  

### [Terri Williams-
Flournoy](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20559)

  
_NORTH LITTLE ROCK, ARKANSAS_  
  

Texas A&M  57  
Auburn  47

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Auburn head coach along with student‑athletes
Katie Frerking and Tra'Cee Tanner.  
COACH WILLIAMS‑FLOURNOY: It was a tough game for our ladies, but I thought we
continued to fight through. We've always had tough games with Texas A&M,
they've usually beat us pretty bad. For us to have a 10‑point basketball game,
for our ladies to continue to fight, that says a lot about our team.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Coach, you had the run to cut it back to four at halftime, then Texas A
&M put the game back to double figures. What changed the second half?  
COACH WILLIAMS‑FLOURNOY: I thought Courtney Williams, number one, hit some
really big shots. I really thought she took the game over in the second half.
She's a very good player. I really thought she stepped it up in the second
half and hit some really big shots for them.  
  
Q. Coach, how proud are you of this team that they kept fighting towards the
end?  
COACH WILLIAMS‑FLOURNOY: I'm very proud of this team. I just told them that.
I've told anyone that have asked that same question.  
It was tough. The losing streak was tough. They could have easily just said,
Forget it, the season is over with, we're done. They decided to turn it around
themselves. They decided to turn around and work a little bit harder, and
that's what made that turn.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much.

### [Robin Pingeton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21391)

### [Morgan Stock](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28326)

  
_NORTH LITTLE ROCK, ARKANSAS_  
  

Georgia  75  
Missouri  64

  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Missouri head coach and student‑athletes
Sierra Michaelis and Morgan Stock.  
COACH PINGETON: I'm just really proud of our team. We just had a crazy year
with so many challenges. We weathered the storm. It's always tough, last game
is always a tough one. Wouldn't trade my girls for the world. Love them to
death.  
We've continued to grow throughout the course of this year. Tonight, give
Georgia credit, I felt like they were the aggressors. We had a hard time
keeping them off the boards. I thought we did a better job taking care of the
ball. The difference to me came down to the rebounding. We just had a hard
time eliminating those second‑shot opportunities.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Jordan has been big for you all year. Georgia limited her to five points
tonight.  
COACH PINGETON: She only played 22 minutes. It's tough to get a lot done. I
just never felt like she really got into a flow.  
Thought they did a good job of double‑teaming. I think just even making it
hard for her to cut. They would beat her to the spot, take her off her path a
little bit. I thought she had some tough calls. Never had a good rhythm.  
When she got her fourth, we had a player at the score table to rotate in for
her. She picked up that last one before we had a chance to get her out. I
thought that was critical for us.  
She's one of our best rebounders. I think she definitely could have helped us
on the boards there those last seven and a half minutes.  
  
Q. You mentioned Juanita was there at the table for Jordan. Why not
immediately after the fourth foul have her subbed out?  
COACH PINGETON: Yeah, I thought about it. Just felt like, you know, we were‑‑
I liked where we're at. Jordan has been in that position before. You hope you
see growth in your players in regards to just being able to play with fouls.  
Honestly, I thought they were tough calls. Those are going to happen,
absolutely. But I felt comfortable with her out there. I felt confident with
her. But once she got that fourth, we knew we needed to make that rotation. We
just couldn't make that substitution quick enough.  
  
Q. Girls, after you fell behind, you made charge after charge, could never
get over the hump. Was it an energy thing?  
MORGAN STOCK: I mean, I think our energy was there. I think we needed to stick
together and we did. I think there were some things that didn't fall in place
that we needed them to.  
But overall I think we did a good job sticking together and trying to pick
each other up whenever those kind of things happened.  
  
Q. Coach, career night for Sierra. Talk about her performance.  
COACH PINGETON: Sierra is a great player. I mean, the ceiling is so high for
her. But really, you know, as of the last, gosh, handful of games, five, six,
seven games she's been playing well.  
Going into tonight's game, she was shooting 77% from the three‑point line, 50%
from the field, close to a double‑double. She's been really playing well as of
late. I think she's playing with a lot of confidence, which is great. She's
only a sophomore.  
Think about how bright the future is for us. But not surprised. She's got a
great feel for the game, understanding of the game. She's deceiving on the
court. She has the ability to score in a variety of ways.  
Defensively she may not have the same athleticism as some kids out there, but
she's got quick hands. She anticipates well. Glad to have her back for a
couple more years, there's no doubt.  
  
Q. Sierra, what were you feeling the last five minutes without Jordan and
without Lindsey?  
SIERRA MICHAELIS: Last five minutes it was mostly guards. I was thinking
drive, kick, if not I have a drive.  
Kind of hard not having a post player in there with their bigs, from a boxing
standpoint. Our 2‑1‑2 is really effective against Georgia.  
  
Q. You guys have had a lot of injuries already this year. When you lose your
leading scorer to fouls, Lindsey to injury, do you think you have enough out
there to make one last charge?  
COACH PINGETON: It definitely hurts us. Jordan is such a huge part of what we
do. I think Lindsey brings a lot of intangibles to the table with her grit,
passion, how hard she plays.  
With that being said, I did think we still had enough on the court. I think
we're a possession away from taking the lead. Then we had that turnover on the
out‑of‑bounds play. I think we're down one at that point. Then there's another
possession down four, had a chance to cut it to one, missed a three.  
So, yeah, I felt really good about the kids that were on the court. I think
the biggest challenge was our ability to eliminate the second‑shot
opportunities. But that was for the full 40 minutes. I didn't think we got off
to a great start. Then we kind of regrouped, made a run there towards the end
of the first half.  
Coming out of the gates in the second half, I didn't think we were on point.
Had a couple looks, we didn't finish. Then we made some runs.  
For the most part, it's always going to be a game of runs, but we had some
opportunities, and key possessions weren't able to capitalize on.  
  
Q. Morgan, you made a back ‑cut layup for a three‑point play. What were you
feeling at that point during that run?   
MORGAN STOCK: Specifically I was thinking, Great pass, because it was a
perfect pass. I was really excited. I just wanted to keep pressing forward.  
I know my teammates were feeling the same way, so...  
  
Q. Coach, have you had a chance to check on Lindsey just yet?  
COACH PINGETON: She was in the locker room. She has an awfully big egg on her
head. She hit pretty hard. I have no idea if it's concussion or not. She took
a pretty good blow. But she has all feeling and movement, so she'll be okay.  
One of the toughest kids I know.  
  
Q. Morgan, you had a look at three. Sierra passed it to you on the wing. Did
you feel good about that shot?  
MORGAN STOCK: I did. Every one of my shots I think 'in'. If it goes out, it's
going to be a long rebound kind of thing. But, yes, most of the shots I shoot,
it's a yes shot, so...  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.

# [SOUTHEASTERN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=SOUTHEASTERN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 5, 2015

  

### [Tiaria Griffin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24869)

### [Andy Landers](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13868)

  
_NORTH LITTLE ROCK, ARKANSAS_  
  

Georgia  75  
Missouri  64

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Georgia head coach and student‑athletes Tiaria
Griffin and Krista Donald.  
COACH LANDERS: I think it was the type of game that our players, that we
expected it would be. Missouri is very, very good at what they do. What they
do is extremely difficult to defend.  
That said, I thought defensively we were pretty good everywhere with the
exception maybe of containment. To Missouri's credit, to Robin's credit, she
elected to go with five guards and drive it, which made it very difficult.
Consequently, we had to downsize our lineup and try to defend them.  
But I was extremely pleased with the effort, with the patience, with the
discipline on offense. When things weren't going well, we stayed the course.
We stayed, for the most part, disciplined.  
Our players in the second half, by and large, made a lot of plays. They didn't
run a lot of plays, they made a lot of plays, which I found through the years
you have to do that at tournament time in order to be successful.  
So thought they were terrific. Thought these two sitting beside me were
excellent. Their numbers I think indicate how good they were. Overall just a
really good team effort.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Girls, after you went up 11, they made quite a few charges. You got
within two. What allowed you to keep your composure and not let them take your
lead?  
TIARIA GRIFFIN: I think staying the course. We all came together and we all
knew what we had to do to just stick it out, keep our composure, make plays
when we have to.  
  
Q. There was a point late in the game in the last three minutes, one of the
times when they pulled within two, they had a three ‑pointer go up. You called
a time‑out right after that. What did you have to say? What did you do
mentally to turn it around?   
COACH LANDERS: Well, I remember the play you're talking about. The person
guarding the ball on that shot was Mackenzie Engram.  
A couple times as the game got into the later stages, the shooters would
extend their range. That's what happened on that shot. It was as if we didn't
know they were going to do that.  
We knew a couple of those kids have really crazy range. For us not to be
defending hands up, to allow them to shoot while we basically have assumed a
position of defense, they're just shooting, that's not the way we're going to
finish the game.  
Then the other piece was just be patient on offense, make them guard us. Let's
not quick‑shoot the basketball. When we get it back, let's make them guard us,
get a good shot or get fouled.  
We started talking about that at halftime and probably should have repeated it
more during the second half.  
  
Q. Tiaria, speaking of the second half, you came alive. What were you doing
differently? What looks were they showing you?  
TIARIA GRIFFIN: They was pretty much standing on me on the three‑point line. I
was looking to get the ball in the paint a little and try to shoot a jump
shot.  
  
Q. Coach, a lot of coaches don't really work on free ‑throw shooting in
practice. In a way, your being cool on knocking them down on the free‑throw
line made a difference in the game.   
COACH LANDERS: We try to shoot free throws every day. Some days we have
challenges of trying to hit eight in a row or ten in a row, buddy systems
total in a row.  
I think the thing that happened, that's been happening to us, in my view you
have to go back, to appreciate today, go back about three weeks. We've been
playing three weeks without our starting three, our starting four and our
starting five. Today you saw how much we missed Kris because her presence was
incredible today.  
Merritt has been out for three weeks with mono. We didn't complain about any
of this when we were going through it. I didn't mention it with the players.  
What you have now is a team whose younger players have improved. Haley,
Mackenzie, they're like starters for us. They're in better condition than Kris
and Merritt. I'm going to continue to start them because of that. These kids
have been hurt and been on the shelf.  
But what happened during that period, those kids grew up. They had to grow up.
We've been out of one game. Even with Tennessee, Kentucky, everybody we played
in the last four minutes, we managed to lose them all, but not anymore. I
think that's what you saw today. The younger kids have grown up. Veterans
understand what needs to be done.  
Now when you put us all together, put us back together, give me these two
healthy ones back, give me Merritt, wow, we're better than we were before Kris
sprained her ankle, before Merritt caught mono.  
There's a confidence there, to answer your question about free throws. I think
there's a confidence that we know who we are now. We reinvented ourselves. It
took a while. We were painful. But we're pretty good.  
  
Q. The NCAA Selection Committee says they don't pay attention to the score
differential. It does seem to me it means something you're in the game with
Kentucky and Tennessee. Do you think they ought to pay more attention to
that?  
COACH LANDERS: That's up to them. It doesn't matter what I think.
Three‑fourths of the people read whatever you write don't care what I think.
That committee, I'm not going to have any influence on them.  
We know going in you have to do what you have to do. Right now we know we need
to win basketball games to get in the tournament. We're comfortable with that.
This is the bed that we made for ourselves.  
It's time to go to work. It's time to get it figured out.  
  
Q. Coach, what did you think you had to do entering this tournament to get
the attention of the committee and have a résumé at the end they're going to
look at? Have you spent a lot of time thinking about that?  
COACH LANDERS: No, I haven't. I can tell you how much we've talked about it,
none. All we've talked about is winning the next game because we know if we
win the next game, we're in good shape.  
We're not going to get two ahead, three ahead. Win the next game. Hey, if we
don't beat Missouri, we're cooked, we're crock‑pot cooked.  
Now, we got us another good one to play. Win it. Just take care of that
business. That's all that matters. Maybe somebody somewhere along the way will
have to stop and go, Whoa, we got to put these guys back on the table.  
  
Q. You have Tennessee next, the third time this season. What are you going
to do to get a different outcome?  
COACH LANDERS: I think we take care of the ball a little bit better. I think
we've learned to do that. I know it's hard for anybody out there to believe
because we just played Tennessee three games ago. We're going to take care of
the ball. We're going to do a better job of taking care of the ball.  
I truly feel like we've learned that lesson. I think having two point guards
now who have the experience, I have options and I have choices.  
At Florida I pulled Haley and put in Marjorie and finished the game with her.
Tonight I pulled Marjorie and put Haley in. I thought she was terrific the
first half. As things started to unfold a little bit, I put Marjorie back in.  
We're going to do a better job of the things that we had control of in all of
those games that we lost control of and hurt us. That's what we're going to do
better.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, ladies, thank you very much.

_NORTH LITTLE ROCK, ARKANSAS_  
  

Kentucky  67  
Vanderbilt  61

  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Kentucky head coach and student‑athletes
Jennifer O'Neill and Bria Goss.  
COACH MITCHELL: Very tough game tonight. Vanderbilt was an extremely tough
opponent to play against. I thought their players played with a lot of
determination and made it a difficult game.  
I was very, very proud of our players. Went through some adversity in the
game. Sometimes when you get off to a hot start, it all kind of unravels on
you, you don't get it back.  
But our players steadied themselves at halftime and came back with a great
second half. We're very proud to be moving forward in the tournament.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.  
  
Q. Obviously your band and cheerleaders weren't able to make it here. The
Ole' Miss band filled in. How did that happen? And for the players, does that
help when you have that from them?  
COACH MITCHELL: The SEC, Leslie and her staff arranged that. The people at Ole
Miss were good enough to participate. We were very, very grateful and
appreciative. Those young folks in the band showed up with a lot of enthusiasm
for our team. That's really, really admirable, commendable. We're appreciative
of the SEC even thinking about that, then the Ole Miss band participating.  
We appreciate it.  
BRIA GOSS: From a player standpoint, we're just so grateful they came out.
One, they didn't have to. Two, they didn't have to with as much energy as they
came out with.  
That really helped. Going over there and touching there hand at the end of the
game, I felt that wasn't enough from our part. I was really, really happy they
had the opportunity to do that for us with so much enthusiasm, like coach
said.  
COACH MITCHELL: I'm a Mississippi State grad. It's hard for me to compliment
Ole Miss. But I do tonight.  
  
Q. Jennifer, you had 19 points tonight. Do you have a preference coming off
the bench or starting?  
JENNIFER O'NEILL: My preference is probably just to perform either way. I just
want to be productive for my team and help them.  
  
Q. When you grabbed that 14 ‑point lead early, you scored 16 straight, do
you feel like you let off the gas or...   
BRIA GOSS: I think we lost our defensive intensity because we weren't scoring
on the offensive end. We had to refocus and regroup at halftime.  
Vandy stepped up and got the momentum, really got going.  
  
Q. Rematch with Mississippi State, double overtime game in the regular
season, what do you remember from that game and what do you expect going
forward tomorrow?  
COACH MITCHELL: Well, we really were clicking in the first half, built a
sizable lead. I remember we lost focus there at halftime. The first five
minutes of the second half was really dominated by Mississippi State. Went
back to an 11‑point lead, then they came back again.  
We played some really good basketball against them in stretches, and they
played some really good basketball against us in stretches.  
I want our team to come out with a real determined spirit and I want them to
come out with a great mental focus on what Kentucky needs to do to win.  
When you get to a tournament, at least the way we feel about it, you have to
focus on yourself. It can't be a whole lot about your opponent. You have to do
the things necessary for you to be successful.  
We'll work real hard just trying to get our team mentally prepared to go out
and play a great game against a very tough opponent.  
  
Q. Jennifer, you guys are coming off a win against South Carolina on Sunday.
You win tonight. Talk about the stretch of play lately for you guys.  
JENNIFER O'NEILL: The key for us has been intensity. That's something that
he's been preaching to us in practice and during shoot‑arounds.  
He wrote three words on the board which were focus, responsibility and
execute. That's what really got us through the South Carolina game and that's
something we have to carry over in this tournament.  
  
Q. Coach, in this kind of tournament environment where you don't have a day
off, you don't necessarily know who your opponent is going to be, talk about
how you get your team ready to go.  
COACH MITCHELL: Well, we benefited I think tonight from some uneven play out
of our younger players, which led them to not have to play a lot of minutes.
Our two mentally toughest people, who it won't matter how many minutes they'll
play, they'll be ready to go, are sitting beside me here. They know what needs
to happen.  
So we won't have anything other than talking about what it takes for us to be
successful in this tournament. We'll just mentally prepare. We'll ask for
tremendous focus and we'll ask for them to understand what they need to do.
That's the responsibility part of what they really need to do tomorrow night
to win, then go out and execute it.  
We've had some tough players through the years in this tournament and we've
been able to win a bunch of games. I think these two want it really, really
badly. I think they'll help us get our minds right for a good game tomorrow.  
But right now I just think these tournaments are mental, mental toughness. Are
you tough enough to hang in there and make no excuses and win games or do you
bail out and make an excuse and say that you're tired. That's not going to get
you anywhere in this tournament.  
We'll go back and make sure our players understand we'll win this one with our
minds because it will be our minds that tells our bodies what to do.  
  
Q. Jennifer, what changed for you in the second half?  
JENNIFER O'NEILL: I was more aggressive. I told my team, I apologized, I was
settling for jump shots instead of attacking the baskets or getting fouled or
getting other people involved.  
That was really it, just changed my mindset.  
  
Q. Could the players address the play and help you got from Harper off the
bench.  
BRIA GOSS: She did a great job. She was hot at the beginning of the game,
really got us going. Got us an early lead.  
Her intensity off the bench really gave us a spark. We're going to need that
from her tomorrow and every day going forward. Not just this tournament, but
looking on the future, she has that capability. That's what we need next year
from her, as well.  
  
Q. Coach, what is the game plan to slow down Victoria Vivians and Martha
Alwal from Mississippi State?  
COACH MITCHELL: You just have to play really good team defense. Victoria needs
to play out of her comfort zone. You can't let her get in a rhythm. I thought
we let her get her feet set on a lot of threes in Lexington. We didn't play
very good team defense behind our own ball defender. She's a hard cover, a
great player, a tough player.  
Martha is a senior and tough and long and athletic, a real presence in the
lane. We'll just have to battle. Our team has to fight, claw, scratch, just
really battle and have a blue‑collar mentality against any of our opponents in
this tournament. That's what we'll need to do against Mississippi State
tomorrow. We have to play harder than they play. That's the goal.  
  
Q. What did you feel was the biggest difference between Jennifer between the
first and second half?  
COACH MITCHELL: The first thing, the charge, Vanderbilt wanted to keep
playing. I told the team that today. They've had a lot of success. They did
not want their season to end tonight. They were really fighting for their
tournament lives.  
They had made some plays on us down the stretch. We needed one stop
desperately. We needed just one stop. Whoever was guarding that player was
pressuring and wasn't giving her an open spot. I think it was Dahlman. We
talked about how she puts her head down and plays basketball.  
Jen made a clutch play, concentrated, veteran, did her job. Huge play in the
game.  
Sometimes her desire to win manifests in trying really hard but maybe shot
selection's not great. That's the only thing that I would ever coach her on.
Just let it come to you. Let's make sure we attack first. Especially when
you're in a drought, when you're not making jump shots, somebody has to get in
the lane, get their feet in the paint, make a shot.  
She really did a good job in the second half and I thought had a much better
mindset, and it led to better shots and better play.  
I tell you the biggest thing for Jennifer right now is she is affecting the
game defensively. When we're good, she really, really turns up the defense and
does a great job. Bria is always there, always a rock defensively. Jennifer
has become that, too, for us in this time of success for our team. That's what
we'll need from her more than anything tomorrow, just a real focus. These two
need to play real tough defense tomorrow, and they will.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, ladies, thank you very much.

_NORTH LITTLE ROCK, ARKANSAS_  
  

Arkansas  72  
Ole Miss  61

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Ole Miss head coach, along with players Tia
Faleru and Gracie Frizzell.  
Coach, if you could give us an opening statement.  
COACH INSELL: I'm just real proud of our basketball team. We've had a great
year. We didn't have it to start the second half for about eight minutes
there. We didn't have a lot of pop. That's why I was having to call timeouts
to try to get our pop right.  
For where we were at to start the year, what a lot of people thought about us,
to finish tied for seventh in the league, to do the things we've done this
year, it's been a good year for Ole Miss. It's been a really good year for Ole
Miss women's basketball. We are proud Rebels up here. We're not happy we lost.
We win with class and we lose with class at Ole Miss.  
I'm real proud of my basketball team. When the game was over, we talked in the
locker room we're going to the NIT to win it.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Could you speak to the challenges involved in rebuilding a basketball
team with the tradition that Ole Miss has. Where do you think you are on the
trajectory?  
COACH INSELL: I thought it would take four years. Really, when I took over,
where we were at, nobody in this room, nor did I playing in this league, knew
what this kid's name was two years ago, Tia Faleru. Now she's a two‑time
all‑conference player, one of the best players to wear the uniform at Ole
Miss. Real proud of her.  
Our seniors bought in. I feel like we're way ahead of schedule. I thought it
would take four years to get our depth right. We still struggle with depth
with our bench, not because our kids on the bench aren't any good. I don't
want that to get misconstrued. We have a lot of freshmen. We've had to sub
with young kids. The future is bright for us.  
We're way ahead of schedule. We have three really good players signed for next
year. We signed one of the top three or four classes in the SEC. We have a kid
transferring to us from Rutgers, real exciting to get her in there. We're
going to add a couple more pieces.  
It's real tough when you take over a program at the bottom of this league
because this league is not forgiving night in and night out. We took over a
program that finished last in the SEC for several years in a row. To get to
the post‑season in year two, to have a winning record, to have a chance to get
20 wins, now we're going to the NIT, there's a lot of great things going on in
our program that I'm excited about.  
I feel like we're on pace to get to where we want to get to faster than I
thought we could get there. It's a credit to our administration. Ole Miss is
committed to women's basketball. A lot of places it's not like that. Our
attendance is growing.  
There's so many great things going on. It all starts with how great our
players are, the buy‑in effect our players have. You have to have that. I act
like a maniac on the back sidelines sometimes, but I tell them they can't do
anything wrong in my eyes, and they don't.  
We'll get better from this. We'll grow from this. We'll take a couple days
off. In terms of our process, in terms of where we're going with our program,
if you had a vote, you voted us 14th in the league. We were unanimous. We
laughed at you guys then and we still laughing now. And the coaches voted us
14th. We still laugh at them, too.  
  
Q. Girls, you started off pretty good offensively. What changed? Did they do
anything offensively or defensively? Did you fall out of rhythm?  
TIA FALERU: I feel like, yeah, we had Danielle in foul trouble, A'Queen, our
two key players there. The energy kind of went down.  
I feel like we beat ourselves the first half. We didn't come out and play Ole
Miss basketball. When we play Ole Miss basketball, we have energy. At the
start of the game, you see we played very well.  
I feel that hurt us a little bit.  
  
Q. What has this week been like for you returning back to Little Rock?  
GRACIE FRIZZELL: I think it was good. I wish we would have won, obviously.
Coming home, but it's still an away game.  
My family is really my team, so...  
Being home in Little Rock is good because my family and friends get to come
out and support the Rebs, but I wish we would have won.  
  
Q. Matt, what happened during the year that allowed you to jump from that
projected last ‑place finish to seventh and turn some heads?  
COACH INSELL: The buy‑in effect from our players. It's fun to play at Ole
Miss, but it's also tough on these ladies. We knew we had a lot of work we had
to do.  
It didn't just happen when the SEC play started. It was a process day one back
in May when they reported to summer school. They bought into everything we're
doing.  
I hear coaches say all the time, they started playing my style of play. Our
players grew up. They continued to grow as individuals, as people on and off
the court. I'm just so proud of them. All credit goes to our players.  
I told them before the season started, We're going to make the post‑season.
Everybody is going to say, What did you do to get to the post‑season? I didn't
do anything. These guys did that. They made that commitment. Their teammates
made the commitment. When you get a team that makes commitments like that, you
have a great season. I'm real proud of them.  
  
Q. Coach, your dad is kind of a legendary women's college basketball coach.
How much have you leaned on him as you've taken over at Ole Miss?  
COACH INSELL: I've leaned on him a lot. I talked to him this morning. I didn't
know if this game was at 12:00 or when it was going to be. Our girls were up
early. Dad, what do I do if they push this game back to 2:00? Do I have them
eat breakfast?  
One thing he always taught me, whatever you do, go 100% at it. If you're
players will buy into it, then something special will happen.  
That's what's happened with us. I'm just real proud of 'em. When we win, we're
real happy. We win with class. When we lose, we lose with class. That's
another thing he's taught me, too, so...  
  
Q. Coach, I was reading that a lot of the roads in northern Mississippi were
closed yesterday and last night. How did y'all get up here?  
COACH INSELL: We had a lot of rain. It was raining real hard. We left out
Tuesday morning. We knew the weather was coming in so we got on up here
Tuesday, brought the girls over here last night so they could see the
tournament.  
We got a lot of young players that never played in the SEC tournament. I
wanted them to get the environment.  
Our fans had trouble getting here. As I told you, our attendance is growing. I
probably had 50, 60 different people call me this morning, Coach, we can't be
there. Text messages on our phone, Sorry, I can't make it. Our athletic
director couldn't even get over here. Luckily, our senior administrator,
Lynnette Johnson, came with us. But our AD, he was flying over, he couldn't
get out. So we had a lot of bad weather hit us.  
I hate our fans weren't able to see us. But they watched at home and they're
proud of this basketball team.  
  
Q. Coach, what was the biggest difference between this game today and when
you played Arkansas at the start of January?  
COACH INSELL: They made more free throws than we shot. We're a team that
drives to the basket every single possession. I have to go back and watch on
film to see how that happened. It's kind of amazing to me. I guess we wasn't
very physical. What do y'all think? We'll have to look at that on tape.  
Free throws were a huge difference in the game, a huge difference in the game.
It's just the way it goes sometimes.  
There was no difference. Arkansas is the same thing they were a month, two
months ago. They haven't changed. We changed a lot. We got beat. Everything
they did to us this time they did to us last time. We didn't get to the paint
the way we needed to or the line. We only went to the line 17 times. That
hurts us.  
We'll have to go back and look at the tape. We'll look at it and learn from it
because we're still playing. Last year at this time we weren't playing
anymore, so there was nothing to learn. This time there's something to learn.  
  
Q. What has the rebuilding process been like in the sense there is a post
‑season, an NIT to look forward to?   
GRACIE FRIZZELL: It's been tough. We started in May, June, of last year. We're
hungry for practice every day. We come to practice ready to work. I think
coach does a really good job of helping us buy into it.  
TIA FALERU: I feel like the staff, bringing in a whole new staff, strength and
conditioning coach as well, long summers. Toughest summer since I've been
here, and I'm a senior.  
Been through ups and downs, so I know exactly what it's like to lose and what
it's like to win. This year it's a little bittersweet. I'm a little down. Like
coach said, we got more ball ahead of us. I feel like this is not the last
time you're going to hear from Ole Miss.  
Even though I'm going to be gone, I feel like we're going to make a run at
NIT. As long as Tia Faleru is on the team, you're going to hear from Ole Miss.  
COACH INSELL: We'll take another year or two from her. She's got so much more
she can get better at. As I tell WNBA coaches that blow my phone up every day,
she's going to be a great pro.  
Gracie, being from Little Rock, I'm glad she's an Ole Miss Rebel. She's as
good as there is. We have to get more Little Rock girls over to Ole Miss. I
think that's going to happen, too.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, ladies, thank you very much.

_NORTH LITTLE ROCK, ARKANSAS_  
  

Texas A&M  57  
Auburn  47

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Texas A&M head coach and student‑athletes
Courtney Walker and Courtney Williams.  
COACH BLAIR: This is one of the reasons we needed to play today, instead of
having a double bye, because I had to get my point guard some experience. I
thought knocks came in and handled herself a lot better than what she did in
the second half against Missouri and the game against LSU.  
We cut our turnovers down. Right before half, we decided to let them back in
the ballgame with a lot of poor decisions, some of it by me, some of it by
these two. We let them back in the ballgame.  
In the second half we only turned it over five times. That's good for us. I
thought we had a very good, quick offense attack after we broke the press.  
We didn't want to set up because they were still going to continue their traps
in the corner. What they want to do is make you ad‑lib on offense, and they
just want you to be able to create.  
I think we've got kids that can create off the bounce, particularly with the
Williams kid. She can create, get it to the middle of the lane.  
We didn't shoot as well. She attacked, got to the free‑throw line. Hopefully
tomorrow we'll be better at knocking down free throws.  
I thought that was good, but sometimes you've got to be able to run a
halfcourt offense, as well, depending on what the defense is going to do.  
Give Auburn a whole lot of credit. You win four straight after losing 13
straight, I cannot think of anybody that's ever done that in a long, long
time. So give Terri a lot of credit. Tanner played well in the second half.
Montgomery, she's just a great catch‑and‑shoot person that can also put it on
the floor.  
Give them credit. They're ready to start next year. We're ready to keep this
year going.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Coach, could you address the challenges involved in trying to basically
run your offense, especially in the halfcourt sets, with your starting point
guard sidelined?  
COACH BLAIR: Well, if you were in football and you lost your quarterback,
you'd have to play the wildcat, okay? But we do not have to do that.  
We've got a very capable backup in Curtyce Knox, who was highly recruited just
like Jordan. She redshirted a year because of the depth we had at the point.
She's gotten better and better.  
A lot of times she can dominate a practice. But what she has to do at this
level is be able to dominate with leadership and make the right pass, the
simple, completed pass.  
She's getting better. I was able to take her out in the first half and rotate
her when we had a comfortable lead. All of a sudden that lead vanished, and I
had to put her back in.  
Curtyce is going to get better and better. She would start for a lot of other
ball clubs in this league. But she wanted to be an Aggie knowing that the
person we had at the point guard position back then was unbelievable. We owe
her a lot for holding up that commitment because sometimes injuries happen.  
  
Q. Coach, the play of your bench stepped up tonight. Give us your thoughts
on that.  
COACH BLAIR: I thought Jennings, Scott and Mitchell were all very good.  
Jennings, man, she's 007 or something. The kid ain't afraid to take a shot.
Sometimes she has to give it up and get an assist, because she had Williams
wide open in the first half for a layup, she shot a jumper she's been making.
You put her over in the left corner, the scouting report on her, you better
guard her. She'll kill you over in that left corner. That's hers. She owns it.
She feels good about it.  
Scott, she has had an up‑and‑down year for a senior due to her mother's
situation and everything like that, all the procedures that her mom has had to
go through. It's been tough. She's been going back and forth.  
Jennings has been able to step in, where usually those are all Tori's minutes.
Right now it's Jennings. Tori came in, did a couple nice things for us.  
Rachel, you saw the good. If you been with me all year, it's a Clint Eastwood
movie, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly sometimes. You saw the good. She was the
only one effective on Tanner down there in the second half because of her size
and she was doing a good job of getting her body over there.  
Everybody else, when Tanner would get the ball, we were trying to come over
and double her, make them have to pass out. Thank heavens they missed a couple
threes. A couple times we missed the double that we should have been down on
there.  
Mitchell, she's a fine kid because I never know what's coming. Tomorrow she
might dunk one, okay? But she might miss the backboard on the next one. But
she loves the game and we love our Rachel.  
  
Q. Coach, Auburn cut the lead to 3 points in the second half, then you
pulled away. What was the key there?  
COACH BLAIR: Not turning the ball over and taking good percentage shots early
in the second half. But give them credit, they made a couple good runs and
pretty good shots down there theirselves.  
I thought our halfcourt defense was outstanding the whole night, okay? I'm not
sure what the percentage is, I don't have my glasses on. They shot 38%, but
one out of 13. The one that they made, Frerking or whoever hit it was
completely wide open. We'll take that, that's why we lead the nation in
three‑point percentage defense. We're proud of that.  
We have to do better tomorrow because LSU hit a lot on us every which way.  
Y'all got something for my kids here?  
  
Q. I was going to ask about the matchup tomorrow with the guards of LSU.
They had 58 points on you in Baton Rouge. Courtney and Courtney, what do you
plan on doing different tomorrow?  
COURTNEY WILLIAMS: Particularly it was harden. She had 26 points. I think she
was like five for eight from the three. We want to make her put it on the
ground because she's a spot‑up shooter. She'll size you up, let you rest,
shoot the three.  
We want to attack her hard off the screens and make her put it on the floor.  
With the other guards, they were coming off the screens, so we want our post
to hedge correctly, go under the screens, follow the defense that Coach
Starkey gives us better than we did when we went to LSU.  
  
Q. You lost Jordan last week to an injury. How have you tried to adjust
without her going forward?  
COURTNEY WALKER: We just been trying to talk more. That was one thing. Of
course, she's going to be a leader. As far as being on the court, C was doing
a great job of talking on the court. Curtyce doesn't talk as much as Jordan.
That's one of the biggest things, the leadership on the court that Jordan
brings for us and trying to make up for that.  
  
Q. Courtney Walker, on the flipside of that, playing with Curtyce for two
and a half games as basically the starter, do you feel more comfortable with
her now than you did two weeks ago or a week ago?  
COURTNEY WALKER: I mean, yeah, always trying to build chemistry is a good
thing. Curtyce is very capable. We had confidence in her to do what she's
going to do. We have to settle down and do it, relax, break the press like we
know how.  
  
Q. Both Courtneys, you get great support on campus and on the road. Were you
aware that the band and folks were MIA well into the second half? Did it give
you a punch when they showed up?  
COURTNEY WILLIAMS: I heard them playing our school song when they had got
there. Gave us some energy.  
  
Q. Other than Arkansas, you've been the only other team in the SEC that
played in this building. How much did that experience in December help you out
for the day?  
COURTNEY WALKER: It's been cool. I mean, it looks way different. SEC got it
set up really nice. It just reminds me of Georgia still from the last two
years of the tournament.  
It was kind of different. Didn't really remind me of the way it used to be.
Everything is different, set up for the SEC.  
COACH BLAIR: We got to build this crowd for tomorrow. You got University of
Arkansas still left in it. You've got me with my Arkansas ties still left in
it, my family. You got Mississippi State with Coach Schaefer and his Arkansas
ties.  
The fans of Little Rock have been really good. Hopefully the weather is going
to be beautiful tomorrow, sun is going to melt everything, snowmans are going
to melt. We need people to come out and watch top‑quality women's basketball.  
The media has done a great job. But we need folks to come out. There is
nothing better than Friday of an SEC tournament. You've got eight teams that
are all NCAA playoff teams. It does not get any better.  
You'll never have the men play in a situation like this right here in
Arkansas, but you've got the women. So let's embrace it and hopefully you'll
be able to host a regional here someday because I think this is a perfect
venue, the facility is great.  
Just like to thank everybody for coming out, all you guys. Let's go eat.

_NORTH LITTLE ROCK, ARKANSAS_  
  

Arkansas  72  
Ole Miss  61

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Arkansas head coach and student‑athletes Calli
Berna and Jessica Jackson.  
Coach, if you can begin with an opening statement.  
COACH DYKES: Well, it's a great win for Arkansas today because Ole Miss is a
very good basketball team. They came in winning three out of four. Matt does a
great job in his second year. That program is on the up rise.  
We were the better team today. We did some really good things. It was as good
of a team win as we had all seasons. Got them on the boards 33‑29\. We felt
like we could drive the ball on them, so we kept a lot of the drive action
going in the game. We made 28 free throws.  
We weren't perfect. Had to battle through foul trouble. Melissa Wolff only
played about five minutes, I think, in the first half. McKinley Bostad came
in, knocked down shots for us.  
We were good. We were a good team today. We're playing like an NCAA tournament
team right now. I hope that happens for us 'cause that was our 17th win this
year against a strength of schedule that's 10.  
We've done everything that the Selection Committee asks you to do in terms of
being aggressive with your schedule, playing on the road. Out of the Power5
conferences, we're second in the nation in terms of the number of wins we had
on the road or neutral floor. That has to hold up.  
We'll prepare for South Carolina. But that was a huge win for us in terms of
our résumé and where we'll be viewed for the NCAA tournament.  
Couldn't be any prouder of my team. I told them afterwards, I couldn't love
you any more than I do and I can't be prouder of you than I am today.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Girls, Arkansas struggled in recent years and in this building. Was that
something you thought about going into today or did any of that really
matter?  
CALLI BERNA: It's not something we talked about. We're kind of a team that
we're going to look at the first game in front of us, and that's how we're
going to do things.  
I think we knew we had to come in here and fight hard and play our game. When
we start to think about, We lost to Ole Miss last year, when you think about
that, you don't play your game as much. For us, it was come in here, play as
hard as you can, and today that worked for us.  
  
Q. Pretty bad weather. What do you say to the Razorback fans that came out
today?  
COACH DYKES: They were phenomenal. They got pretty loud. I told people on the
way over here, on the bus, maybe the schools being closed, that may help us.
Let's go watch the Hogs while they're in town.  
We got to do that today on a neutral floor with great crowd support. There's
probably quite a few of them that's the first time they got to watch us play
here this year. We played once against Oklahoma. I hope they appreciate how
hard we fight and play the game of basketball. I think we do a good job of it.  
  
Q. How about Jessica Jackson's play in the second half? Jessica, what kind
of helped you get going into the second half? What was it like to play back
near your hometown once again?  
JESSICA JACKSON: It's always great to play near my hometown. My family and
friends get to come and watch me play, support me and the team.  
My teammates is the ones who keep me going. We all feed off each other. My
teammates is what keeps me going.  
  
Q. Jessica, I think you missed your first five. Any frustration there? How
do you stick with it?  
JESSICA JACKSON: I always get told by everyone, Let it go, Jess. If your first
couple shots don't come to you, don't let that define your whole game. You can
do other things like rebound to help your teammates out. Just got to keep
playing and hopefully the shots will fall sooner or later.  
  
Q. Coach, you mentioned McKinley early. She gave you a spark today. How
important was her play there for you?  
COACH DYKES: It was huge. The only other time we played Ole Miss was in
Oxford. She fell and knocked her two front teeth out. 99% of kids would have
been done for a couple of weeks. She sat out for five minutes, then said,
Coach, I can go back in.  
At that point I could see the nerves of her two front teeth were exposed. She
went back in and played in Oxford.  
That really set a tone for who this team is, sets a tone for who we are going
to be going forward. You can knock our teeth out, break our nose, we're never
going to quit.  
She played 30 minutes in a big‑time ballgame and held up well. I though her
and Kelsey Brooks were outstanding in guarding Frizzell. Frizzell can really
shoot that basketball. She had 11 points today, but they made her work for
everything she got. Did a good job covering her.  
Probably as good of a team defense as we've been in in a long time. Ole Miss
can move and drive that ball on you. We're constantly in help, constantly on
the drive lines. Our staff did a terrific job of getting this team prepared,
then the kids did an excellent job of taking that preparation to the floor.  
She was huge, though. Mac was huge.  
  
Q. Jessica, you had four points in the first half, but finished with 25.
Were you doing something different in the second half in order to get open and
get those shots? And, coach, what adjustments did you make at the half?  
JESSICA JACKSON: What got me going, again, my teammates got me going. Coach
and them was saying, Flash to the open spot. Jess, you got to work. That's
basically what got me going.  
COACH DYKES: To answer your question, as well, we stayed with pretty much the
same offense in the second half as we did with the first. I think we were just
a little bit more aggressive with it after we turned the corner on the ball
screens. Then Jess and Jhas were really good at playing off that ball screen
action we had going on. Moved the ball really well. Four or five plays in the
second half it was Jess to Jhas or Jhas to Jess. Jess is a confident player. I
want us to all be that.  
  
Q. Coach, you were up one at half. In the first five minutes, there were six
lead changes in the second half. What did you do to take over and pull away?
Are those pretty good traits to have in the post ‑season tournament?  
COACH DYKES: I thought we did, again, probably 75% of our timeouts we spent
talking about defense, the importance of playing the gaps, playing low and
wide, making sure we're covering the gaps up. We wanted to take away their
vision, their eyes. We wanted the gaps to look closed even if they weren't.  
Just reminded them about boxing off. We beat them on the boards 33‑29\. I
thought we were really good boxing off. They got some over our back a few
times. That's going to happen. They're an athletic team. We never wavered.  
We had a thing today that they forgot to tell us that we're not supposed to
play tomorrow. Now we're going to play tomorrow.  
  
Q. Coach, tomorrow's game, what do you expect? South Carolina.  
COACH DYKES: I expect South Carolina to be here at noon. I expect them to be
the same as we saw them a few weeks ago. After they lost to UConn, came to our
place. I said, I hope I get to see a UConn‑South Carolina rematch on a Final
Four on a neutral floor. They're good enough to win this thing. Don't think
they're not. They have size, experience, a future Hall of Fame coach, Hall of
Fame player. They're the real deal.  
So we have our work cut out for us, we know that. But you know what, that's
okay. It will be the 9‑seed taking on the 1‑seed.  
Their size is overwhelming, looking ahead a little bit. Their size can
overwhelm you some. As well as we played today, we're going to have to play
that well and probably even more tomorrow.  
  
Q. Girls, coach touched on your NCAA tournament hopes. Is that what you're
playing for this week, making sure that résumé is as good as it can be?  
CALLI BERNA: Obviously the NCAA tournament is our goal. We are playing for
that. But more importantly, we're here and we're focused on each game. We're
taking it one game at a time. I feel like that's the way you get to the NCAA
tournament.  
We're going to take on South Carolina tomorrow the best we can and hopefully
our résumé does hold up. I think it will.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, ladies, thank you.

_NORTH LITTLE ROCK, ARKANSAS_  
  

Kentucky  67  
Vanderbilt - 61

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Vanderbilt head coach and student‑athletes
Jasmine Jenkins and Marqu'es Webb.  
We'll take questions.  
  
Q. Coach, fell into a hole early, then your team fought back. Talk about
what happened to change it after the poor beginning.  
COACH BALCOMB: Well, I think one of the biggest things was we changed
defenses. We were really struggling rebounding in the zone. They were getting
second and third shots every time down.  
We switched to a man‑to‑man. Then we were responsible for who we had in our
checkout. We started giving them one‑and‑done. We held them for a long period
defensively which helped us to get offensively in transition, get in a flow
and be able to score as well.  
  
Q. Coach, talk about the charge call on Dahlman.  
COACH BALCOMB: That was a tough call. You guys already know how I feel. Had a
technical. I can't really say anything about it other than it was the game
right there.  
I mean, obviously I didn't see it that way. You know, you don't have control
of that. That was pretty much the game. It would have been a great big play
for us, but it turned around to be the opposite.  
  
Q. With zero seniors on this team, a lot of underclassmen, talk about the
program.  
COACH BALCOMB: I think it's been an interesting year, different than any other
season I've ever been in.  
At the same time we were young. We lost a really strong leader and a really
strong scorer. I think it took us a while with so many young players, then you
throw in a lot of injuries to that, for us to get into a flow and a rotation
and roles, all the things that make up a team, chemistry on and off the court,
consistency, and consistency leads to trust.  
I saw a lot of trust on the floor today and yesterday. You know, I think the
future, that shows us that we can be the team we want to be, and we're heading
in that direction. I think it means a lot to end on this kind of positive. It
showed us what we needed to see to go forward.  
  
Q. For the players, when you were down by that much in the first half,
struggling to score, how did you keep your mentality up and the fight?  
JASMINE JENKINS: I think, like coach said, we changed defenses. That really
helped us. When you're playing, coach always said to not look at the
scoreboard, just go out there and fight. That's what we did.  
We fought when we were down. We fought when we were up. We fought the whole
game. That's a huge positive to take out of this game.  
We dug ourselves a hole and we got out of it. That's a positive. We stayed
together and believed in each other for 40 minutes, the entire game. We didn't
look at the scoreboard, we just went out there and played basketball.  
  
Q. Kentucky has no shortage of tall players. Marqu'es, give us a cameo of
what it was like down in the post.  
MARQU'ES WEBB: Definition of the SEC, you know. It's a battle every night. It
is a battle every night, whether it's rebounding, offensive rebounding,
defensive rebounding. Shooting a layup is a battle.  
It's all about angles, doing work before the catch. Whether you're being
guarded by somebody that's 6'5" or somebody that's 5'9", it's a battle. We're
just ready to fight, so...  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_NORTH LITTLE ROCK, ARKANSAS_  
  

Auburn  71  
Florida  49

  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by Auburn head coach, along with
student‑athlete Brandy Montgomery and Tra'Cee Tanner.  
Coach, begin with an opening statement.  
COACH WILLIAMS‑FLOURNOY: I thought our players came out and started the game
exactly how we wanted them to start, and that's playing defense. That's been
key for us the last couple of games. Then not only playing defense, but
converting some of those turnovers into points for us as well.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Can you elaborate on the start, what you wanted to do.  
TRA'CEE TANNER: We definitely talked about keeping them from getting open
threes. Our defense is set into only allowing them to get contested threes off
so we could irritate them a little bit.  
I think we did a really good job of limiting their three‑points. We just amped
up the pressure a lot on defense. We weren't holding back because we have
nothing to hold back for.  
  
Q. Brandy, do you feel you were coming into the tournament with a lot of
momentum?  
BRANDY MONTGOMERY: Yes, we definitely came in on a high and we fed off of
that.  
  
Q. Can you talk about your shooting day.  
BRANDY MONTGOMERY: I honestly just haven't been thinking about it. I just
catch, shoot, no thought. It's been working for me.  
  
Q. Describe the last two weeks for you guys, where you were at two weeks
ago, where you are at mentally morale ‑wise now.   
TRA'CEE TANNER: I think we did complete 360 of how we played earlier in the
season. We're a much better team than our record shows. Better late than
never. But for it to click right before the tournament, it gives us a lot of
momentum to come in, especially our young ones that have to come up and play.  
I think we have a lot of things that we have to do, but it can be done and
each team is beatable.  
COACH WILLIAMS‑FLOURNOY: I think our young ladies should get all the credit.
They could have said, The season's over. They could have quit. But that's not
what they did. They get a lot of credit for continuing to fight, continuing to
work hard. I'm just really proud of them for doing that.  
  
Q. Coach, can you speak on Brandy a little bit. Has her getting in rhythm
offensively been a boost for you?  
COACH WILLIAMS‑FLOURNOY: It helps us a lot when Brandy is making shots. Brandy
is going to take shots. It helps a lot when she makes them.  
If you look at her number, she was 7‑15\. Because Brandy is a shooter, as a
volume shooter, you have to make sure you're always taking good shots. A lot
of times she was just rushing and taking bad shots. Bad shots brings your
percentage down.  
The last couple games Brandy made good shots. Once she's in rhythm, you're not
going to stop her.  
  
Q. Can you look ahead to tomorrow against Texas A &M.   
COACH WILLIAMS‑FLOURNOY: It's so funny to look back at the games we played. We
went back and looked at our game against Florida the first time in January, we
were awful. Couldn't even recognize what team was out there on the floor. We
were really bad.  
Really, there was no energy. There was no effort. There was no hustle. They
just weren't playing very hard.  
We continue to tell them again, That's not the team we are. They rediscovered
who they want to be. That's what we want to continue to do.  
  
Q. Did the weather affect your travel plans at all? Did you try to get here
early?  
COACH WILLIAMS‑FLOURNOY: No. When you play the first round, you come very
early (laughter).  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, thank you very much.

_NORTH LITTLE ROCK, ARKANSAS_  
  

Auburn  71  
Florida  49

  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by Florida head coach along with players Ronni
Williams and Kayla Lewis.  
Coach, please begin with an opening statement.  
COACH BUTLER: I just want to congratulate Auburn. They were fantastic today. I
think it's arguably the hottest team in the league right now. They did just a
fantastic job from the jump of executing their game plan. We were reacting to
that the entire game.  
We've got a lot of areas we have to look at and change and grow from, learn
from. But Kayla didn't deserve the way we played today. I'm really
disappointed for that.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. You had trouble shooting the ball today. What can you attribute that
to?  
KAYLA LEWIS: Well, you can't ever attribute that to something. Shooting is
something that comes and goes. You can have a good night or a bad night.  
Shooting the ball I don't think was our biggest problems. I think one of our
biggest problems was we turned the ball over. We gave points to people in the
way we knew they scored. We didn't do a good job defending Auburn, and they
did a great job executing what they did well.  
Their press was very effective and has gotten better since the last time we
played them. I don't think it was our shooting that lost the game.  
  
Q. Was that something you saw the last time, the press? How did that throw a
wrench into what you were trying to do?  
KAYLA LEWIS: Wasn't a surprise. Knew it. Worked on it. They did a good job in
it. We didn't do a good job executing, miscommunications, not getting the ball
out of our hands fast enough. Their execution was better than ours in the
press.  
  
Q. Ronni, they got off to such a good start. Looked like you came out at
half with some energy. Was there a moment where you thought, This is where we
make our run or was it always a struggle?  
RONNI WILLIAMS: I wouldn't say it was a struggle. Our shots just weren't
falling. Like Kayla said, we had turnovers.  
But Auburn is a great team. They have a great defense. So in order for us to
be able to execute what we needed to do, it had to be perfection. The passes,
we had to meet our passes. That was our main thing tonight, just meeting our
passes.  
  
Q. Coach, you mentioned how well Auburn has been playing. What was the
biggest concern playing a team first round of a tournament that closed the
regular season on such a good run?  
COACH BUTLER: Well, I mean, confidence is a really, really powerful thing. We
had some tough situations down the stretch, disappointment our last home game,
last regular‑season game. I thought we had the right mindset. But clearly I
was wrong. I was wrong. Sometimes coaches are wrong.  
But I just really commend Terri. They had a lot of adversity this season,
losing a significant player in a key time. I think you just got to commend her
and her team the way they came together and played even tougher and harder for
one another.  
  
Q. What do you think you can attribute the shooting trouble to tonight?
Anything in particular?  
COACH BUTLER: We've not been a very good shooting team all year. That's not
what we hang our hat on. We put a lot more energy and effort into our defense
which didn't hold up very well tonight either.  
Certainly you can shoot the ball and cover up for some breakdowns. But we
didn't play particularly well on either end of the floor. But I give Auburn
all the credit for that.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, ladies, thank you.
