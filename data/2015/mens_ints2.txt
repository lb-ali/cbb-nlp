_CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

DUKE - 68  
SAN DIEGO STATE - 49

COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Well, very first thing, just congratulations to San Diego
State, Steve and his kids for a great season, 27 wins and a great program,
great people. And they were a very worthy opponent today, a team that was
really tough for us to score against and so we beat a really good team. Our
guys played outstanding defense. Justise, his defensive rebounding especially
in the first half was huge, and his play throughout was huge. And then Jah
was, you know, his scoring inside to get that percentage of shots and makes
against the San Diego State defense that is one of the best in the country was
terrific. My guards handled the ball well and we're going to Houston. So
that's a heck of a thing. I'm proud of my team.  
  
MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
 Q. Jahlil, you don't see a lot of guys as big and dominant physically
as you that apparently spent so much time working on your moves and your
fakes. Where did that come from? Did somebody influence you at a young age?  
JAHLIL OKAFOR: I've been playing basketball my entire life so a lot of the
things come natural, I'm just really comfortable playing in the post and I've
always been bigger than everybody else my size, so at an earlier age I was
always forced to be in the paint because I was taller than everybody else.
That's just somewhere I'm very comfortable.  
  
MODERATOR: Question is about the moves, his individual moves.  
  
JAHLIL OKAFOR: Well, I have a trainer that I've been working with since 8th
grade and he's been great for me, even when I stepped on the Duke campus, I
worked on a lot of moves with Coach Capel and watching the film with coaches,
they pointed out things that they'll think will work and it's been effective
for me.  
  
 Q. For Jahlil, how much did the aggressiveness and the quickness of
your guards have to do with putting their defense on their heels and creating
openings for you?  
JAHLIL OKAFOR: Say that again? I'm sorry.  
  
 Q. How much did the quickness of your guards have to do with putting
their defense on their heels and kind of creating some openings for you?  
JAHLIL OKAFOR: Our guards, they were phenomenal tonight on both ends of the
floor. They found me multiple times to give me easy opportunities to score and
they were giving me all the confidence in the world, but I think their
quickness did give San Diego State a problem.  
  
 Q. Jahlil, what did you learn from Friday night and how did that
experience help you tonight?  
JAHLIL OKAFOR: Just the game's never over. We had a huge lead with Robert
Morris and they cut it down to 10 and we kind of felt the pressure of that
game and we learnt that from this game and we never let up, the entire game we
stayed together, we kept competing.  
  
 Q. Usually winning an ACC tournament leads to NCAA success. What did
you guys do to recharge your batteries in the last week to come in here and
play the two games like you played and moving forward?  
JUSTISE WINSLOW: Really we just took some time off, let our bodies recovery
physically. Just the whole week Coach did a great job of getting us mentally
prepared. We didn't find out our opponent until Wednesday so throughout that
week, there was a lot of focus on us and how we can get better as a team, and
once we found our opponent, the coaches did a great job of letting us know the
scouting and the game plan. We were just very prepared for both these games so
that we could practice really helped us get better.  
  
 Q. Jahlil, at one point early in the first half or midway through the
first half, you finished off a fast break with a dunk and you turned around
and you punched your fists and you were clapping. Kind of emotional. What was
going through your head then because you were maybe a little more emotional
than I'm used to seeing?  
JAHLIL OKAFOR: I had a lot of emotion going through me before the game. Me and
my brothers, we really just wanted this game. There was no reason for it, I
don't know why I did it, it was just all emotion and I was passionate about
the game.  
  
 Q. Jahlil, what would it mean to you, you know, to get to the top of
the mountain here. Obviously you have a ways to go, but what would that mean
to you to win a national title?  
JAHLIL OKAFOR: It would mean the world to me. I've always wanted to win a
national title. Me, Justise, Tyus, Grayson, the freshman who are coming in
here, we had one big dream of winning the national title. That's what led me
to come to Duke was the opportunity to win a national title. That's where all
my focus has been the entire season and that's where it still is. We're
putting everything on the line and that's our No. 1 goal.  
  
JUSTISE WINSLOW: Like Jah said just as a kid, you grow up wanting to be in
that moment and play on that big stage. It's been a long season, we had our
ups and downs. For us to finish off in that fashion would be great but we've
got a lot of work to be done.  
  
MODERATOR: Thanks, guys. Good job. Questions for Coach?  
  
 Q. Mike, you reduced your rotation tonight, dramatically it seems, and
at some point in the game you stopped calling set plays and went straight
motion offense; is that right, did I see that correctly and why did you do
that?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: That's pretty good. Keep going, I'll grade you. What was the
first point you made?  
  
 Q. The rotation.  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Rotation. It was so good that I'm really pretty good. I
don't go into the game thinking about a rotation. Part of it has to do with
foul trouble, who they have, and our match-ups, and then conditioning. Jah,
especially with these long timeouts, Jah this week is in much better shape
than he was the last three and a half weeks of the season. I think he's pretty
much over his injury, so he can play longer. If you hit on a group, I would
have had Grayson in there a little bit longer but he got in foul trouble, it
just kind of hit. In the second half, they're a very good defensive team and
they're very tall, they have great length. They're tough to score against.
They were prepared to stop some of our sets really well. And so we just said
at a timeout, look, let's run motion, you guys attack, follow your instincts.
If you can get it to Jah while you're running motion, get it to Jah but be
players. And we do that at different times during the season but today it
really worked out. It was almost like a good push for them because it
translated on defense also. It just kind of worked out. But they're the ones
who made -- they were making the plays and they made it happen.  
  
 Q. I was asking the players about usually the ACC tournament winners
spring boards and certainly Notre Dame has, but how do you deal with not
winning it and still keeping the goals that you obviously have in mind?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: I don't necessarily agree with that. I think we've won a
national championship and we've won a tournament. I remember losing by 20
points in the championship game and winning. I think the main thing is for any
team to put what they've just done behind them and try to get fresh. That's
what we've tried to do. When we lost to Notre Dame, it's not like you go back
and punish them. They've been too good. But learn from it, get fresh and then
you're 0-0 again, that's what we tried to do.  
  
 Q. Mike, when Justise has the kind of all-around game that he had
today, what does that do for the team especially on the defensive end?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: It just takes us to a whole other level. Those two kids
played at a really high level this afternoon. And Justise, a lot, was on their
best player, O'Brien, who I think a lot of people feel is the best player in
that conference, in the Mountain West. And certainly that point forward, that
guy, he's a really good player. Justise won that individual battle, not that
he was bad but Justise was so good, and it gave our guys more confidence.
Those two kids really played great games this afternoon, big-time games.  
  
 Q. Coach, you know what it takes to win a national championship. As you
look at this team, do you see all the pieces coming together right now that
tell you, you have a shot?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Yeah, you know, we have a shot because we can still play.
You know, there will be 16 teams that will have a shot. A couple things, one,
we're healthy, hopefully we stay healthy. We weren't healthy the last couple
weeks of the regular season, completely. We have great attitudes. The guys
aren't ready for this to be -- in other words, they're not mentally tired,
they're not physically tired. They're together. We have talent, we're getting
older by experience, and so we just -- like we got better here, these two
games. Our defense was really good here. We shared the ball well again
tonight, 16 and 9, really good. So we got better. If we can -- we've got to
play Friday night. Hopefully we get better then and get a chance to play
Sunday. It's a young group of kids that have really had a great season and
they still want to get better. So you've got a chance, we've got a chance.  
  
 Q. When they cut it to 7, they came down and Tyus fed Quinn in the
corner for 3, and you called an immediate timeout even though there was a TV
timeout coming up the next dead ball. What did you tell them because y'all
went on a 13 run after that?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: I thought like we had lost control of the game, they were in
more control, the momentum of the game was theirs, and we had just seized it
with that 3. And I wanted to make sure, I just wanted to be the point guard
for the timeout and say, look, we need stops, we're going to go motion, let's
change this right now. I've done that more this year with this group at
different times, to call some timeouts when it's not in the book to call them
or whatever, but just more by feel. I think they needed a blow, they needed a
blow so they would be fresh defensively.  
  
 Q. Coach, you obviously have learned a lot about your freshmen
throughout this season but did you learn something else about them this
weekend in their first tournament action? And talk about that growth of them
from beginning to now.  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Well, sure, thank you. This is their first time. And even
for the upperclassmen, most of the questions for the upperclassmen was what
you did last year. So there wasn't a lot of positive vibe about us being in
the tournament, it was like can you get over this and then it's a new thing
for you. That's just the way it is. I thought our guys had fun this week. We
didn't pay attention to anything like that, we just played. And they're such a
good, close group. They're really a close group. And they responded in both
games when it got down to 10 against Robert Morris and it got down to 7 this
afternoon, they responded to like their best play, which that's the thing you
can't teach, you don't know if they're going to do it and they did, and so I'm
proud of them for doing that. This tournament, I call it tournament pressure,
and they handled it really well twice.  
  
 Q. Steve Fisher was talking about how you guys offensively were able to
do things that teams haven't been able to do against them all year, like
getting to the rim, finding an open 3, then pounding it down low to Okafor. Is
this maybe the most versatile offense you've had in quite a while? Because it
seems like you have got four guys, whether it's the wing players, the guards
or down low that you're able to score almost at will against anybody at any
time?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Well, it's a very complimentary group of guys because you
have, I think, the best low post scorer in the country in Jah, we have good
shooters and we have guys who can drive. And so that's why we've been one of
the best offensive teams in the country because we have those components. But
it starts with Jah because you get -- you don't just get penetration with a
dribble, you get penetration with a pass and then you get results. And so you
move the defense in and out, and Jah overall has done a really good job with
the double team. So it's been a really good off -- I mean, one of the very
good offensive teams I've had. We've been a good defensive team most of the
year and we just had a couple games where we weren't good, but overall we've
been a very good defensive team and we were really good here for these two
games.  
  
 Q. Coach, the other night with Jah with the dunk, do you think that was
a learning lesson for him and how do you think that impacted how well he
played today?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: I think all of them are learning lessons. He shouldn't have
done that, and he knows it, he takes responsibility for it, and just like you
should take responsibility for playing great tonight and why did that happen,
why did that happen? Were you a little bit more mentally prepared tonight, did
you show emotion, did you put more into it, and did you play through tired? I
didn't think, like in that situation it was the end of a four-minute period, I
thought he was tired and he did -- he made a mistake. Tonight, this afternoon,
when he got tired, he played through it and made really good plays. And that's
part of becoming a really good player is to be tired. A team needs to beat it
and a player needs to beat it because all these kids get tired.  
  
 Q. What adjustments do you have to make heading into Houston against
Utah and their 3-point shooting team?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: You know, I haven't watched anybody. I wish -- I'll handle
Utah questions -- nothing against them, I just haven't watched them. I didn't
know we would be going to Houston until about an hour ago and in between I
haven't watched any of their tape or whatever. I'll be happy on our press
conferences before the game to talk in detail about Utah, but I just know
they're coached by a guy with an amazing background, I think in the history of
the game, I don't know how many times two Polish coaches will go against one
another, where both of us are called Coach K, but he's a good friend. I had
him on my Sirius XM show about a month ago and, boy, was he -- he was really
good, really good. And his background is amazing. I know they play with great
character and they come from a great conference but I'll study them more and
I'll be more apt to give a good answer as to how we'll defend them and attack
them.  
  
 Q. Mike, have you been able to -- were you aware of how well the
conference has played?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Yeah, yeah. Unbelievable. How about the triangle region,
it's not bad. But the whole tournament has had incredible games, just
incredible games. Our hearts and our thoughts and prayers go out to Mike and
his family. For him to coach that game without anyone knowing that his mom had
passed away. She was an Olympic -- she was, like Mike said, she was way ahead
of her time. She just was like a great, great lady. For his team and for the
basketball gods to make that happen was so good. I'm so happy and I hope
they're doing all right.  
  
MODERATOR: Thank you.

_CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

DUKE - 68  
SAN DIEGO STATE - 49

MODERATOR: We'll be starting with San Diego State.  
  
COACH FISHER: I told our team that I'm disappointed that we couldn't have
played better, that we didn't play better, but I'm immensely proud of what the
program has become, single out our three fifth-year seniors. We got beat up
tonight by a really good team. I thought when we fought back in the second
half and cut it to 7, I think we had the ball twice with a chance, maybe, but
they didn't let that happen. They're very good and they deserve a No. 1 seed
and they played like one. We're better than we played tonight, they had a lot
to do with it, but we've got a group of guys that compete, believe in one
another. And when it ends, it ends so fast because you don't think it's going
to end. But the end is here for us. But we represented San Diego State and
ourselves in a fashion that a mom and a dad and the university president and
the coach could be proud.  
  
MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. Skylar, can you just give us your impressions of Okafor, particularly
in the first half when they were able to get the ball inside to him pretty
effectively, sometimes on the break?  
SKYLAR SPENCER: He's a good player. You know, he's real big and he gets into
position. I tried to guard him without fouling him, but I'll take the blame on
that one. I allowed a lot of points from him so I feel like I let my team down
in that area.  
  
Q. JJ, uncharacteristically we're not used to seeing you guys kind of
not look comfortable, they were doing some things to you that most teams
don't. What happened early in the game from your perspective?  
J.J. O'BRIEN: I think they bothered us with their pressure. They did a good
job denying our wings, getting us out of our sets a little bit. So their
pressure bothered us early and I think we had some turnovers, some missed
shots and they had some runouts and they got some easy buckets. Their pressure
bothered us.  
  
Q. Is that just a matter of them being extremely talented, that that
happened, because again that doesn't usually happen with you guys?  
J.J. O'BRIEN: Well, not a lot of teams pressure like them, so it's a lot to do
with their coaching, a lot to do with their players, but that's just their
style. We haven't faced a style like that.  
  
Q. Skylar, this question is for you: You're the only guy sitting up
there that's coming back next year. I know it's pretty early to think about
things like this, but how much does a game like this make you want to get
going right away?  
SKYLAR SPENCER: Yeah, it leaves a bad taste in your mouth. I want to get back,
I wish the season started tomorrow. I'll think about this L, go back in the
gym, work hard in the off season and hopefully we meet them again next year.  
  
Q. AQ, you guys seemed real tentative early, very uncharacteristic of
you guys, and then once you guys were behind, you seemed to relax a little
bit. Just talk about that a little bit and how were you guys able to get back
into it?  
AQEEL QUINN: Their pressure bothered us a lot. That's all I can say, their
pressure bothered us.  
  
Q. For Skylar, you said Okafor was big and he got positioning, but can
you describe what it's like to go up against him?  
SKYLAR SPENCER: I played against big players before but I haven't played
against anybody that big, with that skill set. It was kind of hard to fight
with him and not get called for a foul, so I don't know, I guess I'll come
back stronger next year or whatever, but I just tried to bang with him without
getting called for a foul.  
  
Q. For Dwayne, you guys obviously hit a bunch of 3s on Friday. What were
they doing differently to take those away from you today?  
DWAYNE POLEE II: They did a great job denying and pressuring the guards so
that it was hard to make certain reads. That's a credit to their defense. And
open ones we did get, we weren't able to knock down. All credit to their
defense.  
  
MODERATOR: Guys, thank you. Congratulations on a great year. Questions for
Coach Fisher?  
  
Q. Steve, I know about the pressure. That's just an extremely talented
team and I wonder if that is basically the difference tonight, the depth of
their talent, that they can play defense like that and make shots, and you
guys are, it's really 50/50 whether you're going to come out shooting or
not?  
COACH FISHER: What happened to us was created a lot by Duke, but it could not
have been a worst scenario for us to get behind so big, so fast early. And we
got rocked back on our heels and I think we became tentative a little bit when
that happened rather than being smart-aggressive. But we had some pretty good
looks that we didn't get to go down, but a lot of it's a credit to how they
guard. They do a nice job of guarding, they don't let you get easy looks. But
we got off to a rough start. And all that being said, at halftime I said we
can win the game, let's get the first basket, let's win the first TV timeout
segment. I think we cut two or three points off of it, 13-10, and all of a
sudden Malik hit a couple baskets and we cut it to 7. I think we believed then
that we had a chance, but to their credit, I think they went back-to-back-to-
back on us and 7 became 13 or 14 again and they expanded on it. We're better
than we played. Duke made us play that way to some degree, to a great degree,
and when we had our open shots, the ones that went in yesterday didn't go in
today for us. And we had some open shots, not as many but we had some open
looks that we couldn't get to go in.  
  
Q. Steve, I know it's not the easiest time to do this, but I just
wondered if you could reflect back on what your guys accomplished this year
and maybe what you see for this program going ahead from here.  
COACH FISHER: I told them, you must be disappointed. Disappointment is there
when you lose, especially when you lose your last game. But to your point, I
said the same thing, reflect back with pride on what you've done to continue
to elevate San Diego State basketball. And I singled out the three fifth-year
seniors, and where we were when they came and how much improvement we've made.
And then I said be determined, be determined the rest of you, that you're
going to come back and do a little extra to get a little bit better, and knock
on the door again. We will find a way to work our way into Sweet 16, through a
Sweet 16 and you can be the group that does it. But they've done a wonderful
job all year in representing San Diego State in terms of how they treat and
deal with people, to how they go to class, to how they compete as a basketball
player. So they've done a wonderful job representing themselves and our
university and I'm proud of that. Disappointed that we're losing today, it's
there for all of us.  
  
Q. What were your impression of Winslow and Okafor, were they better
than you even could tell on film?  
COACH FISHER: They've been pretty good on the film that I've watched. I knew
they were good. They've he got a team full of very good players. Okafor is a
load, he's hard to guard. I think we gave him two, three, four that were too
easy, but he's good. He's very, very talented. And again, he's not the Lone
Ranger. Winslow can play. They've got a terrific team and they played like a
No. 1 seed today.  
  
Q. Can you talk about how you guys have relied on your defense all year,
one of the best in the country but they still were able to come out and shoot
in the mid 50s from field goal percentage, and even high from a 3-point range.
What were they were able to do that they were able to score almost at will all
night?  
COACH FISHER: They got it to the rim a little too easy on us with their
guards, with their quickness to get by us and get to the rim. That hasn't
happened the way it did tonight. We say guard your man, keep him in front of
you, be responsible. And when they would get in the gaps, somebody would step
over to help a little bit and then they did a great job of finding the 3-point
shooters and all the while they're throwing in an Okafor every other time down
the floor and he went to work on us. He went to work.  
  
Q. Steve, I just wondered if you could address real quick the news of
the illness kind of sweeping through your bunch?  
COACH FISHER: Everybody knew that AQ got sick at shootaround on Thursday
before we played on Friday. I don't know if it was a bug, they initially
thought it might have been food poisoning, but it hit a lot of people from
coaches to players to coaches' wives and that's not fun to deal with that, but
that had no impact on how we competed, what we did, how we played. That had no
bearing on it.  
  
Q. You had a pretty great freshman class at Michigan, and this Duke
freshman class is pretty good as well. Can you compare the two a little bit? I
know it's a ways back, but can you talk of this Duke freshman class and how
good they actually are?  
COACH FISHER: They're very, very good. I don't like to compare anything, but
they are a talented, well-coached group that compete hard and that's what you
have to do, no matter whether you're a freshman or a senior, but they're very,
very good.  
  
MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.  
  
COACH FISHER: Thank you.

MICHIGAN STATE - 60  
VIRGINIA - 54

COACH IZZO: I can't tell you how proud and excited I am for these guys.
Especially the seniors, juniors, the guys that have been through a lot. I'm
not sure of all the great teams we've had, I've ever had one in a day that
change what we do on a game plan and execute it as well as they did. I'm just
proud of them, excited for them and looking forward to moving on.  
  
MODERATOR: Raise your hand, please.  
  
 Q. This is for Trav and Branden. Early on you scored 13 quick and,
Branden, you were big at the start of the second half. As two seniors, was
part of that, did you guys talk about not wanting this to be your last game
and, I don't know, I guess coming out big and carrying the game early?  
TRAVIS TRICE: It's funny that you say that. Draymond Green actually this
morning said don't let this be your last game and I texted him back and said,
I won't. But that was our mindset coming in. We knew they were a great team,
we had to jump out on them early.  
  
BRANDEN DAWSON: Coming to the locker room after the first half, we just kept
telling each other that we definitely want to practice tomorrow and coming to
this game, myself and Travis and Denzel, but being that Travis and I are
seniors, we just kept telling each other hey, we definitely don't want this to
be our last game, so we kept playing hard and we just kept playing with
passion.  
  
 Q. For either Branden or Denzel, when you look at what Travis has done
from where he was last year to this year scoring 23 points in a game like
this, is it hard to believe how far he's come?  
DENZEL VALENTINE: No, not really, he's always had that capability. We just had
basically a three year starter in Keith Appling playing in front of him, so
Travis was always ready but it's his senior year and this is his time to
shine. He always just stayed humble his three years and always calm and he
just kept working and now he's shown what he can do.  
  
BRANDEN DAWSON: Just playing with Travis since AAU basketball, those shots
that Travis made throughout the Big Ten tournament and shots he made in the
regular season, a few of the shots he made in today's game just shows Travis
is a bigtime player. He's been in moments like this plenty of times and the
shot he made, I think, late, I knew it was going in for a fact. That's just
what type of player he is. Big-time players make big-time plays, that's what
Travis did.  
  
 Q. Follow-up with Travis. Denzel said it, you waited your turn. How
hard was that to wait until your senior year and did you ever have doubts?  
TRAVIS TRICE: To be honest with you, there were a lot of things that played
into it. If you look early on I had a lot of injuries. I mean, I lost out on
two summers and that's really when you improve so I think that played a major
key into it. At the same time I've always had great players around me and all
I care about is winning, whether that's playing a lot, scoring a lot, not even
playing at all, that's all I care about.  
  
 Q. Question about Branden for you. Matt Costello said right before the
game, usually through the huddle when you guys are jumping around, and he
jumped in and kind of took over and Tony Bennett said they just couldn't match
his energy. Can you talk a little bit about Branden gave you today and how he
changed the game defensively early on there?  
DENZEL VALENTINE: Yeah, funny you said that, because we're usually jumping
around in our huddle or whatever, I'm usually the one that takes it over and
is encouraging guys. B.J. just took it over for some reason so I was like oh,
he ready to play. So when he did that, I knew he was ready to play. B.J., he
just came out like a monster and he did what he's supposed to do. At half-
time, I stayed in his ear. I knew if I couldn't be in the game, I had to stay
in his ear. I just kept encouraging B.J. and he pulled through.  
  
 Q. Travis, what was going through your mind the first five minutes when
you went on your hot streak? And then later, there was a transition
opportunity when Branden ran the floor. Costello went first, and Branden came
fast. What did you see in Branden on that one? How key was that play and what
did you see from Branden as that was developing?  
TRAVIS TRICE: It's funny, I actually caught the ball around half court and
once I got it, all I hear it B.J. yelling my name Trav, Trav. And he just
separates and goes down and finishes, gets the and-one, and I think that was
one of the major plays of the game because that changed the momentum,
honestly. It really got him going, too. So after that we were just rolling
with him.  
  
 Q. Travis, did you ever kind of just feel snakebit considering the
injuries you went through, at one point even your blisters had a blister in
it?  
TRAVIS TRICE: I haven't had any surgeries but I've probably had every injury
in the book that would make you shake your head. I just think everything
happens for a reason. I just thank God for literally just bringing me through
it. It's made me a better person, honestly, just all the things I've been
through.  
  
 Q. Travis, you just talked about your start, the first five and a half
minutes scoring 13 out of your team's 15 points to give you an 11 point lead,
how that felt and what you were thinking, starting the game?  
TRAVIS TRICE: To be honest with you, it started off, my teammates did a great
job of getting me open looks. I think B.J. or Zel threw me a breakout. I got a
dunk and then I got a layup from one of the two, and then Denzel hit me with a
great pass on the 3. I have to give my teammates credit for that because they
did a great job of finding me early on.  
  
 Q. It's really a question for all three of you guys. Coach Izzo said
that he asked you in a day to change something significant about the team's
personality, and I'm sure he'll eventually tell us what that is. But when he
comes to you and says to you we're going to do this thing that's totally
different, give us a little bit of insight into how you digest the fact that
the coach is asking you to be totally different.  
DENZEL VALENTINE: Well, at this point in the season we're playing teams that
we're not familiar with. So if we got to do something that's uncharacteristic
of us, then we just have to do it and we've got to trust in the coaches that
they're being right. Obviously they were right because our defensive concepts,
it worked today. Our coaches do a great job of preparing us for this.  
  
BRANDEN DAWSON: Yeah, just what Denzel said, we've been playing in this
tournament we've been playing teams that we're not familiar with, so you have
to follow the Coach's game plan and that's what we've been doing. Our coaching
staff, our managers, they do a great job of getting us prepared, but when you
have trust in Coach and the things that he tell us to do, then that's when
things fall into place. Like for instance, Coach told me during this game that
I can't go for any steals, I can't gamble, and I didn't go for any steals. So,
Coach, I listened to you.  
  
COACH IZZO: (Claps hands.)  
  
TRAVIS TRICE: I think you've just got to give our coaching staff a great hand.
Not only coaches, but our assistant coaches. They're staying up until late
hours of the night preparing us for our game. I think it just speaks to how
great that really are. They literally told us a totally different game plan
from some of the things we've been taught for four years honestly and for them
to be able to display that to us and for us to pick it up, I just think it
shows how great of coaches they are.  
  
 Q. Travis, you mentioned your teammates getting you those open looks
earlier, but it seemed like you had a very aggressive mindset. Did you see
that as a chance to seize control of the game and once you had that lead, does
that change the complexion from there on out just because of the type of game
that it was?  
TRAVIS TRICE: Yeah, I think of the way Virginia plays, they're a team where if
it's a slowdown game, the momentum's in their hands just because of the way
they play. Early on our thing was attack from the getgo, not just myself;
everybody. We need to try and attack, get a lead and it gives us kind of a
cushion. At the same time, you have to give Virginia a lot of credit, and most
of that was because of the way they play.  
  
 Q. You guys are probably one of the most dangerous teams within this
bracket and you're a 7 seed. Do you feel that there's less pressure as a 7
seed? Is there an us against the world type of mentality that you enter this
tournament with?  
BRANDEN DAWSON: Well, just throughout the season, we definitely had an up and
down season. We had some losses that in my mind we shouldn't have. Coming to
this tournament we just told each other, hey, we see the Coach's game plan, we
all play together, we bring in passion. We trust one other then that the sky's
the limit for us, I think coming to this tournament being a 7 seed it's
definitely us against the world type of mentality for all of us. We keep
playing the way we're playing, we'll definitely make a good run.  
  
 Q. Travis, defense obviously is something people were talking about all
week, a lot of it was with Virginia. Can you talk about, I guess, what the
challenge is when your program is built on that and hearing people talking
about other programs' defense and does that raise your game to become a better
stopping team on defense?  
TRAVIS TRICE: To be honest with you, all, we've tried to improve defensively
and honestly we're going up against one of the better teams statistically in
the country against Virginia. But we don't try and get caught up in that. If
you think about that, there's a hundred other mind games you could be playing
with. Our thing is just concentrating on winning the game, listening to our
coaches and doing what we need to do to win.  
  
MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Izzo?  
  
 Q. So, Tom, fill us in. What was the major personality change?  
COACH IZZO: Well, it really wasn't a personality, it was just the concepts.
Usually we're a team that our guards, we call it jump to the ball, we're
always giving help, we play kind of like they do, a little pack man defense.
But because they run these flare screens and they're so good at it. This is a
hard team to prepare for and a very well-coached team. A couple guys didn't
have as good of games but because they flare those guards, we couldn't get
caught up in that. So we used our bigs in the middle and we just kind of
changed what we do and we did it in a day and a half. We did some things
against Wisconsin where we changed how we played. Some guys are just concept
guys that do the same thing and I respect that because we're just not quite as
talented as we've normally been, so we're always cheating and trying to find a
way to get an edge. Give my staff a lot of credit, they sat down and did it.
But to have a team do that in one night change or two nights, kind of the
things, like Branden and Trav have done the same thing for four years. It was
interesting because we put Branden on the perimeter at the 3 because we were
running out of bodies there in the first half. He jumped to the ball and he
held like we normally do and they flared him and got a bucket and he kind of
said, oh, it's different when I'm playing the three than the four. It was just
something we did tactically and my assistants talked about it, we went with
it, we implemented it, and boy, the credit goes to coaches can tell you what
to do, but to do it when muscle memory tells you to do it a different way,
that's where I think we all talked about, in factor, Earvin talked about it
when he talked to them. At this time of year your focus has to be incredible
and that was incredible focus if you ask me.  
  
 Q. You said yesterday that you've learned over the years you've got to
look at the whole weekend, you can't just look at the first game. When did you
see this in Virginia, when did you guys come up with this, was this earlier in
the week, was this after watching them play Friday, how did it work?  
COACH IZZO: I didn't go that far, we're not that good a team. We couldn't go
in thinking -- I watched some film on Virginia early, but I also know what we
did last year and that probably helped us a little bit, too, I did forget to
say that. We did similar things last year, but last year we didn't have to
cheat as much because Harris and Appling were two of the best guards
defensively in the country. We kind of talked about it on Tuesday, if we play
them, here are some things we can look at, put it down, had our video guys
pull some clips of when we played them, pull some clips of what we were trying
to get across. And the minute we got back from the game, we gave them a half
hour, we talked about it and we went with it.  
  
 Q. Tom, a couple of the guys said that you brought up the Wisconsin
game down the stretch to them. What did you tell them and what did you see
differently in this game from those guys versus last week?  
COACH IZZO: Well, like I said, I've always been a guy that if there's an
elephant in the room, I'm going to address it. You know, I made no bones about
it. We didn't finish the job against Wisconsin, and so all I want them to do
is learn from it, you know, because it wasn't a couple of plays; it was a
couple of defensive lapses, it was not cutting out. So those are the things we
emphasize, and that's the advantage of playing in championship-level games,
because they hurt a little more, you remember them a little bit more and I
think our guys, I might have said it once or twice, but they said it more. And
don't forget, we didn't do this, we didn't do that. That's pretty cool when
that happens.  
  
 Q. Coach, you talked a little about your team not being quite as
talented this season. Do you consider them now overachieving or do you feel
that they're sort of maximizing the potential that they've -- that you've seen
in them all season?  
COACH IZZO: Well, that's not a cut to us. It is just that we're missing a few
players that we started the year with. In all honesty, we're not as talented,
but that happens to a lot of teams. I did say this is one of the more together
teams we've had ever, ever. I mean, something funny happened the other night
after the game. We watched a little film like we do and we give them a meal
and we send them up and we do some stuff and we bring them back down. After
the meal they just sat there and laughed and talked. Usually we had guys that
would run up and grab their phones and text their girlfriends and call it a
week. These guys just enjoy being around each other. I think that's the makeup
of a team. And I give credit to our seniors and our junior. These three guys
did that. Branden's an unbelievable teammate, sometimes too good of a
teammate, got to get a little more selfish. And Trav and Zel are just special.
I get a lot of credit from our football coach when he says you know, I look
across, you've taught us how to win championships. The last couple years he's
taught me that our seniors have to be good down the stretch and that's what he
preaches to his team and it's been good for me and my team.  
  
 Q. Along those lines, when Branden had a marvelous game against
Virginia last year, but he had Adreian Payne in the game, and there were other
things. Can you talk about his performance in this setting today about with
your roster as is it?  
COACH IZZO: You know, that breakaway, I told him after in front of everybody
that I'm really mad at him because that's what I think he has to give. To me,
that was an unbelievable play, I would like to know what that 40 speed was. He
looked like Secretariat, he just put in another gear. When he called Trav, he
was 10 feet behind I was right in line, and when Trav threw it, I said what
was he doing, and it was one step. Branden has got some special skills that he
doesn't even know he has sometimes. But he is getting better and we shouldn't
punish him because it's taken a little longer. Like Trav, I think he would
have been a different player if he didn't miss two summers. And we had Branden
miss two summers, and that's more difficult than people think. Just like
Anderson, he's not the same player he was. That kid in the middle of January,
I think, was one of the best players I saw play. Injuries are more difficult
than people think to get over.  
  
 Q. Forgive me if you've answered this already, 5 point game with just
under three minutes left, they've been fouling you, you hadn't taken many
field goal attempts. Trice waves off the screener and hits a 3. Talk about
that play.  
COACH IZZO: Good coaching. I told him to do it. No, I didn't. You know, that's
what you say, you rely on your seniors. They're a hard team to get around
because we're trying to ball screen it, they trap that, jump it, so we started
telling Trav just take them one-on-one and I wasn't expecting them to pull up
from that distance. It's one of those oh, no, nice shot type things. But he's
made a lot of those through his whole career, he's made a lot of those through
high school. I've just got to run with him because the kid's an incredible kid
and I'm just happy that he made it.  
  
 Q. I think that's 13 Sweet 16s for you now. You just beat a team that
was 30-3 and it's Round of 32. Did that seem almost more like a regional final
and what does that do for your team just getting started in a tournament to
come through a war like that, if you had that type of experience in a third-
round game?  
COACH IZZO: I think people asked me yesterday about the chip on your shoulder
because we beat them last year but these guys lost about as much as you could
lose last year if you have 16 years or 18 years straight of a senior class
going to a Final Four. And I know that record was meant to be broken, nobody's
done that throughout their career, so it wasn't -- I mean, it wasn't the
record that was earth shattering to me but it was to them that they were part
of the group that didn't so I think these guys had a lot more to play for than
people give them credit. And to watch them and listen to our former guys, like
they said today, I think that's a driving force you should have. I can't tell
you how good I think Virginia is. I do not think they played well today for
Virginia. I guess we get a little credit for that, but it's just one of those
days some guys miss some shots, it happens. It's happened to us. But we've
been a team all year that has banged around, probably lost more games than we
should have just because of the free throw situation or dumb coaching with
two, three seconds left to go in the game and people hitting 3s and tying it.
But I think we've had to earn every single thing we've gotten because every
game's been like that. So I think they felt comfortable in a game because
that's the way not their whole tournament has gone or the Big Ten tournament,
their whole season has gone that way. I'm just, I'm really proud of this team.
I don't use that word lightly when I speak and I am.  
  
 Q. You look at Travis' development from last year to this year, you
said he missed a few summers. Was there anything else that's led to what he's
been able to do as a senior?  
COACH IZZO: You know, I honestly believe the summer he's talking about, I
mean, I think it was his first -- you've got to realize he's 6-1 and a buck 50
when he started. He got up to about 172 or 3 and then that summer he got
really sick. It was a virus of some kind, they didn't know. I was worried
about his life for a while and it totaled him for the whole summer and he went
down I think to 148 pounds. Then the next summer he had a couple injuries,
too. He had a concussion. When you miss that much time, you can't get
stronger, either. So this summer, if you looked at the spring, summer and
fall, he had the best summer ever and I think I wore him down a little bit by
the middle of December because we just played him to death at the point and
guarding the best player, and we had some injuries then when we didn't have
any subs in the perimeter and he went through a little bit of a tough time
when I made the lineup change. I think it helped him because Tum took some of
that pressure off of him and it let him be a scorer and now he can do both. I
can't say enough about the job he's done but he has done it the old fashioned
way, he's earned it. He's a gym rat, his dad's a coach, his mother was an
athlete. Great family. When I didn't start him, I called his dad and he said
yeah, I didn't start some guys on my team, either. Everybody gets it. When he
says winning is the most important, winning is the most important.

_CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

MICHIGAN STATE - 60  
VIRGINIA - 54

MODERATOR: We're ready to begin with the University of Virginia.  
  
COACH BENNETT: A very physical game the way we started. There's a little bit
of a pattern or a trend for us, later in the year our starts hurt us, and when
the Trice young man had 13 I think of their first 15, we dug ourselves a hole.
After that first five minutes, it wasn't a matter of heart or effort. I
thought our guys laid it on the line, but when we needed a key stop or a
bucket to be made, it wasn't there. If you look at it, we took 17 more shots
than they did. We had trouble finishing and trouble making shots and then
there's a key breakdown. And again Michigan State, they're playing good ball
right now, they're very tough and they've got some guys who made some big
plays in that setting. Stings right now, of course, the finality of the season
after we've had a heck of a year with these guys, what they've done, but it
just leaves that feeling that you wish you could have taken it further. But it
doesn't take away when all the dust settles what was accomplished, and we give
thanks for that but certainly learn from what took place.  
  
MODERATOR: Questions for Justin, Malcolm.  
  
Q. Justin, can you talk about Branden Dawson's impact on this game
inside, in the paint, and what he was able to do and how difficult he was for
you?  
JUSTIN ANDERSON: We knew the challenge that he presented to any basketball
team, his ability to rebound, his ability to pound on the inside and tough
fade away jumpers. He's a very complete player down there. I think early we
didn't match his energy but we did a great job getting back to who we were and
I think we did a solid job on him. I'm not sure about the numbers, but he's a
tough player.  
  
Q. You guys, Coach mentioned that trend of slow starts but your defense
keeps you in those games. How do you balance even with your defensive playing
well all year, when you don't have that offensive consistency? How do you get
that back and the defense sparks the offense, especially the last two losses
that wasn't there consistently enough on offense?  
MALCOLM BROGDON: I think it's about what Coach Bennett said earlier, getting
off to a good start, whether it's being sure-handed with the ball or not
having defensive breakdowns. Our defense does lead to our offense but when
you're having defensive breakdowns and you can't get stops and you're having
trouble seeing the ball through the net, then you're going to struggle, so
offensively I think that's why we struggled a little bit.  
  
Q. For Malcolm, why was Trice able to have that hot start?  
MALCOLM BROGDON: I don't think we made him uncomfortable. I thought he was too
comfortable at the very beginning. Losing him in transition and just not
pushing him out of his comfort zone. When players that can score at that level
get comfortable, then they're going to knock down a lot of shots.  
  
Q. What did Michigan State do defensively to you guys that contributed
to your 29 percent shooting tonight?  
MALCOLM BROGDON: You know, I think they play a similar pack defense. I think
they jam the lane and then they -- when we come up our down screens, which is
a staple in our offense, they swipe the gap really hard, which I thought led
us, disrupted us a little bit more than we should have let it. We just got a
little bit out of chemistry.  
  
Q. Justin, there were a couple sequences in the second half where I
think you were down 2 and maybe 3 and had an opportunity to get back there.
Did you feel like the breakthrough was coming, at some point you were going to
catch up and take the lead?  
JUSTIN ANDERSON: Yeah, I didn't have a doubt in my mind throughout the course
of that game that we weren't going to win that game. This team's resiliency
and ability to fighting no matter what the circumstance may be, I just knew
that collectively we had our heads in and we knew what we had to do to try to
fight back. It hurts, when you pull that close in the second half and maybe
they get a big shot, a big bucket, or whatever the case may be, it really
hurts because we know how hard we have to fight to get back when we dig
ourself in a hole like that.  
  
Q. Malcolm, could you talk about that as a team 2 for 17 3-point
shooting and some of your 3-point difficulties here?  
MALCOLM BROGDON: I thought offensively we were just a little out of rhythm and
it's hard to not gun 3s when you don't see one go through the net. We just
struggled in that way. Michigan State played good defense.  
  
MODERATOR: Any other questions for Justin or Malcolm? Okay, thanks guys.
Congratulations, great year. Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. Tony, did you feel the defense and rebounding were good enough had it
been a decent offensive day to win this game?  
COACH BENNETT: I think so. Michigan State, I thought early we were bailing
them out with our offense. You have to shift them. I mean, they're like us,
they're standing in the elbows and they're really jammed in there, and the
ball has to shift, you can't just stand one pass and either throw it inside
and the defense hasn't moved. And the ability to move the defense and be
physical and finish and we had a lot of opportunities. You look at our
offensive rebounds, 18 of them, we got some in there. We just had trouble
finishing. It's not like they're huge. I thought when we settled in, we moved
them better and got some looks, but the percentages, whether the key free
throw here or there, the 3-pointer shots, and then finishing, your defense can
only hang in there so long. It was enough, but not the start. To mention, you
asked a question about Trice, he hit some tough ones early, too, a couple real
tough ones that got him going and a couple times, we didn't have that many
turnovers but the three of them were crucial because we call them live ball
turnovers, they're the ones that, boom, got them going, they run out and got
points off of them. That hurt because we didn't shift the defense right away
and attack.  
  
Q. Same question about Branden Dawson. Early on he seemed to really
impact the paint defensively especially and that altered things a little
bit?  
COACH BENNETT: Yeah. I think his eyes light up when he sees Virginia because
he was terrific last year and he's was good again. He is so athletic and so
strong and our guys had trouble finishing. That's where you have to be able to
use fakes, draw fouls and do things. He was a man, he made some tough shots,
blocked shots, got on the glass. And you can see why he's at good as he is,
and he plays well in big games. He's done that twice on a big stage.  
  
Q. Can you talk about that fourth foul on Atkins with eight minutes to
go and maybe how that changed the momentum?  
COACH BENNETT: What was the score at that time? Six point game? It looked like
a clean block. When you're clawing and trying, scrapping, trying to get back
in it, you need everything to go well for you and go right. That hurt. Then
there was -- that was at the end of the shot clock right there. Seemed like
there was a little bit of a momentum shift there but that certainly hurt us.
Maybe when I watch the tape, I'll realize that I overreacted to it but I
thought it was a good block and again, we needed everything at that time.  
  
Q. You mentioned Branden Dawson from last season. In this game did you
see anything, the difficulties you had were similar or reminiscent to the
problems you had facing them last season? I know it's a different season,
different players.  
COACH BENNETT: Honestly, I'm not sure. I think he made some tough shots
against us last year. We tried to match-up Darion Atkins on him, our most
athletic, lively defender. Last year I think he had 24-10. He was timely,
that's the thing. He was timely. He probably impacted the game more
defensively this year than he did last year. Everything he did was timely at
the right times.  
  
Q. Tony, obviously you referred to being a little bit out of sorts
early?  
COACH BENNETT: Yeah.  
  
Q. What was the deal on that timeout where they were going to review it?
I thought you guys were thinking they would take a point off the board and
they added putting one on it. What happened there?  
COACH BENNETT: Nice call, right? He said both of them were 3s. They had those
in, they were checking them. We didn't call the timeout for them to check it,
we called the timeout to try to get ourselves going. But they reviewed both of
their 3-pointers. My staff said his foot was on the line on the second one at
the top of the key. Then they went back and saw it. They put the review in
before and both were 3s, so that was what it was.  
  
Q. Just when I asked the players, when you're getting the stops, it
seemed the first half you guys were playing good defense, you just couldn't
finish, after the initial run. How do you get them, if the defense isn't spark
being the offense, what next?  
COACH BENNETT: It's a challenge, we got some shots, we got some offensive
rebounds. We're not the greatest offensive team, we don't have tremendous
shooting, so that's why I said let's shift the ball. We decided to make a
concerted effort to pound it inside, we got a few things there. We got some
good looks, but when you're that cold, hard to beat a team like Michigan
State. You have to be able to, and again I think after the start our defense
rallied enough, except for a couple key possessions, but you have to be able
to make some plays. Trice made them for them, Dawson made them. We couldn't
get those. Again, there was a better effort in the second half to get it
moving and get it closer but that puts a lot of pressure on you.  
  
Q. You talked about Dawson, how he played great this year and last year.
How about Trice though, his development from last year to this year?  
COACH BENNETT: Good player. He has the ability to create shots, make shots.
When you can stretch the defense like that. He's complete, he can score at all
three levels. Off the drive, off the pull-up or deep 3s. It was a dagger 3,
the one he hit at the end of the shot clock. It looked like it was an NBA 3.
We should have known that, we saw it against Belmont most of the game but he
drilled one. And again, like Dawson, those two, they were the deal. Valentine,
I think their big three, we did a good job on Valentine, but didn't really do
the job we needed to do to be successful against Trice. And as poor as we shot
and all those things, we still had a chance, and we tried to hang in there
with it, but when you got a guy like Trice, making those plays down the
stretch, that's what makes you advance in this tournament.  
  
MODERATOR: Any other questions for Coach?  
  
Q. What was your main focus at halftime? Did you feel pretty good
considering you hadn't played that well?  
COACH BENNETT: Offensively we said let's shift them, let's get the ball moving
and really attack. We got a couple good looks and we said defensively let's
try to keep them off the glass, avoid the runouts. Do what we do. There's no
magic formula at that time, a couple a little adjustments here and there. We
went with Evan again at the four, try to move them that way so at least there
would be some spacing. I was hoping we could either knock done a shot or open
up the lane a little more for some drives, which we got. But it was stay in
there, stay in there. We have been in this spot. Ironically, I think about 17
of our 34 games we've been down at halftime. So as much as we struggled, it
was still a two possession game. But they had a quick burst and we fought
back. It was typical of a lot of our games but just not enough. Because
they're so tough-minded, they're so good defensively, every start like that
was costly, especially in this game.  
  
Q. What was it defensively that Michigan State did that really didn't
allow Brogdon and Anderson really to get going?  
COACH BENNETT: Again, they jammed the lane, they played a similar defense kind
of that we did. Some of it we just missed some shots but they were in position
and they made you earn. When we did get the open looks we didn't capitalize. A
couple times we probably forced and didn't screen it well enough or move it
well enough. But you are going to have to outlast them. That's how our game
was against them last year. We probably didn't have as quite the outside
attack as last year without Joe, but it's just a physical, hard game and
there's not a lot of easy stuff there and that was the case again, we knew
that.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the decision to start Justin Anderson today after
having him come off the bench in previous games?  
COACH BENNETT: I thought he showed. He did a good job. I was really worried
about the match-ups. Evan would have had to guard Valentine, and I thought --
and when we played NC State we put Justin on Anthony Barber, Cat Barber, and
he did a really good job spreading out. And I thought okay, London can really
move and try to bother Trice, which Trice just got off to that start and we
liked Malcolm on Valentine. So we thought the match-ups were good. How Justin
played, and that probably, I don't know if it would have made a difference if
Evan was out there or not but I thought it was time.  
  
Q. You played Michigan State two years in a row now, how would you
compare this team to last year's team looking forward?  
COACH BENNETT: Yeah, they're playing good ball. Last year with Harris and
Payne they had probably a couple more big playability guys that could just go
get stuff. I'm missing someone, who's the senior? Yeah, Harris and Payne,
Appling, yeah. They had guys with that experience but they understand who they
are, they're very clear. They go through, it's Dawson's team, it's Trice's
team, you can see that, and Valentine. Those guys have a ton of experience.
They're not quite as explosive offensively but very sound, very tough, know
where they've got to go to get stuff. I think that's a fair assessment. And
defensively, very good.

_CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  
MODERATOR: We're about to start with the San Diego State student-athletes.  
  
 Q. This is for Dwayne and J.J. Coach Fisher's had a lot of success
building the program with transfers and we know what you guys have meant to
the program. What has it meant to you guys to come play at San Diego State and
for Coach Fisher?  
J.J. O'BRIEN: It's meant a lot. He recruited me out of high school and I chose
to go to Utah and just to have the opportunity when I transferred to come back
here. It was a blessing so I'm very fortunate to him. Especially to be a part
of something that's growing and to be here during those first years of
success, starting with Kawhi and started before that, too. To be a part of
three consecutive tournament appearances for me has been amazing. So I'm
blessed to be a part of it.  
  
DWAYNE POLEE II: I just want to say you can't forget AQ because he's also a
fifth year as well. Just to see what Steve Fisher built from the ground up is
something special and just to be a part of it, six straight tournament
appearances doesn't come around very often so just to be a part of something
special is a great feeling.  
  
AQEEL QUINN: Let them know, DP. It's been a fun experience just to know that
we left a legacy once our time here is done. That's something that will last
for ever. I mean, when we come back and we look up in the rafters and we see
banners and we know we're a part of that. It's just been a blessing, man, to
be a part of this and what a special group of guys and us three seniors, it
just means a lot.  
  
 Q. Can you take us through the last 48 hours and maybe tell us where
you ate so we won't go there?  
AQEEL QUINN: For lunch the day before yesterday, I had a turkey sandwich.
Right after that my stomach just, it was not feeling well. We came to the
shoot-around, I didn't feel good in shoot-around at all. I told Tom, I'm like,
I can't -- this is not right. So when I got back, started vomiting, got IVs
that whole night until like 3:00, 4:00 in the morning. Woke up, got another
IV. Didn't eat all day. Then came to the game. Tried to give it everything I
had, but then that second half it just wasn't right, so I told them I can't go
no more. And then last night I had another IV and we here now.  
  
 Q. Are you okay now?  
AQEEL QUINN: Pretty solid now.  
  
 Q. This is for all you guys. Coach Fisher turns 70 on Tuesday, don't
tell him I told you that, but he's very animated on the sidelines to this day,
always has been. Does he bring that energy all the time, is he always like
that in practice and everything?  
DWAYNE POLEE II: Yeah, he brings that energy every day in practice. Defensive
sliding, he'll be doing stretches with us, he's just really uplifting, he
brings a lot of energy to practice every day.  
  
J.J. O'BRIEN: Yeah, it's funny because when he wants you to do something, he's
going to act it out for you, so before he tells you what to do, he's acting
out himself, he's moving his feet real quick and everything. He moves pretty
well for a 70 year old man, I must say.  
  
 Q. On defense or offense?  
J.J. O'BRIEN: On defense, he does that a lot on defense.  
  
SKYLAR SPENCER: He's got a good stance on defense.  
  
J.J. O'BRIEN: How to get the hands up and cover the drive, so he's pretty
active.  
  
SKYLAR SPENCER: He's always animated and involved in our practices. He let's
the assistant coaches do their thing but he make sure he always puts his
input, he is never just going by quietly. You always hear him doing something.  
  
 Q. AQ -- he gave me permission to call him AQ.  
AQEEL QUINN: DP said the stretching part is the funniest to me. When we're
doing our stretching, when he's like just mimicking what we do, that's the
best part of practice to me the whole time. It's a good sight to see. It's
pretty funny to watch him. If you guys come out to practice right now, you'll
probably catch him doing a couple stretches.  
  
 Q. You for some of the bigs here, I guess Skylar especially and Dwayne,
you guys have great length, height and all that, but Okafor obviously is a
presence, a monster inside. How have you guys defended this season someone
who's got that kind of physical size?  
SKYLAR SPENCER: You have to control the paint. You can't let them overbear
you, take control of them. You have to always be aware, stay connected because
when you playing against a good big man, you rest for one second they can
catch you slipping, and that's an automatic 2 points, so I just have to be on
my toes and stay aware the whole time.  
  
 Q. J.J., I'll start with you, you talk about being special, about being
a part of this growing. A victory over Duke, what would that do for the legacy
that you're building?  
J.J. O'BRIEN: It would do a lot. Probably the most behind or close to the win
at Kansas, just program building wins that tell a lot about what kind of teams
we have, especially in the tournament to make it to the Sweet 16, that would
be huge. Coach Fisher had battles with Duke back in his Michigan days and
we're fortunate enough now to be a part of that year at San Diego State. It's
a big opportunity, man. They've got a great history, and to get a win would
mean a lot to our program.  
  
 Q. J.J., a question, you guys talked about hanging banners a little
earlier and obviously Sky's the only guy that's coming back next year but
earlier Coach Krzyzewski was talking about Marshall Plumlee and how big guys
maybe develop a little bit later than perimeter guys. I'm just wondering if
you three seniors could talk about Sky's development and him being one of the
guys to kind of carry that banner again next year?  
J.J. O'BRIEN: Sky came in with a natural ability to block shots, but he's
grown so much in that area just with his timing, his ability to block shots
without fouling, and also with his ability to alter shots. With his defensive
positioning, sometimes he doesn't even have to block a shot, helping outside
the lane, helping on pick and rolls, not letting the guard get by him so
defensively he's going in that area a lot. And offensively, I think a lot of
people have seen this year, he's had great post moves this year, he does a
good job catching and finishing, so overall I think he has grown a lot, and
just his maturity overall. He does everything right on the floor. There's few
times you're going to catch him not doing the right thing. He's very mature
about how he goes about playing defense, offense and just being a leader.  
  
AQEEL QUINN: I think Skylar, from the first year it was just blocking and then
he was like carrying minutes with DeShawn Stephens, and then last year he
played a lot, started. He was vocal on defense but he was there with shot
blocking. But now this year, what I've loved like more than anything is his
communication on the defensive end. We can actually hear him now, like years
previously we were like can you talk louder please so we can hear you. Now
he's like the main one screaming and yelling back there and it's so much
easier when you know he's back there and which way to jump on ball screens and
stuff like that. I just think the communication barrier is at an all-time high
right now, and I love it.  
  
DWAYNE POLEE II: Aside from the defense, I think Sky's grown a lot
offensively. I think that just gives us one more weapon, having Sky down low
to finish around the basket and grab offensive rebounds and just give us an
added weapon.  
  
 Q. This is for J.J. Since you brought up the Michigan days, what do
guys now, it's been a long time since the days of the Fab Five and Coach
Fisher playing Coach K's team in the championship game, what do guys know
about it, and do you guys ask questions about those days?  
J.J. O'BRIEN: We don't ask too many questions about it, but I think we all
know a lot about it. I mean, they had the whole documentary on it. They just
had the documentary on Christian Laettner the other day. It's in history and
if you're a basketball guy you know about it, just their battles, them
starting five freshmen and playing against them in the National Championship
game, so many opportunities that they played against them. We know a lot about
it but we don't speak too much about it.  
  
 Q. Maybe for AQ and J.J., is this a little bit similar to a couple
years ago when you guys played against McDonald's All-American five-star guys
and you guys really, I don't want to say, chip on your shoulder but you went
in there being not highly rated guys and kind of wanted to show the world
something is this a similar situation, I mean they have nine McDonald's All-
Americans and both of you guys weren't really highly recruited out of high
school and now you have a chance to play on the same floor with them?  
AQEEL QUINN: Are you talking about Jamal Jeter at the Hunter Center when we
played UCLA? That year it was pretty much the same. Like you said, Jamal Jeter
was the anchor of that team. You know Jamal Jeter's fiery and he plays with a
lot of passion. I think this year they do have a lot of McDonald All-Americans
and I think a lot of people in our locker room had developed as far as the
older guys and we have a couple young highly rated recruits that came in as
well. But we do have a lot of passion and heart. The experience will help us,
and we definitely are looking forward to this opportunity. As you said, we do
have a chip on our shoulder being San Diego State and we had to hold up that
mantra.  
  
J.J. O'BRIEN: Yeah, like he said, I think we're more now on the upswing of
getting more highly touted recruits with the freshman class that we had but we
don't compare with five as far as like they do right now. I mean, when we
tossed the basketball up, your starts don't really matter. I mean they're
proven great players, they're No. 1 seed but in the game we've just got to
worry about playing basketball. So it is a similar situation, but we just want
to win and move onto the next round. Five stars and McDonald's All-Americans
aren't really something we need to worry about. We just need to worry about
them as great players and do what we do as great players.  
  
MODERATOR: Any other questions? Thanks, guys. We're ready to begin with Coach
Fisher. Questions.  
  
 Q. Can we go back to December 2001 when you took the team back to
Cameron Indoor Stadium and how much when you're building that program, how
much that exposure meant to building the program, where it is now?  
COACH FISHER: We don't take bye games and that was a situation where the
longer I held out, the more money they offered us to go. I tried like the
Dickens to get Mike to give me a home and home and couldn't get that done, but
we robbed a bank to go there and we played well. We played well. We had Randy
Holcomb on that club and wound up going to the NCAA Tournament ourselves that
year and it was a great experience for us, for our kids, for the program, a
nationally televised game that was helpful in starting the growth of the
program.  
  
 Q. You're coming up on your 70th birthday. How have you been able to
maintain the fire that it takes to be able to maintain the kind of success you
have been able to build in college basketball?  
COACH FISHER: I don't feel 70, and I look in the mirror and I know I'm
approaching 70. If you do something you love to do, and I've said this before,
my dad was my first coach. That's all he wanted to do. A wife, four kids,
World War II, he did everything but student teach. I saw his passion for
coaching our little league team, and he told me, do something that you love to
do. Don't do something for money, do something you have a passion for and
opportunities and good things will happen.  
  
 Q. You talked about that being a great experience against Duke in 2001.
Can you talk about how far you've come? Now here you are, six straight
tournaments, you're playing them in the Round of 32, measuring up against one
of the blue bloods, one of the greats.  
COACH FISHER: Well, there's no question that Duke is one of the elite, and
that's where most of it, and I'm not demeaning us, aspire to get. They're less
than a handful that you could say that are at that level. We have a great
opportunity. We're here, we think we can win, and probably most people in the
country will not think that could happen but we're coming in to play and play
as hard as we can if we make shots. You know, you've followed us, underline
if. We're as good as most people in the country. We guard efficiently, we
guard collectively, and last night when we had open shots, we made them. We
need to do the same when we play Duke on Sunday.  
  
 Q. What would it do for the program as you talk about, you've built a
program; not a good team. You've built a program. What would it do in terms of
the next step beating Duke in the Round of 32, and also just to even be here
and no one thought you were going to go to Duke and win. There will be some
people that think you can beat this team tomorrow, that's where you guys have
come to.  
COACH FISHER: We've never been beyond the Sweet 16. I said that last year when
we lost to Arizona. San Diego State will eventually sometime, maybe not in my
lifetime, but we will have a team that will get to the Final Four, have a
chance to win a National Championship. To say that, now people don't laugh
when you say that so that's a neat feeling. A year ago when we went in to
Kansas and Allen Fieldhouse and won there, I know a lot of people said they
didn't win at Kansas, they couldn't do that. But we did. So we want to
continue to grow who we are, and this would be a huge opportunity to do that
in front of the whole world. I think we're the only game that's going to be on
when we play on Sunday and we'll have a lot of eyeballs on it and our goal and
hope is to play well and win.  
  
 Q. Steve, Coach Krzyzewski earlier was talking about Marshall Plumlee
and the development of big guys that usually comes later than perimeter guys.
I just wondered if you might speak to the development of Skylar Spencer and if
it's been easy for him to be overlooked in the mix of everything that's
happened.  
COACH FISHER: Skylar Spencer knows who he is. His signature is he's defender,
shot blocker, protects the rim. He has worked tremendously hard to grow an
offensive game. Last night he had some really, really good baskets for us
versus St. John's. We need for him to have confidence in his offense, but we
need to be -- need to have him as our Rock of Gibraltar defensively. He's a
terrific young guy that doesn't care if he doesn't get a lot of touches. But
he has to have the ability to draw a defender on him. They can't just walk
away from him, say he can't or won't score.  
  
 Q. Steve, how would you compare what you've done at San Diego State to
what you did at Michigan, and how have you built this program basically out of
nothing to what it is today?  
COACH FISHER: What happened in my first stop doesn't happen, and it happened
to me. It happened at a blue blood program, one that sometimes people say you
win because you're there and sometimes people are saying that about Duke now.
It's Duke, they're supposed to win. At San Diego State, we reenergized a
dormant program and took a program that had not had recent success and one
step, one block, one coffee shop to the 300 at the National Kiwanis meeting,
we drew an audience and we grew it because we got some players who helped us
win. And now we have one of the better programs not only on the west coast but
in the country and we're very proud of that. Four straight years, we've sold
the building out before the season began, we had won 29 straight at home
before we dropped one to Boise State. So we've worked hard at it. Been a lot
of people that have worked hard at it. It's been a community affair that has
allowed it to happen. The nice thing is, we still see an upward tic in trend
and I like that, too.  
  
 Q. Do you feel like you're not known for being this architect at San
Diego State or do you think people still know you as the coach of the Fab
Five?  
COACH FISHER: I would say probably that depends on your audience, on who
you're talking to. I walked into the hotel here where we're staying and people
looked at me and looked at me and, do I know you? Oh, yeah, I know you. Those
are the guys that remember me from yesterday. I went to the Final Four the
last two years, and they all know me as San Diego State coach now. I like the
fact that now when I go to the current people that are involved and they say
San Diego State when they point at me.  
  
 Q. Coach Krzyzewski described you as a friend. I'm curious how much
interaction you've had with him in the coaching circles over the years, away
from the court obviously?  
COACH FISHER: You know, it's a small fraternity relatively speaking and there
are no secrets. We all go to the same places to watch the same groups of kids,
these AAU programs. Mike has always been a guy, and I have great respect for
him as a basketball coach obviously, but the way he interacts with people is
something that everyone should take a look at and say that's how it's supposed
to be. So often you get a head coach that walks right by the assistants and up
to sit either by himself or with other head coaches. Mike has always gone out
of his way to shake hands, to sit and talk long before I became a head coach.
Got great respect for him. So I've known him for a long time. Our wives have
known one another through various functions and I call him a friend. I think I
said this outside, when I got the job at San Diego State, and I got a telegram
from Mike Krzyzewski, welcome back. People don't do that. He does it.  
  
 Q. It's been 23 years, I guess, since the national title game, the one
time you guys were in an NCAA Tournament game against each other. It's not
very often that coaches go 20 years, have the longevity to be around two of
them and have that happen. Is there going to be any special feeling going
against him all these years later after doing it once before?  
COACH FISHER: The excitement for me is we're playing, we're playing in the
NCAA Tournament, we won a game, we're in the Round of 32, we're playing a
great, great program but we'll be worrying about the players on the floor.
Mike is the architect and I think I would probably lose 10-9 in a game against
him, but he's not going to be playing, nor will I. But he's got a terrific
team and we're just happy that we're still playing and our happiness wants to
be still playing after the game.  
  
 Q. Rick Pitino was on the radio a few days ago, didn't like the one-
and-done, wants to see that eliminated. You've done it all different ways. Do
you like the one-and-done, do you think it should change and do you think it
will change at some point?  
COACH FISHER: I like the way it was before the one-and-done. I think if you're
talented enough and somebody's coming and saying we want you and we will pay
you millions to have you, they should be allowed to do it. I think -- I've
coached kids, we had a young player named Jerod Ward. If you're a junkie, you
know that name. Clinton, Mississippi. Came to us, who's better, Jerod Ward or
Felipe Lopez. Tore his ACL twice. Had he had the opportunity, he would have
gone to the NBA out of high school. I don't know how long he would have
played, but he would have had quite a bit of money. And I've said this before.
Nobody bats an eyeball when a 16 year old turns pro in tennis or other sports.
So there's value to be gotten obviously from going to college, but I don't
think you should say you have to stay X number of years if you're talented
enough.  
  
 Q. You talked about you guys need to make shots to win, I guess that's
pretty standard. But one guy didn't make shots last night, Win Shepard, he
contributes in other ways obviously. What has his growth been as a player
during his time there, where his emotions are a little different now as a
freshman when he's not having a great shooting night?  
COACH FISHER: When Winston Shepard signed with San Diego State, he was the
highest ranked player we had. With that came the pressure of expectations. He
played terrific as a freshman but people expected more. Started every game as
a sophomore, people expected more. He is our leading rebounder, he's our best
passer, he's one of our smartest players, he knows what to do and he's to the
point now where he's not worried about what others are thinking, and he's
playing to win, made great progress, and he is a huge piece to what we've done
over his three years to have the success that we've had. Winston's done a
great job for San Diego State.  
  
 Q. Steve, your first handful of years, how hard was it to attract top
players?  
COACH FISHER: Early on? When I took the job I heard from a lot of high school
coaches, and one, I tell this story. He said, I've got a player you need to
look at. He's not good enough to play for Rick Majerus, but I know he can play
for you. I said the last time I looked I'm in the league with Rick Majerus,
and I need guys that can play for Rick as well as me. I made a home visit with
Tyson Chandler my first year. Went pro right out of high school. We were
unafraid to go talk to people. The audience I got early on, they wanted me to
sign the Fab Five book. So we got audiences with people, some just wanted to
see who we were. Some of those guys went someplace else and we got some
bounce-backs early on. So we were unafraid to knock on doors but we said we
have to grow our program a certain way. Junior college transfers, four-year
college transfers and good high school players. This past year we signed four
high school players and it was the highest rated class we've had. We will
still take, like everybody does, like Duke, like Carolina, like Michigan
State, a transfer who can fit a niche and help you. So we now attract, we get
in the doors easier now. We've been smart to go into doors we thought we could
have an opportunity on, but I use the phrase, we don't have to get on kneepads
to get into your home to recruit your son and I like that.  
  
MODERATOR: Okay, thank you, Coach.

_CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  
MODERATOR: We are set to begin with the student-athletes from Michigan State.  
  
 Q. Branden, tell me what you remember from last year's Sweet 16 match-
up with Virginia when you had 24 and 10?  
BRANDEN DAWSON: Virginia's a great team. Last year was definitely a well-
fought game by both teams, but you know, they play hard, that's the main thing
they're going to do. They're great defensively, they're a disciplined team.
They don't make many mistakes and last year it was just a great game from both
teams.  
  
 Q. For Travis and/or Branden, could you talk about when Colby just
showed up way back when you guys were freshmen and how far he's come as part
of the program?  
TRAVIS TRICE: Colby since day one has fit in with our group. He is a great
asset to our team, you've seen lately he's been playing a lot and even
throughout this year he has really stepped up and played in some big games,
but he's just a great guy. He adds a different dynamic to our locker room and
he's always cracking jokes at everybody. Half the time we don't understand
what he's saying.  
  
BRANDEN DAWSON: Just like Travis stated before, Colby's been a huge impact
from our team since the first day he arrived. On the scout team we have a kid
named Eron Harris and those guys, they do a great job on the scout team. It's
funny because Colby and I, we're always getting into it in practice, we're
always just going at each other because he's always trying to score me, I'm
always trying to score him. He's been great since the first time he came.  
  
 Q. Question for both Travis and Branden. When you guys came here you
knew the situation with everybody who had played for Tom Izzo had been to one
Final Four. Obviously last year's class didn't. Can you talk a little bit
about the sense of urgency for you guys right now and how you want to keep
your season alive and what things do you have to do to keep your season
alive?  
TRAVIS TRICE: Definitely last year hurt, especially being so close, being in
the Elite Eight game, we felt like we were four minutes of making it to the
Final Four and keeping the streak alive. We feel like that is just added to
this year, we want to start that streak back up again and start our own. Both
of us, that was the reason why we came here to go to Final Fours and play in
championship games.  
  
BRANDEN DAWSON: Yes, I would definitely agree with Travis. Just for the senior
group not being able to make it to the Final Four last year, that's just for
motivation for us, for us to get back to another one as far as myself and
Travis, so I think from watching last year and learning what we did, what we
did wrong in the Elite Eight game, it just carries over to tomorrow's game and
the rest of the tournament.  
  
 Q. For all the players, what are some of the keys to attacking the pack
line defense and what has been kind of the focus point of your preparation
here the last 12 hours, I guess?  
DENZEL VALENTINE: Yeah, we just got to be solid on everything and be sharp
with all our cuts and everything. I think if we do what we do on offense and
we're sharp, we'll be fine.  
  
BRANDEN DAWSON: Yes, I think we just have to make just the simple play. We
just have to stay dialed in on our offense. We can't have too many mistakes
against a well defensive team like Virginia, so I think if we play solid, we
listen to coach game plan, I think we be okay.  
  
TRAVIS TRICE: I think we're going to shoot well. Virginia does a really good
job of really packing it in, like you said, and also their length helps them.
They start off 6'1, and after that they're 6'5 and up so I think the driving
kicks are going to be there, we're just going to play smart and not turn the
ball over.  
  
 Q. Travis and Denzel, this is likely to be a road environment in some
ways, it's close to Virginia. You guys dealt with that against Wisconsin, and
you guys played really well on the road this year dating back to Iowa, what
creates that dynamic? Why does that work so well for you guys this year, even
sometimes better than at home?  
DENZEL VALENTINE: Just because we just have the us against the world type of
mentality. We have to pull together and it's going to be tough, but at the end
of the day we're good enough players and we're close enough that when it gets
tough and when there's adversity we just band together. We can do this, we've
been play -- we played all the top teams in the country either at home or on
the road or at a neutral spot, so it's new because it's the NCAA Tournament,
but we've been here before.  
  
TRAVIS TRICE: What was the question again? Oh, road games. Yeah, I feel like
we play a lot better on the road, kind of like what Denzel said, we feel like
it's us against the world. You kind of take out all the distractions of family
tickets, friends trying to come to the game and all that. You just really bear
down and focus in, and that's when you really rely on your teammates.  
  
 Q. For Travis and Branden, could you just talk about your decision to
come here together and the roads you traveled after playing AAU ball and
everything and how it's gone for you so far?  
BRANDEN DAWSON: Well, it's ironic because when I made my decision and a couple
days after I made my decision I found out that Travis had committed, too. So
from playing AAU together since the 7th grade, it was great. He's like my
brother. We've been roommates since my freshman year, so it's been great. So
just playing along with Travis has been quite a long journey, it's been fun.  
  
TRAVIS TRICE: Definitely like BJ said, we're like brothers. It was a great day
when I found out he had committed here, too, that way I knew I would have
somebody I would be going through this with. And to be honest with you, it
wouldn't be the same if I hadn't been here without BJ, dude's like my brother
so I'm grateful we both got to come here.  
  
 Q. This is for all the guys, how much do you figure the games you guys
had against Wisconsin kind of prepares you for facing Virginia, seeing as how
they have similar styles?  
DENZEL VALENTINE: Yeah, they're a similar pace team and they've got kind of
the similar players but Virginia's a little bit more athletic and a little bit
more physical. We're just going to have to just go out there and just play our
game and be simple, make simple passes and not turn the ball over and I think
we'll be fine.  
  
BRANDEN DAWSON: Yeah, as I stated before, Virginia's a well-disciplined team
and just to compare them to Wisconsin, both teams are disciplined teams.
They're going -- the key fact that Coach pointed out to us, he said Virginia's
going to make you play defense for 35 seconds and that's what we're going to
have to stay dialed in because the minute you relax and the minute you turn
your head or something or you going to get beat by anything, a shot or back
door, so we have to stay dialed in and I think just stay poised.  
  
TRAVIS TRICE: I think both teams are very similar. I feel like Wisconsin kind
of spread you out more with the more shooters and kind of stretches it out
where Virginia is more of an inside team, but they run their stuff really
well, which causes problems where they might run their offense for 30 seconds
and then you fall asleep at the last second and they get a layup. So our thing
is we've just got to stay disciplined and stay locked in.  
  
 Q. Branden, last year you talk about defense but you guys held
Virginia, I think, 35 percent shooting last year to win. What did you do
defensively? And also do you feel like this Virginia team's going to come in
with a chip on their shoulder having lost to you guys and kind of increased
importance to be ready for this one?  
BRANDEN DAWSON: Yeah, I think they're definitely going to come in with a chip
on their shoulder. I know for a fact that they didn't forget about the game
last year. Last year, we had a good defensive team last year, we had Adreian
Payne, we had Gary, had Keith and as far as this team we have younger players.
So this year they're definitely going to come in ready to play, they're going
to come ready to play and they're going to definitely have a chip on their
shoulder so we're going to have to come ready to play and just be dialed in.  
  
 Q. Travis, the Virginia players said this week, they're pretty honest,
they said they noticed right away that there was a potential second round
match-up with Michigan State. They haven't really emphasized the revenge part
of it, but was that something you guys picked up on right away, that there's a
potential second round match-up with UVA or didn't look past the first one?  
TRAVIS TRICE: To be honest with you, at Michigan State we try to take it just
one game at a time. You can see throughout this tournament, if you start over
looking games you can get upset and we don't want to be one of those teams so
we just take it one game at a time but we know, it's definitely got to be a
revenge factor for them. It would be the same thing for us if a team put us
out last year.  
  
 Q. Did you notice it right away in the brackets?  
TRAVIS TRICE: Oh, yeah, you're obviously going to look in your section and
your part of the bracket, but our first concern was Georgia.  
  
 Q. This is for Denzel and if you guys want to answer and chime in, too.
Given Tom Izzo's history in this tournament, how well his teams have done,
does that give you guys any kind of -- is there kind of a mental bounce that
comes with it when March comes around that's maybe just really just a
psychological effect but it's not really anything that has changed, just kind
of knowing that his game plays good in March?  
DENZEL VALENTINE: Yeah, whenever you see Michigan State or whenever you think
about Michigan State history, you think about what have they done in March.
You go in the gym and there's all these banners, Final Four banners, Big Ten
championship banners. At Michigan State, we kind of expect to play good and
expect to win here. That being said, with Virginia coming in, we put them out
last year so they're going to have a championship on their shoulder and
they're going to be ready to play so we've just got to particular to our
principles and just know that we're Michigan State but also we've got to play
how we play and I think we'll be fine.  
  
 Q. What is it about Coach Izzo that makes him effective in tournament
settings, and quick turnarounds? Do you guys pick up on something about him
that makes him so kind uniquely successful?  
TRAVIS TRICE: I think our entire coaching staff deserves a lot of credit, and
our managers because they do such a good job of breaking down other teams and
film work. As far as preparing us for March and the tournament, I believe it's
a whole year thing. It's not like March comes around and we flip on a switch,
it starts with our first practices and our first games. We're not afraid to
play anybody anywhere and I think that shows. A couple times early on in the
season we might take a loss somewhere, and people will look down on us, but we
know it's only preparing us for this.  
  
BRANDEN DAWSON: Yes, I would definitely agree with Travis. Coach, he's been
through this plenty of times, so he know what to expect and he told us playing
Georgia yesterday, he said the first game is always going to be the toughest
game, we have to just get prepared. But around this time our coaches, our
managers, they do a great job of just getting us prepared, watching film,
waking up, early walk-thru's and everything. So Coach, he just wants to win,
that's main focus or us and for the program.  
  
 Q. What are your three thoughts about facing a No. 2 seed at this stage
of the tournament as opposed to maybe later, a bigger obstacle to advance, so
to speak?  
DENZEL VALENTINE: Yeah, you know, it's tough, we're in the third round and
we're already playing a 2 seed, a great team like Virginia, but it is what it
is. The tournament was set up like this for a reason and we're not, like
Travis said, we're not scared to play anybody at any time, to we're just
coming in with the mindset that we can win this game if we do what we do and
we're solid, so I think we'll be fine.  
  
BRANDEN DAWSON: Yeah, from the question earlier, from looking at our bracket,
we kind of had in our mind we were going to play Virginia, but like Travis
said, we just had to focus on Georgia. But this is what this tournament's
about, this is March and you're going to go up against any good team at this
point. So like these guys said before, we're ready to play anyone at this
point, this is what this tournament's about.  
  
TRAVIS TRICE: Like they said, it is what it is. If we didn't play them now we
would probably have to play them later on. Like we said, we're not scared to
play anybody. We're ready to play, Virginia's a great team, we're just
prepared to play.  
  
MODERATOR: Any other questions? Questions for Coach Izzo?  
  
 Q. Tom, could you talk a little bit about what you saw yesterday?
Especially talk about the second half with B.J. but throughout the game with
B.J. and Travis and where their sense of urgency is right now with the end of
their careers in sight?  
COACH IZZO: Well, I know Travis is off the charts. Every minute is important
to him. B.J. doesn't always show that as much, but I thought he was very
focused, when the game started, everybody handles that kind of excitement
differently. B.J., we talked to him about the pump fake, he went for the first
one and gets his second foul. So he had, what, 14 or 16 and 6 day but it was
all in the second half. He didn't score at all in the first and didn't play
many minutes. I think that's one of the big keys, we've got to keep B.J. in
the game and there's no question in B.J. and Trav, those guys have played on
an aircraft carrier, played in Germany, played in Sweet 16, Elite Eight games,
they've played in championship games and Big Ten tournament and Big Ten
conference. They're pretty well-schooled and those are the guys you rely on at
this time of year.  
  
 Q. So much is made this time of year of your success in tournaments and
in March and I'm curious as you go back to maybe earlier in your career, are
there things you have learned, sort of key lessons of how you get a team
ready, especially a second game in a setting like this?  
COACH IZZO: You know, I think in the second game turnarounds, I've got to give
credit to my best friend in the world, Steve Mariucci. Football looks at
things in video and film in a kind of a different way, especially 18 years
ago, I think they were far ahead of where basketball was at that time. I used
to go to as many camps and when he was at San Francisco, I would learn some
things there about different ways I wanted to prepare and kind of put my own
thing together there. We do things in 15 and 20 minute intervals, after a game
before breakfast, after breakfast, before lunch, after lunch. Trying to keep
the focus, which is very hard to do at this time of year, there's parents and
families on the hotel, there's games on TV, there's upsets happening, and I
know the attention span isn't as good when you're fatigued and tired. So we've
gone with this model. And then I stole from a lot of good coaches, Mike
Krzyzewski, stole some things from him on learning how to win the weekend,
that you do have to prepare once your program gets to a certain level. As I
told our media, the first year I just, I was so happy to win a game I didn't
care about the rest of the tournament. I thought I won the National
Championship and someone reminded me we won one game, but that's how it was
early. Once we got to a Final Four, you realize you go to win the weekend. You
have to prepare that way, you have to make sure your players understand that
it's one game at a time, but you're in a place where if we don't win two games
and come back successful, it's not as good. I've stolen from a lot of
different people. I haven't come up with some diabolical plan, most of my
plans have been stolen from other people.  
  
 Q. Talk about playing Virginia so soon after meeting them last year and
that jump out at you as soon as you saw the bracket?  
COACH IZZO: Well, so soon; it's a year. That seems like a long time to me.
I've known Tony since he was a player, I've known his dad, I knew his uncle.
When I was a Division II guy. I just have always had the utmost respect. I've
been a fan of his and what he's accomplished and then watching what he's done
at Virginia, we played against them when I was an assistant when he was at
Green Bay, I watched what he did at Washington State and played against his
dad four times the year we won the National Championship. I mean, that should
be illegal to play against Dick that many times in a year because they're so
difficult to play against. What Tony has done is he stole some things, too,
I'm sure from his dad, from other people, but he's added his only little part.
I think offensively they're different, they run some great stuff. They're
disciplined but yet they can get out and go a little bit. I still think, first
thing I thought about when we got him again is why, you know, and then I
realized my AD is on the selection committee, so I was mad at him. But the
second thing was where is Anderson at because I don't think there's any
question this is a very good team, but they lost two very good players last
year, very good players, and we lost some good players, too. But Anderson, if
you watch him before he got hurt, I think was playing at a whole other level.
The other night I'm sure was reassuring to Tony that at least he's coming
back. The tournament, he didn't look as good but he looked a lot better the
other night and I know what that's like because we had Payne and Dawson last
year missed eight and nine games at the end of the year and then getting them
back is a whole another story. But great respect, I guess, would be the first
thing; appreciation for how hard his teams play and how solid they are.
They're about as mistake-free as a team on both ends of the court offensively
and defensively, you're going to earn your keep when you play them. He said
something to me last year, it was a war last year and I remember him walking
by and saying that's the way the game should be played, and you know what, I
felt the same way. It was a dogfight right to the end and I think both teams
played hard as well and hopefully it will be the same tomorrow.  
  
 Q. Kind of along those same lines, what do you remember from that back-
and-forth contest in last years Sweet 16 between Michigan State and
Virginia?  
COACH IZZO: One thing that makes me sad, Adreian Payne was pretty good and
he's gone. One thing makes me happy, Branden Dawson might have had the best
game of his career. He was very good. He made a lot of shots and he did a lot
of things but a couple of my best players struggled in that game. Keith
Appling, who had been hurt, struggled, but Gary Harris had a pretty good game
defensively but it was a little harder offensively. So I don't know, every
game's a new game, everybody reacts differently. It all comes down to the
match-ups and how you match up. My biggest concern is how we match up with the
size of their perimeter people more than their inside people. Their inside
people are strong and athletic and good, but their perimeter people, not only
in height but in girth, they're big, they're big. We're not as big there, so
I've got to figure out a way to, I don't know, work around that.  
  
 Q. Tom, this is likely to be a road atmosphere, you faced that against
Wisconsin in the Big Ten tournament. All year the personality of this team has
done well in that setting. Travis Trice's shooting numbers are significantly
better away. What is the personality of this team that's allowed that to
transpire?  
COACH IZZO: I don't know, we played Virginia and New York last year, which
wasn't a home game for us. Then we played UConn there. We have had good
practice in the NCAA tournament last few years. I do think when you're a
close-knit team and everybody gets along so well. We as a coaching staff, in
our video room here at the hotel and usually a lot of teams they eat and if
there's nothing there they're back off to their rooms. It will be a half hour
later and those guys are sitting there talking and doing things. It's an
unusually close group, 1 to 13. They all sit there and talk and laugh. I think
that's very positive and I think that's what being on the road does, it gives
you a sense of camaraderie and you kind of have an appreciation for a guy more
than just as a basketball player.  
  
 Q. Coach, I think a lot of people would say that you and Tony both
built the programs that you've built the right way. What does the right way
mean to you and what are some of the similarities between your program and the
one that Tony's trying to build?  
COACH IZZO: Well, I think No. 1, we both have incredible universities. I mean,
Judd Heathcote was very, very important to me and we had done a lot there. It
was a different era. When Magic came into our film room today and talked to
our team, there were some things that happened in the past, so when I say we
built it up recently, there was some things there, and this other guy from
Virginia named Sampson or something like that that was pretty good at
Virginia. So there were good perhaps there and solid and I think good
institutions, but I think part of our success has been president, AD, right on
down the list. We've really been solid there, especially in the last 10 years.
I think that's helped. But doing it the right way means we're just blue collar
guys. I know where Tony's from, he knows where I'm from. We're not far apart.
We're from places, I was a Division II guy, he was a Division I guy that was a
Division II school not many years before that. We kind of both came up as
being mentored by people that were very disciplined. Dick Bennett, Judd
Heathcote, we couldn't ask for better mentors. So I think that all helps.
We're not loaded with McDonald's All-Americans and things like some places but
we get good people who buy into what we want to do and I just marvel at the
job he's done in getting it back as quick as he's gotten it back. I have a lot
of respect for it and Tony's one of the guys in the profession that I would go
against recruiting every day because I know it would be up and up and he would
do a good job and there wouldn't be anybody ripping anybody, it would be fair
and that's the way I look at Tony Bennett. Great family, but a great guy
himself.  
  
 Q. Coach, I'm sure you've been in this situation before where you've
beaten a team in a tournament and you're going to play them again and there's
that chip on the shoulder that they're going to have coming in. What do you
say to your players in terms of mentally preparing for a team that's going to
come out with a little chip on their shoulder?  
COACH IZZO: Well, I don't know, I've got a chip on my shoulder every time I
play Duke, it sure as hell hasn't helped. You can look at that one of two
ways. I think for the most part any team that's missed as many free throws and
lost close games, we had a chip on our shoulder, too, but those things are all
great. If there's a lack of respect, if one school's talking junk about the
other school and all that, but you're not going to find that with these two
programs. Sure, they would have liked to have advanced last year, but kind of
like they went through a little bit this year, we had two key people out a lot
of games and we have been a higher seed and maybe there wouldn't have been
that match-up. I think, let's face it, they were a 1 seed 90 percent of the
year. So I think both programs know where each other's at and I don't know
what I would say to my players, you know. I don't think the pregame speech
will be, by the way, they've got a chip on their shoulder, and that wasn't
meant disrespectfully. But you get to this time of year, if you don't have a
chip on your shoulder, there's something wrong with you because my chip would
be if we won the National Championship, nobody's gone back-to-back, there's a
chip on your shoulder about that. If you haven't -- we got a little chip, we
thought we were a Final Four team, it broke a hell of a string for us last
year. This class last year was the first one that didn't go to a Final Four of
seniors. So I think Trice and Dawson and Valentine have a little chip, too.
But chip on your shoulder works more if you don't respect who you're playing
than it does if you do respect them. Good question but I don't have a good
answer for you.  
  
 Q. Rick Pitino was on the Dan Patrick show a few days ago talking about
that one and done rule, he doesn't like it, this is it should be changed. If
you could change that rule, would you, and how would you and do you think at
some point ultimately it will be changed?  
COACH IZZO: You know, I'm on a million different boards and I've been on
boards with the NBA and talking to them. No. 1, as we all know, it's
completely out of our hands. That's No. 1. Number 2, I get condemned for
acting -- if I could have five one and done guys tomorrow, I would take them,
okay? My biggest worry is what's happening to these guys. Like everything else
in the world, smoking cigarettes was cool, then after research of years and
years and years, it develops lung cancer. So we change our thoughts. We have
not researched where a large majority of these guys that come out early, one
year I think there were 70 some that came out, there's only 30 first round
picks and there's only 60 picks so that doesn't include -- so somebody's
getting fed a bunch of baloney. Especially for me at this point, I've had a
million chances to do a million things, it's not like I'm living every day --
if we get a guy back, I'm happy. If he goes to the pros, I'm even happier
because that will help my recruiting, sad as that is to say, more than winning
a National Championship, but I'm more worried about what happens to the kids
and I think everybody outside thinks it's the coach that's holding him back.
Some day, 10 years from now, there's going to be a study of how many kids came
out and ended up on the streets. That's the crime of this whole thing. There
is nothing wrong with being an apprentice. There is nothing wrong with being a
graduate assistant working your way up that way. In fact, there's some good
things for it. You know what, my buddy Mariucci and I, every time we get
together, the first thing we say is we both made a lot of money, we've had a
lot of success in different areas. God, I would die to go back to college. You
know, I really would, too. I think like a lot of my former players that are in
the NBA, it's a job. It's a nice job, but it's a job. College isn't a job and
I think so many kids are missing out. So I would take a completely different
approach, not what's best for the NBA, not what's best for the college, what
truly is best for the kid and how can we work around it. Is it the baseball
rule so LeBron can come out and the other guy has to go. I also worry that so
many of these kids go to school and they never get to enjoy it -- every shot
that's missed, does that mean that I'm not going to be able to come out. I
feel bad for them. I take a completely different look at it. Whether some
people think that's, think of the right word here since we're on TV, since
it's not -- some people think I'm just lying or really I'm looking out for my
own. Michigan State is going to be there if the kid leaves early or not. I'll
be there some of the time if a kid leaves early or not. It's the kid that is
going to lose out, and there's so many that have left because people have
convinced them to leave. Do I think it's healthy? No, and I think 99 percent
of the coaches, I think 99 percent of the NBA people, I just think there's
other people that get in there and that's where the problems are. But I'll do
it anyway. I'll take a four year guy, a two year guy, a two year guy and a one
year guy and if he can play it, it doesn't matter to me.  
  
 Q. I was wondering, you mentioned Magic speaking to the team. I was
wondering what his influence is like? Is he someone when March comes around
it's annually you'll let him address the team or is he like a trump card that
you pull out when you want a particular reaction or anything?  
COACH IZZO: No, he's actually boring because he's there all year long. He
comes back, his family still lives in Lansing. There's no trump card with
Earvin except he's one of the rare people in sports or maybe in the world that
has transcended time. You know, it doesn't matter if it's Tum Tum coming from
out of the country, everybody knows Magic Johnson. I've been blessed. I mean,
I'm telling you, the greatest thing that's happened to me at Michigan State is
he has supported us, I mean, he flies here from LA, he did it last year, he
did it the year before, he did it when I first started. He's kind of got an
annual thing now where he brings his dad, it's the coolest thing there is. He
sat there and when he talked to them today, I said to my assistants, they must
think I had a meeting with him before and gave him all these things to say
because he analyzed their team way better than I did. So it's just special for
me and I think it's special for my team that a man of his stature would take
the time on a regular basis. The negative is I can't use him as a trump card.
The positive is, I don't need to use him as a trump card because he's there
sometimes making a phone call, sometimes doing this, trying to help the
players out that went here. Boy, that's special, I promise you.  
  
 Q. In the last two games for Virginia they've given up the highest
shooting percentage to opponents that they've given up all year. As you watch
and analyze that, is that starting on the offensive end because of the quick
shots and not getting back or why do you see those numbers elevated?  
COACH IZZO: I don't know. We went into Wisconsin a couple weeks ago to play
there and they had the highest field goal percentage they've ever had
defensively both from the 3 and the 2 since I think Bo's been there and they
had us down 20. I think that happens once in a while. This tournament is all
about match-ups and styles. If somebody plays a certain style and it's a
little more effective in one way or another. I look at us and the last 10, 12
games, we've been very good defensively, too, but we're not rebounding the
ball as well. Sometimes we had foul trouble last night my best rebounder only
played 22 minutes. You look at a guy like Anderson and when he was out of the
lineup, that's a big guy out of the lineup both defensively and offensively.
So I don't know if there's reasons for it. I know this. There aren't many
coaches around the country that wake up feeling good about going against
Virginia's defense. I think it's more than just reputation. I think it's been
proven over time. Now if they had a slip up here and there, took a couple
quick shots, maybe the defense they're playing against gave them quick shots.
Tony's got a very disciplined system, discipline doesn't mean they just hold
the ball, it means they're going to get a good shot. Get it in 10 seconds,
maybe it's the other team isn't as good defensively, they're getting a quicker
shot. I don't know the reason, I just know this, they're awfully good
defensively and we're going to have for find ways to score and that's what
we're working on last night, today and tomorrow morning.  
  
 Q. This may be a little off the subject, forgive me if my memory's
fuzzy but were you involved in that game with Virginia that was canceled at
the Richmond Coliseum?  
COACH IZZO: Pete Gillen.  
  
 Q. Has that ever happened to you any other time?  
COACH IZZO: No, where I am from, an area in the UP where there's 11 months of
winter it should have happened a lot of times. In all honesty, it was amazing.
We were in Richmond and it got to about 65, 70 degrees there and I guess they
had ice underneath, it was a hockey arena. Our guys were slipping the first
half and we kind of went back and forth, we each went on runs that were
significant and I was talking to Craig Littlepage, I think what he did is when
they went on their run and went up on us, that's when they called the game. He
was hoping that that means they won but unfortunately they didn't. But Pete
and I, we both agreed on it, it was a tough situation but it was the right
thing to do, definitely the right thing to do.  
  
 Q. Tom, do you have to adjust your lineup to deal with their size, do
some things that you haven't done much this season?  
COACH IZZO: Well, maybe a little bit but we don't have enough bodies to adjust
it much. Could we play Branden at the 3, some, but we're always in trouble at
the 4 and 5. I think we'll make some adjustments, we'll cover some things but
I don't know if we'll make wholesale changes. And if I did, I wouldn't tell
you here, to be honest. I really think for the most part when you play 35, 36
whatever games we've played now for, it's not broke, why fix it. And it's not
been broke, we've been pretty solid against bigger teams, smaller teams,
sometimes free throws didn't go in and we lost for different reasons. This is
maybe we have an Iowa or a Maryland in our league that is very big and has big
wings, they're big but they're not as linebacker stylish as Virginia's are. So
maybe by halftime I'll be changing a lot of things but as it is right now
we're going to go what we have. I'm sure Tony's going to go with what he has
and should be a heck of a game. Hopefully it will be as good a game as I think
it could be.

_CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  
MODERATOR: We'll be starting with the Duke student-athletes Quinn Cook, Tyus
Jones, Justise Winslow.  
  
 Q. This is for Quinn and Tyus and Justise, too. Last night Coach talked
about how Quinn, you've shared that leadership role with a freshmen, and how a
lot of times freshmen need that go ahead to speak up. Can you talk about how
you guys have worked out that dynamic and it hasn't been a problem like it
might be for a lot of teams and kids?  
QUINN COOK: Definitely. One thing about our team, it's not just the
upperclassmen, the seniors, juniors doing all the leadership, the motivating.
A lot of times we have three freshmen on the floor at all times and even
Grayson has stepped up, which makes four. So we want to have leadership from
everybody and there's been times when I've been in a funk and either one of
these guys get on me telling me to step it up and that's one thing that makes
our team so special. We're close off the court so it translates on the court
so we can say whatever to each other and we can trust each other. It's not
just been myself. Amile, who's captain, everybody asks, played a part in being
a great leader this year.  
  
TYUS JONES: Quinn has been a great leader since day one, he's been a leader of
this team. But as a leader he told us coming in that everybody on the team can
be a leader, everyone can get on somebody, tell them pick it up or what they
did wrong and stuff like that. As the leader and captain of our team, for him
to say that it just gives you confidence and he made that known since day one.  
  
JUSTISE WINSLOW: Pretty much it's about keeping everybody accountable. Q's our
leader but at the same time if Q's not doing something right, then Tyus is
going to get on him. It's just about trusting, believing in each other, having
your brother's back and keeping everybody accountable.  
  
 Q. This is for Quinn first and then Tyus, and Justise can jump in after
that. San Diego State's a pretty good defensive team, seems like tempo's going
to be important for you guys to get the game going at a higher speed. Quinn,
what's going to be important for you guys to pay attention to in that
department?  
QUINN COOK: We have to play at our pace. I think they like to control the
tempo. They're a great defensive team, they're very long and they use their
length to their advantage. We still want to get in transition, get some early
3s, get Jah going, and I think the key did rebounding. Those guys are
humungous. I think if we can control the boards, and make those guys work, I
think we will be fine. Those guys are a heck of a team, they won some bigtime
games, especially last night against St. John's to advance. They're a
confident team and they're shooting the ball extremely well. We have to focus
on rebounding and it will be fine.  
  
TYUS JONES: Yeah, like Quinn said, they're a great defensive team so we know
that we're going to have to work on the offensive end and be sharp. But yeah,
we're going to have to keep them off the glass, hold them to one shot and then
try to get out like Quinn said and get some easy transition points and maybe
open things up for us. We've just got to be sharp and stay together, regroup,
not worry about last name. It's a new game, a new day, so we've just got to be
sharp and play Duke basketball.  
  
JUSTISE WINSLOW: Really just comes down to playing smart and playing our game,
push is when we can but at the same time know the time, know the situation,
know when to pull it back out. I think we'll do a great job of doing that, it
starts with the defensive rebound on the defensive end so we got to get that
first before we can run transition, but when we're playing in transition we're
pretty much unstoppable. With the way we can knock down 3s in transition, big
fellas on the floor, it just makes us real tough to beat.  
  
 Q. This is for Tyus and Justise, as freshmen talk about what it's been
like playing for Coach K and maybe one thing, one of the most important things
you've learned from him? And also you guys seem to be growing out your hair
all year, is that something that y'all talked about doing as a team or
something that you just ended up doing instinctively?  
MODERATOR: Coach K, then we'll deal with the hair.  
  
TYUS JONES: Playing under Coach has been great and that's a big reason why you
come to Duke, so you can learn from the best coach in the game. For myself
personally he's taught me just a lot, not even having to do with physical
skills on the basketball, but more leadership stuff, having to talk more, how
to control and run your team, just taught me how to be a better and more
complete point guard.  
  
JUSTISE WINSLOW: For me just as a freshman like Tyus said, one of the biggest
reasons you come to Duke is to play for Coach K. He's one of the best ever,
but just one of the biggest ways he's influenced my name is from the mental
aspect, mental preparation, mental focus. That's something that I kind of
lacked coming into my freshman year but just learning to be more consistent,
play consistent, be mentally consistent night in and night out is something
that Coach K has really taught me pretty well so far this year.  
  
QUINN COOK: I can speak on the hair. Justise, he had it when he first got here
and I was kind of growing mine out, so Matt started doing it and then Tyus and
Jah joined along, and Matt cut his. All the fans like it so we just kept it
going.  
  
 Q. For Justise and for Tyus, Rick Pitino, the Louisville coach came out
a few days talking about the one-and-done rule and he said should get rid of
that rule and top talent coming out of high school should probably be allowed
to go to the NBA if they can and players who go to college should probably
stay in college a few years. What do you guys think is fairest to you?  
JUSTISE WINSLOW: It's nothing we can really say, nobody can comment on that.
Whatever the rule is, that's what you've got to follow. Right now the rule is
right now one year. For a lot of players, if they're ready, they're going to
leave. But you just got to abide by the rule, whatever the rule is. Whatever
we think is fair, whatever, doesn't really matter. Just abiding by the rule is
the biggest thing.  
  
TYUS JONES: Yeah, same thing as Justise said. You've got to abide by the rules
no matter what. Players, we don't make the rules, so just kind of the new era.
10, 15 years ago, players were used to being able to come out right after high
school, but it's just something that's changed in this day and age.  
  
 Q. Do you wish you had a statement in that rule?  
JUSTISE WINSLOW: No, not really.  
  
TYUS JONES: Me, either. It's one of those things where you can't focus on it,
can't worry about it and that's -- personally that's not where our focus is at
this point.  
  
 Q. For Tyus and Justise, you talked about coming to Duke to learn from
Coach K. Can each of you talk about him and express the difference in your
game now as opposed to the beginning of the season, how much have you grown?  
TYUS JONES: I think I've grown, like I said earlier, just being a better,
complete point guard, just doing more of the leadership things. Coach has
taught me a lot with that as well as Quinn at the same time, just doing small
stuff like talking more at dead balls, bringing the team together, just making
sure everybody knows what play we're in, getting guys in the right spots.
Stuff like that, small stuff that you might not focus on in high school and
coming into college. He stresses that to me as the point guard. And like
Justise said, mentally, mentally how to approach the game, how to break down
defenses and reading defenses and stuff like that. That's what I feel I've
improved on the most.  
  
JUSTISE WINSLOW: The biggest thing that Coach K has been able to teach me
isn't anything physical like skill-wise but more mentally how to approach the
game whether it's through the game plan or scouting of your opponent. Like
Tyus said, it's really just a mental aspect, his leadership, his ability to
pass that down to us, but really just being able to focus and prepare for each
game, each practice and just the mental approach, learn how to defend ball
screens and those type of things has really been the biggest thing and biggest
advancement that Coach K's given to me.  
  
 Q. To Tyus, you and Jah decided you wanted to go to college together.
How hard was it to keep that pact and what led you to go to Duke?  
TYUS JONES: It wasn't that hard for us. People didn't believe us, but we were
in it one hundred percent together. We approached the recruiting process
together. We took visits at the same time. We talked daily about different
schools and stuff like that, ultimately Duke felt like home to us. Coach K, we
had all the trust in the world for him and the staff, and we loved the team
already. Duke was home and we're a hundred percent glad that we came here.  
  
 Q. For all three of you, do any of you know any of the San Diego State
players? Have you run across them anywhere, and if not, does that change
anything when you're playing a team that's knew?  
QUINN COOK: I know Winston Shepard just from the AAU circuit. We played on
Adidas AAU circuit, did camps together. So I know him. We all watch
basketball. We watched them play Arizona and Maui. We watched, myself and Tyus
watched them play against UNLV this year. We're fans of the game so we are
familiar with those guys and they're a great team. Coach Fisher does a heck of
a job.  
  
TYUS JONES: I don't know any of their players personally but like Quinn said,
we're fans of the game, so you know them through AAU in high school and
obviously from this year just watching college basketball, you see them play a
couple of times. Obviously you're just watching and observing. So we see them
and we're somewhat familiar with them, but on a personal note I don't know any
of their players close or anything like that.  
  
JUSTISE WINSLOW: Well, I know Winston Shepard just because he's from the
Huston area, just working out with him back home. Like they said, just being
fans of the game, you get to know a lot of players of a lot of the teams. Our
coaches do a great job of doing the scouting report on all the players so by
the time the game rolls around we're pretty familiar with all the teams.  
  
 Q. After the Notre Dame game, Coach K was pretty unhappy the way you
started the game and said he hoped you learned a lesson about having to
prepare and focus every timeout. Do you feel you've learned that lesson, is
that something you've got to be concerned about going on?  
JUSTISE WINSLOW: Definitely, we've got to learn to start better, have stronger
starts and just put a better 40-minute performance all together. We can't have
those lulls like we did yesterday in the second half where we let them get
back in the game, and if we can do that, start strong and play hard for 40
minutes, then we'll put ourselves in a great position to win.  
  
TYUS JONES: This is just a learning experience for us. This is something that
we can learn from and especially prior to the tournament, it's something that
we don't want to let happen again. So like Justise said, we've got to come out
the gate strong, focused and mentally prepared and be ready to go 40 minutes.  
  
QUINN COOK: Basically saying the same thing, just we can't spot a team 17, 18
points, especially in the postseason because guys are playing for their
season. I know seniors, they don't want their season to end and I think after
the Notre Dame loss, I think we kind of really realized that we are close to
the end, and we don't want the special teams to end our season, just starting
with attention to detail, sense of urgency for all 40 minutes.  
  
 Q. In that post-game press conference he said that he thought that you
guys took for granted what it takes mentally to prepare to win because you had
gone on that long win streak. Did you take that loss to Notre Dame, was that
fresh in your mind coming into the NCAA Tournament?  
QUINN COOK: I don't think so. I think we had a meeting after the game and we
didn't watch any film or anything of the loss. I mean, I just think it was
something that we knew what happened and we fought back and we had a chance to
win. So after, it's a new season. Coach said it was 0-0 and we just got
prepared for yesterday's game and we didn't have an opponent so it was a week
for us to really focus on ourselves, just get back in the right shape, get
back sharp the way we were because I don't think we were sharp as we were in
those 12 games, 13 games we were winning. So we kind of focused on ourselves
and just took it as one-and-done mentality.  
  
TYUS JONES: Yeah, just a lot of the same thoughts Quinn has, just we weren't
as sharp as we had been in the previous games. We played a really good game
versus NC State the night before so I think we came out a little bit more
relaxed and not as intense as we needed to be and it hurt us. We spotted them
15, 17 points and dug ourself a hole that we just weren't quite able to climb
out of.  
  
 Q. For Quinn, I'm interested, what's your perception of them? Obviously
they're not a college basketball blue blood but over the last five years
they've won just as many NCAA Tournament games as Duke has, I think they have
more players that have played in more NCAA Tournament games than on your
roster. Do you consider them a top 25 big-time school or are they just sort of
one of those other schools out there in the wilderness?  
QUINN COOK: They're here for a reason. Coach Fisher, he's obviously
experienced coaching the Fab Five, being in National Championship games,
actually winning the National Championship, going to the Elite Eight a couple
years ago. We respect those guys, they're a top 20 team, they're here for a
reason, they beat a great St. John's team that we played against and we
struggled with those St. John's guys and they were up the whole game. We
definitely respect those guys, they're here for a reason. We've got to prepare
the same way as we do for any team and I think we're doing a great job of that
and I know those guys will be ready.  
  
 Q. For the panel, does SDSU resemble anybody that you've played
already?  
QUINN COOK: They remind me a little bit of Virginia just the way they play
defense. Their length, they play at their own pace. And they're older, I think
they start three seniors, Polee, O'Brien and Quinn, juniors with Shepard and
the big guy. They're good. Chol, coming off the bench, they're extremely
talented and they play great defense, they play great defense and that's what
really sticks out to us. Defense wins games so we have to play defense just as
they do tomorrow.  
  
TYUS JONES: I agree with Quinn, they remind me a lot of Virginia just because
of how good a defensive team they are and their size and length. They've got
Polee and Shepard as a two and three and they're 6-7, 6-8, so when you've got
size like that, it's a hard match-up and it definitely gives you an advantage
so they remind me of Virginia just because of the size that they have.  
  
JUSTISE WINSLOW: Like they said, Virginia, with their length and ability to
control the pace and the tempo, that's the biggest thing that they do. Playing
at their speed and teams really have trouble with that, just their ability to
play defense and their length makes it really tough to score on them.  
  
 Q. I wanted to ask again about preparation last night, there was a lot
of talk about the balance between focus and looseness that you obviously don't
want to come out -- Quinn, you've been through everything, how do you keep the
team loose and focused at the same time?  
QUINN COOK: I mean, just be kids. I mean, we're all, you know, in college. I
mean, we want to have fun. We're not always in hotel room just talking
basketball. We want to be ourselves, that's how we stay loose. But also at the
end of the day when it's time to watch film and get prepared for the next
team. We take it seriously. On the way to games, it's all business, we're
never joking and laughing when it comes down to being prepared for the game.
We've been in some big time games this year and we created some good habits.
We don't play tight because we always remind ourselves that we've been here
before, especially with a younger team, that's the advantage we have, with the
amount of big games that these games have played in, it really helps us.  
  
MODERATOR: Okay, thank you. We're ready to begin with Coach Krzyzewski.  
  
 Q. Way back in December 2001, Coach Fisher was still building his
program and they came to Cameron Indoor Stadium for great exposure. Talk about
how far he's brought that program from that day?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Well, he's built a great program. San Diego State and their
community should be really -- should really value the fact that Steve's been
there. That's what we're going to face tomorrow. We're not going to face an
outstanding team; we're going to face an outstanding program. All the values
and principles that he brought there and developed, you know, after his first
year, his first year was difficult. Since then, he's brought in great kids who
played the game the right way. This team is no exception to it. It will be a
difficult game for us against Steve's team.  
  
 Q. You and Coach Fisher met a long time ago in the tournament and
you've been around coaching circles a long time. What is your relationship
with him? How much interaction, I know you have some common Midwest roots as
well.  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: We've been friends for a long time but before the
championship game in the early '90s, we're both old coaches who we got in it
for the right reasons and we're still in it for the right reasons. So he's a
good friend. He and his wife are good friends with my wife and I. He's just
been really good for basketball. I've enjoyed my friendship with him.  
  
 Q. Coach, Jah and Tyus wanted to go to college together. Do you recruit
them as individuals? How did you guys approach that or did you recruit them as
a pair?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: We really approached it, recruiting them, as individuals
because no matter what youngsters say, you can't be sure about that. But they
came on their visit together. Their families know each other really well
because of USA Basketball, and so we saw that connection. But the thing, if
one of them, if they were going to be true to that, if one of them didn't like
it, then the other one wasn't going to go. So obviously I'm glad it worked out
that way. We recruited them for a long time.  
  
 Q. Rick Pitino was on Dan Patrick show a few days ago, talking about
the one-and-done rule, doesn't like it. You've been able to adapt your program
to whatever system there is and done well with the one-and-done, but if you
had your way, would you change it? And do you think this is the best way for
the students?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Right now in college, a lot of students aren't completing
four years because they're getting out into the business world, so I think
there's a change anyway going on. Certainly in other sports, kids go all the
time. It really doesn't matter what I would want, it's what the players' union
and the NBA would decide on. I think the NBA would like two years. And the
counsel for the players' union came out a couple weeks ago, I don't know what
function this was at, but said that it didn't seem like they wanted the same
thing. They would even like kids to come right out of high school. We just
have to adapt to whatever's going to happen with the NBA and the players'
union. Really, it doesn't make any difference what we want, we have to adapt
to it.  
  
 Q. Just to follow up on that just a little bit, you've been through the
first third of your career where you never lost a guy early. Then you went
through another decade where you lost a few but kept a few, Battier, Redick
for four years. Now you have kind of been in this one-and-done era where
you've had a lot. Can you just talk about your career in that regard and how
much more difficult or is it more difficult now with this system?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: It's always difficult to get to the level of excellence that
we want no matter what the environment is. Basically it's up to us to adapt to
the environment and whatever culture is there and the rules. It's like running
a company. If you want to be a CEO for a long time, you had better adapt to
the changes that are occurring in business an the economy and international
relations and all that. So adaptability is the key thing. I'm also at a school
that allows me to adapt and the people, the infrastructure that we have in our
program and in our school and the leadership has allowed me to change
accordingly. But we've changed a lot over the years and we needed to. Now, I
don't think we've changed our values or our principles, but certainly the way
we recruit and how we play and how we interact with our guys continually
changes.  
  
 Q. Last night San Diego State shot the lights out from the 3, and I
think they scored the most points they have since February or January. How do
you prepare for that as this is a team normally that likes to muck it up but
now they're coming off an offensive outburst. Does that change how you
prepare?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: I think one of the things that changes is how Polee's
played. He was out for a long period of time and I think he's been back for
seven games or a small number of games. He was fantastic last night. And he
may be coming on. In other words, he may be regaining what he missed by being
out and then that gives them another 3-point shooter besides Shrigley and
Quinn and gives them even more depth. And you put more than one shooter out
there and it stretches and it gives O'Brien a chance to make more plays. So I
just think they're integrating him back into their system has helped immensely
and makes them a more difficult team to defend.  
  
 Q. Obviously not from here, so I'm a little bit confused how this
works. Is a Charlotte crowd a Duke crowd or is it going to be mixed tomorrow?
Because I heard a lot of Carolina, saw a lot of Carolina shirts last night.
Will the Virginia fans root for San Diego State? What do you expect in terms
of the crowd?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: I don't expect anything. You know, I expect to play San
Diego State. A crowd never influences us. We always play in front of a big
crowd and sometimes that crowd is for us, sometimes it's mixed, and sometimes
it's against us. I'm trying to figure out how to guard O'Brien, not how to
sell Duke shirts and dolls and all those types of things. I just hope we have
a great crowd, it's two tremendous games, four really outstanding programs.  
  
 Q. With the way they play defense, how important is getting your
transition game going going to be and what's the best way to go about that?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: I think St. John's is pretty good in transition, and I don't
think Quinn was up to par health-wise last night. I think they're a better
transition defense team than they showed last night, let's put it that way. I
think they're an outstanding defensive team for a number of reasons. One,
they're very athletic. Two, they have amazing length. Then they have
incredible experience and then they're deep. So they've done their thing a
long time with one another and then they have -- you can't practice against
length unless you have it. So I think you're surprised. I mean, kids can be
surprised with how long they are and how athletic they are. They're one of the
best defensive teams in the country and I think those four factors, a lot of
people can't matchup with that in putting a defense out on the court.  
  
 Q. You've talked a lot about Matt Jones as a guy who doesn't need the
ball as much on offense?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Right.  
  
 Q. How has he improved or changed your ball movement?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Well, Matt's helped us in every way. Before ball movement,
he's our best perimeter defender off the ball, and he's good on the ball also,
but he adds a toughness element. He hasn't been a consistent high percentage
shooter, but he's hit unbelievably big shots, and then he can streak but he
can also drive the ball. And then he can play where he doesn't take a shot and
he'll be all right. So the ball, the ball doesn't stop in his hands, it
usually moves to another good place. And then he can offensive rebound. Matt's
been a really good player for us and that's why he's been starting. I think
that lineup has helped, and then our two big guys coming off the bench,
Marshall and Amile have really improved during this last month.  
  
 Q. Coach K, Tyus and Justise talked about how much you have helped them
improve their game from a mental aspect. As freshmen. And as a Coach who has
been doing it for a long time, do you find it easier to relate to your younger
players or do you -- does it get easier as time goes on?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Well, no, it doesn't get easier. I think it doesn't get
harder, it's just always different. I mean, my middle daughter is here with
her three boys: Quinn, Rem and Caid and they're all different. She relates to
them in different ways and I think that's what you have to do with your
players. Tyus and Justise, they want to learn and they're capable. Their glass
is bigger as far as what you can fill it, you can give them more because
maturity- and then intellectually as a player, they can absorb more. And then
there's no stoppage because they believe in us. Not just me, but Jeff Capel
and Jon Scheyer and Nate James, so they're very willing learners. It's been
great coaching them because they give you energy. I think if you would ask any
teacher what class do they enjoy teaching the most, they would say the class
that wants to learn because it brings out more of your teaching. Those kids,
that's what they do, they're great kids to teach.  
  
 Q. You look at who Marshall has had to guard in practice throughout his
career: Miles, Mason, Jabari a little bit and Jah this year. How do you make
sure that, especially when he's going up against Jah, like, he doesn't get
frustrated or down on himself or just because that's a pretty tough assignment
for anyone to handle?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Yeah, it is, and also you're not getting like, even if you
did well in practice, there's no headline about that. It's a good observation.
I think we have to tell him how well he's doing. And then there's a point, big
guys come around at a different timeframe than the perimeter guys. This last
month he's just taken a giant step forward forward. Marshall is really a good
player right now. I do think throughout his career some of those times he was
hurt, and so that knocked him back, but playing against Jah, I think, has
helped him. I really think in practice when they're doing individual work,
playing against Sean Obi has helped, who's transferred and strong guy. Sean's
done a good job in practice sessions to be physical with Marshall and with
Amile and that's helped him.  
  
 Q. Mike, what about this tournament still surprises you? Like with the
way we started off this year with some of the 14-3 upsets, things like that.
Have you just seen it all before or are there still things that happen that
kind of take you back?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: No, I don't think you've ever seen -- you see different ways
to win and lose. I wish we didn't see a game starting at 10:45. I mean, I
can't even believe that that could happen. I can't believe that that could
happen. Could you? I mean, how did that happen, by the way? That's not right.
That's not right. But the tournament keeps growing and kids keep doing
magnificent things, some kids do things that aren't so magnificent which lead
to someone doing something magnificent. The tournament has -- everyone talks
about game pressure. When you get to the tournament, it's tournament pressure.
It's game pressure at the highest level. What that does creates even more
magical moments. We had tournament pressure on us last night when it got down
to 10 and Justise responded with three magnificent plays that gave us 8 points
and them none. So, like, that was a great moment because he was not -- he
hadn't been playing that well and then all of a sudden he was great. But the
pressure of the tournament can get to you. It can get you to perform high or
low. So there's always something new, always something new that's going on.  
  
 Q. Sort of piggybacking off that, you've been around the game a long
time, Austin Carr scored, I think, 61 points in an NCAA Tournament game. It's
a record that stood since, I believe, 1970. What are your thoughts about that
and do you think anyone is ever going to challenge a record like that?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: I think most records will eventually be beaten because they
just are, they just are. Nothing against Austin, he's pretty good. Wonder if
everyone knows who he is. Wonder if any players know who he is. Well, yeah,
they may not know anybody from the '80s. I have to be careful about that when
I make references, like is that out of date or whatever. But it will be broken
at some time just number of wins -- probably Coach Wooden's record will never
be broken, that's one that's -- that's pretty darn hard. But points, rebounds,
things like that, wins I think pretty good chance that they'll all be broken.

_CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  
MODERATOR: We'll have with us Justin Anderson and Anthony Gill.  
  
 Q. Justin, a lot has been made of your absence and how the team did and
how the team would do going forward. What are your thoughts on that and what
were your feelings about how your team did while you were out?  
JUSTIN ANDERSON: Wow, I think our team did a tremendous job without me. It
feels weird saying that, but I was still there cheering those guys on, it was
just a different role that I had to take. But our program is based on
something that's bigger than one player and I knew that we were going to be
very successful this season regardless of any one player or injuries that may
occur. I've had total confidence in my team since day one.  
  
 Q. For each of you guys, you need no more motivation ever in March but
you had this team last year and knocked out in the Sweet 16 at MSG. What does
it mean for you guys to have another shot?  
ANTHONY GILL: I just think it's a blessing to be in this position we're in.
We're not going to go into this game thinking of it as A revenge game or
anything like that. We are just going to go out there and play like we want to
continue to keep moving on in this tournament. Like I said, it's a blessing
for us to be here. We got knocked out by Michigan State last year, but, like I
said, we're not going to take it as a revenge game.  
  
JUSTIN ANDERSON: We're extremely hungry regardless of who we play, we know we
have an opportunity and that's what this is all about, March is all about an
opportunity and we're starting to see that on the highest level right now with
the upsets that are occurring and teams taking full advantage of their
opportunities. For us to sit here and dwell on what happened last year, it's
not going to help us win this game tomorrow so we're just going to accept what
we have to do and go in very hungry and try to come out on top.  
  
 Q. Anthony, I think it was 16 minutes left that you left that game last
year with the ankle injury. You guys were up. How difficult was that for you
to have to watch the end of that game, how was the post-game situation for you
and how much have you kind of envisioned getting an opportunity to turn things
around this year?  
ANTHONY GILL: You know, I think that that game last year was big for our
program, just to continue to make us hungry and want more for this program and
want more for each individual player. But I think personally I think I really
wanted to help my team out there and I wasn't able to perform the way that I
wanted to and I think that that really in a way made me a lot more hungry and
want to get better, just to know that I could have helped my team and I didn't
really do what I needed to do because of injury. So I think that if anything
it made me just a lot more hungry.  
  
JUSTIN ANDERSON: And that's one player that we actually did need at that
moment because he started off really well for us.  
  
 Q. What was your takeaway from playing Michigan State last year as far
as their style of play and how maybe better equipped will you be this year
having gone through it?  
JUSTIN ANDERSON: I think our team has realized that that was a total different
team that they had last year. You take away three guys that are playing at the
professional level, Keith Appling, Gary Harris and Adreian Payne, those are
three big-name players that had tremendous years for them last year. But this
team, we understand that their system is one that gets out in transition and
just like the teams we play in our conference, North Carolina, Louisville,
teams that like to run in transition, we have to get back and set our defense
is very important. And Valentine and Trice are playing at a high level this
year, they're stepping up and filling those shoes from the guys last year and
we have to make sure we keep constant ball pressure on them and not let them
get going offensively.  
  
ANTHONY GILL: I think it's going to be a physical game, especially in the post
they're really a physical team and we have to match that physicality from the
beginning and if we don't, we're going to find ourselves in a deficit. I think
Dawson and the other interior players that they have create some challenges
for us because of how physical they are and we're going to have to match that
physicality.  
  
 Q. Anthony, you said it was big for your program last year to play in a
game like that in Sweet 16, I think when you made the tournament you've made
four Sweet 16s in a row. You have to play teams like Michigan State. How big
for the program to get over that hump to beat teams like Michigan State
specifically with the history that they've had in the tournament?  
ANTHONY GILL: I think it's time for this program to take the next step. I
think that that means to go past the Sweet 16. I think we have the players to
be able to do that, we have the coaching staff, we have the system to be able
to do it and we all have the want-to and the will-to be able to do it. So it's
just up to us really and I think it will be great to bring something special
back to Charlottesville and to the UVA fans.  
  
JUSTIN ANDERSON: Yeah, it's definitely important to take the next step. Kind
of piggy-backing off of what Anthony says, we are going to try to stay hungry
and keep trying to achieve more. Last year we got to a point we were thankful,
satisfied that we got there but we want more. And hopefully this year we can
give ourselves that opportunity.  
  
 Q. Justin, a couple days ago you described Anthony admiringly as a
junkyard dog. Can you expand on that a little bit more given this match-up and
what he said about the physical nature of it? And just how important he is for
this team?  
JUSTIN ANDERSON: He's very physical. He thrives off of physicality of games
like this. Like I said, 15 and in is his wheelhouse, even though he can step
out and shoot the 3 in practice, but no one needs to know all of that. But
when he has it in the low post and he's taking his time, we have full
confidence in what he can do down there even defensively as well going against
guys like where he's going to have to see Dawson tomorrow, he's just an
animal, he's a beast, he's relentless we all respect him and we all know
that's what he's going to bring every night.  
  
 Q. For both guys, the post-game after last year's loss to Michigan
State, was that the most somber you've been and what sort of motivation was
that for not necessarily this game but for the season ahead?  
ANTHONY GILL: I think the biggest thing that hit me was we won't be able to
play with the seniors on the team anymore. I think having Joe Harris, Akil
Mitchell and Thomas Rogers and to no longer being able to play with them, I
think that was the biggest thing to hit me and I don't want my time with those
guys to end. I want to continue to keep playing with them, and I think when I
realized that was the last game I would be able to play with them, I think
that really hit home seeing them tearing up and things like that, I think that
was probably the biggest thing that impacted me and I don't want to see Darion
Atkins or Maleek Frazier or Rob Vozenilek go out like that and I just want to
continue to keep playing with them for as long as I can.  
  
JUSTIN ANDERSON: Anthony hit it right on the head, the senior class is always
their leadership and their ability to have an effect on the younger guys. I
know in particular being a guard, with much respect to Akil and Thomas, but
being a guard, Joe Harris kind of took me under his wing my freshman year and
kind of showed me the ropes and to realize that was my last game playing with
him and see how hard he did everything and how great he was at doing the
little things, he was kind of like my hero and it was sad for that day to come
and for us to lose the game that close that we really wanted, we thought we
had a chance to win, it was very emotional but at the same time it was very
hopeful because we understood that those guys laid a foundation that was going
to be one to compete with and we wanted to make sure that we wouldn't let them
down by this year and years to come.  
  
 Q. Anthony, is the physical match-up the type that you kind of relish
or look forward to as opposed to maybe a team that's more of a finesse type of
group or does it matter? I'm just curious?  
ANTHONY GILL: It doesn't really matter to me. I just think that I'm a physical
player, I like to draw contact and things of that nature, so depending on
whether they're going to be physical with me or they're not going to be
physical with me it doesn't really matter, I'm seeking the contact regardless.  
  
 Q. Last year they held you to I think 35 percent shooting. What did you
learn from that game against Michigan State and what do you got to do
differently this time around?  
JUSTIN ANDERSON: We've got to shoot the ball better. Maybe the rims in MSG
were a little tight, Carmelo Anthony wasn't even scoring that well on those
rims that year. But we feel good, we have confidence in our coaches, they
prepared us really well and we have full confidence in our offense. Even
though that stat was bad for us last year last season, hopefully I'm not
speaking too soon and something crazy like that happens tomorrow but we have
full confidence in our shooting and I think that we are going to come out with
that confidence.  
  
ANTHONY GILL: I think that we probably would have to execute on the offensive
end a lot better. I think we need to hit them with screens. They were physical
with us last year and we kind of took a step back and I think we need to come
out with the same physicality that they had last year with us and we need to
do it this year in this game, and just knowing the kind of team that they are,
they pride themselves on physicality and tough defense and we're going to have
to be ready for that.  
  
 Q. Could you guys talk a little bit about Brogdon, not just as a player
but he seems to be kind of an interesting guy, told me about his plan to wipe
out poverty, and he's got a lot of big plans after basketball, I guess. Can
you just talk about him as a person and as a player?  
JUSTIN ANDERSON: Well, he's different, and if I had -- and when I say that, it
could come off bad but I don't mean that at all. I wish I had an hour to talk
to you about how amazing he is on and off the court with his work ethic not
only on the court but in the classroom, with his interactions with people.
He's a great role model. He's someone that you want your son to look up to and
be around just because he's always setting the right example and he's working
as hard as he can to achieve whatever goals that he puts out for himself. I
wish I had more time to talk about just the little things that he does that
helps us grow as people and helps us grow as a basketball team and I think
that's what makes this group special is we have a lot of individuals like him.  
  
ANTHONY GILL: Like Justin said, he's an amazing person. I wish I had an hour
to talk to you. I get to live with him and just to be able to interact with
him on a daily basis is awesome. All of my roommates, it's just awesome to be
able to just do life with them and it's just great. If I had an hour to talk
to you, I would tell you a whole bunch of stories about him but I don't think
he would want me to put those stories in the media, so I'm just going to keep
my mouth closed on those.  
  
JUSTIN ANDERSON: Can you guys ask Anthony to name his roommates?  
  
ANTHONY GILL: My roommates are Darius Thompson, he's sitting out this year;
Devon Hall, London Perrantes; wow, I just went blank, and Malcolm. Did I
forget anybody?  
  
JUSTIN ANDERSON: DA.  
  
ANTHONY GILL: Darion Atkins, that's my favorite roommate.  
  
JUSTIN ANDERSON: Did you guys notice anything about that?  
  
ANTHONY GILL: Justin didn't live with us this year. He wanted to be outside
the basketball group. I think that speaks to his character and his lack of
teammate-ness.  
  
MODERATOR: Justin, rebuttal? Anyone else? Okay, on that note, thank you. _____  
  
 Q. As you look at the last two games, opponents have shot the highest
field goal percentage of the year against you. Is that starting offensively
with quick shots and getting sped up or do you see a different cause for
that?  
COACH BENNETT: Yeah, you always look at the quality of the shot, and against
Carolina they got some pretty good quality looks against us but they also hit
some tough shots. A good number of their guys were pretty well-contested.
There's good stretches. Even in the Belmont game, some of our breakdowns in
the Belmont game, we were playing them a little differently than other teams.
We were trying to stay at home more on the 3-point shooters so it did open up
maybe the lane for some drives and then some of their backcuts for layups.
Those were just break downs. But there's a enough contested shots but you want
to certainly not have that number go up, that's an important number for us, so
I don't know if our offenses dictated that as much as just some tough shots
being hit and then couple them with a few breakdowns or we talk about those
live ball turnovers that have hurt us. Didn't hurt us as much in the last
game, though.  
  
 Q. How big of a game is this for you guys not only because it's the
next game but because it's Michigan State and if you guys take that next step
as a program to get a marquee or a signature win like this, to get in the
Sweet 16 and hopefully further?  
COACH BENNETT: Yeah, Michigan State is a heck of a program, very good team,
excellent coach, and we know we'll have to play our best. As far as I don't
get too much into having to beat a marquee team. You play so many in the ACC
but just you want to advance. Any chance you can put yourself in an
opportunity to advance is significant. This is a very good team as a 7 seed
who's playing great. Seedings, throw them out, I said that before. But last
year they're the team that stopped us and they played real well, it was a heck
of a game. Again watching how well they're playing this year, I mean, if you
can beat a team that's playing at a high level, and certainly Michigan State,
that's great, but it's just about trying to advance, whether it's Michigan
State or someone else.  
  
 Q. What are some of the signature things that a Tom Izzo team does
better this time of year than January? Seems like his teams just keep getting
better and better as the years go on. What do you see that he does to improve
these guys for tournament play?  
COACH BENNETT: Yeah, I think well some of their staples, their ability to get
down the floor, I don't know if they improve that as the season goes but their
transition offense is terrific, how they will get rebounds, and off the pass
they're up the floor, and I think because they're so tough minded, that's who
he is, that's what he instills in his program. They really are -- they just
battle, you can see that. Of course they offensive rebound, that's something
they've always done. Those two things are there but they do them at a high
level but his players are good. Their three guys, Valentine, Trice and Dawson,
Dawson last year had 24-10 against us. He's got good players and he certainly
has them playing so hard and you just see it. His track record speaks for
itself, but their ability, you saw yesterday how they got some easy transition
buckets, how quick they're down the floor. Some teams in our league do that,
the Carolinas, some of those, certainly Duke, so your ability to as always try
to make them play against a set defense will be one of the keys. But I think
those two things and then just their toughness and their mindset that is part
of that program make them so effective come this time of the year.  
  
 Q. Rick Pitino was on Dan Patrick's show a few days ago talking about
the one-and-done rule, thinks it needs to be eliminated and has his own
suggestions. What do you think of that rule? Do you think it's outlived its
usefulness? Would you like to see change and how realistic is that?  
COACH BENNETT: When we get a one-and-done, I'll let you know, I don't have
much to say, I've never had one so I can't speak to that as much. It's hard. I
was fortunate to have some time in the NBA. It's hard to tell a young man, I
know other sports do it differently, but our formula's always been getting
more mature guys in the system. I don't have -- I was asked this last year a
couple times. I don't have a strong feel on it. Maybe I should because I can
take both sides of that. For guys, if there's the opportunity to go and play
at that level and take care of family and there's some security there, that's
a good opportunity. But I know when you go back and look at the draft, I just
go back to the draft and even some of the teams that you played against, just
seeing Grant Hill here, we were teammates on the Pan American team, so many
players, they were seniors, they were juniors. The strength of those teams
with maturity, I guess maybe in some ways we had an advantage because we've
been mature and a lot of other teams have been young. If there was -- if they
stayed longer -- is Coach Pitino saying there shouldn't be any rule or should
they have to stay longer? What was he suggesting?  
  
 Q. The LeBron level, the Okafor level talent can go straight to the
NBA, but if you go to college you probably have to stay a few years.  
COACH BENNETT: Yeah, I think if you did that, it certainly would strengthen
the depth of the college game just like maybe in the past in that regard.
Again, I don't have -- I haven't had a one-and-done, so I don't know. I said
this before, if they're going to allow the one-and-done rule, I get asked,
well, would you recruit a one-and-done guy? Of course, I would consider that
if we could get one but if you do that, you had better have the ability to
follow it up with another guy like that because that does -- I am amazed at
how programs that lose guys can just reshuffle or reload as they say and do
that.  
  
 Q. London yesterday hits the bucket in the lane in a 2-point game
earlier, they had made a run and he hits a 3-pointer from in front of your
bench. Do you ever tell him to shoot more? Just talk about what you're getting
from him from an offensive standpoint.  
COACH BENNETT: He's got such a good feel. The first game when Justin got hurt,
we played at NC State, we talked to him about trying to look to be assertive
more. I think he's got such good feel. Of course you encourage him. He knows
he has a green light to shoot the right kind of shots but if you take a guy
out of what's natural to him and make him into something that maybe he is not,
I think you have to be careful about that. That first game against NC State,
he was trying to be aggressive. I remember saying to him after that game just
be yourself, you take the shots from there, you know what's right, you know
you have a feel and I trust his feel and I think that's the biggest thing is
that I trust. If I need to whisper something in his ear, if I need to talk to
him, I will, but the game, he's such a classic point guard when you watch him
the way he's played. He understands the moment, when he needs to take the
shot, when he needs to get the guys the ball and that's really important. When
you have Malcolm or Justin, guys who are more geared to being aggressive, you
need a guy who understands that feel or can get it inside if we're not getting
touches, so I don't think I want to mess with that with him. I trust his feel,
as I said, or I can tell him hey, we can run a little action for him but he's
very timely with his shots.  
  
 Q. Touched upon a prior comment you made about the one-and-dones, and
you said you would consider that. It wasn't a we'll take a one-and-done in a
heartbeat. Kind of describe your philosophical approach to recruiting and I
was just talking to the players, they say a lot of the guys have the blue
collar, underdog mentality. Do you look for that in every single one of your
recruits? Say a one-and-done stud comes your way and maybe doesn't fit every
single one of those parameters, would you still take him?  
COACH BENNETT: Well, I haven't had a chance to recruit a one-and-done so I
don't know but there are a lot of guys that are that talented who are blue
collar and that hungry, of course. You don't want to take a guy, if you're not
sure about the character or if he just is -- it's just I'm not about trying to
-- I just want to use this as a touch point and I'm gone. You want a guy who
wants to come and be a part of making a team great, whether it's for a year or
two. We look for -- not everything has to be checked off the box, but we do
look for character first, we look for toughness, and so if there was a guy who
was that talented who was interested enough, absolutely I would go after that,
but if there was a guy that didn't fit, I would not go after that guy.  
  
 Q. When Coach Izzo was in here, he described your post-game encounter
last year at the Garden and said you remarked to him that's the way the game
is supposed to be played. The disappointment in the result aside, was there
kind of a mutual respect because of the way they played and was it almost like
looking in the mirror, that blue collar approach to Michigan State brings?  
COACH BENNETT: Yeah, I wouldn't say it's not -- I've said this, there's so
many different ways to play. I enjoyed that physical, it was tough, there
wasn't anything easy and it's just what I've been brought up on, I believe
what he believes and it was a hard-fought game. So again there's so many
different ways, but it wasn't -- that game was not sloppy, it was hard-fought.
Yeah, I think that's what I meant by that. What was the question part of that?
I kind of got off track.  
  
 Q. Was it almost like looking in the mirror?  
COACH BENNETT: Oh, yeah, yeah.  
  
 Q. You go way back with Izzo?  
COACH BENNETT: No, for sure. We're similar programs, they run more than us, of
course. They do different things, but I think we value a lot of the same
things. Like we talked about, you mentioned blue collar, just a tough mindset,
kind of that idea, the whole -- the cohesiveness, touching greatness in
concert with others, you need that. And you have to have talent, there's no
question. You guys can see that in their team, you can see it in our
individuals, but that ability to try to do something special and go beyond
requires a level of toughness on both ends of the floor, and guys that have
bought into that so I think we both subscribe to that idea.  
  
 Q. Justin Anderson, he's a guy maybe in the NBA next year. Just his
return and what it means because he looked pretty spry yesterday?  
COACH BENNETT: Yeah, it's good to see. Just to see him have a shot go in and
see him moving better and get a block, that was important. Everybody asks he
is he full strength? As much as he's missed, he can't be, but he is he
certainly closer and to see him have some success in that game and give us a
lift like that, I was really happy because I know how his attitude has been
unbelievable through this, but how much he's wanted to get out there and show
some, hey, I'm back and I can help this team in a positive matter and he did
that and he was so excited about helping the team. Yeah, he's very important,
we need all of our guys to be right.  
  
 Q. Tony, Tom Izzo said he wants his team to stay focused because he
knows you guys are going to run that shot clock down the screens and stay
focused throughout each possession. Are you stressing to your team because
watching them make or miss, it's two paces, sometimes the ball is hitting the
floor and they're at the other rim. You miss a shot, make a shot, get back on
defense against this team.  
COACH BENNETT: You have to, if you can't get back it can be a really long day
because again, I mentioned teams in our league that are like the Carolinas and
the Dukes and others, that discipline of doing that well. I mean, that's why I
said we're not the same, we don't go down the floor like that, but of course,
transition defense and that's why they've been good as of late. And when
they've had success even yesterday when they have got down the floor. Makes
misses on free throws that's kind of a discipline, something we know. That's
the first key, that's where our defense starts in the transition so you won't
see many better than I think the way Michigan State can go.  
  
 Q. When you saw the brackets come out and you -- obviously these are
the guys who put you out last year. Did you look at them and say, well, good
we're going to get another shot or were you like oh, it's Michigan State again
the second round? What was kind of your attitude when you saw that as you were
kind of maybe looking at the big picture?  
COACH BENNETT: Yeah, you usually look at your first game, all right, if we
win, Georgia, Michigan State. If we get by a dangerous Belmont team, we're
going to have our hands full. I watched Georgia play against Kentucky. I
haven't watched Michigan State in that Big Ten championship. Man, they're
playing really good basketball, you'll have to be at your best -- it's not
like oh, revenge, we have got to get that, or oh, it's just if we get here
then hopefully we can play at a better level than we did last time we saw
them.  
  
 Q. Coach, could you just talk a little bit about Brogdon not just as a
player and his competitive fire but just he seems to be a very unique
person.  
COACH BENNETT: Yeah, he sure is. I've said this before, he really is a great
ambassador for our program, for the University of Virginia and even for
college athletics. He's in the graduate school, the Batten School of
Leadership at UVA, which is just an incredible program. He's done so well
academically. He's a lot of what's right about this game and college
athletics. He's become a great leader this year, I love that. He's very
steady, humble, but competitive. One of the harder workers I've seen on his
game. I mean, you wouldn't look at him and say he's just this gifted natural
guy. He's gifted with his frame, his strength, his hands and all that but he's
kind of willed his way into being the player that he is, but I don't think
people realize how hard this guy works on his game and what he's done. Just
again, he's the whole package, he really is. He wasn't real highly recruited
coming out but that was an important get for us. I can remember seeing him at
the Peach Jam. He got hurt at the end of the year but he did some things, he
handles the moment well and his teammates love him. Those are the guys when
you have that saying, you know, a coach-led team can be good but a player-led
team has a chance to be very good or great, and I think he has that ability to
lead the team and the guys respond to him and he's making the most of his
college experience, he really is, from an athletic standpoint but certainly
from an academic standpoint, socially and all those things.  
  
 Q. I think we got a reminder last year when Gill went out how important
he is to this team. Can you just talk a little bit about what having him at
full strength in this match-up hopefully for the entire 40 minutes, how
important that is and just I guess the physical nature of their post players
against him?  
COACH BENNETT: Very important. That match-up was hard for us, we just didn't
-- Dawson had his way, they have Payne, they have Dawson and they have very
good players again. Anthony rolled his ankle in that game and we had a hard
time matching up, so we need Darion and Anthony and certainly Mike, Mike
didn't play as much in his last game but this is more of a traditional size,
traditional game. Whether it's Isaiah, we used Evan as the four. Our fours and
fives have to be right in this game, it is, because it's such a physical
rebounding game, there's a lot of ball screen, off ball screen set, they've
got to be sharp and showing and they've got to be engaged in what it will take
from a physical standpoint. And Anthony's one of our guys who can get on the
glass, can draw some fouls, he can manufacture some buckets if he has room and
I know certainly they'll be guarding him well and he's certainly a key and
when we've played well, he's been a part of that.

_CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

DUKE - 85  
ROBERT MORRIS - 56

COACH TOOLE: Obviously we want to congratulate Duke on their win. They're a
terrific team obviously, and made the night uncomfortable for us. I thought
our guys continued to battle regardless of score and I'm very proud of that.
Would have liked to have made a couple more shots or been a little more poised
offensively at times, but I thought we competed the way we wanted to compete.
But it wasn't enough.  
  
MODERATOR: Questions first for Rodney and Lucky.  
  
Q. For either one of the players, when you made the run there in the
second half, two part question, what did you do to be able to come that close
and what were you not able to sustain?  
LUCKY JONES: The way we played during that stretch, that's how we were
supposed to play for 40 minutes. We couldn't withstand that run. But hats off
to our team for pushing and still staying with it, still having the courage to
fight back and make the simple plays and the right plays. We did a great job
during that run.  
  
RODNEY PRYOR: We started to hit shots more in the second half, I think that
gave us energy on the defensive side. We were able to get stops, get out on
the break and make plays to get the run to, I think it was we got it down to
10 and we just didn't capitalize on the defensive end. When they went back on
their run we gambled a few times, I think, and they got out on a break and got
a few 3s, so we weren't able to get stops when we needed them.  
  
Q. Lucky, Robert Morris fans kind of gave you a nice round of applause
when you went out in the game for the final time. What were your emotions in
that moment going to the bench and you hear that? And also your thoughts on
Jahlil Okafor and what it's like playing him, you don't see guys like him in
your league.  
LUCKY JONES: Hats off to our fans. They're some of the most dedicated fans
you'll ever meet, thick or thin, win or lose, they're always there. I had a
great run at Robert Morris. I played as hard as I can for as long as I can.
And going off of Jahlil Okafor, he's a great player, one heck of a freshman
and I hope he do well at the next level.  
  
Q. For either of the players, the idea of coming in playing Duke in
Carolina has to be tough, but how does your expectations compare to what the
actual game felt like?  
RODNEY PRYOR: Obviously we expected to come in and compete, give ourselves a
chance to win the game. They had the home crowd advantage, but the energy in
the building just gives both teams energy, I believe, and we tried our best to
feed off their energy, stay poised, stay calm and things like that. So it was
fun playing out there.  
  
LUCKY JONES: I know my team enjoyed, you know, just being able to get this far
in the tournament. Winning that first game really gave us momentum and
confidence to come in here, give it our best. Win or lose, Robert Morris
really played hard this whole season to get to this point. Going off this
loss, it doesn't really define our season. We have some incredible guys in the
locker room and they're going to be back next year to do it again.  
  
Q. For either player, Duke came out, hit the first seven shots and nine
of the first 10, a really fast start. How difficult was it to maybe hold
composure there when they're seemingly making everything?  
LUCKY JONES: It wasn't that difficult. We just didn't finish when we needed to
finish. They had some wide open good looks and given those type of shooters,
especially Quinn Cook, who's one of their best 3-point shooters, those are
easy shots for him.  
  
RODNEY PRYOR: I think when the team get hot like that, you just make sure you
stay together, stay composed and try to get stops in a row and try to make
place on the offensive end to give ourselves a chance to get back in the
ballgame.  
  
MODERATOR: Thanks guys. Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. Coach, you guys didn't pull the ball out and try to grind the clock
down to five seconds on the shot clock or anything, you went ahead and played
it looked like. What were you trying -- what did you want your guys to do as
just play like you normally want to play?  
COACH TOOLE: They do such a great job of pressuring you. It's hard to hold the
ball. You can see at times where we were and trying to execute maybe some sets
or certain actions. They would take you out, all that stuff, so you have to be
able to make basketball plays. I really thought to start the game we got some
excellent looks. We missed four or five layups early in the game, that if
those go, it might be a little bit of a different game. I think it was 7-5 and
then it was 22-9 and I think we missed three or four layups in that span. If
you're looking at 22-15 or 22-17 maybe you're feeling a little bit better
about yourself but sometimes playing against guys that make you play faster
than you want, make you a little bit uncomfortable, you rush some of those
layups you normally would finish, that's why they're the 1 seed.  
  
Q. What does this situation coming in do as a teaching moment for some
of the younger guys going forward?  
COACH TOOLE: We just talked about that in the locker room. I said to them
especially some of our new guys, none of the guys on our roster had played an
NCAA game before Wednesday and some of our guys this is their first college
basketball season. What I tried to explain to them was one of the reasons that
we push so hard and we demand so much and hold you to such a high standard is
because these are the games that we want to compete it in, these are the games
we want to be in and we want to play better than we played tonight. And
sometimes players want to practice to prepare for the worst team on your
schedule and coaches want to practice like you're playing Duke. And so that's
the mentality and that's what we talked about, that these are the games that
we work so hard for in December because when you find yourself in this
situation you can't have any cracks, you can't have any chinks in your armor
because that's what they take advantage of, and you have to be so strong in
your plan and you have to be so together and so detailed that if you want to
be in these games you have got to be working at this year round and that's
what we try to explain to our guys who are coming back because that starts the
next two weeks when we get back to workouts and preparing for next season.  
  
MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

SAN DIEGO STATE - 76  
ST. JOHN'S - 64

MODERATOR: Coach Lavin will be joined by D'Angelo Harrison and Sir'Dominic
Pointer.  
  
COACH LAVIN: Just in terms of the game, foul trouble early clearly, you know,
affected our chances to be successful. Rysheed picking up that second so early
in the first half and that's when San Diego State put some distance. That's
when they kind of extended, went on their run. With him out and we fought back
some and cut it to 7, and we played them even for most of the second half
until late, so we were equal on the boards in the first half, shot 50 percent
in the first half. Their put-backs, second chance points in the first half is
where they were able to extend some, and then knock it in, in the seven 3s
also allowed them to extend. So the 3-point shooting in the first half and the
second-chance points is where they were able to put some distance between us
and them. But obviously we're a different team when Rysheed is on the floor,
and in the second half again we played them pretty much even until the very
end of the game. So big picture, just proud of this group of seniors taking us
on this ride, restoring pride in St. John's, getting us back to the NCAA
Tournament and representing the University in such a first-class manner and
all earning their college degrees. True to their character, they fought and
scraped and showed grit, fight, right to the last possession of the game. So
the most gratifying year of my coaching career because of the opportunity to
participate in this senior class' journey here at St. John's.  
  
MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes. Please raise your hand.  
  
Q. D'Angelo, how tough was it against their size without Chris? They're
going 6'7, 6'7, 6'8, 6'9, and you guys are playing all guards how difficult
was that?  
D'ANGELO HARRISON: It was tough but we didn't use that excuse. We did what we
can down low. You credit them, they've got some of the 50/50 balls and kicked
out for 3s in the beginning. They got off to a hot start. They were shooting
3s, we were daring them to shoot and they were making them. You credit them.
It was tough but we fought as hard was we could but it just wasn't enough
today.  
  
Q. Can you talk about what emotions you're feeling as you picked up your
fifth foul, walked off the floor and realized your career was going to end at
that moment?  
D'ANGELO HARRISON: No, just keep trying to do what I can to win the game.
Nobody was there to foul so I fouled. When I sat down that's when it hit me.
It's tough. I don't even know how to put it in words yet, but I owe this guy
my life, so I'll probably talk to him every day for the rest of my life,
that's just the kind of guy he is.  
  
Q. For Dom, after you got a couple of fouls early, how much did it take
away from your aggressiveness because you basically were the rim protecter
back there?  
SIR'DOMINIC POINTER: It didn't take away from my aggressiveness at all. I was
down there playing tough. The ball didn't bounce our way. A lot of times we
had the rebound in our hands, we slipped out of our hand and we gave them easy
layups like that. It was more the ball just didn't bounce our way.  
  
Q. D'Angelo, it looked like you talked to Winston there a little bit at
the end of the game. What did you guys say to each other?  
D'ANGELO HARRISON: Just continue to move forward. He played well, so just
continued success. That's my little brother, I talk to him every day, we're
all in a group text. Just saying keep moving forward and keep winning, win the
next game, it's important, for us.  
  
Q. For both of you guys, can you describe the way that when San Diego
State gets a second chance point, like after you've already gotten the stop
and then they get another chance, the way that that affects morale or spirit
or your ability to keep pushing?  
D'ANGELO HARRISON: It definitely hurts, but our goal was get the first rebound
but sometimes they're going to get the tip. I tried to do my best, when they
get it try to run up under them, try to grab it, too. They're just bigger than
us on some plays and sometimes you just can't do nothing about it.  
  
SIR'DOMINIC POINTER: Exactly what D'Angelo said. We did get our rebounding. We
were trying our best, the ball bounced their way a couple of times. Sometimes
we had, like I said we had the ball in our hands, we got tipped. Once it got
tipped around it, they a lot bigger so they longer, they get the rebound and
they put it back up. I wouldn't say it was deflating it until the end, but
more toward the end it hurt us.  
  
Q. If Chris is there, how different is today's game?  
D'ANGELO HARRISON: You could say the game would be different but we're an old
enough group that that wasn't a factor. We played without him, we played
without him before. I think we only lost one game when he wasn't out so I
think we're like 6-1 when he didn't play. We didn't use that as an excuse. I
mean, you can say it would be different, he's 6'9, does unique things. We
didn't use that excuse, we just tried to play hard.  
  
Q. For Dom, you had a stretch where you guys got back where you were
within 7 again and you were getting a lot of stops but you committed four
turnovers in five possessions. How frustrating was it to be there with a
chance and not be able to convert?  
SIR'DOMINIC POINTER: It's very tough but we just kept fighting through it. The
team, we don't let those turnovers affect us, we came out, we scratched it off
and kept playing. We started to come back at the end just we didn't have
enough guys.  
  
Q. I know that you guys are going out in a very well-respected class.
The last three games, you had three opportunities to do things that you had
never done before, beat Villanova, win a Big East tournament game, win a NCAA
tournament game. To have come up short on all three, how do you put that into
words?  
D'ANGELO HARRISON: That's a tough question, to be honest. We tried our best,
man. I couldn't do enough today. I played my hardest, I do what I could and we
just came up short. So you credit San Diego State, credit their coach. I mean,
it's tough, that's a tough question, I don't know how to answer that.  
  
SIR'DOMINIC POINTER: Like D'Angelo said, we played our hearts out and not
winning none of it was hard, but it happens. Like I said, we had a great year,
successful year as a team, our seniors played our hearts out, everybody played
our hearts out, that's all we can ask for.  
  
MODERATOR: Other questions for D'Angelo or Dom? Thanks, guys. Congratulations,
a great year. Questions for Coach Lavin.  
  
Q. Steve, I mean, it's the obvious thing's missing here, which is Chris,
and the number of second chance points that you mentioned. I mean, is this not
somewhat his, you know, his doing?  
COACH LAVIN: You know, it's interesting. If Rysheed doesn't get in foul
trouble, I think this is a game that comes right down to the wire. We knew San
Diego State was a very capable, you know, basketball team. They've had a great
run of success, six straight NCAA tournaments. But to me the defining or
turning point in this game was Rysheed picking up that second foul within the
first minute because he's been a catalyst in this run that allowed us to get
to the NCAA Tournament and the numbers bear that out, and even points in the
paint. We outscored them 40-30 with the points in the paint. Granted, there's
a plus 13 on the second chance points, so it's undeniable that their size was
a factor for them in terms of getting those second shots. But this group has
been successful without Chris. Ideally, we would have preferred to have Chris'
services today, but to me, when I look at the game, it was, when Rysheed
picked up that second foul because of the way he influences the game at both
ends of the court with his ball pressure, with his ability to put pressure on
defenses by breaking them down off the bounce, his playmaking ability,
finishing at the rim ability, drawing fouls. He's a real catalyst and a key
contributor to what we do at both ends of the floor, and he's one of the
better guard rebounders I've coached. When he went out with the second foul,
really the rest of the game was pretty equal until right there at the end
until we were in a situation where we were just fouling to try to get back
into the game. We cut it to 7, had multiple possessions but we never really
got back over the hump from the lead that they extended on us with Rysheed
out, even though I thought the group fought back admirably well given the
circumstances. And I thought the second biggest factor is Dom takes that spill
and he was just basically not the same. So now Obekpa is not with us,
Rysheed's in foul trouble and Dom goes down with the hip pointer. That just
now becomes too much to overcome, and we still fought back in spite of that,
had the ball on multiple occasions on the break and a couple possessions where
we can cut it to 5 or even to 4 if we hit a 3-pointer on one of those
possessions. So the group fought admirably well and I'm proud of them, but
those combinations, Rysheed and Dom being injured I thought was the difference
tonight given that we didn't have Chris with us.  
  
Q. Steve, if you had Obekpa for tonight, would you have opened in that
zone with Rysheed down low protecting against the guys 6'9, 6'10?  
COACH LAVIN: The hypotheticals are obviously, if we had Maurice Harkless
tonight or Jakarr Sampson or Amir Garrett, but I'm just proud of this group
and we got to give credit to San Diego State. They had a great season and they
played really well here tonight and we came up short but I thought the foul
trouble with Rysheed and then Dom's injury, the combination of those two made
it very tough on us tonight with the group we were competing with.  
  
Q. I know the game just ended, but is the door open on a return for
Chris Obekpa next season or do you expect that his time at St. John's is
done?  
COACH LAVIN: We'll get a chance next week to decompress and talk to one
another. We've texted the last couple days, we've been in communication and I
wouldn't be surprised at all if he doesn't return to St. John's.  
  
Q. Your post-season record at St. John's is 2-8. Why don't you think
it's better and how disappointing is that number for you?  
COACH LAVIN: We probably need about an hour and a half for that one, so I
won't, in fairness to the other writers who probably have deadlines tonight
I'm not even going to delve into that one because I have to talk about the
last five years, Harkless going pro, Sampson going pro. I'm just proud of this
group if they got us back to the NCAA Tournament and it's so rare to be able
to take two groups, the team we inherited from Norm Roberts, the team he left
behind, great character, they were such a special group, D.J. Kennedy because
they got us back after a decade in the dessert. D.J. Kennedy and Dwight Hardy,
Paris Horne, Justin Burrell, Sean Evans, Malike Boothe. Go right down the
list. That was a special group of seniors in my initial year at St. John's and
I was like a stepfather, as we all can appreciate. That's tough to do, coming
in as stepfather with someone else's kids, and they punched us back in the
tournament and then we had to start over with this wonderful group that now
got us back to the NCAA Tournament. Ideally I wish we finished in the Final
Four, cutting down the nets in the National Championship but they overcame a
number of things that you don't anticipate. We never thought Harkless would
leave after one year and lose Jakarr after two, and Amir Garrett to Major
League baseball. But these guys, the last of the Mohicans fought to their last
possession for St. John's, really represented the front of that jersey well.
And if we wanted to do an overview, comprehensive, sit down together, it would
be great to get a cup of coffee with you, Zack.  
  
Q. Your four seniors played 39 minutes tonight. You had a four or five
minute stretch in the second half where you your guys didn't score. Do you
think fatigue set in?  
COACH LAVIN: Those kids were so tuckered out, that's why I'm so proud of them.
The combination of Dom Pointer being injured, Rysheed Jordan being in foul
trouble and obviously we know we didn't have Chris Obekpa's services and yet
it's still a 7-point game with multiple possessions and a chance to cut it
inside of 7. These kids are super heros in my eyes. I look up to them and I
told them as much after the game. I've had 27 years in the business and I
probably admire this group more than any that I've coached and it's tough to
separate who's your favorite, I had some special groups along the way. This
one, because of what they had to overcome and where they started as the
youngest team in school history. Not the youngest team in the country but the
youngest thing in school history. And those things that we just talked about,
the number of kids along the way that decided to opt for the professional
route, which I can't fault them for, if I had a chance to play for the 76ers,
I would probably opt for that, too, if I was at that age and had that
opportunity, financial gain but it made it tougher and to me the story even
more remarkable of this group of seniors who will all earn their degrees. I'm
sure they were tired emotionally, physically. They gave everything they had to
this University and they gave us a special ride this year and took us back to
the tournament so couldn't be more proud of them. But they're probably a
little tuckered out.  
  
Q. Coach, you talked about how this is your most rewarding season as a
coach and we talked about these seniors and how they define St. John's and the
program going forward. How have they changed you as a coach going forward?  
COACH LAVIN: It's a unique group. The first year I didn't get to coach them
because of the cancer, so they arrived on campus and ended up playing for a
coach other than the one who recruited them. Right there, that's not something
they signed up for, yet they had a great attitude, they were eager to learn,
they worked their fannies off that first year and made progress. Then my
second year my father passed away. So any time you go through a battle with
cancer and losing someone so close to you, and this group, there's something
special about their character, their makeup, their demeanor. These phrases we
use in coaching and teaching and education, and they're just really a special
group. So I think their resiliency, their spirit inspires me. I mean, watching
that grit and that determination, that resolve, they were so resolute,
tenacious comes to mind as a word, they're just a tenacious group that would
not be denied, which, you know, which is why they're all going to earn their
degrees and why we're here tonight. I just wish we could have taken it
further. Obviously that's what makes it tough. It's kind of a bittersweet. It
comes to an end after a great run with this great group of kids. I wish we
could take it further but San Diego State played really well and we were short
handed and they deserve to move through the brackets and we're proud of what
we did. Now we go home and regroup.  
  
Q. This is another hypothetical question, I guess, but given Rysheed's
importance to the team, did you consider keeping him out there?  
COACH LAVIN: Yes, I did.  
  
Q. Or bringing him back early?  
COACH LAVIN: Yeah, in hindsight naturally as a coach, 20/20, but my concern
was that if he picked up a third or a fourth that maybe then we would look
back at the second half if he ended up fouling out, we didn't have him down
the stretch. But we definitely considered it and then we were staying -- I
didn't feel they were pulling enough, like you know, if it got past, if they
started to go double digits, it was 10, 12, 14, 16, I think I would have gone
back to him, but the fact that I felt we were right there within striking
distance, it ended up being a two, two and a half possession game at the half.
I thought we were in a good place, Dom's injury compounded it, because Dom was
dominating the game, but then after the hip he was not the same player. He
hung in there, didn't want to be taken out. The combination of no Chris
Obekpa, then Rysheed's foul trouble, if we didn't have all three of those
working against us maybe we get inside of 5 or 4 or 3 but it put us under
duress because we've shown we can beat everybody playing 6, 7 this year. But
we need all 6 of those 7. Now we're down basically to four. When Rysheed is on
the bench, there is no Obekpa, then Dom's injured. Essentially we're playing
four in a group of seven and that was a little too much for us to sustain
against a good team at this stage of the year.  
  
MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach.

_CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

SAN DIEGO STATE - 76  
ST. JOHN'S - 64

COACH FISHER: Tonight we beat a team that's very hard to guard, and we
statistically are a pretty good defensive team and we had a hard time keeping
them in front of us, especially in the first half. They had four guys play the
whole game and they would have had, Jordan probably would have played the
whole game had he not gotten two early fouls. So we thought we could create
tired legs, but we were the ones that got tired legs in stretches, but first
half we made some shots obviously and Polee and Matt combined to make a bunch
of 3s. When you do that, you've got a chance. When we score points, we've got
a chance. We score this many points, we've got a chance against anybody. St.
John's is well-schooled, they play hard and they were very difficult to keep
out of the transition game. But our guys did a nice job, I love the way we
compete and play for one another, so really good win for San Diego State and
we're glad that we're here and going to be playing another game on Sunday.  
  
MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes?  
  
 Q. This is for Dwayne. Dwayne, you came out and took seven shots
tonight, you hit five of them and hit three of them in the first five minutes
of the game, obviously you're feeling well coming out of the gate. Talk about
that a little bit.  
DWAYNE POLEE II: My teammates found me in positions where I could shoot the
ball. I found myself open a lot of times because, you know, we have a lot of
great players on this team. You know, Coach Fish, he just does a great job of
telling me to shoot your shot and I found myself wide open so I give a lot of
credit to my teammates as well.  
  
 Q. JJ, start with you first, can you talk about just kind of how
uncomfortable it was, this was definitely not the type of game that you guys
generally get drawn into, yet you were able to really score in bunches.  
J.J. O'BRIEN: Yeah, we haven't played a team like that all year. They do a
great job of pushing the tempo and they kind of imposed their will on us early
so we kind of had to slow it down and get back to our defense in the second
half. We did a good job of getting back to how we play, getting back to our
defense, getting inside and hit people on the outside or scoring inside. They
do a good job of that but we did a good job of adapting.  
  
 Q. Dwayne, how special was this for you to have this type of game
tonight in an NCAA Tournament given everything that you've been through health
wise?  
DWAYNE POLEE II: It's just a blessing, you know. I had a lot of positive
support around me, my teammates, the whole coaching staff, my family, my
girlfriend, they just stayed positive for me and that's the reason why I'm
here right now, just living by faith and just staying really positive. It felt
really good to have a good game in the first game of the tournament.  
  
 Q. Matt, you just kind of knew things weren't going well, you guys
weren't shooting. Like Coach said, when you guys score you probably can beat
anybody or at least be in the game. When you were getting hot right there, did
you know how important it was or how important it would be to score a lot of
points against these guys because they're tough to stop?  
MATT SHRIGLEY: Yeah, definitely. They push the ball and play a lot of
transition, that's a lot of their offense. Dwayne came out, making a lot of
shots. You kind of take it upon yourself to say, okay, let me make my shot
now, and you feed off each other. Coach says it a lot, take your shot, make
your shot.  
  
 Q. Is that what it will take to beat Duke?  
MATT SHRIGLEY: Definitely. I mean, to beat anyone you have to make your shots
and score a lot of points.  
  
MODERATOR: Other questions for the student-athletes?  
  
 Q. This is for Sky, you were playing in there against I don't think
anybody taller than 6'6 to start. What was it like to kind of play where you
are the big guy in there and kind of have your way?  
SKYLAR SPENCER: It was different but I had to kind of take advantage of my
opportunities and just let everything come to me and let the game flow.  
  
 Q. For JJ, obviously Aqeel wasn't feeling a hundred percent tonight and
you guys have all said he's your emotional leader. What was it like not having
him out there in such a big game, how did you guys adjust?  
J.J. O'BRIEN: It was different, usually he's out there with us, someone had to
step in in that role, I think we all tried to step up and be a little more
vocal. Someone had to fill in, we had to adapt to situations like that. But we
definitely missed him and we hope he gets better.  
  
MODERATOR: Any other questions? Thanks, guys. Head back to the locker room.
Good job. Questions for Coach Fisher?  
  
 Q. Coach, just give us an update on Aqeel and how were you able to play
him or not play him based on how he was feeling?  
COACH FISHER: At our open shoot around here yesterday, came into the arena
feeling good. Towards the end, he told Tom that he didn't feel great, had a
knot in his stomach. By the time we got back, he could hardly stand up. I
think they've attributed it to some form of food poison. He had an IV last
night. He had another IV this morning and he probably still is feeling pretty
miserable, but he said I'm good to go. He tried and competed, like AQ
competes, but he was not obviously at full strength. And hopefully we'll have
a day and a half to get him ready because we need him.  
  
 Q. Coach, what can you say about Duke? You have a big game ahead of you
playing them and it's going to be a tough match-up, they had a pretty good
game themselves tonight.  
COACH FISHER: They did, and they've had a lot of pretty good games, which is
why they're the No. 1 seed. We're glad that we're playing. It's them that we
have to play. We were 8 seed. That's the math, I used to teach math and we
will definitely have our hands full. But our players compete and if we make
shots and that's a big if, we will have an opportunity to make it interesting.
We know not only are they a terrific team but they are a premiere program that
is in that elite stratosphere, and that's where all the rest of us aspire to
get. We're inching our way along, building our own resume. They've got a
pretty good one that's built on a number of years of great, great teams. Our
players and our fans will be very excited to play the game and we'll see what
happens.  
  
 Q. Steve, I think you shot 16 3s in the first half and I don't think
you've shot more than 17 in the last nine games. Every game has its ebb and
flow, but were you at all surprised by that number, that high number there?  
COACH FISHER: Well, the 3s we got were wide open 3s, and they were taken by
guys that can shoot and make 3s. And between Dwayne and Matt, they made a
bunch, and I saw highlights of, I think it was, Davidson or one of the games
where a player banked it in and he turned to the TV and said I called that. DP
did not call his two banks but they were well received on our end. You have to
get a little bit lucky and we were ready to talk about had we continued to
shoot them and not make them about play inside out, throw the ball to JJ or
throw the ball inside and play inside out. But the 3s we had were great looks.  
  
 Q. Steve, I'm going to try to sneak in two questions. One, how much did
you watch tape of St. John's with Obekpa and what kind of a difference might
he have made in this game? And on Duke, where does Jahlil Okafor rank against
some of the great freshmen in college basketball you've seen and coached
against?  
COACH FISHER: Well, St. John's is not as good a team obviously without the big
shot block or the inside presence. We knew he wasn't going to play so I
watched very little without him. I did watch some segments, but they're
different. They're like us. When Skylar's not in there we're a little bit
different. When they get to the rim they can finish. When we get to the rim
tonight we could finish, and with him in there it would have been harder for
us to finish up going to the rim, but we earned a win tonight against the team
that they had. Okafor is a terrific player. I'm not an NBA scout but everyone
says he's going to be the No. 1 guy taken in the NBA draft this year. He knows
how to play, he plays within himself, he's a legitimate center that wants to
be a center and doesn't care to drift out and shoot 3-pointers. He's a hard
guy for anybody to guard. I don't like to do a lot of ranking because I'm not
very good at it, but I know he's good.  
  
 Q. Coach, from going essentially facing a five guard lineup in St.
John's how much of a transition will it be facing Jahlil Okafor, Marshall
Plumlee and Justise Winslow at Duke?  
COACH FISHER: Every game has a different storyline. Every game has a different
way that you have to play. Tonight our No. 1 concern is who's going to cry
uncle first, can we get back and can we have a bigger lineup and stay in front
of people without them driving around us time and time again. Obviously with a
smaller team, point of emphasis, go rebound the ball, go rebound a miss. I
think we had 13 out of 28 misses. We had a goal, rebound half of our missed
shots, so we were close on that tonight. The thing we did tonight, we not only
rebounded them, we got them in the basket. We got several points off of
offensive rebounds and Sunday will be different obviously. They've got some
size, and size that's quality, but they've got some perimeter play that will
be hard to deal with, too.  
  
 Q. Steve, it's essential obviously to win at this point in the season.
How proud are you of your guys, playing a team like they had not played all
season, that they did find a way to get it under control and to win and
advance?  
COACH FISHER: I've loved every team I've ever had but this is a unique group
and we're fed by our fifth year seniors. Got three of them, AQ, Polee and
O'Brien, and JJ is someone that I use often, play like JJ. If you have a team
that will be willing to give up -- give of themselves, we had to say, JJ,
we're going to play through you and we want you to be a facilitator when
needed but an aggressor to score, he's as happy if he scores two points or if
he scores 22 as long as we win. So this was a good win for our program. We
want to continue to play. This is a stage, as all of us know, where everybody
starts watching, the eyeballs multiply with each victory. So we'll have more
folks watching, it will be a bigger deal come Sunday, and if we happen to win,
it will be a bigger deal come next week in Houston.  
  
MODERATOR: Anyone else? Thanks, Coach.

_CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

MICHIGAN STATE - 70  
GEORGIA - 63

COACH FOX: Hard fought game. Michigan State is a very good basketball team,
and we congratulate them. Took us a while to settle down offensively. We
turned it over in the first half, not so much in the second. And then late in
the game we kind of, I thought our defense began to stabilize but I never
really was comfortable with how we were defending most of the night, but we
competed and we just had to play uphill. We had a very good start and then we
burped there for a minute in the first half and we had to play uphill, which
is so hard to do. They have a very good team, we wish them well and they
certainly earned the win.  
  
MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes, please raise your hand.  
  
Q. Two questions for the players. First, were there early game jitters
at all, and also, did it seem like you guys did sort of struggle to get into a
flow offensively?  
NEMANJA DJURISIC: I think we started the game very well. I think we were ready
to compete. I think emotions got us throughout the game because there were up
and downs every game. But throughout the game we just couldn't, first half
especially we couldn't stabilize. Our defense dictated the tempo and we just
gave up a lot of easy buckets in transition, which hurt us definitely and put
us behind and it's very, very hard to play against such a good team behind.  
  
MARCUS THORNTON: I thought we came out stronger, like Neme said. We didn't
deal with our first bout of adversity very well. Michigan State, they played
like a team that's been here before. So when you're playing against a team
like that, there's only a very limited margin for error. So it kind of caught
up to us in the end.  
  
MODERATOR: No others? Thanks, guys. Questions for Coach Fox?  
  
Q. Coach, was Kenny injured or did he re-aggravate his foot in the
second half?  
COACH FOX: Well, Kenny is injured. We knew he would be injured today. There's
no way to get him a hundred percent right now, and I thought under the
circumstances, it's very hard to play this game when you don't practice,
extremely hard to maintain your conditioning, your timing, and everything else
that you need to do. Under the circumstances, I thought he gave us a heck of
an effort. He's certainly fatigued. He was not nearly the defender he's been
this year because he can't cut and change directions. I give our trainers
credit and Kenny credit for getting as close to being able to play as he
could. But obviously we had some in and out and he wasn't quite as effective
as he's been earlier in the year but that's part of it.  
  
Q. Was that why maybe it was so hard to handle Trice?  
COACH FOX: Trice is a really good player, and when healthy is a great defender
and Trice requires a great defender. They have a very good team with he and
Valentine, they can spread you out and obviously they're very confident
shooting the ball. So it's one of the things we hoped to do was slow those
guys down, which I don't think we did very well in the first half. I thought
there were spurts in the second half we did a little better shot.  
  
Q. Branden Dawson picks up his second foul and I think you guys are up
11-5 or in that range. Did you think at that point that was a major break but
at that point Marvin Clark came in and almost seemed to give them a boost
offensively?  
COACH FOX: I don't think Michigan State has bad players, I think they have
quality depth, and so we didn't see it as a real advantage quite frankly. It
was not something that we focused on obviously. Dawson's a very good player,
but it was just part of the game. I thought we had -- had both of them been
two fouls, it might be a little advantage for us but their depth up front
certainly showed.  
  
MODERATOR: Any other questions? Okay, thank you, Coach.  
  
COACH FOX: Thank you

MICHIGAN STATE - 70  
GEORGIA - 63

MODERATOR: About to start with Michigan State.  
  
COACH IZZO: My father told me nothing would be easy, and we kind of live on
that, to be honest with you. I thought we played about three, four different
games today. I thought Georgia came out and really played well early and did
everything they do. What they do, we swear we weren't going to let them get to
the line 25 times and we didn't, they got there 26. We've been a team that has
been assists, we had 18. We did some of the things we do, they did some of the
things they do. Very good rebounding team, I loved the way they rebounded and
I thought they never quit. We made a couple of mistakes again, but for the
most part if you added up the minutes we played well, there would be a lot of
them. As they say, it's win and advance, that's what we're going to do and
move forward.  
  
MODERATOR: Questions for Travis, Branden and Denzel.  
  
 Q. For Travis, you're kind of emblematic of a Michigan State player.
Going to your senior year you basically doubled your production. What is it
about the program that guys always get better, especially by the time they're
seniors? Trice?  
TRAVIS TRICE: I think there's a lot of factors into this. Our coaches do a
great job of developing us from freshmen to senior year, they're pretty good
about spotting guys they feel they can help improve, but really it's your
teammates honestly, when you're going against a Denzel Valentine every day and
a Brenden Dawson every day, you have no choice but to get better. That's -- I
owe it to my teammates.  
  
 Q. One of the Georgia players said Michigan State played like they've
been here before. Did that experience help you, particularly in the last
minute they made the run and you had to hit those free throws?  
BRANDEN DAWSON: Yeah, as far as myself, Travis and Denzel, we've been in this
position plenty of times and in the huddle Travis mentioned we've been in the
position against Wisconsin where we had a big lead and we just didn't keep our
poise. In this game we kept our poise and throughout the game and as far as
myself and Travis and Denzel we just have to lead the young guys, we
definitely have been in this position, I wouldn't say just against Wisconsin;
we've been in this position plenty of times throughout the season.  
  
 Q. You pick up that second foul and have to sit for the final 14
minutes. Talk about what that was like in the first half, and in your second
half you've been about as efficient as you've been scoring around the
basket?  
BRANDEN DAWSON: I was frustrated. When I got my second foul, I was definetely
frustrated, but as far as my teammates and Coach Fife, they just picked me up,
they told me in the second half I have to play better. I actually had three
fouls, finished the game with three fouls but in that situation where your
team needs you, you just have to play smart like Coach has been telling us
throughout the season, play hard and smart, that's what I did, played hard and
smart even though I was in foul trouble.  
  
 Q. Denzel, can you talk about 6-6 from the free throw line, what your
mindset was in such a tight situation?  
DENZEL VALENTINE: I just knew that I didn't play my best second half so I
didn't want to let the team down. If we had a loss or something like that, I
didn't want to say it's because of me. So I just went to the line like I'm
going to make up for it and I just knocked them down.  
  
 Q. For Travis, Georgia said that Kenny Gaines was battling an injury.
Were you aware of that, and did that feed into your aggressiveness going into
the basket? Trice?  
TRAVIS TRICE: I knew he had missed some game towards the end of the year
because of the ankle but at this point in the season, I mean, all that goes
out the window. You know he's going to come out and play hard and he's got a
shot to play in the NCAA Tournament, so my thing was just sticking to our game
plan honestly.  
  
 Q. Travis and Denzel, when Georgia came out in the second half and cut
the lead to two, and they had a chance to tie, Matt made a nice defensive
play, that spearheaded a run, I think Brenden Forbes hit a couple of 3s,
Branden had and-1 in that stretch. What was going on on the court
communication-wise? What do you think fueled you guys to answer their
challenge and answer a run right when they were ready to cut it to 2 and tie
it?  
TRAVIS TRICE: Our thing was just sticking together. Basketball's a game of
runs, other teams are going to make a run but it's how you respond. Our thing
was huddle up and stick together. We've been in this situation before and
there were times we kind of fell apart and we knew we he couldn't do that this
time. We had to stick together.  
  
DENZEL VALENTINE: Like Travis said, we just wanted to stay together, stay
together and keep working, keep fighting. We can't control if our shots are
going in but we can control what we do and how we respond. So we just wanted
to respond in a way that let us to win the game.  
  
 Q. For Denzel and Travis, two months ago could you have survived a game
where in the first half Branden's in that kind of foul trouble, and Travis,
you got off good looks but missing shots. What's happened to you guys from
your other pieces on this team, could you have survived that two months ago?  
DENZEL VALENTINE: I don't know, you know. That's a good question. Give credit
to, we're going to give credit to Marvin and Colby, they played big minutes
for us, they came in and were ready to play early in the season. We wouldn't
know what we would get but those guys have stepped up big time, not just this
game but in the Big Ten tournament and a couple games late in the season, they
stepped up their play, so those guys came in and played good.  
  
TRAVIS TRICE: Like Denzel said, that's a tough question to answer but I
honestly feel more confident now with our guys coming off the bench and some
of our other guys, just the way they're playing right now, the energy and the
focus they're doing has been great for us.  
  
 Q. For any of the guys, going on his question about how this team
always gets better it seems this time of year. Is that the result of Coach?
What do you think it is as to why Michigan State at this time of year is
always playing at its best?  
BRANDEN DAWSON: I would say it's just our focus. Coming into this game, we
wanted to be different. We've been watching all the rest of the games and we
saw that good teams, the Baylor and Iowa States, those guys just came out and
I think they were too focused on just the seeding. Tonight Coach mentioned to
us let's be different. So we just wanted to play better, we just wanted to
come out and play hard and I think around this time is just our focus and we
were just dialed in.  
  
 Q. Branden, you've obviously been through this before. What is it about
this time of year that always seems to bring out the best in you guys?  
BRANDEN DAWSON: Well, I'll just say just having a great coach as far as Coach
Izzo and I would say our coaching staff, they do a great job of getting us
prepared. We had an up and down season but I think our chemistry has been
great, especially playing in the Big Ten tournament, I think that's when our
chemistry really started to flourish. As far as the team, like I said as far
as myself, Travis and Denzel, we just have to lead these guys and I think our
chemistry has to keep flowing in those late game situations.  
  
MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Izzo?  
  
 Q. Tom, there was a point this year where I think you just benched your
entire bench, so to speak, you just couldn't get anything out of them. To get
what you had out of that first half this year with Marvin and get that run,
where is that group?  
COACH IZZO: First of all, I benched myself a few games so I can appreciate
that. They learned. Marvin hasn't played a lot of basketball, a lot of years
of it so it took him a little while longer and we've got to remember like with
an Alvin Ellis, he was out the first six, seven weeks of the season. The first
game he sprains that ankle. He was out until right before Christmas. When
you're not a great player, it's hard to come back from that. And then we
couldn't get him time. It was Big Ten time and then we got him time by
necessity because of foul trouble and that, I think they got a little better
and I think they are practicing a little better. Matt has been really good,
him coming off the bench, too. And today he had been really good up until
today and just struggled a little bit today.  
  
 Q. You guys had a good run in the first half, got the transition going
a little bit. Did that come out of defense or what? And that's with Branden on
the bench. What was going well during that time?  
COACH IZZO: I thought we turned them over a little better or they turned
themselves over. One of our struggles has been keeping guys off the free throw
line. Seemed like they did what they did well, didn't have that many
turnovers, we only had nine, but we scored some baskets off turnovers, that
was one thing. We put them on the line a little bit early and didn't defend
very well, we started doing a better job of that. But I thought we got a
running game going of makes, misses, rebounds, turnovers, and I thought that
was the difference in the game in the first half. Give them credit. I'll tell
you something, this is a very good team. I'm proud of them, not because my
nephew's there. I'm proud of them because I've seen Mark go through some of
the same things I went through, where people are questioning this, that and
the other thing. We played a lot of good teams this year, that's as good a
team as we played. They got in a little foul trouble, too. I do think the
injury to Gaines was big. I watched him warm up and he was limping on that
thing and he still got 12 or 14 points, but that kid's a hell of a player. I
think that hurt. I thought we did a decent job on their two bigs. We couldn't
re-bound with them, which is disappointing but I thought we did a decent job
of walling them, we worked hard on that for three days. But that is a good
basketball team. Tough, runs a lot of good stuff. I just thought our fast
break was the difference in the game the first half and then in the second
half the same thing, once they cut the lead we got a couple quick buckets off
the break and that was the difference.  
  
 Q. In your running game, it's always been a staple of this team this
year, a lot of years but is it better now even -- I mean, the half court's
game a lot better, but is it better now than it was earlier?  
COACH IZZO: I think it is, I think BJ's pushing a little hard, and I think Tum
pushes it a little bit. And we have two wings that can shoot it. We had some
bizarre lineups in there because of the foul trouble we were in, but I
definitely think our running game is really good. The problem we have, we like
to what we call blitz and break, run up, makes and misses but for most of the
year, we did not have enough subs, and we were wearing Trice and Valentine
down to nothing. Now we're trying to get back to running, I still don't have
the substitution pattern I would like to have, but we're an interesting team.
You saw a lot of good minutes and then you saw some bizarre plays and I think
Georgia deserves some credit for that and we deserve some blame for that but
we're doing what you're supposed to do in this tournament. We survived and
we're advancing, and it's going to get tougher each game but I think we
learned something from the past games, especially the Wisconsin game.
Hopefully we'll keep moving forward here and our break is a big part of that.  
  
 Q. Coach, is there something that you would pinpoint as to the reason
why Matt was so inefficient from the field tonight?  
COACH IZZO: This is where you wish you were a politician, don't you, so you
could be politically correct? Hell, no, I can't figure it out myself. I think
he's having trouble figuring it out, too. He did some good things, he guarded
pretty well, he blocked some shots. He got six, seven rebounds, but I don't
know, I don't know. You know, I think I'll blame it on one of my assistants,
that's what we do at this level. Blame it on somebody, sure as hell isn't
going to be the head coach and you can't blame a player so one of my
assistants is in big trouble when we get back.  
  
 Q. Tom, given that you've heard your players say chemistry's at its
best so far this season, given that they're describing having learned lessons
and are applying them to games now, do you feel like the potential for this
team may be the highest that it's been?  
COACH IZZO: I think it's the highest it's been this year, but I think it's
pretty easy to see we're not a typical Michigan State team. We don't have
maybe as much talent as we had. We do have -- I appreciated Branden, but we've
had chemistry all year. We tell our guys you have to play hard enough, good
enough and smart enough. For the most part, we play hard. A lot of times we
play good. Now, the third one, that's got to fall on me because we're just not
playing as smart as we need to play in certain situations, and it's cost us,
between that and some free throws, it's cost us during the year. But we have
played well enough to be in a lot of games and I do think that it was fun to
listen to the players say, okay, remember what we learned in Wisconsin at
halftime in the huddles they said it. That's encouraging because that means
they're not treating the history like it's just that is the way it is, you
treat it that you can't change it but you learn from it. I think we had enough
guys that played well to win, we had enough guys that played poorly to keep my
job and coach, and now in the next two days we have to figure out what we did
right and wrong and somehow to stop one of these two teams we could play. I
think this team has had good chemistry, maybe as good as we've had in a long,
long time, they get along well, they hang together, they do everything
together, we don't have the super star syndrome and it's been fun to watch
them grow together. Sometimes, I've got to tell you, it's an out of body
experience once in a while the things we do for no reason. Clock's on our
side, we talk about it and we've made a few mistakes. I guess somewhere
seriously I've got to take onus on that because it's my job to make sure they
know what they're doing at certain times. We'll try to get better with that in
the next two days.  
  
 Q. Tom, to me that first half was as physical a basketball game as I've
seen and you let the kids play. Can you comment on the physicality, especially
in the second half?  
COACH IZZO: I know those are two physical guys we played against but they
probably think we are, too. For me, going through what I went through in my 20
years here, I constantly say this is like belly bumping. This isn't physical
at all compared to the way it used to be and thank God it's not that way
anymore. But I would agree. I think we learned something at Illinois and then
Purdue and then Indiana and Maryland and Wisconsin. We got tougher this year.
We were not a very tough team, we were not. We've gotten tougher, but I would
say that the proof's in the pudding. We might have played a little better, but
that was a tough team we played against. They had men on those boards, they
went after them, they did a hell of a job. That is a good basketball team, a
well-coached basketball team and I think one that has -- he's going to do
hopefully what I did. People were on my butt and we made it and all of a
sudden we took off. I think he's got a lot of bright days ahead of us at
Georgia.  
  
 Q. You said you wanted to follow without defending, that was one of the
keys?  
COACH IZZO: They shot 26 free throws so we did a hell of a job on that, but go
on.  
  
 Q. Especially early on, Branden gets a couple. Was he maybe too keyed
up, I think he bit on a pump fake, he helped on one, looked like he read what
the offense was going to do? What were your thoughts?  
COACH IZZO: Well, when you're too keyed up you sometimes can make mistakes or
when you're not focused in on what the scouting report says, those guys are
tremendous shot-fakers. Djurisic is unbelievable, I watch film after film.
It's easy to coach that, and tell them this is what he is going to do, but
when he's doing it on the floor I think it is different. Sometimes coaches
don't appreciate that but I think it's harder than you think. After that first
little part I think we did a decent job defending them, but, boy, when I
looked out there and there was Marv and Colby, I said wow, just hold on and
that's what we tried to do. Then we started building on it because of a couple
turnovers.  
  
 Q. You kind of go into where I was headed. Marv and Colby at the end of
that first half came in and played some pretty strong defensive minutes for
you guys. Obviously at the end Wollenman had that foul, but can you talk about
the job and the minutes that both those guys had?  
COACH IZZO: It was phenomenal. We just had no choice. Colby is a doctor, he's
in medical school so smart as they come and you really could -- he really
understands things. And Marv is a guy that I think has grown as much as
anybody. He was a kid that didn't play until he got to high school so he's
behind in some ways. He's improving, he's listening. His roommate is Tum Tum
and Javon. It might not sound like it, but I'm so excited that we're moving on
because not only do you worry about the first game more than any game, but the
first game against what I knew was a solid team -- I would rather play a team
that's got crazy athletes and not as solid than I would that's kind of like
us, that's solid, they can grind it, they can run a little bit, and I will say
that a healthy Gaines I think might have made that game a little different,
too. But we've had some injuries all year, we'll take it. I'm excited where
we're going and looking forward to the challenge ahead of us on whichever team
wins.

_CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

DUKE - 85  
ROBERT MORRIS - 56

COACH KRZYZEWSKI: First of all, just congratulations to Robert Morris. Not
just a good team but an outstanding program. This is their 8th appearance in
the NCAA Tournament and they've also had a number of NIT appearances, and what
Andy's done is not just built a good team but a really good program. Whenever
you beat a team that's a good program, that means even more. They have a well-
conceived offense to take advantage of those individual skills of Reed, Jones
and Pryor. Those kids can really score the ball. I thought our defense was
excellent tonight and we obviously shared the ball really well. To have 28
assists in a game is fantastic. Our bench, especially Marshall and Amile, gave
us a huge boost. They were real veterans in this game with offense and --
offense and on defense, they were outstanding. And then Quinn had another
outstanding game. We feel good about our performance. Grayson got 12 minutes
tonight, we weren't sure how long he would be able to play. Hopefully that's a
sign of him getting back into really good health. Any questions that y'all
might have.  
  
MODERATOR: Questions first for Quinn and Marshall.  
  
 Q. This question is for Quinn. Your leadership skills have really shown
through this season. You were on a couple of the Duke teams that had some
disappointing losses in the NCAA Tournament. What did you tell to the younger
guys on your team in order to get them motivated for the tournament, or did
you need to tell them anything?  
QUINN COOK: Yeah, it's a new year, it's a new team, it's a new season, we're
0-0. We played in some big-time games and earned a spot here in the NCAA
Tournament. I just told them to be their selves. I don't want them thinking a
lot so I kind of let them be themselves and act instinctively. Justise and Jah
made some big-time plays in the second half when they cut it to ten and
Grayson, him being under the weather, him getting some minutes out there was
good so going into the game Sunday, whoever we play, we have that confidence
with one game under our belt.  
  
 Q. Quinn, when you have bigs inside like Jahlil and Marshall, how much
easier does that make it for the guards?  
QUINN COOK: A lot easier, they create so much attention and they're always
talking on defense, helping us out. The guards in pick and roll situations.
They carve a lot of space out so for early drives if we don't hit them,
they're very unselfish, so when they get the ball inside, if they don't have a
shot inside they pass it out, so those two make our jobs easier as guards.  
  
 Q. You talked about telling the guys just be yourselves. What kind of
fine line is it to kind of be yourselves and be loose like it certainly seemed
you were and then when Jahlil missed that reverse dunk, and we'll talk to Mike
about that later, what's the fine line there being yourselves and also being
into the game one hundred percent?  
QUINN COOK: Just making the right plays, just -- we know what we need to do.
We've played in big, big time games where we know we can't have that. You
know, two points can end your season. Freshman mistake, Jah knows that that
and he bounced back from it. He made some big time plays when he made that
run.  
  
 Q. Either one of the players, after they cut it to 10, what did you do
really well down the stretch?  
MARSHALL PLUMLEE: I thought we really came together and responded. I think
there was a timeout, they got a little emotional, and every team here is very
capable of winning, they wouldn't be here if they weren't. So it can turn
around just like that and we've got to be ready and be able to respond. So I
would have to say it came from a little bit of emotion and drive that came
from a timeout.  
  
QUINN COOK: Yeah, like what Marshall said, Coach called a timeout and just
told us we're fine, we're missing some shots, we missed some open shots. They
hit some tough shots and that's how the game goes. The crowd got some momentum
to those guys and we made some big time plays. Justise's 3 was big time for
him to struggle in the first half and come out and have six big time points
was big for us. I hope it gives those guys confidence as freshmen, get that
good game under their belt. We'll be back on Sunday.  
  
 Q. Quinn, you get your first couple of 3s, how big is that to get it
going because obviously it seemed to sustain you and, it seemed, your
teammates throughout the game?  
QUINN COOK: It's big, just for a player's confidence just to see a shot go in.
Myself and Tyus have a great chemistry, so it's tough to guard. We work on
that in practice, so to see some shots go in was great, and cause a lot of
attention, when I hit a couple, guys run out to me and open things up. Coach
is always telling me keep shooting, doesn't matter if I miss six in a row, 10
in a row, he wants me to keep shooting so that does a lot for my confidence as
well.  
  
MODERATOR: Thanks, guys, congratulations. Questions for Coach?  
  
 Q. Mike, how do you draw the line between guys having fun and being
loose and not being as focused as they need to?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: You see it. I'm with them every day and I know them. We have
great relationships with our guys. So specially in this tournament, you want
them to be loose. I thought to begin at the beginning of the game a couple of
our freshmen were -- they didn't talk. Jah, Justise, they weren't talking,
they weren't themselves and that's why Marshall and Amile coming into the game
gave us a huge boost. You just do it by feel. I know them well enough, I feel
like I can get emotional, funny, serious and they'll respond because of the
relationships that are built. It's my responsibility to spontaneously act when
I do have a feel, when I do see something, and for them to react to me. And
they've done that and they did it tonight.  
  
 Q. Sort of following up on that, how much, I guess, were you trying to
-- what message were you trying to get across to your guys when you're
teaching a young team in the tournament in that second half timeout?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Which second half timeout? We had a number of them.  
  
 Q. When Jahlil missed the dunk.  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Well, you can't do that. That's the easy message. Like,
don't do that, especially don't do it when you've played four consecutive
minutes and you're tired. You just can't do that. So, I mean that's an easy
one.  
  
 Q. Coach, Marshall Plumlee seems to be really coming on. Is that
something you're seeing in practice or is it in the games or a little bit of
both?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: I think it's the last month really. Marshall has been
consistently good. He's had great practices. He's had mature, veteran
practices where he never takes a possession off, he's talking, he's sharp, and
it really sets a good tone, and it translates because he does that in the
practice. And in the game tonight, our guys threw three lobs to him, maybe
four, and that's showing confidence in him. But he deserves that because he
and Amile really did a great job for us tonight.  
  
 Q. Coach, could you talk about Quinn's leadership and just how the
whole dynamic has worked so well with him and Tyus this year?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: It's been a fabulous dynamic. They have a great
relationship. I saw in somebody's article, I do read articles, not every one,
but where someone had interviewed Austin Rivers, and Austin made a point I
think, which is very, very good, is that as a freshman you don't know about
how much you should talk about different things, and to have an upperclassman
say that's what you should do, especially when it's an upperclassman who has a
big-time role on the team like Quinn does. We as coaches say these things, but
when Quinn says them in his own language and his own way, they resonate even
better. This is our 30th win. He's led us to a fabulous season and hopefully
he'll lead us further into this tournament.  
  
 Q. Coach, what gives you the drive that you have that you win so much;
you won national championships, you won regular season championship. What
motivates you and keeps your drive up to keep winning like you do?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: I want to win, I still have the desire to prepare to win and
want to win, but along with that, I have a responsibility to have the drive
for the players that I have the privilege to coach. I mean, I shouldn't coach
unless I have the drive and you can't fake it, you can't fake it. And these
kids deserve it. It's their moment. I don't like to bring up what's been done
in the past, whether we've won or we've lost, because we've already done that.
It's what you're doing right now and how emotionally and mentally ready you
can be to help your team. And my staff's done a good job. I love my guys. It's
easy to do that, for me it's always come easy to have drive. Now, I'm not
necessarily smart. Sometimes I haven't been the smartest guy or whatever, but
the passion to win has never been a thing I've run out of yet.  
  
 Q. Mike, when you came back after the ACC tournament in preparation for
this tournament, what was the demeanor of the practices? High? Was there any
letdown?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: No, good. Again, we tried to prepare for this like we did
for the ACC tournament, and in that we had about 40 minutes of contact the
first day just to get back to playing some defense, but then after that was
individual work, 5 on 0, and to try to get fresh. Grayson didn't practice
until he got here. The open practice here was the first time Grayson has
played this week since the ACC tournament. And Quinn was sick last week, so we
wanted to make sure he wasn't rundown. And then Jah started -- we saw some
improvement with him and that's what we've done. We thought we played great in
the first game of the ACC tournament for some reason, we didn't play as well
for more than half of a game, and then we almost won that game. And so we
weren't -- we weren't going to punish our guys or anything like that. We
didn't want to wear them out, we wanted to get them healthy.  
  
 Q. Robert Morris runs usually a three guard set. You guys had a lot of
success in the front court. Was that something you saw coming in today, that
that's maybe something we can exploit?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: I don't know about exploiting it but what we tried to do was
not let them walk into their offense. When they walk into their offense, then
they have more energy. You have three explosive players. This way, they have
to, even if we didn't turn them over, we didn't think we were going to turn
them over, although we did a couple times, was more working in their offense
already and maybe having them out a little bit further than if they just
walked into it. Overall, it was good and I thought Matt did a really good job.
Matt sets a tone defensively for us.  
  
 Q. I just want you to talk about Justise and the stretch after they cut
it to 10, he had a 3, took two defensive rebounds, one for the layup, one to
feed Tyus for the 3. He really kind of kick-started you at that point.  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: He made the biggest play of the game when it was down to 10.
Robert Morris fought the entire game and put themselves in a position with
double digit minutes to maybe win the game. Justise had 6 points but the 3
points were worth a lot. I don't know how many, a lot. And then his verve
during that time, and Jah during that time all of a sudden went from 10 to 18
real quick. But that was -- I mean, that was a key part of the game and
Justise was key along with Jah during that time to get us back because there's
a lot of game -- just the tournament's different and you can get a lot of
pressure on yourself and have no pressure on the other team when they're
placed in a position like that. Justise really responded.

_CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

VIRGINIA - 79  
BELMONT - 67

COACH BYRD: First off, we played a great basketball team. Virginia made the
winning plays in the last three minutes that we didn't make, and they deserve
to win. They were the better team. That being said, I'm certainly proud of our
team's performance, I'm proud of their fight and grit and determination and
the plays that they made, and we played a great team and I don't have the
play-by-play but somewhere in the neighborhood of three minutes we had a real,
real chance to win that basketball game and just didn't get it done. They did
and they get to play Sunday, but this team right here's come a long way and
I'm lucky to coach them.  
  
MODERATOR: Questions? For the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Craig, you had things going there from 3 point range. What did you
see in their defense that allowed you to exploit that and can you just talk
about the feeling you had shooting the ball today?  
CRAIG BRADSHAW: I mean, honestly we just had a great game plan, we ran a lot
of stuff for down screens and we had a lot of open shots. My shot felt good.
That's about it.  
  
COACH BYRD: You guys think that bank shot was an accident but honestly he does
it all the time from right there. I'm not going to make him say for sure but
I'm about 90 percent sure he meant to bank that, truthfully.  
  
Q. Looked like when your offense was spreaded out, looked like you was
more effective then. What happened?  
MODERATOR: Directed for who?  
  
Q. For the Coach.  
MODERATOR: Student-athlete questions first.  
  
Q. Reece, you knew going in they were awfully good defensively. Were
they everything you thought they would be? And how did you counter their
toughness, because you guys did make your run?  
REECE CHAMBERLAIN: They're a great team, we knew that coming in, that the
shots we normally get were going to come tough. I thought we did a great job,
and there's only one stretch in the first half where we kind of got carried
away and didn't run offense but I think overall we did a pretty good job of
moving the ball and working in until we got some good shots.  
  
Q. Evan, the free throws, 25 to 6, did you kind of feel that they were
really taking it to you inside and how did you feel you dealt with their
height advantage?  
EVAN BRADDS: They shot a lot more free throws than us but I think it was just
because at the end we probably fouled seven or eight times so there's probably
14 right there. They're big guys, big, tall strong guys and they're hard to
deal with down there. Gill's a monster and he got to the line a lot tonight.  
  
MODERATOR: Any other questions?  
  
Q. Craig, when you hit the second of those two 3s and cut it to 62-60,
what did you think, did you think you guys were going to win the game at that
point?  
CRAIG BRADSHAW: I don't think you ever think you're going to win the game
against those guys, they string together some stops. I felt good about how I
was shooting. We were running a good offense and they just made some good
stops at the end, made more winning plays in the end.  
  
Q. Bradshaw and Bradds, you're coming back next season how do you feel
about this team going forward, do you feel like you'll be here again at this
very place in the NCAA Tournament in 2016?  
CRAIG BRADSHAW: I don't think you can say anything for sure but we have a
really young team and Mack Mercer played great tonight and I'm really looking
forward to his development. Amanze is the starter, we've got really young
guys, I think we're going to be really good next year. It's up to us.  
  
EVAN BRADDS: Like he said we are very young. I'm excited, we all work really
hard, so we're just hoping we can work hard enough to get back here next year.  
  
Q. The question is like when you had your offense spreaded out, looked
like it was more effective then than it was when they standing in their
position which they was getting the ball on the corners and at the top of the
key and your guys was hitting the 3s and stuff and looked like your offense,
well, that was a stop and they just went, you know?  
COACH BYRD: Looked like bad coaching, didn't it? We got out in the first half
and then a couple of times in the second half, we got out of the things that
we're supposed to do and tried to make things happen individually and you're
just not going to do that against a team that guards as good one-on-one as
they do. A big play was the play we kicked it out and they deflected it and
then our guy still reached out and touched it and it went out of bounds, that
was a big play. And we actually got Taylor Barnette two or three really good
looks late off of a throw back down screen kind of play and he made the shot
that got us here or we wouldn't be here. But those didn't go down today and to
beat Virginia, you've got to make plays like that. So we got a little stagnant
every time, but there's a lot of great basketball teams that tried to score it
good against Virginia and haven't been as effective as we have, so I was
overall pleased with the offensive execution and performance.  
  
Q. I was going to ask you about Taylor. Do you think he was pressing at
all or do you feel that they were very familiar with him?  
COACH BYRD: No, I thought he took -- he's 1-7 from 3 and I thought at least
two of those were quick and long. He and Craig both had some early that were
too early in the shot clock to take the shot they had to take. And then, you
know, 3-pointer shooters are going to have their good days and their bad days
and you live and die with it sometime and I just think he had a bad day. I
don't think he was -- look, he is an easygoing guy that doesn't seem to be
impacted much by pressure situations. If he was ever going to press, it would
have been on the shot he had to make to get us here and he didn't hit the rim
with it. So you look at any great 3-pointer shooter and they're going to have
one 1-7 days and they're going to have 6-7 days.  
  
Q. In the first half I think they matched you 5-12 on 3s. Were you
expecting that kind of shooting by them on the perimeter, and what did you do
to stop it later?  
COACH BYRD: Well, I don't know that we did a whole lot to stop it. We talked
about defense every timeout, all during halftime. Brogdon just had a really
good first half and not such a good second half shooting the basketball. It
looked to me like their shots from 3 just didn't go down. I think they focused
more on getting the ball inside and I think that's a big answer to the foul
shot discrepancy is that they had an inside game that we knew we would
struggle with if they went in that direction too much.  
  
Q. Can you speak to Bradshaw's day? He almost seemed like he kind of
willed you back into the game when it was a double-digit lead?  
COACH BYRD: When Craig plays like he did today and he's obviously a first team
OVC guy and played like that a lot he makes us a way better team. He's
fearless. He loves situations like that, that he's in. Who he's playing
against and the circumstances in the game matter not to him at all. I like
him. Plus he's just good enough, he's just athletic enough and simply good
enough to play against defenders from Virginia. And frankly we try hard but we
don't -- we don't get ACC level players very often, and he is that.  
  
Q. Rick, you seem to have better success on the screen roll getting the
ball to the basket maybe more than other teams have had. Was your 3-point
threat part of that or was it execution?  
COACH BYRD: I think when you have at least one big that can pop back and make
it, they can't have nearly as much help on the screen-and-roll as they
ordinarily would. Again it's funny but there aren't many -- I watched a lot of
their games and a lot of people they played, I watched a ton of ball screen
clips and there aren't many people at that level of basketball that really
have, Wisconsin obviously does, but really have the bigs that can pop back out
and shoot 3s. I know they were ready and I know they talked about it but it's
one of the hardest things to guard in basketball is a big guy that can set a
ball screen and pop back. You can ask Tony, but I think they did some things
they haven't done all year long about switching ball screens with Nick Smith
in for us that at least I haven't seen, and Taylor either didn't tell me the
truth but he said they don't switch nothing. That's what you say when you're
from Kentucky, they don't switch nothing. And Tennessee, I'm not throwing off
on Kentucky.  
  
Q. You pushed out to a really quick lead and then again in the second
half when you made your run to get back into it, you guys were playing at a
pretty fast pace, was that part of the game plan today to make a conscious
effort to push it?  
COACH BYRD: Yeah, you know, I don't think -- first of all, we like to play
that way, I like to play that way. In fact I like to play that way more than
our guys do. I'm always on them to sprint the floor. I think if you let
Virginia set up that defense, get their defense set every time and say, you
know, okay, guys, have at it, they're just going to shut you down. They're the
best defensive team in the country. So I told them before the game, even if we
only get 3 points, even if we only get 5 points on fast break situations it's
going to be worth it, it's going to be worth pushing it every single time. But
they're a great transition defensive team, too. If you look at their numbers
on the year, very few offensive rebounds by any of their perimeter players.
They get back and they wall off. They make it tough to get anything.  
  
Q. Coach, your team showed a lot of resiliency and confidence even when
they got down. Your 2008 team took Duke to the brink. Did you show them that
game or did you even talk about that game heading into this one?  
COACH BYRD: No, we really didn't talk about that game at all. I think most of
our guys know the history of that game. This team again is not really as good
probably as some of the teams we've had over the last several years, but it is
the best I'm-not-going-to-quit team that I've ever had. We came back from
double figures time and time again this year to either win games or to make a
game of it similar to tonight. So I don't know, I don't know what that says.
Again, we're not as efficient, as sound, as good as some of our teams, but
never give up stuff, this team's got it.  
  
Q. If you've seen a ton of their games you probably saw the Justin
Anderson of February. Do you think you got the Justin Anderson of January here
tonight?  
COACH BYRD: Well, I think he's closer than he was a week ago obviously. He
stepped back and made a 3 tonight and that had to make him all feel good. And
when I say I saw a lot of games, to be honest I focused a lot more on their
defense and let our other guys watch more of their offense than I did. I
watched some of it for sure, but he's obviously, overall he's their best
offensive player I think overall. But the beauty of their team is that you've
got guys, Brogdon can do that, Gill can have a great game, what did he get,
16? You've got a lot of guys on that team that can score 15 or 16 points in a
game and up can't just focus on any one guy. They're a better offensive team
than they get credit for only because they're such a great defensive team.  
  
Q. Coach could you speak about the youth that you saw in the game
tonight, especially Amanze and Mack, and what they really brought inside the
paint for you guys?  
COACH BYRD: We are, we don't have a post player that's older than a sophomore
on our team. You heard those guys speak to where we can get possibly. So we
played all year long with guys making freshmen and young player mistakes in
there and we made a few tonight that Virginia didn't make because they're a
little more experienced and they executed when it came time to win and we
didn't get it done. But I'm excited about our team moving forward a whole lot.  
  
MODERATOR: One more question for Coach Byrd? That was it. Thanks, Coach.  
  
COACH BYRD: Thank you.

_CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  

VIRGINIA - 79  
BELMONT - 67

COACH BENNETT: First of all, congratulations to Belmont on an outstanding
season and run at the end of the year. Really, Coach Byrd is a tremendous man,
a tremendous coach. He's kind of near and dear to my heart because he wears a
sweater vest and my father used to wear a sweater vest when he coached, I told
him that before, but what he's done with that program and how he's lasted was
remarkable. We knew it was going to be a very difficult, challenging game,
very dangerous. You just don't see a lot of teams that can spread the floor
like that, that can shoot the ball and have the kind of guys that just keep
coming at you, that can even bank 3s where they're going the way Bradshaw did.
But it was good for us to be in a game like that. Our young men have been in a
lot of games like that where we had to just outlast and stay in there and make
some plays and even overcome some of our mistakes, but find ways. And they had
to do that and I hope it will serve us well heading into Sunday's game against
obviously a very good Michigan State team.  
  
MODERATOR: Questions for Anthony, Malcolm.  
  
 Q. Malcolm, seemed like it was a second game in a row that maybe an
opponent sped you guys up a little bit offensively. Did you come into this one
being okay with playing a little faster or did they do something to control
the tempo in the first half?  
MALCOLM BROGDON: I think we're not a team that can't play faster tempo. I
think we can adjust, I think we play well at a faster tempo. I think they were
able to get us a little bit out of sorts but at the same time I thought it was
more on us than them. I thought we had a few defensive breakdowns, back door
cuts, losing vision of the ball and uncontested 3s that really sort of broke
us down and got us out of sorts.  
  
 Q. Malcolm, when Bradshaw banked the 3 and followed it up with another
3, he was pretty pumped at that point, and then you guys immediately turned
him over a couple of times. What are you thinking at that time when they get
that close and what did you do defensively to kind of get them out of that
mode?  
MALCOLM BROGDON: At that point in the game you're just thinking you've got to
get stops and for a player like him, you've got to make him uncomfortable. If
he's comfortable, he can make shots and sort of dictate what he does. Me,
myself, I tried to just pressure him, tried to get the ball out of his hands
and swipe at the ball as much as I can.  
  
 Q. For Anthony and then Malcolm, seemed like it was a concerted effort
to get you going inside, felt you had an advantage inside. Was that part of
the game plan and Malcolm, how big was Anthony all game?  
ANTHONY GILL: Yeah, I think that Coach Bennett told us before the game we're
going to call one of our plays to get the ball on the side and I think we
really wanted to take advantage of that. I think we had some opportunities
where we could rebound on the offensive end, too, and we did a really good job
of that. Darion, I think he had six offensive rebounds and that was big for
us, that was huge. When everybody's rebounding like that on the offensive end
I think we have a good chance.  
  
MALCOLM BROGDON: To follow-up, AG was huge for us. I thought second half he
stepped up made some big plays, had some huge rebounds for us, but that's
nothing new, he's been doing that all season and that's what we expect from
him every game.  
  
 Q. Anthony, did it feel like January again when you see Malcolm and
Justin getting hot there in the first half?  
ANTHONY GILL: Yeah, I think so, just to see Malcolm hitting all those shots in
the first half was awesome. Even to see Justin out there doing his thing and
being more confident out there. Actually I don't think he ever lost confidence
but to see him get his flow back and rhythm back was great for us and great
for him, too, just to see that.  
  
 Q. Malcolm, you guys talked yesterday about not wanting a close game in
this first round, you got one anyway. Was there any concern heading down the
stretch, how concerned were you that this team was hanging around?  
MALCOLM BROGDON: Down the stretch you're definitely concerned because that's a
very dangerous team, they hit quick shots and they make a lot of 3s, so they
make big plays. But it's all about us, we've known that all season, we know
that now, coming into the NCAA Tournament, we have to lock down on defense and
that's what we lean on every night, that's our foundation, so to be able to
lean on that at the end of the game is what we do best.  
  
 Q. Malcolm, you didn't shoot it in the second half the way you did in
the first half, yet you made your free throws. How big do you think the free
throws were in this game, 21 of 25?  
MALCOLM BROGDON: I think that's actually pretty astonishing that we shot them
like that. I think that's a huge improvement and very good, especially with a
team like that. At the end of the game we're in the bonus, you've got to make
free throws if you want to win in the NCAA Tournament and tonight we were able
to make free throws and hold them off.  
  
 Q. Malcolm, two part question. First off, offensively most of your
points in the first half, did they change something defensively against you in
the second half? And then your matchup with Bradshaw, what made him so hard to
guard?  
MALCOLM BROGDON: Just in the -- I thought they pressured me a little bit more,
tried to make me a little bit more uncomfortable in the second half but I put
it more on me, I just wasn't making shots. And then Bradshaw, he's shifty, he
shoots it when he wants, he makes a lot of shots and he plays with a lot of
confidence and when you play against another player that is as good as he is
and plays with that much confidence, he's going to be hard to guard.  
  
 Q. With Anderson healthy out there, you guys obviously showed what you
can do offensively, do you feel that area of your game is overlooked because
of how good you are defensively?  
ANTHONY GILL: I definitely think we have some talent on offensive, too. I
think that people do overlook that at times, they see our defense and see how
well we play on defense and then they just X out the fact that we play offense
sometimes, but I think that we have great players on offense and I think that
once we get into a rhythm we're able to exploit a lot of different things.  
  
 Q. I just want to get y'all's thoughts on having a rematch with
Michigan State on Sunday?  
ANTHONY GILL: I think that it's going to be good for us. Last year they beat
us in the Sweet 16 and I remember in the locker room everybody just said
remember how this feels. I think this isn't going to be a revenge game, just
us going out there and do what we do. I think everybody's hungry to go to the
next round and wants to keep moving on so I think we're ready for the
challenge and we're going to go out there and do it.  
  
MALCOLM BROGDON: I agree with Anthony one hundred percent, it's not about
revenge, it's about going out there and establishing ourselves and making it
to the next game. The hungrier team is going to win on Sunday so we're going
to come out and try to be hungry.  
  
 Q. Malcolm, can you talk a little bit about London, he hit some big
shots at several junctures of the second half?  
MALCOLM BROGDON: I thought he was terrific. London is a guy who's very poised,
he knows when to shoot and make the extra pass. In the second half, he stepped
up for us. They were clamping down a little bit on defense, denying the wings
and making it a little bit more difficult for us, and London took the ball in
his hands and made some huge plays for us to keep us ahead and keep us with a
decently comfortable lead.  
  
MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Bennett?  
  
 Q. Coach, as the players put, were you nervous down the stretch when it
got to 62-60?  
COACH BENNETT: They made some tough shots. I don't know if nervous is the
right word. I knew we were going to have to make some plays, some stops and
free throws. If you look at our 25 attempts to their six, that was significant
but to step up and make them, but you're never safe when you play a team like
that, that has that big shot ability that can score in spurts and hit kind of
unlimited range shots, and we did obviously. We had a stretch but we had to
make some adjustments and guard in some unconventional ways that we haven't
had to do all year. Some teams in our league did some thing so we had that to
draw on, but of course I knew that game was in the balance. Even my
assistants, he finally put his guys in at 26 seconds and I looked up and it
was a 12 or 13 point game and I said they're probably a team that could bang a
few 3s. But it wasn't until that point, when you are up 11 with a minute, you
just never know how quickly they can shoot 3s so we knew we had to finish it
out.  
  
 Q. I forget the total, was high 40s in turnovers in the last three
games combined, only seven today. How important was that to you offensively
and were you pleased with the improved ball security?  
COACH BENNETT: It was better. I think there's a couple offensive fouls in
there, too, so that even would lower it. You know, you can't have your offense
cost you. I think someone asked a question to Malcolm early, and perhaps a
couple times we settled for some outside shots. I think when we established
the inside a little more, we were better. And I think as a younger guy when
your shots are going in from the outside, you want to have guys confident to
take it. That's maybe when the games got -- I don't want to say fast, but we
didn't establish enough on the inside. But the ability for us, as I said,
offensively to not hurt our defense is significant, and that was more like it,
though they were hard to guard. We had some breakdowns defensively but ball
security, getting attempts up every time is so important and it was good to
see that number come down. They didn't go out and pressure as much but you
still had to take care of the ball and they were feisty with how they would
get in there and swipe and they weren't going to quit.  
  
 Q. Coach, Justin said it was really nice for once to talk about his
game and not his finger or his appendix. Did he ever show frustration or
anything to you maybe in practice about, hey, I keep getting asked about this,
I can't wait to get on the floor and show them? How nice it was for him to
actually do some talking on the floor?  
COACH BENNETT: He's a unique kid. Young man, I should say, I get in trouble
when I call these guys kids. He is unique. He never got discouraged. I
remember when he was supposed to be able to play for Louisville, has one
practice under his belt, had a decent practice, was excited to play and all of
a sudden he has to have the surgery and he said, Coach, he just said, my faith
is big, I'll be okay, and he was such an encourager through it. That, to me,
is remarkable to see someone who's in his spot who's having such a good year
and such a part of it and how it kind of took the wind out of his sail. His
attitude was impressive. Even during the games, that's real stuff, and I'm so
thankful he had that because I think it's helped him in his recovery and his
ability to play 26 minutes. That was the best of his three games.  
  
 Q. Asked Malcolm and Anthony about having another crack at Michigan
State on Sunday in the tournament. Want to get your thoughts.  
COACH BENNETT: Yeah, you're going from a master coach in Coach Byrd to one of
the greatest coaches in Coach Izzo. Great respect for that program. How it's
built, the physicality, the sounds, the toughness. Grew up respecting it, know
we'll have to be at our best, but I think it's a real good team that seems to
be playing very good basketball. I did watch most of the game against
Wisconsin and I said Michigan State's back and that's a real good 7-seed, no
doubt. When you get to this stage even in the first round or second round or
the next round, you're going to have to play at a high level, so I'm sure it
will be a physical game and a hard fought game, I expect that.  
  
 Q. This is probably the last thing you're thinking about but were you
aware that this is the first time Virginia's won 30 games in back-to-back
seasons?  
COACH BENNETT: Yeah, I study all those records. I was really encouraged about
it. No.  
  
 Q. I mean, what does it say?  
COACH BENNETT: It's the first time, you said, in the history of Virginia
basketball? They probably only played a 20 game schedule so that's probably
another reason why. That's a credit to these guys and what they've done just
to be able to sustain it. You know, we had a vision when we came in to try to
turn the program around and there's nothing better than being part of a
turnaround. But to establish it and try to stay at that level, that brings
other unique opportunities and challenges to at least establish that from a
win number is good and I'm very thankful. I'm thankful for the guys that have
stayed tough-minded, that haven't gotten caught up in how we do it but that we
do it, and we do it together and in a way that's best for us and that's all
week of do.  
  
 Q. Was there any sense of relief either during or after the game about
having a team at full strength for the first time since early February?  
COACH BENNETT: Yeah, I mean I don't know if anybody's at full strength at this
stage of the year but to at least be able, you look at Malcolm's stat line,
I'm sorry, Justin's stat line and then I think Darion and Anthony were moving
better than they did in the ACC tournament with their ankle. I knew that would
be important because it takes an incredible amount of energy and some of our
guys' games are reliant on how healthy they are, so just to have that, to be
able to come in with Marial. We slid Evan to the four in this game, matchup,
that's what you need, you have to be flexible to be able to match-up with
different kinds of teams so that was obviously the most healthy we've been for
quite a while.  
  
 Q. Coach, would Justin be starting against Michigan?  
COACH BENNETT: Well, we're playing Michigan State, so I don't think he'll be
starting against Michigan. We'll look at it and see the match-ups and all
that. He'll play, how's that for you?  
  
 Q. You mentioned Anthony. How important was it to establish him inside
early and how different are you guys when he gets going like that?  
COACH BENNETT: Yeah, it was important and I don't know how good of a job we
did because I mentioned we hit some 3s early and we kind of got -- that's a --
it's not Fool's Gold, that's too strong of a word but, hey, there has to be a
balance. We're not a high volume, that was 17. That was the way they condensed
the defense and you had to take some of those shots, and we made some, but
even if you touch the paint first and then kick it out. And I thought we
didn't do a great job but when we did, usually good things happened and that
was important for us with Anthony, Darion, that was a hard match-up game for
Mike Tobey but the ability to get inside. I thought London made a terrific
ball that was really key in that run. That was a little sideball screen and he
slipped it and then Anthony had a nice finish, so that was big.  
  
 Q. Tony, was there any explanation given on that play where it looked
like the shot clock might have expired, there was a lot of confusion there?  
COACH BENNETT: Yeah, I was confused, but, no, the official said that Marial
had possession of the ball and I don't know when he had possession of the
ball, maybe that was at the, I think maybe that was while the shot clock was
at 3 or 4, I don't know. I guess maybe he did. I think the guy came and it was
so fast, it was kind of a bang-bang play where he got it and the guy swiped it
out and the shot clock didn't reset. I think if he had possession, the shot
clock should have reset on that if they called it a turnover. Everybody was
kind of standing around. Seemed like, I don't know what the right answer is
but that was the explanation, that we got possession so the shot clock should
have reset and it was a shot clock error on the scorer's table.  
  
 Q. You generally don't switch on defense very much, particularly on the
perimeter. You did that more tonight than normal. Are you comfortable doing
that?  
COACH BENNETT: Well, we'll switch, like, some ball screens, and, look, they
have four guards and that was what Evan gave us, the flexibility. Rotations
are really tough against them because of how spread they are and sometimes
they're coming off ball screens, they balance it out more to take the quick
pass depending upon when someone is in there. So we changed our philosophy a
little bit of what we do in this game and I thought it was good for us. A
couple times we miscommunicated and they got some shots but very difficult
team to try to blow up the screen when they have a four man who really slips
the screen, a little bit like Mitoglou from Wake Forest when we played them.
So we just thought we had our normal defense and then we had a plan B and we
went a little more to plan B. And we even had a plan C we went to, too. I
thought it was effective for us, I'll watch the tape, but you have to have
that when you go against that, so I am flexible.  
  
 Q. Tony, you mentioned Michigan State against Wisconsin. Have you seen
them at any other point during the year and have you scouted them at all?  
COACH BENNETT: Just bits and pieces, not a whole lot. I just know that Coach
Izzo has a knack for getting his teams to really rise up and play at a high
level come March. He's just done it, you look at his track record, but
watching because I know how good Wisconsin, just from my interest being from
there and all that, I watched them a few times, and I know how well Wisconsin
was playing, so when I watched that Big Ten final, that was impressive. I
think they beat Maryland to get into that game in a tough, hard-fought game
and how well Maryland's playing. They have a knack, they've got guys with
experience. I remember how good Dawson was against us last year in the Sweet
16 game. He's got them playing at a high level, without a doubt. But watched
them just bits and pieces.  
  
 Q. You said after the Carolina game last week that that's not who we
are. I don't know what the exact numbers are for a 2 versus a 15 in a
tournament but obviously people will think maybe you escaped today but the
sense is you feel you played very well?  
COACH BENNETT: I think we were solid enough and made some plays. Every year I
think the seedings become less significant. You just look around how close the
games are, the upsets are there. It's just happening more and more. Parity is
here in college basketball and yeah, there have been two 15 upsets. We saw
one, it happens. So when you play a team, match-ups are so important. That was
a difficult match-up, I think, for anybody the way they were playing but that
was a hard one for us. We have had some trouble with teams that play like that
so I thought we responded in some ways. I don't know how well we played. We
played well enough, and I have great respect and I think there's things
certainly we can clean up and it will be a different kind of game come Sunday.  
  
MODERATOR: Okay, Coach, thank you

_CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  
MODERATOR: Robert Morris student-athletes, Lucky Jones, Rodney Pryor and
Marcquise Reed. Questions?  
  
 Q. Congratulations, guys. Has the euphoria of a win last night left you
and when does it leave you?  
MARCQUISE REED: You know, we enjoyed it while it lasts, and we just try to
move on to the next game and hopefully make another run and get another win in
the tournament?  
  
RODNEY PRYOR: Yeah, like Marcquise said, we enjoyed it after we won but now
we're onto the next game.  
  
LUCKY JONES: We embraced the moment. We've just got to go out there, follow
our plan and execute and see what happens tomorrow.  
  
 Q. Lucky, do you feel -- you obviously have a great back story. Do you
feel blessed to be where you are right now? Obviously when you were a young
child, the health complications, and in high school you didn't really have any
scholarships until the end of your senior year. Now, here you are getting
ready to play Duke in the NCAA Tournament.  
LUCKY JONES: I'm very blessed and fortunate. I'm just going to embrace my
moment right now, just go out there continue to play the way I've been
playing, help my team, hopefully get this win tomorrow.  
  
 Q. Lucky, two North Jersey guys with you and Kavon on the team. Can you
talk about your relationship, I know you were at Saint Anthony's, I know he
was at Hudson Catholic, how much did you know each other in high school? Did
you room together at Robert Morris and what does it say about the toughness of
North Jersey basketball that you guys are both here?  
LUCKY JONES: It's very tough in North Jersey. That's my little brother since
day one. As soon as he stepped on Robert Morris campus, I took him in, I
showed him the ropes, I showed him how to work hard and he's really grown into
a mature point guard and he's doing big things for us out there on the floor.
We knew each other a lot, obviously for him playing with the New Jersey
players AAU program and me playing for IZOD, so we played against each other,
we talk off the court. We always had that mutual relationship.  
  
 Q. For Lucky again, do you like the first name? Did you get made fun of
a lot when you were younger?  
LUCKY JONES: Not at all. Everybody thought it was a cool name, especially
playing basketball, if I hit a good shot or if I hit a shot that nobody
thought I could make, they would just be like Lucky, Lucky, Lucky, keep saying
it over and over. It's something I got used to. I love my name, I wouldn't
take it back for nothing.  
  
 Q. Do you think it's kind of emblematic of when you were younger?  
LUCKY JONES: Maybe. It's just the name I was given. I was blessed enough to be
here and I'm just living this moment right now.  
  
 Q. Lucky, last year the team obviously had more managers at one point
suited up with suits and ties than the players did. Talk about what happened
this summer and coming into this year to get this team to develop and
redevelop and kind of reestablish itself with some newcomers and what not.  
LUCKY JONES: I believe we just all had to, you know, take a realty check, look
where we came from, understand we all wanted the same goal and that was to get
to the NCAA Tournament and we just had to put a lot of things aside and just
sacrifice for the greater good of the team. We put in a lot of hard work this
summer in the waiting room especially on the court and we just tried to
embrace that and bring it all together because we knew what kind of talent we
really had.  
  
 Q. You guys played a game in the tournament already. Do you think that
will help you tomorrow against Duke?  
RODNEY PRYOR: Definitely to get one under your belt is a good experience for
the whole group. We went over that in scout today that Duke has a few players
that hasn't played in a NCAA game yet so we're going to try to use the
experience of already playing in one and getting all the jitters out of the
way and stuff like that, so I think that's good for us.  
  
MARCQUISE REED: Just to touch on what Rodney said, just for us to have that
experience already for the first round. They've got a lot of freshman so they
never experienced an NCAA Tournament game. I think that's the motivation for
us to come out and play hard and get another win.  
  
 Q. What's the confidence you guys have playing a team like Duke that
obviously have the huge name, they have the big stars, but as you've seen
already there have been big upsets, anything can happen. How confident are you
guys that you can give them a game tomorrow?  
MARCQUISE REED: I'm very comfortable with my team because we've got some real
high-level talent on our team, more than a mid-level program, so I'm confident
with my team to play with the best of them.  
  
RODNEY PRYOR: Yeah, I'm confident, like you said, some teams already made
upsets. When you get on this stage you never know what's going to happen,
you've just got to come out, give it your all, play hard and I think teams
with the most energy and effort can come out on top.  
  
LUCKY JONES: We very confident in our coaching staff and our program and our
players, so we've just got to go out there and continue to execute the way
we've been executing especially in the last 18 minutes of the second half of
the last game, so we've just got to make sure we play like that for 40 minutes
and don't have any lapses.  
  
MODERATOR: Let's start with Coach Toole. Questions?  
  
 Q. Coach, kind of walk us through a little bit, I guess, the turnover
from last night, the game, travel, and kind of how you do the whirlwind to get
here?  
COACH TOOLE: Well, as soon as the game was over last night we went back to the
hotel, packed, went over to the airport where our charter was, ended up taking
off probably 1:45. Got here a little after 1:00 in the morning, got to the
hotel about 1:30. Not that anybody was worried about getting any rest, that's
usually when our guys operate at their best, in the early morning hours. We
were able to get in to do some film and some scouting report earlier this
morning, probably about 11:30, 12:00 and then get in to have a practice as
well to walk through some stuff. Obviously we're light on the floor, didn't
want to do a whole lot, having played last night and then the turnaround for
tomorrow. Tried to just do what we needed to do, be efficient with our time
there on the floor, and then we will use this time to get a bunch of shots up
and get ourselves loose and be ready to go tomorrow.  
  
 Q. Your first couple years of college when you were playing just down
the road from Duke, was there anything about Duke that you learned or that
left an impression on you?  
COACH TOOLE: Nothing in particular I learned from my time at Elon. Obviously
you knew a lot about them before you came down here and continue to learn
stuff all the time. Obviously they're the gold standard for college
basketball. They're a well-oiled machine in terms of how they consistently win
year after year after year. At our level now, this is my 8th year at Robert
Morris, and the amount of effort it takes to sustain our program at our level
is incredible, and it's hard to imagine what it takes to sustain a program at
the national level like Duke does. That's something that I look at and say
that's incredibly remarkable for 30-plus years to be able to do what they've
done.  
  
 Q. Two years ago in Moon Township, you guys took down Kentucky in the
first round of the NIT. How have you been able to draw from that experience as
you come into the last game yesterday, and then tomorrow's game as well?  
COACH TOOLE: Well, I wish this game was in Moon Township, that would make me
feel better about it. Obviously any time you get in games where you are
playing the high majors of the world, you can always learn something.
Obviously we played Carolina, Georgetown, Clemson this year, and each of those
experiences I think we fared better each time we played those guys, and I
think a lot of times it's a matter of being comfortable and figuring out you
can play your own game and stay true to who you are and what you do best. I
think at times you get in these situations and you try to do more than you're
capable of, and you're a little bit on edge or you're playing a little faster
than you want and so you can't relax and play your game and I think that's
what we try to talk about with our guys and that's what we talk about going
into that Kentucky game. Just do what we do. If it's good enough, great, but
if not, that's what you live with. But trying to recreate the wheel or pull
out some shot that you've never done before, that's the first step in failure
in these kind of games. You have to stay true to who you are and you have to
make sure that your team is staying together and playing together.  
  
 Q. I guess how much then concern do you have about your guys being
loose? They have a game under their belt and they sounded like they thought
that might help them, having played a game already. Do you think they'll be
loose and relaxed about it or tense, do you think?  
COACH TOOLE: I hope they're going to be loose and relaxed. Obviously getting
some of those first-time NCAA Tournament game jitters out of your system, I
think, can help. We weren't ourselves in the first 10 minutes of the game
yesterday, we were kind of a little bit on edge. We were rushing things, there
were times where we were taking some shots that were a little bit
uncharacteristic. We just weren't playing at a comfortable pace. We weren't
playing our basketball. Hopefully with that having been done already, we'll be
able to kind of settle in as soon as the game starts tomorrow. Obviously the
opponent is a little bit different and the stage is a little bit different,
but I think hopefully we can remind them it's still the same tournament and
it's still the same way that we played for at least the last 18 minutes of
that game last night as how we've got to play for 40 tomorrow.  
  
 Q. One specifically about Duke. Quinn Cook, for all the attention that
goes to the freshman, he's really picked up his game and he's been a leader
for them. What do you see when you've looked at him on film as far as it's not
just the scoring but what he does, the intangibles beyond that?  
COACH TOOLE: I think as a coach, you watch a guy like that who in his senior
year has to shift a little bit of what his role is, has to learn to co-exist
with some talented freshman and actually ends up probably having his best
season because of it. That's got to be a credit to the way he approaches every
day and his desire to win. I think when you really want to win and you're
concerned about your team and your program and you're willing to make any
adjustment you can, that it's in the best interests of the team. Obviously
he's been super aggressive in terms of his scoring, he shot the ball at an
incredibly high rate but you can tell he's the emotional leader of the group.
When he gets going, when he gets up into that ball and starts to pressure his
opponent, speed them up, that energizes the rest of his team. As poised and as
great as Tyus Jones is with his decision-making, you can see when they get in
the huddle there's one voice talking and that's Quinn Cook's, and he's getting
everybody on the same page and getting everybody working together, and I think
that's been something from an outsider, obviously something that's pretty
remarkable to see from a guy like that in his senior year.  
  
 Q. Understand your son's a Duke fan. How does that go over with dad and
how do you cope with that?  
COACH TOOLE: Well, I married his mom and she's a Duke fan so I kind of knew it
might be coming down the line at some point in time. Actually he's two and a
half and I think he's doing it just to really bother me at this point in time.
I think he knows who he's rooting for tomorrow and I think he knows the right
answer, but he enjoys reminding me Duke, Duke, Duke. When I go on the road
sometimes, they'll watch games and I have clips on my phone of him saying on
the phone, Tyus is my guy. Tyus Jones. So all year long, him and his mom
watched and I'm sure she didn't think we would be playing them in the NCAA
Tournament but it's been pretty funny and he's got a very good personality and
I think he kind of enjoys telling dad that he's not rooting for Robert Morris.  
  
 Q. When you look at Lucky and the career he's had, could you tell he's
a guy who's dealt with a lot of adversity from when he was obviously younger
to in high school where he didn't really have much scholarship offers until
his senior year?  
COACH TOOLE: I think that's part of what makes Lucky a good player, that
constant thought process of trying to earn respect I think is something that
he's always faced and I think it drives him, I think it motivates him, I think
it helps him compete, I think it's part of what makes him the player that he
is. He's always out there trying to carve his niche and earn respect and
increase his reputation as a player and these are the kind of moments and
situations that you find yourself in when you work the way he works, so it's
really helped our team in the last month, I think. I think he's really focused
on what's best for our team and has driven our team into this direction that
we are in, having won seven games in a row and his attitude and his
communication to his teammates has been terrific. He's talked all about the
things that are important to help us win games at this point in time and I
think he understood or he finally realized here in the last month that the
only thing he hadn't accomplished as a player was being a part of the NCAA
Tournament and I think that's really where his change and shift in mindset
came from. It's been great to coach him and guys have responded to him and
really played their best basketball.  
  
 Q. You have a couple North Jersey guys there in Kavon and Lucky, you're
also from New Jersey. A, do you feel like this is almost a New Jersey team
and, B, what is does it say about the toughness of guys like tough Kavon and
Lucky from North Jersey that they bring to a team?  
COACH TOOLE: I always tell them that they got tough when they came to hang out
with me, and I'm a Jersey Shore guy. That North Jersey toughness, I'm not sure
I'm buying it. We've always recruited Jersey guys, we've always had a couple
Jersey guys. We have a kid from Union Catholic obviously signed for next year.
You like to have those guys that have those Jersey roots to you. Kavon and
Lucky, their greatest attribute is their stubbornness and toughness sometimes,
you butt heads with them, but when you get on the floor and you're in
competition and facing adversity, like we did last night, those guys step up
and respond. You look for that in recruiting, you look for that
competitiveness, you look for that toughness. Sometimes on the practice floor
you wish it was different but you know they're going to show up on game day
and that's exactly what they've done.  
  
 Q. I apologize if this has already been discussed but I happened to see
the bit about your wife and your son being huge Duke fans.  
COACH TOOLE: Yeah. If J.J. Redick was sitting here, I probably would be single
right now, put it that way.  
  
 Q. So how is that dealing with that on the home front?  
COACH TOOLE: It's been great. It obviously adds a little bit of entertainment
and some enjoyable conversation. But my wife, I think when it's all said and
done, she'll be rooting for us. I'm not sure about Ryan yet but hopefully
he'll come to his senses by 7:00 tomorrow.

_CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  
MODERATOR: San Diego State will be bringing four student-athletes: Dwayne
Polee, Aqeel Quinn, Winston Shepard and JJ O'Brien. Questions?  
  
 Q. For Dwayne, I actually covered the team that you played for there
the first year under Steve Lavin. I was wondering if you could just reflect
back on that first year of experience with St. John's, what that was like
playing for them and being part of the last team to make the NCAA?  
DWAYNE POLEE: It was a great experience. Coach Lavin, he was a great coach,
his staff was great to me, I was surrounded by 10 seniors, so they just helped
me with the transition and I think that's helped me a lot.  
  
 Q. I just wanted to ask also, obviously your mother became ill and you
had to transfer. How would you describe that experience and what you went
through taking care of her at that time as well?  
DWAYNE POLEE: It was a hard decision to make but I had to do what I had to do,
so it's no bad blood between me and St. John's and anything, I left on good
terms.  
  
 Q. Winston, what's it going to be like to face D'Angelo?  
WINSTON SHEPARD: It would be like facing anybody else. He's one of my best
friends, he's my brother, but I'm not going to make it into a one-on-one
match, so we'll see.  
  
 Q. Tell me about, you guys grew up together. I mean, how close were
you? Can you give me some background on your relationship with D'Angelo?  
WINSTON SHEPARD: He's one of the people that I'm closest to in the whole
world. Like I say, he's my brother. My mother had to work long nights, so his
grandmother would come pick me up and take me to the gym with him, and we
worked out and practiced. He would take us on AAU tournament trips. Him and
his older brother, they showed me a lot, and I love him, that's my brother.  
  
 Q. JJ, Aqeel is the shortest guy up there. Could be argued maybe he
doesn't wake up in the morning with as much talent as, say, like Winston. I
was wondering if you could speak to his role on the team. When he's scoring,
you guys are winning generally, he's always happy and kind of an emotional
guy.  
JJ O'BRIEN: He's the energy of the team, he's the guy that comes in every day
in a great mood. He lifts us all up with his energy, and like you said, when
he's scoring, we're pretty hard to beat. If he's scoring and his energy is
high, then it usually trickles down to all of us in games, so he's a huge part
of the team, a senior leader, a guy who's been through it, has experience, and
he's a good role model for everybody. So we feed off of him, we look to him
for energy and effort. And when we're going through tough times, he usually is
able to get us through it, so he's a big part of the team.  
  
AQEEL QUINN: Thank you, JJ.  
  
 Q. Dwayne, why did you want to keep playing and what fear do you battle
in coming back?  
DWAYNE POLEE: I just love the game so I wasn't going to let my situation stop
me from playing. I just have positive people around me that would just tell
me, you know, just stay positive and keep your head up. The love of my
teammates, the coaches, the whole San Diego, my family, it just uplifted me.  
  
 Q. Winston, if you could help us sort of fill in some of the details a
little bit about your growing up and being friendly with Harrison. When did
you become so close with his family that you were involved and his mother
would pick you up?  
WINSTON SHEPARD: His grandmother.  
  
 Q. Were you guys classmates at some point or teammates at some point?  
WINSTON SHEPARD: Rival middle schools. D'Angelo was always one of the best
players in the city. It took me a little while to start coming into my own. He
went to Dulles, I went to Lake Olympia, so we began playing against each
other. Then we end up, I get to 8th grade, he's a freshman, he's a year older
than me. We ended up playing on the same AAU team. My mom had to work late
nights so his grandmother offered to pick me up and commute me back and forth
to practice and the tournaments. So we began to spend a lot of time together,
so just through that.  
  
 Q. How much do you think -- how often do you guys, say, text message or
call one another?  
WINSTON SHEPARD: All the time. We've got a group of friends from back home,
we're all in the group chat. I would say that group chat buzzes at least every
day.  
  
 Q. For Dwayne, you talked a little bit about the other day about your
first NCAA tournament game with St. John's. Can you just elaborate a little
bit more on that and why was it so hard in your first time and you've had
success since then playing in the tournament, what is it about experience
playing in the tournament and why was it such a hard first game?  
DWAYNE POLEE: I think it's just the experience factor. I was a freshman and I
didn't really know what to expect. Moving forward, just playing in such a big
tournament with a million eyes watching you and having great teammates that
also have experience, it means a lot.  
  
 Q. Aqeel, your Northridge teams, they didn't do very well. Can you talk
about why you came to San Diego State? And I'm assuming it was for moments
like this.  
AQEEL QUINN: Definitely for moments like this. It was tough watching the
tournament two years in a row and not being in it. I watched Dwayne in the
tournament actually. We used to talk almost every day when he was at St.
John's and I remember when he first got there I called him and he was like,
bro, the altitude up here is killer. I just remember that and multiple other
friends being in the tournament just asked some questions how it was, and that
was my experience. So when Dwayne went through it, I felt like I went through
it, too. I'm just glad to be here for this moment now, like you said.  
  
 Q. Aqeel, especially in San Diego, a lot of people have high
expectations of you guys being this, your sixth trip to the tournament, but
how high of expectations gotten for you guys personally?  
AQEEL QUINN: Well, it's a team goal ever since we started in the summer, we
say it when we bring it in in every huddle, I think we like to keep that
between all of us and everybody in the locker room but we definitely have high
hopes past this weekend.  
  
 Q. For Dwayne again, I know you had had the experience before of
collapsing in practice, but when that happened in a game and you're on the
court, can you just describe the emotion that you're dealing with, and then
over the two months, what you went through to get back to this point with the
operation and everything?  
DWAYNE POLEE: Well, when it happened, it was just a lot of confusion because
you kind of feel -- I felt, like, kind of dizzy and the next thing you know I
wake up with my family, my mom, my dad, my girlfriend, my teammates, my
coaches, the ambulance people, the trainers, everybody just over me and, like,
it's just a lot of confusion at the time. And then moving forward, prior to
the operation, it was just a matter of my closest people to me just keeping me
real positive because it would have been easy to get down on myself and be
ready to quit the game, but they just kept me really positive and my doctors
did a great job.  
  
 Q. Winston, I want to ask, obviously so many good players have come
before you at San Diego State but you've been the lone junior up there, how
anxious are you personally to send these seniors off in a good way?  
WINSTON SHEPARD: I don't think about it like that. I talk to the team before
we go out to the games and I always say each game that we have now is another
opportunity for us to play together. Obviously the opportunities are winding
down, but clearly the time is coming to a close here soon, but each game we
have together is a good opportunity, it's a blessing, so we're just going to
go out there and make the most of it.  
  
 Q. Winston, I know Coach Lavin recruited you a little bit, I guess you
were already looking at San Diego State by then. What was his pitch when he
recruited you and did he talk about possibly playing with D'Angelo in
college?  
WINSTON SHEPARD: Yeah, he talked about it. I don't really remember it, but I
could tell you I could never go to New York. I hate the cold, so it wasn't
even something that got that serious.  
  
MODERATOR: Thank you.  
  
COACH FISHER: I would like to say that we, like all the other teams that are
involved in the field, are immensely excited, very proud to be here. We know
that it's not a divine right for anyone. This is our sixth straight year and I
think we're in the top seven or eight in terms of how many times we've gone
consecutively. So you have to earn your way in and you have to be excited when
you get here, and if you play well, you'll have an opportunity to do it again
the next day. So we're looking forward to a great game with St. John's, a
terrific team, and our hope is to be playing on Sunday.  
  
MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
 Q. Naturally we're very interested in Dwayne Polee, and I was just
wondering how you handled his medical situation as a coach and whether or not
he's under any restrictions since he's playing with that monitor.  
COACH FISHER: Dwayne, who everyone knows began his career at St. John's, so
he's very excited not only to be in the tournament, but having an opportunity
to see his former coach, no player on that team he played with. Dwayne,
everyone knows his story. He's had tremendous care from multiple doctors, and
he's being monitored daily. We have a doctor with us, doctors have traveled
with us on road trips since, and we feel as if Dwayne is good to go. There are
no restrictions on him. We've got a medical team and a trainer in Tom Abdenour
that has done a magnificent job. He's going to play and our hope is he'll play
and play well.  
  
 Q. On Dwayne, when he was going through this process, did you think he
would not be back, and aside from what you were being told by doctors, was
there just a fear of him coming back and playing again?  
COACH FISHER: Last first, yeah, I was nervous. And I vividly remember his
first official team practice. Even though he had done things, very strenuous
things away from me and away from the team, when I saw him practice, I went
with our trainer, I said, stand here next to me and watch every move he makes.
So yes, you go through that just as you do with -- it's a lot different, but
if someone's coming back from a major injury, as he has practiced, I've -- now
he's back to Dwayne Polee. I don't even think about it now when he practices
or when we're playing.  
  
 Q. Steve, I know you mentioned earlier about being one of the seven or
eight teams in the country that's gone to the tournament as many consecutive
times as you have now. I just wondered, what do you think the nation makes of
your program at this point? What do you think their perspective is?  
COACH FISHER: I don't have a lot of time to think about that, but I do know
that, and it hasn't just been one year but repeatedly over the last few years,
when I have gone to the ultimate, I've gone unfortunately as a spectator to
the Final Four, everybody wants to talk to me about San Diego State, and
that's a good thing. We've been six straight years, so that helps to enhance
your image and blueprint of who you are. The more you do in the next three
weeks, the more that will create who you are. So our goal is to do something
we've never done before. We've never gone beyond the Sweet 16. I said that
last year after we lost, one of these days, I may not be here to enjoy it, but
San Diego State will get further than where we are right now, and that's our
hope. Our hopes and dreams are like everyone, but I think there's a bit of
reality that we've attached to it. And our players have experienced winning in
this event and also the bitterness of having to go home before you want to.  
  
 Q. Is there something about this team for all its maddening sometimes
inability to make baskets that we should believe that it can go further than
it has?  
COACH FISHER: Probably depends on who you're talking to, to be honest with
you. It maybe depends on what half of a game or what game you watched. I could
cite them. We've had games where you would say they can play and beat anybody.
We have had others where you would say they would not qualify for a good CYO
team offensively. We guard and we guard hard most of the time. We scored 43
points in our final game in the Mountain West conference tournament. That
won't win for you. So when we make shots, and to be honest, we've got to have
our perimeter guys and our seniors, and two of the three guys that were
sitting up here before, they have to be able to make some shots. They're
capable and hopefully they'll do it.  
  
 Q. You've talked about Aqeel before and how he grows on you, he's a fun
kid to be around. Also, in addition to his emotion and how that helps, when
he's making baskets, you guys are generally winning. Can you speak about the
two facets of his game, the emotion and that he takes shots and makes them?  
COACH FISHER: Aqeel Quinn is what every student-athlete should be,
appreciative that he's here. I don't know if he came up here, but he's got his
cell phone and everywhere he goes he takes memories and makes memories with
his play. He's our emotional bunny. He's a guy that excites genuinely and it's
not phony. He's exciting by nature to be with and positive by nature, finds
something to smile about and it rubs off on all of us, coaches and players
alike.  
  
 Q. Coach, you put Dwayne Polee back in the starting lineup for the last
game of the Mountain West tournament. What was the thinking behind that, what
do you think he brings and what specifically can he bring to this game against
St. John's with so many athletes and perimeter players?  
COACH FISHER: Our starting lineup in years past has always been the same, it
never varied. If somebody got hurt or sick, as soon as they were back they
were in the lineup. A year ago Dwayne Polee was our second-best player in
February and March to Xavier Thames, so we know he can play. So I have to make
a decision are we better with Dwayne in the starting lineup or being that
emotional lift hopefully that would come off the bench in that first wave of
substitutions, and I have not fully decided yet what we'll do for St. John's
tomorrow. Everybody wants to start but Dwayne is such a neat, wonderful young
guy, I truly think that he'll, with a smile on his face, accept either of
those roles.  
  
 Q. Coach, any concerns that the team would look past St. John's for a
possible match-up with Duke on Sunday?  
COACH FISHER: Please. No, you know that won't happen. They are tingling with
excitement. They had this TV on in the locker room and back in the hotel and
saw some of the 3-14 games or whatever they were. You had better live in the
moment if you want to survive in advance. Our players have great respect for
themselves. We may not win, but it won't be because we were looking ahead for
anybody.  
  
 Q. Coach, what concerned you most about St. John's and their
athleticism? Can you talk a little bit about their team and what concerns you,
what you're looking to combat against?  
COACH FISHER: They're a bit like us, they're veterans, they're senior driven.
I believe at least three seniors play prominent roles that were in Steve's
initial recruiting class. They're a hard team to guard. They're athletic and
they put pressure on you. They make shots, and when they get going making
shots, good defense can't stop them. So we have to hope that they have
stretches where they don't make shots, but this is a quality team that we're
playing. I've got great regard for Coach Steve Lavin and what he's done, and
he'll have them prepared. He's had a week or four, five days, I'm sure he's
done what we've done. He's called all his markers in on all his buddies on the
West Coast and had everybody send him game tapes and scouting reports, so
he'll be prepared for us just as we'll be prepared for him. They've got good
players, they've got good players that can score the ball in a lot of
different ways and positions.  
  
 Q. Obviously St. John's is not going to have one of the best shot
blockers in the country because of his suspension. How does that help you at
the offensive end as far as what you can do in the paint?  
COACH FISHER: I don't know how that will help us. We've got to find ways to
make baskets and score points. Last I looked, they still have a pretty good
shot blocker in the middle when you come to the basket and we'll have to do
what we do and try to make it work. Obviously they're not as good without him,
but they're still good enough.

### [Marcus Thornton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18092)

  
_CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  
MODERATOR: We're about to start with student-athletes from University of
Georgia. Who has the first question?  
  
 Q. Start with Marcus. Obviously you've been in the tournament, it's
been a while for you, and the other guys I don't think have been there. You
guys have won on the road, you've won 20 games, you've been in Tom tough
environments. Do you think this team is prepared from the regular season to
maybe take some steps in this tournament?  
MARCUS THORNTON: I would certainly think so, with the success that we have had
this year on the road. I just think this team is a very resilient bunch and
used to be able to deal with environments that are a little bit different than
our own so that will help us a little bit going forward.  
  
 Q. Marcus, you have been here before. What to you is it going to take
to get over the hump, and kind of what do you remember from the last time you
were here?  
MARCUS THORNTON: Obviously the last time was quite a few years ago, so very
different from then, but it's just going to take putting consistent play
together for 40 minutes or 40-plus minutes, as we like to say, and a
consistent defensive effort from all of us and us staying together the entire
time.  
  
 Q. Question for both of the student-athletes that I would like you both
to answer. What do you know about the Spartans and what have you heard about
their propensity in the month of March to exceed any expectations, and really
go on runs and is that something you think about or have heard about?  
NEMANJA DJURISIC: Well, we know they're a great team, they're very well
coached and they have tradition behind them and a lot of appearances in the
tournament, and it's -- it comes with experience. But we're also a determined
team and we're ready for a challenge, and they're a great team. But we
certainly have been through some tough times and this is another road game for
us, which we are very used to. Michigan State's a great team but we're up for
a challenge.  
  
MARCUS THORNTON: Michigan State is obviously a great program with a great
tradition of being successful not just throughout the season, but in March,
we're aware of that and we're aware of how great a coach Coach Izzo is, so it
will be a great challenge for us and we're definitely looking forward to the
opportunity.  
  
 Q. Marcus, you said 40 minutes plus. What do you mean by that? Is that
a team slogan?  
MARCUS THORNTON: 40 minutes plus is just a reference to a game, if it happens
to go to overtime or something like that, so 40 plus minutes is what we like
to refer to that as.  
  
 Q. For both of you, could you just break down the match-up Branden
Dawson and with Michigan State's centers Schilling and Costello, what do you
see from those guys, how do you see the match-ups playing out there?  
NEMANJA DJURISIC: They're great down low in the post, they have great players,
they're very tough, athletic. Certainly going to be a good match-up for us.
But we have the size and we have the ability to guard them well and I think
Marcus and myself and the rest of the big guys on our team are ready for the
challenge.  
  
MARCUS THORNTON: Yeah, I agree. The word that I think of when I see them is
tough, they have a very tough bunch down there. It will be quite a match-up
for us. Obviously I think they're very good players and size-wise we'll match-
up pretty well. So it will be a good match-up.  
  
 Q. I'll follow up on that. Marcus, do you anticipate mostly being
matched up with Dawson and do you compare yourself as a player to him in any
way?  
MARCUS THORNTON: You know, me and Neme and the other big guys, we'll be
matched up on different guys depending on whoever gets down the court first.
We're pretty interchangeable in that regard. I think Dawson's a player that's
not too unlike myself, obviously a very good player and has been a consistent
contributor for, I guess, four years there. So I'm looking forward to the
match-up.  
  
 Q. Neme, can you just talk about what Marcus means to this team?
Obviously I know you've become close friends off the court, too. What he means
to the team both on and off the court?  
NEMANJA DJURISIC: Well, since Marcus has been healthy, it's been a difference-
maker on this team. For the past four years he's brings an incredible
intensity and leadership to this team, something this team really needed. And
just his presence in the paint, his ability to lead the team, his ability to
play hard and tough throughout the season is really made a difference, the
best two seasons, especially in the SEC. Definitely it's been an honor to play
with him. Made my life easier because he brings a lot of attention to him. So
just an incredible teammate for the past four years.  
  
 Q. After four years in Athens and stuff, have the fans back in
Montenegro figured out the difference between Georgia the state and Georgia
the country?  
NEMANJA DJURISIC: I hope so, I hope so. They've been following up, especially
lately with you our success, they follow more with college basketball and
Georgia in general and I think they're aware of the difference at this moment
especially now that we made the tournament.  
  
 Q. Marcus, I think according to what I saw, 2002 was the last Georgia
victory in the NCAA Tournament. Does that weigh on you guys at all? You're
playing a team that's been 18 years in a row making the field and this team
struggled to make the field and hasn't won. Does that weigh on you guys?  
MARCUS THORNTON: I wouldn't say that necessarily weighs on us, but this is a
team that has always had the goal of winning NCAA Tournament games, we believe
that we have a team that is capable of doing that so obviously that's a goal
of ours and something we want to accomplish. We know that Michigan State
definitely has a ton of experience, as you said, with 18 consecutive years in
the field so we have a ton of respect for that and obviously that's going to
be a great challenge for us but that's something we're looking forward to.  
  
 Q. Marcus, Kenny's health, he's had a lot of issues this year, but how
much of an adjustment has it been to have to play without him a couple games
late in the season?  
MARCUS THORNTON: The type of team that we have had and consistently made
something about our team special is that we've been able to fight through
adversity and be resilient whether it be injuries or other situations that
we've had. It's been tough but it's helped us build our character as a team
and hopefully we'll and he have Kenny available and we'll go from there.  
  
MODERATOR: Thanks, guys. We'll start with Coach Fox.  
  
COACH FOX: ,You know, the most watched event every year in the country is the
Super Bowl but nothing captivates our country like the NCAA Tournament, and
we're blessed to be here and excited to play a very good Michigan State team.  
  
MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
 Q. When you drew Michigan State in this NCAA Tournament for the first
round, what was your initial reaction?  
COACH FOX: Well, my initial reaction was for my -- one of one of my operations
coordinator's whose uncle is Coach Izzo, so my initial thought was about him
and his mom because I knew it would be a very emotional game for them. But
after that, great respect for Coach Izzo, not only for the success that he's
had but he's so good are for the game of college basketball. Our game needs
more people like him and I was stunned that they ended up at a 7 seed. They've
got a great team and I thought they would be seeded a little better than that.
So we know we have our hands full.  
  
 Q. This is the first time that you guys have made the tournament in
four years, so what does that mean for you and your program?  
COACH FOX: For us, I came to Georgia to rebuild our team and when you get
hired someplace you talk about a vision and things that you plan to accomplish
and that works for only so long and eventually you have to start accomplishing
them. But now we've had multiple postseasons, multiple 20 win seasons, had a
couple guys go out of school early, which kind of forced us to rebuild it
again but I think it just shows that our program is healthy and hopefully we
can play well.  
  
 Q. Can you give an update about Kenny Gaines at all? I know you expect
him to play, how does he look this week, has he recovered from that foot
injury?  
COACH FOX: Well, he was not cleared to practice early in the week, we let him
shoot some balls yesterday and move around a little bit. So we anticipate that
he'll play. We'll keep our fingers crossed that he'll continue to get a little
better each day but it's not an ideal situation but he's a tough kid and he'll
do the best he can.  
  
 Q. You've talked a lot about progress and getting better in increments
and that kind of stuff. Obviously Georgia has an NCAA legacy, this is it the
12th time they've been there, but getting beyond that first round, getting
deep into the tournament's only happened a couple times. Is this team prepared
to do that now and what's it take to get to that next stage and be able to win
several in a row on this stage?  
COACH FOX: Well, we're not concerned with winning several, we're concerned
with winning the next one. Obviously in the tournament, there's no bad teams
left and we've got a great opponent in Michigan State and it's going to take
us playing well at both ends. I think the one thing this year that we've had
to deal with is obviously the injury situation. It's kind of made us a tougher
team, it's galvanized us defensively but it's prohibited our offensive
progress. We enter the tournament with the belief that we can still get better
and we can still improve because we think offensively hopefully we'll have
some pieces together to keep playing like we originally thought we could play
earlier this year.  
  
 Q. You kind of alluded to Matt's relationship as Tom's nephew. I know
you talk with your local media about it. What's your relationship with Tom
Izzo and how much have you picked Matt's brain this week?  
COACH FOX: My relationship is Coach Izzo is one of great respect. Obviously
having coached Matt and known Coach Izzo for, I don't know, a decade or so, I
can't remember when we first met. I think I coached him when I was an
assistant at Kansas State, I think they came to Manhattan and played years
ago, now that I think about it. I have great respect for Coach Izzo. I told
our local media earlier this week that if my son was ever fortunate to play
for Coach Izzo, I would stand up and cheer. He's what's good about the game.
We have a football coach at Georgia named Mark Richt that's who they would
want him to play for. I think most college basketball coaches feel that way
about Coach Izzo. Matt obviously has been a Michigan State fan most of his
life but he bleeds red and black. I think -- I'm not worried about him. I did
pick his brain some this week, I'm more worried about his mom and the rest of
his family, but I think they've got wonderful family and it will be a neat
story for them to tell in years to come.  
  
 Q. All year so much is made of Kentucky and your league. What was it
like existing in a league like that where it was sort of everybody else behind
them and they were everything?  
COACH FOX: I think as I look back at it, Kentucky has a great team. I mean,
they have one of the best teams in the history of college basketball. You
know, no one in our league can beat them. But they beat everybody else like a
bass drum, too. We gave them two really good games, didn't win either one of
them. I think for us it was about when you play Kentucky, you've got to give
the best effort you can to have a chance to win, and then you've got to close
it out and our team failed to do that. But I think Kentucky's a great
representative of our league. They're very, very good and it's going to take a
really hot shooting team and a very complete effort to beat them.  
  
 Q. Mark, I know on social media you guys had kind of like a dogs are
dancing campaign. What was your thoughts on that in terms of embracing this
moment?  
COACH FOX: That really was something I thought of and it took about five
minutes to do, and our managers helped get that done. But I think it's a way
to build our program, I think it's a way to grow the interest in Georgia
basketball, to enjoy this moment. This is a tournament kids grow up dreaming
to play in and you should enjoy the experience, you should embrace the
challenge in front of you, so we've tried to do that.  
  
 Q. You were asked about having -- I guess picking your brain about
Izzo. I guess I read in the Jets column that Brian Gregory talked to Tom Izzo
about playing Georgia. Are you worried at all there's anything he can gain
from that conversation?  
COACH FOX: I don't know, they've had lot of success over there in post-season
play so I'm sure Coach Izzo knows how to prepare his team. I'm not sure Tech
has had the same success but they've had success versus our team the last
couple years, if they can get something, we're all trying to get any advantage
we can get.  
  
 Q. Mark, how much, with the tournament experience you have, how much do
you think a factor is tournament experience; the idea you've got one program
that's used to going to the tournament versus another, where people say this
was the goal to just get here?  
COACH FOX: I think tournament experience is important but our goal wasn't just
to get here, you know. But the experience is certainly important. Hopefully
our team will have the poise to deal with the emotions of the event. It's a
bigger event than they're used to, and our poise and ability to deal with
that's going to be important and those teams that have experience, you know,
that's probably a slight advantage.  
  
 Q. Marcus Thornton obviously has been through a lot with injuries and
to get back to this point. Can you just talk about kind of what it means for
him to get back here and what he's meant for the team both on and off the
court?  
COACH FOX: The one thing that you don't wish on anyone is injury, and he's had
to deal with far more than his share. I think he played the first three years
in pain and it certainly rocked his confidence not only in his game but in his
body. One of the things that was really important to me personally was to see
Marcus have a great year and really leave his mark on our team. Last year he
won our leadership award because he just refused to let our team fail, and
this year he's been a tremendous senior and I think obviously comes into the
tournament playing the best basketball of his career and hopefully he'll leave
a great legacy.  
  
 Q. Coach, Sunday night Kenny Gaines said there was a 4,000 percent
chance that he would play in this game Friday. Just now he said it's probably
50/50 and he said he had a meeting with you and the doctors and basically said
that you've got to look at your physical well being. What changed between, was
that just youthful enthusiasm versus facts?  
COACH FOX: Well, he obviously was very excited Sunday and the moment probably
got the best of him. You know, he's doing everything he can. We got to the
hotel, I don't know, 10:00 or something like night, he had treatment last
night, he had it this morning before breakfast. Our trainers have done a great
job trying to get him back. I anticipate that we'll be able to use him, but
it's just part of the game and we have to deal with it.  
  
 Q. What about Juwan Parker, what's his availability?  
COACH FOX: Juwan Parker will be dressed for the game but in all likelihood it
would be an emergency use only. He's had obviously another setback and he's
been through a lot.  
  
 Q. Mark, just wonder what kind of pace would you like this game to be
at tomorrow?  
COACH FOX: Well, we want to play as fast as we can play well. Doesn't mean
that we want a track meet, but we certainly don't want a real slow game,
either. I think for us it's been finding a balance with our team and playing a
speed in which we're comfortable. Some nights that's a little quicker than
other nights but I think we've got to find that comfort level but we want to
play as fast as we can play well.  
  
 Q. Anything you can draw on being an assistant going up against
Michigan State when you were at Nevada?  
COACH FOX: The Nevada game was 11 years ago, I think, 10 years ago, 11 years
ago. I didn't go back and look at that game. I did scout the game but the
entire landscape of college basketball's changed since then, so we're not
looking back much on that contest

CHARLOTTE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+2ND+%26+3RD+ROUNDS%3A+CHARLOTTE)

_CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  
MODERATOR: We're beginning now our 15 minutes with Michigan State student-
athletes Branden Dawson, Denzel Valentine and Travis Trice.  
  
 Q. For Branden and Trav, with the streak of Final Fours over, is there
less pressure going into this or do you guys feel pressure to maybe establish
your own identity where Tom Izzo leaving a mark?  
BRANDEN DAWSON: I feel like there's not any pressure between us. Like you
said, their streak was broken but Travis and I, we're trying to start our own
streak of our own and try to make it to the Final Four. I don't think there's
any pressure on us. Coach talked about it with us making history and doing
what we have to do. I think just going into the tournament with a great mind
set I think we'll be fine.  
  
TRAVIS TRICE: Like Branden said, we don't really feel any pressure. It was
disappointing breaking the streak last year and missing out on the
opportunity, but we'll have a chance to go this year and set our own mark.  
  
 Q. For all three of you, please, when you watch the film on Georgia,
can you tell me what sticks out for them because obviously you haven't played
them being an SEC school?  
DENZEL VALENTINE: They're just a really solid team and they run their stuff
pretty good and they got pretty good size. They're just overall solid
basketball team. They played Kentucky as best as anybody in the country so
we'll just have to come out and play our game.  
  
TRAVIS TRICE: They're a really athletic team. What really helps them are their
bigs and guards, they're kind of interchangeable where they do different
things but they're kind of the same players. Like Denzel said they played
Kentucky tough at home.  
  
BRANDEN DAWSON: Think they're a good team. Both teams have really similar
records so I think that they've been playing good basketball. Like these guys
said, I actually watched the Kentucky game and they played good. They're a
great physical team. We really -- we really haven't played anyone from the SEC
but they're a good team, they're physical.  
  
 Q. Branden, on Tuesday Tom told us he wasn't going to make a decision
until Tuesday night or maybe even Wednesday on who they're going to match you
up with. Who are you going to start matching up against?  
BRANDEN DAWSON: The kid, number 2, Marcus Thornton. I just never know late-
game situation I might switch out on a guard. So as far as for myself, I just
have to watch him, the bigs and the guard.  
  
 Q. How do you think you guys change at tournament time? You've been a
team that's been improving in this environment. Do you get better at this time
of year?  
BRANDEN DAWSON: With the season that we've had, with the up and down we've
been going through, I think around this time our chemistry is a lot better,
we've been playing good at a team. We definitely have the same team as last
year. We have a lot of younger guys on our team. As far as Travis and Denzel,
myself, we just have to really lead these guys.  
  
 Q. Travis, I'll give you this one sort of to follow up on that, how
much of a point of pride is it for this program as far as its identity of what
you guys do in March. It's been a long run not just getting to the tournament
but getting out of the opening weekend and advancing?  
TRAVIS TRICE: I think it's big for us, Michigan State's known for playing well
in March and known for doing good this tournament. We feel a sense of pride
that we've got to carry that on especially for the past players that have
really made a name for Michigan State.  
  
 Q. Denzel, what does Coach Izzo do well or what do you think he does to
sort of get the post-season mentality across to you guys getting you prepared
to play in a tournament like this?  
DENZEL VALENTINE: Like you said, he just does a great job of preparing us. Not
only him, our assistant coaches and their whole staff does a great job with
preparing us an getting us ready to play. Coach always talks about you've got
to have a different mindset going into the March. We take that mindset, too,
and we've just got to come out with our A game.  
  
 Q. For Denzel, this is off-topic of your game, but you guys are one of
the top teams in the country, we've played everybody tough. How do you think
-- how do you look at Kentucky, how do other players that you know, people
that you know in the game look at Kentucky this year as are they beatable or
not?  
DENZEL VALENTINE: Yeah, I mean, I think they're beatable. I mean, they haven't
lost yet but you've just got to have a different mindset when you play them.
You can't go in thinking they're too good. You've got to come in, really
attack them. Whoever gets the chance has to have a championship on their
shoulder when they play them because they're really talented.  
  
 Q. A couple weeks ago or three weeks ago when getting into the
tournament was a goal, how different is your mindset about what you want to
accomplish here based on the way you guys are playing? Does that realistically
change your own expectations for this tournament? I guess for Travis and
Denzel.  
TRAVIS TRICE: I mean, a couple weeks ago our backs were against a wall and we
kind of had to make a decision whether we're going to fight or lay down and we
decided to fight and I think that's what got us where we're at now. Our thing
is we've just got to keep that same mentality which is win or go home. Our
thing is come out and fight and try to win each game.  
  
DENZEL VALENTINE: I just think off-season I really don't think we've been
taking on the mentality to let's get in the tournament, it's just sometimes
the games that we lost we just haven't been able to close them and now we
figured that out where we've got a couple wins and we got some streaks going
on, especially at the end of the season, a good time to be playing good. Now
that everybody's playing good we think that we can make a deep run into the
tournament and we've just got to take it one game at a time.  
  
 Q. Does playing Wisconsin the way you did open even your own eyes to --
that's a team that they were playing at a pretty high level, too, and you were
toe-to-toe with them?  
DENZEL VALENTINE: We basically beat them in our own sense but late game
mistakes. Other than that we feel like we can play with anybody in the
country. We played Duke as best we could. We were up at Notre Dame at their
place, we were beating Kansas. Those are all the top seeds in the tournament
so we feel like we can play with or beat anybody in the tournament.  
  
MODERATOR: Thanks, guys.  
  
COACH IZZO: General comment, yes, I have a nephew that works on Georgia's
staff. No, he will not be invited to Thanksgiving day meals at my mother's
house. And I'm excited to be here. I think a month ago for the first time in a
long time there was a little question mark whether at 13-7 we were struggling
a little bit, but credit goes to our players, my coaching staff for not only
pulling everything together but I think getting to the point where we're
playing our best basketball at the end of the year and that's kind of the way
you want it. We had a few bumps in the road. I thought some early because of
some injuries and things we went through, and some late because we missed some
free throws, and we went through that stage and now we kind of put some things
together and I thought the last five games against very good teams, all NCAA
teams, we might have played the best we played on a consistent basis all year.  
  
 Q. Coach, that's a common refrain with your team. Your fans like to
joke that the month of Izzo is between March and April. What do you think is
the biggest reason for that? Is it the tough schedule you play early in the
season, experience that you have on your team? What's the biggest factor in
why your team seems to so often play its best basketball this time of year?  
COACH IZZO: Just to let you know, those same fans they think I golf in
October, November, December, and January, so I'm not sure that's a compliment.
I don't want to be thought of as a March Coach, I get paid for all 12 months.
So my AD gets ticked off about that, but the truth of it is we do play a tough
schedule. 99 percent of the time this year when you look at Duke, Kansas and
Notre Dame, just to name a few, I think that does prepare you. We had an
enormous amount of injuries this year early and this team wasn't ready for not
only that, but we started wearing our guys down, especially Trice and
Valentine. I think of all the things that happened, that was the biggest
thing. We were playing okay early and then about the middle of January we
really, I thought, looked ragged. So we got a couple guys back, we kept
getting teased by Javon Bess, who I think is my best freshman, and we made a
little substitution at the point so we could try to bring some scoring off the
bench and it wasn't really a demotion of Travis, it was moving him around. The
last nine or ten games he's averaging a lot of points but I think he's a
little fresher not having to guard the other team's point guard all night and
not having to maybe play quite the amount of minutes even though he plays a
lot of minutes. When you control the ball that time, that wears on you. So
when we expect him to score, defend and push the ball, that was asking a lot.
So I think there's a combination of things but honestly I do work the other
four months, I promise you.  
  
 Q. Tom, where this team is now, the way they played against Wisconsin,
Maryland, the way you picture your expectations for them internally, your
hopes for them this month, is it different, and when did you really see -- was
it the Northwestern game, on the road, is there a moment you could point to to
say, okay, there's a chance there?  
COACH IZZO: Yeah, I didn't picture this team playing as well as we did the
last week, if I'm being honest with you. We're not as talented as a team,
we're not as deep as a team, and we're not as experienced as a team. We've got
three guys that have any type of experience. I think Northwestern was one, at
Illinois was one, and late in the year when we lost Dawson, Purdue, who I
think is really good, really physical team, we weren't the toughest team,
which is a trademark of our teams, I think, over the years and we didn't live
up to that. Partially it was just the personnel we had. And so as we played
against a couple teams on the road must wins with our backs against the wall
we started showing some grit and character and I think we topped that off in
the last five games. In saying that, our margin for error is still very small,
it's probably the smallest of any team. I felt pretty good about in my whole
career here since we started going to the NCAA Tournament, had one or two
years like this. But I think they've embraced that, I think they understand it
and the three guys that got leading it, Larry, Curly and Moe are really doing
a pretty good job. And Valentine, Trice and Dawson, they each have their
moments of high and they have a couple moments of low, but they're getting
more consistent and I think they've rallied the other guys. We have a very
close-knit team, maybe as close as any team I've had. And I take my hat off to
Denzel and Travis for that over the spring, summer and fall.  
  
 Q. You kind of joked about your nephew. How much have you had a chance
to get in touch with him this week? Do you try to avoid that? I guess from a
bigger picture, what does this mean for your family to have the ability to do
this and then also having played Kevin earlier this year?  
COACH IZZO: Yeah, it was kind of funny because we did play my other nephew,
Saint Cloud, in an exhibition game, and that was awesome for my parents and my
sisters and everybody flew in for that. This one's, you know, not quite as
awesome because there's so much more on the line. But what a privilege, what a
pleasure. I did call him, he chickened out to call me so I had to call him. I
told him I was proud of him, I appreciate what they've done. Their jobs are a
little bit on the line and I love guys that battle through some adversity, and
Mark has done an incredible job there doing that after losing some players to
the pros and losing some players to injuries. So we talked, I talked to his
brother, who also played a little bit at Georgia, and works up at ESPN. I
thought that they both were kind of -- I think everybody's afraid how to be.
Used to be we joked, we joked about it in football, hey, Michigan State will
get Georgia and it was a big feud and big fight. We joked about it with the
brackets at the beginning of the year and sure enough, it happened. Now
nobody's joking because it means a lot to both parties. Like everything else
in life, I respect what he's done, I'm proud of him, I appreciate the
opportunity Mark gave him, and for two hours, you know, there are no family,
and then after that, I love them to death.  
  
 Q. Coach Fox said he was stunned after watching you guys that you were
a No. 7 seed. I'm wondering after watching them on film what you thought of
them as a 10 seed?  
COACH IZZO: I think we're both in the same position. Could we have been a
little higher, I'm not going to get into that debate, but could they have been
a little higher? They were upset twice at home late in the season. They don't
get that and they're probably an 8 for sure, maybe even a 7. I don't know what
the committee looks at. But I know two late losses to non-NCAA teams is going
to hurt you, and that happened partially because of some injuries and things
like that. So if you remember a few years ago we played USC and they had three
guys out all year and they're all pros, and then they won the conference
tournament and they were I think a 9 or 8. I thought that was one of the best
teams we've played on our way to a Final Four that year. I think Georgia is a
very good team, they've got balance, they've got stability, they're well-
coached, they're solid offensively and they're solid defensively. They're a
lot like us, I'm not sure they're great at anything, as I'm not sure we are,
but I think they're very solid at just about everything. It's so hard to tell
anymore who deserves what because these conferences are all so screwed up. I
don't mean that negatively, I just mean we're all not used to seeing what
we're seeing, so many teams, you play so many teams once. You look at
Virginia's schedule or Duke's schedule and how many times did they play each
other, Michigan State or Georgia, how many times did they play each other,
meaning the different teams in the league. So it's really hard to get a feel
like you used to. It will take four or five years to change it.  
  
 Q. With all the post-season success your program has had, is there a
particular mindset that you've tried to instill in players year after year
about the postseason or is it something that builds over the course of a
season, it's not just about March but the whole thing?  
COACH IZZO: Well, it's not just about March to me; it's about the process to
get to March. But when we get close to March, I think every living alum thinks
March is the time when we excel, and I think in a way it presents a little
pressure, but I think it's one of the rare times it's really, really good
pressure. So many of our former players are calling or coming. They just feel
part of the family, part of the whole deal and I think that kind of pressure
is positive. Alan Anderson who plays for the Nets called when we lost, and I
hadn't talked to him for a while and his first thing was, Coach, which player
do you need me to call? That is Utopia. It's something that coaches dream to
have, a player-coach team, or a former player coach team and I think that's
what helps us. We have had some success. We've gone to seven or eight Elite
Eights at least, maybe that many or more, I don't know exactly. So that means
deep runs in the tournament, they do that in 16, 18 years, that means you're
doing it every other year and I think when you do it every other year it
becomes part of the fabric of your program and you try to tell guys don't feel
the pressure of this, understand the privilege of this and I think they do.  
  
 Q. I wanted to ask you about Yante Maten, what you remember about
recruiting him, and the decision to offer him, and his decision to go to
Georgia?  
COACH IZZO: We didn't recruit Yante until very late, and probably our fault,
too. But he was a late bloomer, I think he would say that himself. Looks like
we were going to lose a kid and we tried to get in late. Georgia had already
done a great job and he made the right decision. We didn't recruit him like a
guy you would recruit or like he deserved to be recruited, but it wasn't out
of disrespect for him, it was more out of what our needs were, what we had.
Whether we lost the guy that we thought we were going to have to get rid of,
we turned to that. But Mark had done a great job with him and of course I
couldn't go in there and rip Georgia in any way, shape or form because I
respected Mark and my nephew and everyone else. So we really didn't get in the
door, if I was to tell you the truth. He never visited, we never visited him.  
  
 Q. I notice you had Alex Gauna on the trip. Can you talk about that
decision, asking him to come along and what that's meant for him and for you
to have him here.  
COACH IZZO: I heard a couple weeks ago that Alex was struggling, like all
players do when they get to the real world. Nothing bad. You're kind of lost.
I know I was. That's why Mariucci and I went back to grad school, we didn't
know what the hell to do. I'm sure he was going through some of the similar
things and I just went into my office that morning and I was kind of thinking
about all the players of the past, like I do often. I looked up on my board
and his name was up on my board, his phone number from last year. So I said
I'm going to give him a call. I gave him a call, he wasn't in. He called me
back, asked him how he's doing, he said okay. I said how would you like to
take the trip with us and kind of go out with your class you would have gone
out with, and I didn't know what he would say. He was so excited that it made
me feel good that I could do something for somebody and help them when maybe
everything's not perfect. When I told the players he was coming, I mean, I
think Branden Dawson and Matt Costello were the two most excited but they were
all excited. I think that's part of what you do as a coach. I think that's
what makes staying in the same place and having a family atmosphere, that's
what makes it so special. So he can't play, he can't practice. He can help
coach from the back seat in the film room, but I brought him along to just
enjoy the class he was with and spend some time with the guys.  
  
 Q. Tom, you were slipping up on whether you've been to seven or eight
Elite Eights. Georgia doesn't usually have that problem, they don't go to the
tournament every year; you guys do seemingly. What benefit is that to you guys
and to your players to have the tournament experience and what kind of
detriment could it be to Georgia in not having that experience?  
COACH IZZO: Well, I think it could be a positive or a negative either way. The
positive is you do have some guys with some experience, but last year's team
and the year before's team doesn't win this year's games. The other side of
it, Georgia hasn't been there for a while. I'm not sure any of those kids have
been there, have they? One kid. Just think how exciting it is for them and I
remember how excited we were the first time we went and with that set of
players, that raises their level. So it works both ways, to be honest with
you. I think a lot of people just think it's March and we're supposed to do
this and that, I'm fighting that. I would think March, fighting a little bit
of the inexperience and what do you do, but what we're both trying to do is
make our teams understand it's a privilege to be here, there is 68 out of 351
teams. It's exciting to be here, and really whatever you did in the past, you
can point to in some ways but that part of history is you don't change and
hopefully we can learn from what we did but I'm sure from his standpoint
they're so excited about the opportunity they have because they haven't had
it. So I think it's a coin flip on that, I think it works both ways. I'm not
downplaying our experience, especially with the three or four guys that have
had enormous -- but we have had four or five guys that have had almost none,
too, and I can tell that sometimes because when you get in this tournament
you've got to focus or every single second. The number of one- and two-point
games in this tournament are enormous and there's no question that Georgia is
as good as a lot of teams we played. They remind me of an Ohio State or an
Illinois or a Purdue, very solid, very stable. You know, those were win-and-
lose games for us during the year. Great respect. I think we have a little
advantage in experience, I think they have a little advantage in first-time
excitement and we'll see what the two will bring.

_CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  
MODERATOR: Jahlil Okafor and Quinn Cook from Duke. Questions?  
  
 Q. Jahlil, you've had a lot of firsts in your first year at Duke.
What's the biggest things you've learned going in your first NCAA Tournament,
and do you feel like you have some unfished business to take care of?  
JAHLIL OKAFOR: Just preparation, trying to prepare the same way for every
game, not trying to overthink tomorrow night's game, that being my first NCAA
March Madness game. Just preparing the same way, looking to my leaders, Quinn
Cook, Amile Jefferson, things like that, they've been helping me the whole
way.  
  
 Q. Jahlil, I want to ask you, you've obviously had a pretty good
freshman year. The Big Ten has floated a proposal to make freshmen ineligible
for varsity athletics. I'm just wondering your reaction to that and if that
was the rule, would you maybe have followed a different path coming out of the
high school?  
JAHLIL OKAFOR: I don't really have any comments about that. I'm happy it's not
a rule this year because I've had the time of my life playing here at Duke my
freshman year.  
  
 Q. Quinn, obviously you guys have said that this is a new season,
you're flush and everything, but you are coming off a loss and you guys have
been coming pretty good coming off losses this year. What's the secret behind
you guys have been able to be good coming off the losses this year?  
QUINN COOK: It's a new season, we're 0-0, taking it one game at a time, we're
flushing everything out that's happened in the regular season in the ACC
tournament and just starting fresh. We have a great Robert Morris team
tomorrow and we're just looking to play well tomorrow.  
  
 Q. For Quinn, your college career in the NCAA Tournament has been kind
of a wide range of early exits but a deep run. What have you learned, I guess,
in your past tournament experiences that you think will help this group?  
QUINN COOK: Have to play with a sense of urgency each game, everybody's
playing for their life right now, nobody wants the season to end. Teams are
playing their best basketball, teams are playing for something. So just trying
to -- don't want our season to end yet, just keep taking it one game at a
time.  
  
 Q. Jahlil, obviously it's all about the tournament right now, but
there's a lot of focus on you and your pro potential and so on. Is it hard to
put that in the back of your mind at this time or does this affect what could
happen in the next few months?  
JAHLIL OKAFOR: No, like you said, my focus right now is on the tournament, and
when I first decided I wanted to go to Duke University or even the thought of
college basketball, I always imagined the opportunity of winning a national
championship and the time is now and this is where I want to be, so all my
focus is on this right now.  
  
 Q. I just wondered, after the Notre Dame game, Coach K was pretty
unhappy, he said, with preparation and how you approached that game. He said
he hoped it would be a learning experience. Can both of you talk about what
you took out of that experience and if it will help you going forward?  
QUINN COOK: We didn't start the game the way we were supposed to. You can't
give a great team like that an 18-, 17-point lead, and we were playing catch-
up the entire second half. We cut it to had 4, cut it to 6 and they made big-
time plays. We know we can't start the game like that, guys, myself, Amile
being captains, we have to realize that when it's not going well in the first
couple of minutes we have to step up as leaders and take control. We didn't do
that in the first half and we chipped away at it but they made big plays.
Coming off a loss like that, we know what we need to do and we're ready to
start this new season and we are off to a great start tomorrow.  
  
JAHLIL OKAFOR: We were in a funk the entire game, the majority of the game,
and we just have to find a way to get each other out of that funk, trigger
something out of one another to get out of the funk. Coach let us know the
entire first half we weren't playing as well as we needed to, that's why he
called a timeout with like two minutes in the game because he could tell we
were going down the wrong path so we just have to find away to get the best
out of one another, we've been doing that the entire season, that was a bad
game for us.  
  
MODERATOR: Any other questions? Okay. Thank you, guys.  
  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Obviously we're happy and ecstatic to be here. We're going
to do our short workout right now. We have one kid, Grayson's been sick all
week, so he hasn't practiced yet. Hopefully he'll shoot and hopefully he'll be
ready tomorrow. But other than that, we're in good shape and ready to go. Any
questions that you all might have?  
  
 Q. I was listening to your show, Coach, yesterday, and you were talking
about -- Charles Barkley was also talking about how not everyone has the
competitive spirit, I guess, they need in this day and age at certain levels,
but it seems your team this year has that. Is that accurate, and if so, when
did you notice it?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Well, we actually -- he was talking about amateur basketball
and how so many games, sometimes you're not playing to win, you're just
playing to perform, and that that's something you might have to teach. I think
a coach always has to teach that to try to get them to be competitive at the
next level. If they're coming from high school, it's a different level of
competition and preparation. Our youngsters have been prepared pretty well,
not only by their high school programs but three of them played on two U.S.
teams, different teams that have won gold medals. So they learned another
level of competition. Our guys have been terrific throughout. It's been one of
my best groups. I've enjoyed every minute with this team, and they've given me
a heck of a regular season and our fans and now we're 0-0 and hopefully we can
do more.  
  
 Q. You have a couple guys on the team that have gone out early in the
tournament but also made a deep run in the tournament, I guess with Quinn and
those guys. How much has that experience helped when you've got the rest of
the guys that are so young?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: We haven't talked about it at all. I don't like to talk
about the past, I didn't talk about the past when we won national
championships and I'm not going to talk about the past when we've been
eliminated before the national championship. I think each year is a new year,
it's a new team, and they don't -- these kids do not live in the past,
especially a past that's not theirs. Like half our team doesn't have a past in
the NCAA Tournament. So it's really important to be in the moment that your
team is, and our guys are excited to play and we're ready to go. It's not
about what we've done successfully or unsuccessfully in the past. And we've
done mostly successfully, by the way. It's about what we're going to do right
now with this group, and that's what we're focused on.  
  
 Q. How have you seen Jahlil's game grow this season?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: It's grown continuously. And he's got a lot more growth
ahead of him. The main thing for Jah is that he's gotten better as the
season's gone along. I think the only thing that has set him back was the
injury at the first North Carolina game when he got injured with about three
minutes or so to go in the first half. That stopped some of his growth because
he's had to compensate. This week we actually saw a lot of improvement from
that injury, but since then he's pretty much played at less than a hundred
percent, although he's played well, I think if he can be really healthy for
tomorrow's game, I think he can do even better.  
  
 Q. Mike, curious with your military background and Marshall's decision
to enter the Army --  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: He's not in the Army yet.  
  
 Q. Yeah, well, the reserves.  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: He signed a contract.  
  
 Q. How difficult do you think that is to juggle? How well has he done
with that, and also are there some intangibles he gained from going through
that that helps the team?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: I told him his coach handled it well and David Robinson's
handled it well. No, I love the fact -- I love the fact that Marshall is
following his heart just like a youngster who might be caught up in medicine
or law or engineering or whatever. That's one of the beauties of coaching in
college, it's not just the passion you have to play for your university, but
it's the passion to get something out of your university that will help you.
Marshall's found that niche and I'm proud of him.  
  
 Q. Larry Brown said yesterday if Kentucky was in the Eastern Conference
of the NBA, they could make the playoffs out of the east. Your thoughts on
that? Is it just absurd to compare college teams like Duke and Kentucky to the
NBA even as bad as the Eastern Conference is?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: I don't watch Kentucky and I don't watch much of the Eastern
Conference of the NBA, so I'm watching Duke, so I'm not qualified to make a
comment on that.  
  
 Q. This is a little bit off topic as well, but having seen I hate
Christian Laettner recently, I was just wondering what the reaction is on your
part and in the Duke community to such a revealing portrait?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: I don't know what the -- again, I talked to Christian before
and after, told him that I loved him and always will and always have. To me,
obviously there are great things about it and some things I think some people
were in there that shouldn't be in there for as long because they didn't
warrant being in there that long. But overall it showed first of all what a
great player he was and it also showed how many great games we were in during
that four-year period and we were successful in most of them because of,
mainly because of him. So overall my reaction is great, and for him to get
that type of exposure, he's doing some commercials now, he's hanging with some
pretty good people in those commercials so I'm happy for him in that regard.  
  
 Q. Being a top seed, is there any added pressure to being a No. 1 seed
in a region?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Is there any added. No, I think there's pressure and
excitement for everybody. We're all, not now because there are games being
played, but everybody's 0-0, so it's a new season, it's a great season, and
it's a one-and-done season. So that either you feel pressure or you feel
excitement. Hopefully you feel something and then you respond to whatever
you're feeling in a positive manner. The seed doesn't make a difference, it's
your match-up and your ability to focus on who you're playing at that moment
and hopefully you get a chance to play another moment after that game.  
  
 Q. You mentioned Jah was healthier this week in practice. What were
some of the things you saw that made you feel better about the way things were
going?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Yeah. First of all, he started the last couple practices
fluid instead of working his way into it, favoring a little bit the ankle and
until he got warmed up, and then his lateral movements were, he didn't think
about them, he just did them. You could just tell, there's been a marked
improvement and hopefully nothing happens here in these 35, 40 minutes and
he'll be ready to go like that tomorrow.  
  
 Q. Mike, you said you were going to watch the North Florida/Morris game
driving down, and could you just give us your impressions of Morris and
problems they present?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: Well, Robert Morris played a great game, but I thought North
Florida, that was a really good game. We watched the first half on the bus and
we got in Charlotte in time to see the second half and we have watched the
game as a staff since then on tape, trying to study them and study more of
their games. They came up with a great comeback. I think the youngster Pryor
has special abilities. He's not just a good player, but he rises to the
occasion. Obviously Jones can make his own shots. Stewart can break you down.
They have two really good young players in Reed and Minnie. I think the kid
Minnie is really coming on as a 3-point shooter and offensive rebounder.
They're playing, I would think, as well as they've played all year and they've
handled the pressure of being in a game where they were behind and able to
come back and beat a really good team, beat another champion. The thing about
that game, you have two teams that are champions, they won their conference
and then they're playing against one another. That's one of the beauties of
the tournament.  
  
 Q. Coach, how does it feel to have the opportunity to play in Charlotte
again, come back here close to home?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: We love Charlotte, this venue and all that. We've lost and
won in North Carolina in the NCAA Tournament, so the location as far as an
outcome of the game, it's not like -- we're a national university, so it's not
like we have this amazing fan base here that's just going to pack people in
and all that. Hopefully we get a good number of people in. We're just happy to
be in the tournament and as healthy as we are. This venue has always done
well, whether it be ACC tournament or NCAA tournament. It's run
professionally, it's done really, really well. So we're happy to be here.  
  
 Q. You have four players with USA experience but in particular to the
three freshmen, did that give them a head start into understanding your system
and the team game?  
COACH KRZYZEWSKI: I'm not sure of my system, but it certainly gives them an
advantage. We have this good pipeline now, we've been involved nine years with
USA basketball now and we've tried to create a total program where these 14,
15, 16 year-olds who are going to become really outstanding players are able
to see basketball in a different light, playing against the great competition
around the world to get exposed to teams that they're not just the best
player, they might be coming off the bench, and to learn more and it's helped
tremendously. I think it's helped the game of basketball and as a result we've
been helped because we have a few of those guys with us. With what Jerry
Colangelo has done with USA basketball, I think has been really good for
basketball throughout our country.

_CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  
MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
 Q. Rysheed, it's nice to finally talk with you, I didn't know if this
moment would ever happen. Tell me, what are your hopes for tomorrow? What's it
going to be like for you to play in the NCAA Tournament game and how long have
you been waiting to do something like this?  
RYSHEED JORDAN: It's going to be great. I've been waiting since last year. I
just want to go out there and play my game, my teammates go out there and play
their game, just stick to the game plan, just win a game.  
  
 Q. Rysheed, we kind of don't really have all the background, but has
this been a rocky season for you, being away from the team and then being back
with the team? I mean, have things not gone very smoothly? Fill us in on
that.  
RYSHEED JORDAN: Well, I wouldn't say rocky. Everything is, I mean, I'm here
now, so that's all that matters, with my team right now.  
  
 Q. For D'Angelo and Jamal both, on Sunday Coach Lavin talked about how
he was happy that you guys weren't going to play until Friday night, it would
give you an opportunity to kind of see the tournament, feel the tournament.
Obviously this has been a pretty incredible first day, how much have you been
able to watch and how much have you been able to learn watching other teams
play, and some teams play above their heads and some play below?  
JAMAL BRANCH: I thought it was a good day. We definitely stayed at the hotel
and watched it together and we saw the teams that weren't ready and the teams
that were ready, and it's good to see that feeling before tomorrow so we know
we need to come out ready or anything is possible.  
  
D'ANGELO HARRISON: You know, it was an incredible day so far. Teams that won
made either runs late or early, so and then teams that haven't been winning
have been making a lot of shots as well. You just want to come out and be as
comfortable as you can, and establish the way you want to play and establish
the game so far.  
  
 Q. Rysheed, there's been a lot of talk about you in the NBA, whether
you're coming back next year. What are your plans for next year? How much are
you considering the NBA? Do you want to come back to St. John's, what are your
thoughts?  
RYSHEED JORDAN: Right now I'm not focused on that right now, I'm focused on
today's practice and tomorrow's game.  
  
 Q. For Rysheed, who up here has been -- has helped you the most in
adjusting to the college game and been any kind of mentor to you, and how
important do you think your shooting will be tomorrow in a game with no
Obekpa?  
RYSHEED JORDAN: Actually the whole team been -- I'm just going to go out there
and just shoot the ball how I've been shooting the ball every other game so I
think it will be good.  
  
 Q. Dom, you're going to be playing tomorrow without Obekpa, how does
your job change, how do your responsibilities change?  
SIR'DOMINIC POINTER: My responsibilities don't change at all. I'm going to go
out there and do what I do. Blocked shots, rebounds, what I do, it doesn't
change.  
  
 Q. For D'Angelo, can you give us a little bit of a rundown on how
choice you are with Shepard? How far back it dates, how you became friendly?  
D'ANGELO HARRISON: I've known Winston for a long time now. We played on the
same AAU team in high school, so I already know what his mindset is coming
into this game. You know, it's just going to be fun and it's good to see him.  
  
 Q. Maybe for Phil and D'Angelo, anyone else, San Diego State's full of
a roster of guys who have played in this tournament multiple times, two,
three, four years. Nine guys have played in it. None of you all have played,
is that a factor at all?  
PHIL GREENE IV: Not really. We going to live in the moment and we going to
come out with a lot of energy. When the ball goes up, it's anyone's game and
we going to come ready and prepared.  
  
KHADIM NDIAYE: I just think we're more hungry because we haven't been here so
I think that gives us an edge over them.  
  
JAMAL BRANCH: Just like what those guys said, we're going to go play our
hardest and give it all we got.  
  
 Q. For D'Angelo, what's it going to be like facing Winston, close
friends? He said you're like his brother. Never played obviously since -- for
a long time, he went to school out in Vegas. What's it going to be like going
up against someone you consider so close to you in a game of this magnitude?  
D'ANGELO HARRISON: Honestly I just want to beat him. Especially when we go to
back home, we go back to Houston workouts. When I see him in Houston, you're
going to want to have that edge, yeah, I beat him. That's my mindset going in,
I don't want to lose to him.  
  
 Q. Will it be fun facing him?  
D'ANGELO HARRISON: For sure. Me and Winston go back we've always been going at
it ever since we met. He grew since the last time I saw him, so it's going to
be fun, it's going to be a fun game.  
  
 Q. How important will it be for you guys to get in transition, force
turnovers and what are the advantages to playing with the small lineup against
a big team like this?  
PHIL GREENE IV: I think that we had to focus in on rebounding, it's a big team
and, like you said, we're going to be a smaller group so we all have to key in
and focus on rebounding and getting stops, to get out in transition, that's
basically it.  
  
SIR'DOMINIC POINTER: Yeah, we've got to go out and play St. John's basketball,
we got to rebound, run. We are a better half-court team than people think we
are, so we'll be fine. We just got to rebound, that's the main thing.  
  
 Q. In your best games, would you say that in addition to the transition
it's been the 3-point shooting that helped you in the big games?  
PHIL GREENE IV: Yeah, of course, because it opens up everything, our teams
can't sag off so when you making a lot of 3s, making tough shots, it opens up
the lane, getting easy baskets and getting to the free throw line.  
  
 Q. Guys, if we could just run it all the way down, in one word or two
words, how different has being at the NCAA Tournament where you've always
wanted to be, how different has it felt?  
MODERATOR: You want them all to answer it?  
  
D'ANGELO HARRISON: It's a great feeling but I want to win games in this
tournament.  
  
JAMAL BRANCH: Exciting.  
  
RYSHEED JORDAN: Joyful.  
  
PHIL GREENE IV: Amazing.  
  
SIR'DOMINIC POINTER: Exciting.  
  
KHADIM NDIAYE: Exciting.  
  
SIR'DOMINIC POINTER: You took my word.  
  
 Q. Rysheed, these last two years you've obviously dealt with a lot,
personal loss, up and down play, had some great moments, obviously had some
moments I'm sure you weren't proud of. What have you learned from everything
you've been through these last two years?  
RYSHEED JORDAN: I learned that no matter what goes on in my life, just stay on
the basketball court, take everything out on the court.  
  
 Q. How big of a motivational thing is it for you for people you've lost
close to you, how much has that driven you to make a career out of
basketball?  
RYSHEED JORDAN: It's real big because those are people that I love and they
love me playing this game. So each and every time I step on the court I think
of them, and just make me go harder.  
  
 Q. For Rysheed again, now that we finally hear your voice, these last
two years not being able to talk, what has been your thoughts on that being
kind of shielded from the media, the New York media. Would you have preferred
to talk? Do you think it's been a good idea for you not to talk?  
RYSHEED JORDAN: Well, I think it's been a good idea because I've been going
through a lot, so let my team just do the talking.  
  
 Q. Are you happy to be able to talk?  
RYSHEED JORDAN: Yeah.  
  
 Q. Why? Why are you glad to talk today?  
RYSHEED JORDAN: Because right now we on a big stage right now and I just want
to, like you said, just let y'all hear -- I don't know.  
  
 Q. One more for D'Angelo. You guys have been through untold kinds of
turmoil over the past four years or so, so in some respects are you prepared
for where you're going through right now with no Obekpa, playing with a
different kind of lineup, having to make all these adjustments in the last
second, even Rysheed talking?  
D'ANGELO HARRISON: We're old enough to adjust to anything, and Phil said it
best to just live in the moment and that's what we're prepared to do and
that's what we want to do as well.  
  
COACH LAVIN: Do you want to go ahead and start with some questions?  
  
 Q. Steve, I asked Dom this question, how do you counter the loss of
Obekpa tomorrow?  
COACH LAVIN: Well, naturally it's -- I should say it's less than ideal to not
have Chris Obekpa's services for the NCAA Tournament. Yet this group over the
past three years has had a number of stretches where we've had to play without
Chris and have been successful. So whether it was through foul trouble or
being disqualified from a game or fouling out or a number of injuries that
he's endured, this team has found a way to offset the loss of Chris in games,
in stretches of the season and still been successful. With that said, we
understand not having Chris at the rim as our goalie, kind of the protecter,
the player that provided resistance at the goal, will make it difficult for
us. But this group has played a number of styles of play, whether it's through
our full court press or through our trapping, and creating match-up problems
for teams that are bigger than us because our speed, our quickness, our skill,
you know, presents challenges for opponents.  
  
 Q. Steve, on Sunday after the brackets were revealed, you talked about
how you thought it was a good thing you guys will play late tomorrow, play
tomorrow, give you a chance to get acclimated, look at the tournament on TV,
get an idea of what they'll be in for. This is about as good a first four,
five hours you could ask for. I'm curious how much you were able to follow it,
how much you were able to encourage them to stay in their rooms and absorb it,
still reinforce that point?  
COACH LAVIN: There's no doubt when the kids came in the locker room, I came
over a couple hours earlier for meetings so I was able to watch in our locker
room the UCLA-SMU game that came down to the wire, and the highlights of the
Georgia State victory and we know Iowa State got bumped out as well. Some
days, sometimes the first day of the tournament's chalk, and then the upsets
start that second day. This appears to be one of those NCAA tournaments where
the upsets begin right out of the gate, and I think the advantage for the
teams that play on Friday is you gain very quickly a sense of March Madness
and how difficult it is to advance through the brackets independent of those
numbers that are next to these teams' names. A 3 and a 14 doesn't mean much
over that two-hour window if you don't bring the appropriate effort and level
of execution that gives you an opportunity to be successful. It doesn't -- you
know, when you get to the tournament, it's so clear, there are no guarantees
but you just want the probabilities or the percentages to be in your favor
because of the way you prepare and play, and the hope is with our team that
they'll have a better sense since we're playing on Friday night.  
  
 Q. Steve, have you given any thought at all, even a fleeting thought,
to how important tomorrow might be to whatever your future's going to be at
St. John's or is that something you'll worry about when you have to worry
about it?  
COACH LAVIN: You know, as we've spoken of before, the administration has been
so supportive from the first day that I was on the job here through today.
Three presidents, so there's been transition, but each of them from Father
Harrington to Father Levesque to our current president have been great bosses.
So there's never been any acrimony or any sense that it's an issue. This is
the best contract I've had in my coaching career, if we're going to talk about
contracts. So just been grateful, and as you can see with the group that's up
here, I mean, this is probably the most gratifying year of my career just
because the company I get to keep on a daily basis and watching the growth and
development of these seniors. They're all going to get their degree here in a
couple weeks from St. John's and I'm actually old fashioned enough or maybe
I'm naive to actually believe that that's important, to earn your college
degree. I know it's kind of a novel concept sometimes, but five seniors are
all going to walk with their college degrees this spring. And then naturally I
just couldn't be prouder of their growth and development each year, their kind
of undeniable progress. Independent, if we were to win six games this March,
which would be wonderful. If we were able to win four games, that's wonderful.
If we're not able to win a game, independent of the outcome of the basketball
game, this has just been a magic carpet ride, to come to St. John's, a program
with this tradition and heritage, to coach this particular group. And then
very unique, because we inherited a group of seniors that have not had success
and to be able to experience and participate with them in their first dance,
and now that's kind of a stepfather role which is difficult. That group, I'll
have a place in my heart for them because I'm eternally grateful for the ride
they took us on in that first year. I still think if D.J. Kennedy doesn't get
hurt, that's a Sweet 16, Elite 8 team. And now this group, they're all players
we brought in to experience and participate, another magical ride to the NCAA
Tournament, and it's rare you get to do that, where you inherit someone else's
players and they take you on a wonderful ride, and you get to your own players
to do it again.  
  
 Q. Steve, obviously you spent your share of time out west, and you knew
then what San Diego State's program may have been all about. But now they're
one of a half a dozen teams, there's seven or eight that have been six
straight times. What do you make of what's happened there and what Steve's
done?  
COACH LAVIN: Well, Coach Fisher brought a national name to San Diego State,
the credibility he brought to that program allowed them to recruit at a higher
level. Once you are able to recruit at a higher level, then you begin to
increase your win totals, and once you win enough games you make the NCAA
Tournament and when you do that on a regular basis, it provides the
opportunity to make a run in one of those tournaments. When all those factors
line up, you engage your base and you energize your fan base. So both Coach
Fisher and Coach Dutcher are a great team, they're a great tandem. Hope and a
Crosby, and Carson and McMahon. Because of the blueprint they had for Michigan
they were able to bring out west and the relationships they have in this
business, going back four decades is important and it's been a catalyst, it's
what's fueled the growth and development of their program, the growth and
development and the rise of San Diego State basketball.  
  
 Q. I apologize if this has been asked, much has been made of the
experience of San Diego State with so many players on their roster and so few
on yours. Does that make a difference in the NCAA Tournament? You've been here
a lot but does experience matter?  
COACH LAVIN: I think experience does matter, and yet we've seen time and time
again, you know, an upstart program that goes on a run and knocks off a
traditional basketball powerhouse, whether it's a mid major program like
George Mason or Northern Iowa or these programs that are dancing for the first
time and yet they make runs into the second weekend of play. So in my
experience, the teams that advance to the second weekend of play to Elite
Eights or Sweet 16s were senior-laden, every one of them, and the only times
we didn't, we didn't have senior-laden teams, with the exception being with
D.J. Kennedy going down the Big East tournament, it hurt our seeding because
he was injured, and then we got sent out west and played a good Gonzaga team
and came up short. With the exception of that year, '97 and '98 was senior-
laden, 2001-2002 was senior-laden, and we're senior-laden again. The
difference is before I came to St. John's, every year you're in the NCAA
Tournament, that's just a given. You're always bringing back an entire roster
where every player other than your freshmen has been to the NCAA tournament.
This was new territory, coming to St. John's where for ten years you're in the
desert, it's a drought, and none of the players have been in the NCAA
Tournament. Then after we made the NCAA Tournament, we were in a reset because
not one player returned the following year. That's why it took us three years
to get to 20, and four years to get to 21 and now we're back in the dance but
once you actually get here, I think it's madness because all that logic
oftentimes goes out the window and the brackets are busted and turned upside
down. That's why we love the NCAA Tournament.

# [NCAA MEN'S 2ND & 3RD ROUNDS:
CHARLOTTE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+2ND+%26+3RD+ROUNDS%3A+CHARLOTTE)

  

## March 19, 2015

  

### [Tony Bennett](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18257)

### [Malcolm Brogdon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26754)

### [Anthony Gill](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26712)

  
_CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  
MODERATOR: Virginia student-athletes, Malcolm Brogdon and Anthony Gill.
Questions?  
  
 Q. Malcolm, what did you guys kind of take away from last year's, your
first game of the NCAA Tournament last year when you played Coastal Carolina
and kind of came in as a heavy favorite, kind of similar to this year?  
MALCOLM BROGDON: Really it was just us getting a taste in our mouth, knowing
what it's like to be in an elite tournament like this and compete for
something special. I think we have a way more experienced group this year,
because the year before that we went to the NIT tournament. We have guys that
have been to the NCAA Tournament now and we're poised and we know how to fight
back on tough games on big stages, and I think that's the strength that we've
built over the last year.  
  
ANTHONY GILL: Like Malcolm said, I think we have a lot more experience this
year. Last year going into the NCAA Tournament when we played Coastal
Carolina, if you guys remember, we got down by a lot and had to fight our way
back and I think that really showed our toughness and I think this year we
can't come into this with the same mentality, we have to be more focused, we
have to be ready. I think we have to be prepared for the teams that they say
aren't that good, I think we have to be ready for that.  
  
 Q. Anthony, when you play a team that plays three and sometimes as many
as four guards, do you feel that you need to be more assertive offensively,
that you need to take advantage of that discrepancy?  
ANTHONY GILL: I think within reason. Within our offensive system when we have
an opportunity to exploit something, I think we will. Coach Bennett puts us in
great positions to succeed. We've been working on a couple things in practice
to be able to exploit different things, and I think it creates match-up
problems for us on the other end though as well. When they have four guards in
and got guys coming off screens, and things of that nature, it creates match-
up problems for us, too, so we'll have to be ready at both ends.  
  
 Q. Anthony, you went to Charlotte Christian, is this a bit of a
homecoming for you?  
ANTHONY GILL: It's great. Last year we were in Greensboro. I grew up in High
Point, and this year we're in Charlotte where I went to high school. I think
it's great, my whole family's going to be here, I'm blessed to be in this
situation.  
  
 Q. Anthony, I think when you were at South Carolina, you played a lot
of zone there. How has your defense gotten better over these past two years at
Virginia?  
ANTHONY GILL: Coming into the UVA program, when you're on your official visit,
they tell you you're going to play defense, and you're like, yeah, I bet we're
going to play defense. But when you get here, it's like a slap in the face,
you're going to play defense or you're not going to play. I think last year
that was the shock factor, I had it and I didn't really understand it. Really
developing, Coach Bennett and other coaches really working with me and getting
me better on my defense, I think put me in the right position this year.  
  
 Q. Following up on your Charlotte return, Anthony, you mentioned your
family's going to be here. How many other folks have reached out to you this
week, saying hey, can you get me a ticket, I would like to get in? What is
that whole experience of coming back to a place where you spent so much time,
like you did in Greensboro?  
ANTHONY GILL: It's great to see everybody at the game, but leading up to the
game is really stressful, trying to figure out who's going to get the tickets
and things of that nature. Last week in Greensboro, I think I had a total of
28 tickets and I think it's great to have the support but it gets kind of
stressful at times but it's just part of it though. You get a lot of love from
your family and friends and people you never really talk to the whole year but
once you come back home they want to get tickets, but I think it's pretty cool
though.  
  
 Q. Malcolm, obviously you guys have questions about Taylor Barnette
early in the week. What did you know about Belmont coming into this tournament
and how much of an education process is there?  
MALCOLM BROGDON: With any team whether or not you know a lot about them, it's
different once you get on the court with them. There's always going to be
adjustments we have got to make during the game tomorrow that we can't prepare
for today. But watching Belmont in the past over the course of this season
they're a team that likes to get up a lot of 3s. They shoot it at a good
percentage and they play a fast sort of motion offense with a few sets. I
think the challenge they present to most teams is they play four guards, five
guards, for a lot of teams that's hard to match-up with but for us we play the
pack line defense. We have very mobile bigs like Anthony that can move, that
can guard, most players on the floor so I think we'll present a challenge for
them.  
  
 Q. Have you seen them play on TV?  
MALCOLM BROGDON: I have, I've seen them play once or twice earlier this year.  
  
 Q. As a follow-up to that, is their style of play similar to Davidson's
at all?  
MALCOLM BROGDON: Very similar. During our practice early today Coach Bennett
actually drew that comparison because they have a lot of similarities in how
they get down the court, how they spot up at the perimeter and just run at the
three. So we have got to be able to close out with high hands and be very
alert on defense tomorrow.  
  
 Q. You guys have had such really good regular season and then kind of
tailed off a little bit. Do you feel that maybe you're under the radar in
terms of teams to really watch out for during this tournament?  
ANTHONY GILL: I think everybody's going to have their opinion. I think we know
where we stand regardless of how many games we lost in the last week or so, I
think we know what we're capable of. It's just up to us to go out there and do
it. Everybody says that they don't like our style of play or stuff like that,
but I think that we know who we are and that's how we're going to win games
and that's the only way we are going to win games is to play defense like we
do.  
  
 Q. Was there one game for you guys that maybe down the stretch felt
like a turning point game? Malcolm, if you can address this. The one thing I'm
thinking of, and I don't know if you guys agree, was the slow start at
Syracuse and the way you came back and really took over that game and ending
up beating the Orange at the Carrier Dome?  
MALCOLM BROGDON: A turning point in what way?  
  
 Q. In the sense that you faced adversity and you beat it back and you
go on and end up getting a victory.  
MALCOLM BROGDON: Absolutely. Syracuse was definitely one of those games for
us, one of the games where we had one of the slower starts of our season and
then come back. There had been a few games earlier but that was probably
against the best competition and probably the most dramatic comeback, because
we started off very slow in that game but again I think it speaks to our
resiliency and our experience and maturity that we have on our team from
playing in the NCAA Tournament last year and then from coming together and
playing well through the whole season.  
  
MODERATOR: Okay, thank you.  
  
 Q. Tony, certainly you were here with Washington State a few years ago.
You've got a lot of roots in Charlotte. Talk a little bit about what that
means to you, and certainly I guess your wife's from here and three years
playing professional basketball before you got into coaching.  
COACH BENNETT: Yeah, this is a special place. My wife's actually from Baton
Rouge, Louisiana but we met here. A terrific place. And it's changed so much.
I was here '92 to '95 and I just did an interview with Westwood One with Kelly
Tripucka, and I missed him by -- I think he was there, maybe he left in '90 or
'91, and we were exchanging memories. We were kind of teasing each other, we
were saying I can't believe our numbers aren't retired here, but I've been
telling my team and my kids, hey, I saw someone had a 25 Hornets jersey, so I
guess it's not, but special time. I did an interview with Tom Sorensen
yesterday about the memories of those years playing here and of course that
was a very unique time, I think, in professional sports and then my memories
of, for sure, meeting my wife here. That's phenomenal for me, it was a great
memory and our time here was special, the people we met. And even our
Washington State team got here and played Carolina in the Sweet 16, and the
opportunities I've had, and it's such an exciting time of year with this
tournament. We were in this arena, we played Davidson, so certainly know how
beautiful it is. And I think it's neat that the Hornets name is back, too.  
  
 Q. Can you update us on Justin's status and how effective, do you think
he'll play more in this tournament than he did in the ACC tournament and how
is he feeling?  
COACH BENNETT: It all depends. He only had two days of practice after being
off over a month with his hand injury heading into the ACC tournament, and the
appendectomy. So these practices, I think, leading up I think were valuable
from a stamina and conditioning standpoint, and even a feel standpoint of
playing and getting the reps in games or practice-like settings. So again
we'll see how it goes and I'm hopeful that he is further along than where he
was after those two games in the tournament and keep building on that because
we obviously know what he can do when he's right. I don't think it's fair to
say, oh, yeah, he is a hundred percent. He still has to wear protective things
and some of our reporters have asked me about do I still think he'll wear the
protective splint that he wore, and just see how it goes and hopefully he is
more comfortable with everything.  
  
 Q. Could you talk about what you've learned about Belmont since Sunday
night?  
COACH BENNETT: Yeah. The more you watch them, they're playing really good
basketball obviously with how many games they've won in a row and just Coach
Byrd's experience and their ability to spread the floor. They are one of those
teams, I've used the analogy, Notre Dame kind of will play the four guards, we
played Davidson who really challenge you. It is a tremendous challenge because
of their ability to shoot and they're sound and tough, you just see it. Well-
coached guys understand how to play, so it certainly puts a premium on our
ability to try to bother as many shots as we can, but to be in position, and
they rebound well because they have such long shots, and then they're sound
and steady defensively. When you get to this stage, you're going to have to
play and play well and against a team like that. Every team's dangerous at
this point, and we understand that, so the more I watch them, certainly the
more respect I have for the job they're doing and how they're playing.
Bradshaw is deceptive how he gets by people and we know obviously about
Taylor, but their interior guy can really score, Bradds. Just an efficient,
very good team.  
  
 Q. Tony, you guys against Coastal Carolina last year kind of came out a
little bit tight in that first game of the NCAA Tournament. Is there anything
that you tell the guys this time around?  
COACH BENNETT: Yeah, I remember Coastal Carolina, they hit some tough shots
and the ability to just play, there's so many possessions and again, we always
talk about trying to win the majority of those possessions or the percentage
of those. But yeah, you've got to rely on that experience, you want to be as
ready as you can but in the case of Belmont they can hit shots with hands in
the face, but if we're going to be good we have to make them hit most of those
shots, bothered shots. Just to be steady but ready. You can't feel your way
into everything, but there are going to be ebbs and flows. I think that is,
you just watch any kinds of games whether it's the conference tournament or
NCAA games and that part is important. So having that experience, those guys
who have been through it will understand it's just how it is. We'll hopefully
be more ready than we did and you're going to have to play it from start to
finish, I do know that.  
  
 Q. As you know, Coach Byrd is head of the rules committee, and in the
off-season, they're going to talk about ways to try to help the offense with
the decline. Is that something you even think about going into a game like
this and is it something you think about longterm how it might impact your
coaching going forward?  
COACH BENNETT: I was one of the coaches who voted for the 30-second shot
clock, which may surprise some in here it's what's best of the game. I've said
so many times I think one of the strengths of the college game for those who
watch it is there's different styles, and I think that is the beautiful thing
of the game. There always needs to be evaluation of the game, where can it
improve. Some people will stand on this side of the fence than others. If the
30-second shot clock, it will be interesting with the NIT to see the stats on
that and how it looks but I think there will probably be some good changes
made and my hope is that but I don't think about that right now. Whatever game
we've got, we have to play how we have to play.  
  
 Q. Justin said that you had tried on that splint that he's wearing and
kind of tried shooting with it. How did that feel to you?  
COACH BENNETT: I just wanted to see it. I actually put it on to see how it
felt. It's interesting, I think I've talked to you guys about this before. The
shooting not so much because you shoot with the big three, at least that's
what I was always thought and you kind of frame it. A little more of your
handles and your catching because you can't spread your pinky when you buddy
tape it and put it on. The question, the more he gets used to it or practices
with it, plays with it, the better you get at adjusting to it. I didn't notice
it too much shooting, I wouldn't say it was like without it, it was a little
more trying to handle it or catch that seemed like it slid out a little bit.  
  
 Q. Mike Tobey had 11, I believe, against Florida State, did not score
against Carolina. How important is it that you take advantage of the size
differential?  
COACH BENNETT: Certainly their ability to play four guards and spread you out,
there are some things there that maybe lean towards an advantage for us and
you're right, we have to, we have to do a good job on the glass, defensively
rebounding, offensively there's opportunities to go inside. Mike's got good
moves and is a skilled big man that we hope we can get him some touches when
he's in there, and that goes with all of our guys but, yeah, he did a good job
against Florida State. There weren't as many post moves. They were a little
more offs and ball screen and slip stuff, but certainly there will be some
match-up issues defensively, but offensively he'll have some advantages if he
can get deep position.  
  
 Q. You mentioned that you are in favor of the Hornets' name. What was
your reaction to that and how many of those guys do you come in contact with
or do you?  
COACH BENNETT: I have such fond memories of those three years when we got to
the playoffs and Alonzo hitting that shot against the Celtics. It's a great
memory for me so I'm glad that the name is back and it seems like the city
kind of rallied around it. Occasionally I'll see those guys, Muggsy or Dell,
but not often, we don't keep in touch that much. And that was you was such a
special time. I learned so much from those guys from that time that I share a
lot with our players. When I talk about Muggsy's heart and Dell's ability to
lock in and get in the zone, just use those experiences, from Alonzo's
competitiveness, it's always good, because when I tell my kids or other
people, hey, I used to play for the Charlotte Hornets, they're not in the NBA.
So now at least I have some validation, that that was a team in the NBA when I
was playing.  
  
 Q. Anthony Gill, who's obviously from here, when you got him on
transfer, what kind of rebounder, defender was he and what has he become for
you guys in these two years?  
COACH BENNETT: Anthony went to Charlotte Christian where Akil Mitchell went
to, well-coached obviously. The Curry brothers went there, so Shaun Brown has
done a great job there, and it's such a good school, but Anthony was a great
addition for us, he was an important part of us coming on to the scene and
becoming real solid. Him, Anthony and Malcolm both sat out, Malcolm was
injured so that was his red shirt year, Anthony was obviously the transfer and
I can remember in practices saying it's going to be nice when these two guys
are on the floor and we're going to have them. Anthony's always been a war I
don't remember, very aggressive on the offensive glass and certainly improved.
The coaches put him on the all-defensive team and he's gotten better and
better at that defensively and he's just improved like most players do because
he works at it, he's very driven, and very committed to his individual
development physically, skill development and he's really a team guy, that's
the one thing about it that you just love. He came in that way. He has been a
great addition and one of the better transfers you're going to find.  
  
 Q. Tony, is this a team that presents a match-up problem in that you
won't be able to post trap them because they're probably not going to play
through the way Duke played through that Okafor for that approach?  
COACH BENNETT: I'm sure their post guy they list them I think as a guard I saw
Evan Bradds, but he can score in there. At times you have to be ready, just
that the distances, they don't put two guys along the lane, there's usually
four around one and they're out. Doesn't mean it's impossible but they will
challenge you if you're going to do that. Again, as I said, it's a difficult
team to match-up with, I don't care what kind of defensive system you play.
When teams shoot that well and if they get it going, whether you're pressuring
or zoning or trying to play position pack defense like us, it presents
problems. But again, it's as I said, if we're doing the job, we're going to
have to be there bothering as many shots as possible. If they're getting wide
open rhythm looks, then you get behind and play. They are so good. I've never
seen a team, they'll get into that lane and throw skip passes and they're
flanked wide, and they're well-schooled in that regard.  
  
 Q. Taylor Barnette on Belmont used to play for you and it's kind of
ironic that he meets you in this game, player that you coached. What's that
like for you to face a player that you used to coach? And have you had a
chance to talk to him what would you tell him?  
COACH BENNETT: Yeah, well, he had a huge reason why they're here. The shot he
hit even at the game before. Taylor's a good young man and I'm happy for him
and I know he really likes Belmont and his sister still plays at UVA and it's
a fine family. He's done a real good job for them. As you were asking that, I
was thinking had I ever coached against a player that had transferred. I don't
know that I have.  
  
 Q. (No microphone)  
COACH BENNETT: I think so, yeah. And I've had a lot of players transfer, too.
I probably should have by now. He knows our guys and our guys like him. He's
explosive, he can get that thing going, he's a lefty. I know he'll be excited.
He's a confident man in the right way but he's humble, too. It will be I'm
sure exciting for everybody.

_CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA_  
  
MODERATOR: We're about to start with Belmont. Questions, please raise your
hand.  
  
 Q. Taylor as you look at the UVA defense, there were games this year,
the Louisville game, they gave up 14 points in the first half, and you watched
the film. Where do you see an opening, and do you think the fact that you guys
shoot so well could be the equalizer?  
TAYLOR BARNETTE: UVA, they're the best defensive team in the country, and
Coach Bennett is a very good defensive coach but Coach Byrd has a good game
plan and he's going to have us well prepared and we're going to run with what
he thinks best is going to work against their defense.  
  
 Q. Evan, I'm curious as you look at that defense, so much is talked
about shooting over the top of it, but for inside guy, the way they post trap
how do you view that match-up?  
EVAN BRADDS: Yeah, as soon as I would catch the ball they're going to be on
me, so I've just got to look for someone quick, look for a quick shot and it
looks like it's going to be a quick pass to somebody around the perimeter.  
  
 Q. Taylor, can you compare and contrast the styles that, obviously you
know Virginia's style, obviously know Belmont's style, how different are
they?  
TAYLOR BARNETTE: Very different. I mean, Virginia is a pack-it-in, seem to
slow-it down team and grind-it out game and we like to get up and down and
run. It's kind of a contrast of styles for sure so it should be fun to watch.  
  
 Q. Taylor, tell me about what you remember from your time at Virginia
and what it's going to be like when the ball goes up in the air and you're
going up against some of the guys you used to practice with every day?  
TAYLOR BARNETTE: It's going to be fun, I'm excited, no matter who we play I'll
be excited. Those are some of my best friends from freshman year of college.
It will be interesting and it will be fun, and I have a lot of respect for
that program and Coach Bennett and all those guys, so it will be a lot of fun
playing against them.  
  
 Q. Did you guys have a betting pool before this on how many Virginia
questions you would get because I can't help but notice the reaction on your
face?  
CRAIG BRADSHAW: Taylor said how many Virginia questions do you think I'm going
to get when we walk in here, so we kind of knew that was going to happen.  
  
 Q. Craig, you've made first team all-conference and first team All-
American, which has become somewhat of a tradition at Belmont. Can you talk a
little bit about what the message is from Coach Byrd about all you guys
getting your degrees, everyone is graduating?  
CRAIG BRADSHAW: Academics are really important for us. He recruits guys who
try to do good in the classroom as well as on the court. We've had a 10 year
streak of having a 3.0 or higher and you don't want to be the team to mess
that up, so that's what it's all about for us, just doing really good in the
classroom and on the court.  
  
 Q. First Reece, can you tell me a little bit about the match-up with
their point guard Perrantes, what do you see for that? And for all the guys,
how do you view the underdog seeding kind of situation you're in?  
REESE CHAMBERLAIN: Going into it, we've watched a lot of film, he's a great
player and kind of gets their team going, so any time I can shut him down
offensively and kind of drop past them defensively and get these guys shots,
that's what we're going for.  
  
 Q. Evan, regarding the underdog role?  
EVAN BRADDS: Yeah, I think we just kind of embraced it. I don't think we
expected to be a No. 1 or 2 seed so I think it's just something we have to
kind of take it as it is and just go out there and play and not pay too much
attention to it during the game.  
  
CRAIG BRADSHAW: We're underdog every time we come to the tournament, so it's
nothing new for us. Same freshman year, we played a great Arizona team down to
the wire, we are just going to be an underdog every time we come into the
tournament, so it's nothing new for us kind of used to it at this point.  
  
 Q. Reece, you're no stranger to the NCAA Tournament, this is your
fourth time. What has been your message as a senior to the rest of the team
that's playing in their first tournament?  
REESE CHAMBERLAIN: I've just been talking to the guys and making sure they
know it's just like any other game playing. We have the same roles on the
team, obviously we're playing a great team in Virginia, but at the same time
we've got to do what we do and take the coaches plan and execute it as well as
we can.  
  
 Q. This is for Evan. It looks as if you guys had a big win over
Morehead State, I believe you hit the 3 to get the winning streak started.
Could you talk about your, I think you went in with a three-game losing
streak, your mood going into the game and what that game might have done for
you.  
EVAN BRADDS: I think that was had a big turning point in our season. I think
we had just been kind of playing average and we started turning things around
and rode that momentum all the way into the conference tournament and
hopefully we're going to take some of that momentum with us tomorrow.  
  
 Q. Taylor, the Virginia players all rave about how much they love
playing that defensive style. You know best, do they really like it and what
style do you like?  
TAYLOR BARNETTE: I trust those guys. If that's what they say they like, then
that's what they like. I was very blessed to be able to play at Virginia and
I'm blessed to play where I am now and I'm thankful for that.  
  
 Q. Do you like their style better?  
TAYLOR BARNETTE: I like basketball in general, so it's just a good opportunity
to be able to play.  
  
 Q. Reece, I guess you've been with the program as long as anybody.
Could you talk a little bit about Coach Byrd for those of us who don't know
him and what kind of coach he is?  
REESE CHAMBERLAIN: He's got a great reputation and he exceeds that and he's a
great X's and O's coach, but at the same time he does a great job of pushing
his players, and gives us the freedom to make plays.  
  
 Q. Evan, have you seen video of your dad and grandfather? And if so,
does your game resemble one more than the others?  
EVAN BRADDS: I've seen a little of my dad. I don't think he ever touched the
paint, he was more of a shooter. My grandpa was probably as much inside as I
am so I would say it resembles more him than me, but he played more during the
peach basket day, they had to take the ball out of the basket so that was a
long time ago.  
  
MODERATOR: Thanks, guys. Starting with Coach Byrd  
  
COACH BYRD: Good afternoon. He asked me to make a general comment, so we're
obviously very happy to be here. This is a young basketball team for us
compared to the last several years, a team that a lot of the year was not as
good as our teams have been, but a young team has a better chance than most to
improve throughout the year and by the time we played Murray State or Eastern
Kentucky in the semi-final game, Murray State in the championship game, we
were a better team than we were much of the year and obviously got a big win
that's been talked about because of the dramatic ending. And then the spot it
put Murray State in because we were able to win that game. I feel bad for
them, they had a great year and a great team, but happy for and proud of our
kids.  
  
 Q. Coach, one of the simple ways of attacking this defense is passing
out of the post trap. I was wondering if you could give us a scouting report
on Evan, what kind of a passer is he offensively?  
COACH BYRD: Evan's a good passer, he's not a strong kid, and so if he is going
to create some rotation, then he's going to have to get rid of it quick and
make the right decision. That, of course, is the big problem. I've seen people
score it when they're doubling, I've seen people throw it in about the 15th
row across the floor trying to take advantage of it. So we'll see how that
evolves for us. It's something that we might do a little bit and it may be
something we don't do at all. They're just so good at trapping, whether it's
trapping the ball screens or trapping the post that it's real easy, it's
really easy to get -- we can't replicate that in practice and we've tried, so
we're going to have to react and be players during the game.  
  
 Q. As you've studied them, how much different are they when Justin
Anderson's at full health as opposed to when he's not?  
COACH BYRD: Well, certainly they seem to be a much better offensive team, the
numbers prove that. He's such an offensive talent in so many ways. So they're
better there. It looks to me like they're good defensively no matter who they
throw out there, I don't see any weak links, but it impacts them and I'm sure
that they hope and would much rather that he be at full strength.  
  
 Q. How much of an asset is Taylor having come from playing for Coach
Bennett and really understanding how their defense works? How much of an asset
is it for you guys getting ready for this game?  
COACH BYRD: Well, some, we obviously have asked Taylor some questions and he's
offered opinions about things, but here's the real difference: If you watch
Virginia on video, you already know what they do. They're one of those
programs that do what they do and they do it great and they do it consistently
and they're not going to change. We're not going to see a 1-3-1 zone tomorrow,
we didn't get ready for one. We're going to see a really good man-to-man
defense and a team that doesn't do a whole lot of different things on offense.
Certainly enough to prepare for, but it's right there for you to see, and I
think most coaches admire that kind of program more than any. Somebody that
will just go in and tell you, this is what we're going to do, this is how
we're going to do it, we're going to do it so good that we're going to beat
you, and that's what they do.  
  
 Q. You were quoted in Sports Illustrated, and I wrote it down here,
that the gradual decline in offensive basketball is reaching a point where a
lot of people think it's just too ugly. Do you think Virginia basketball is
ugly, and as you look to change possibly change some rules with the rules
committee in the off season, would you do things to limit what Virginia -- how
Virginia plays?  
COACH BYRD: Well, the quote says a lot of people think that, it doesn't say
that I think that. In fact, it's just interesting to me that there's all this
discussion about there's not enough scoring. Why do people even go to a soccer
game? I mean, to me, it's okay. I have total admiration for the way Virginia
plays. As a coach and not necessarily as the chair of the rules committee, I
think the game has evolved incrementally to where there is too much illegal
physical contact and it ought to be called because it's in the rule book.
Really, whether it's offensive or defensive -- defensive or offensive, I
should say. There's guys that post up and you've got no way to guard them
because they hold you off or they make illegal contact to get open. Illegal
ball screens, illegal stagger screens. There's a lot of stuff that goes on
that I wish was called by the rules but it slowly slides into that and you
hardly notice it and this is where you are and this is what's happened. The
rules haven't caused the low scoring in my opinion. Doesn't mean we don't have
to try to tweak them to make that part better. But I don't think, I don't
think so. In fact, I've watched an awful lot of Virginia defense in the last
several days and they do it about as good and legally as you can do it.  
  
 Q. Earlier, Craig said that every time they come to the tournament you
guys are an underdog, Belmont's an underdog. Do you want them to embrace that?
What's the philosophy? What do you talk about in the locker room entering
these tournaments?  
COACH BYRD: You would be surprised how little we talk about that sort of
thing. We approach this game like we would approach a regular season Saturday
afternoon OVC game. We prepare the same way, we talk about personnel the same
way. I've obviously told them a lot of things about how good they are
defensively and also have said it's easy to focus on their defense, but it's
going -- the game may hinge more on our defensive end of things. You can't
overlook that they're better offensively, they're better offensively than you
think they are because they're so good defensively. I just don't get into sort
of the psychology of all this stuff. We're 0-6 so maybe you could say you had
better get into it, but we're also 7 out of 8 conference championship games
and a whole lot of other good wins to get there. So I think the way we prepare
and the way we go about it, we'll just stay the same.  
  
 Q. You obviously have had success with this group of players and other
groups of players before them. Did you have any kind of master plan when you
came in? What's been the foundation of the program?  
COACH BYRD: I hardly get from day-to-day sometimes, much less a master plan.
What I've tried to do at Belmont is to recruit student-athletes that would
choose Belmont as a school as much as they would a basketball program and try
to make that a fit. I've tried to recruit guys with high character and that
were unselfish and that would be good teammates and would represent Belmont in
a good way and were still good basketball players. There's just some things I
was not willing to do because I think that much of Belmont as a university and
its reputation, and so a lot of people would think that approach cannot be
successful. At least in our case, I think it's really part of a big reason why
we have been successful. We've had so many good kids that like each other,
that play hard, that love to play basketball, that are not trouble anywhere
else off the court. I'm really, really fortunate to get to coach the kind of
kids I get to coach.  
  
 Q. You touched on their offense. Can you speak to the challenge of
facing an offense that doesn't necessarily have a central figure, a go-to
guy?  
COACH BYRD: It's the best kind of offense, if you ask me. They don't, but
they've got at least four guys on the floor most of the time that all have
their different abilities offensively, different ways to score the basketball.
They're a capable 3-point shooting team without really having any great -- a
lot of teams have one guy that you just can't let get a look, no matter what.
They've got four, five guys that are going to shoot between 35 and 40 percent,
which is plenty good, but we need them to shoot a little bit less tomorrow. I
think the biggest challenge we have is the size and strength difference, and
we're just going to have to see if we can hold our own inside, and if we make
a miss, if we can get the rebound. I thought we did that really good against a
Murray State team that's got a couple of big, strong post players particularly
in our league and we out-rebounded them offensively and defensively and held
their post players in check pretty good. They're not Virginia's team but
they're a good team and we've just gotten better at those kinds of things.
That's where we were weak at early on, too many offensive rebound baskets, too
many easy baskets period. Our focus and purpose on defense has improved.  
  
 Q. Could you talk about the stretch where you lost three games in a
row, including, I guess, back-to-back road games by two points and then you
get the dramatic win by Morehead State?  
COACH BYRD: If you look at our conference record at 11-5, we pretty much lost
the games that we were, quote unquote, supposed to lose, the tougher games on
the road. I would say we were disappointed in that last lost at Jacksonville
State, it's a game that a team that's good in the OVC needs to win, and I was
about as low as I can be personally about our team and how we were playing and
preparing. After that game, and we did get a really good last-second win at
home after losing those two straight two pointers against Morehead State and
then we were 18 down in the second half against Eastern Kentucky at home and
came back and won that game, and that one in particular just seemed to turn
our whole season around and we've played much, much better since the last 15
minutes of the eastern Kentucky game at home. We're finishing what I like
about this team, and maybe even this program is that we've just -- we finished
well over the years. Even though a year ago we lost the championship game to
Eastern Kentucky, we then went into NIT and won two games and almost beat
Clemson at Clemson, and played our best basketball at that time of the year
and sometimes it's hard to keep teams fresh and happy and enthusiastic and
ready to play at this time of year, even though it would seem to everybody in
this room that would be easy, you're playing in tournament basketball. We try
to do that as the season goes along, we try, try hard that we'll be excited
about playing right now and the game will still be a game and not feel like
work.  
  
 Q. Coach, when Taylor ended up coming to Belmont, what was it that
brought him to Belmont and how has he fit into the program since he's been
here?  
COACH BYRD: He fits terrific. I can say this, he's obviously had a lot of
media attention because he made the shot that got us here, and then as it
turns out who we play, that he transferred from Virginia. I think Taylor came
because he liked us the whole time we recruited him. We recruited him very
hard and for a long time, and it just came down to one of those situations
where all of a sudden we had two scholarship offers out and we only had one
scholarship left, and Craig Bradshaw said yes faster than Taylor said yes. and
those situations are unavoidable, and we tried to be really transparent in
where we were in that process. Here is where we are, here's what we've got. So
he was, just like any kid does, he was before his senior year trying to find
out if maybe he couldn't get an offer from the very highest level, and we're
not the very highest level and he lost it. So he ended up going to a great
program. There's a lot of reasons and a lot of good reasons to transfer, a lot
of okay, right reasons to transfer and I never get into that. But he's been a
great fit as a teammate and as a Belmont student-athlete. And he likes
Virginia basketball and Coach Bennett and Coach McKay and he are particularly
close, and has never said anything but positive things about his friends there
and the coaching staff. I don't see how you could do anything else. It's a
real shining example of what college basketball ought to be like, I think,
Virginia basketball.  
  
 Q. Is it correct your dad was a sports writer?  
COACH BYRD: It is, it is. I say that proudly, actually.  
  
 Q. What was that like for you?  
COACH BYRD: It was great, it shaped my life. I was a little kid that loved
sports and I got to go to all kinds of neat things. I got to go to Augusta and
watch the Masters. His beat was Tennessee basketball. In the football season,
his beat was SEC football games other than Tennessee. And we're talking about
Knoxville, talking about University of Tennessee. So I would take some road
trips with him, go to Georgia Tech, watch Georgia Tech and Alabama play
football. My favorite story or the one that people seem to be most interested
in is when I was a little kid, I sold programs at the Tennessee basketball
games and I was allowed to quit at tip-off, and I would scramble. At that time
there were only press tables, just tables. They were open underneath and I
would go sit under my dad on the edge of the court and watch great basketball,
watch and Adolf Rupp's Kentucky team and watch Pete Maravich and that kind of
stuff. I've got to give him credit or blame for what I ended up doing, I
guess.

# [NCAA MEN'S 2ND & 3RD ROUNDS:
COLUMBUS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+2ND+%26+3RD+ROUNDS%3A+COLUMBUS)

  

## March 22, 2015

  

### [Mark Turgeon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13696)

### [Dezmine Wells](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23451)

  
_COLUMBUS, OHIO_  
  

WEST VIRGINIA - 69  
MARYLAND - 59

THE MODERATOR: We're joined now by Maryland. We'll have an opening statement
and then turn it over to the student-athletes.  
  
COACH TURGEON: I think you gotta give West Virginia a lot of credit tonight.
They were terrific. The press was good. We weren't ourselves. We weren't very
good tonight. I thought the first 18 minutes we really played well. And we
weren't ourselves. Give them credit. And we didn't deserve to win. We didn't
play well enough to win. But with that said, I couldn't be more proud of my
team and what we accomplished this year. And today was a tough matchup for us.
This tournament's about matchups. If you want to advance, you've got to have
the right matchups and it wasn't a great one for us. But 28 wins, and we never
stopped playing today. As many times as we turned it over we kept competing. I
think we cut it to six there, maybe five. And I was proud of my group.  
  
 Q. Dez, what was it like going against the press tonight. It never
seemed to stop. They played 12 guys. Looked like they kept fresh bodies on the
floor. What was it like from your vantage point?  
DEZ WELLS: Their press, it was good. They kept throwing a lot of bodies at us.
And we turned the ball over more than we usually do. And it worked in their
favor. And they capitalized on our mistakes. So my hat goes off to Coach
Huggins and his team. They did a good job tonight.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, gentlemen. Coach Turgeon, we have questions.  
  
 Q. How much did Melo's constant going in and out with the injury and
whatnot kind of derail you guys a little bit tonight?  
COACH TURGEON: Obviously Melo is pretty important to us. And lucky for us he's
been healthy all year. That's pretty amazing. We have one point guard in our
program, and a really good one in Melo. And it's the first time all year
really that he couldn't play. He took a beating tonight. So would the outcome
have been different? We don't know. But obviously we weren't the same without
him out there. We were just trying to figure it out. And put a lot more on
Dez. And it was tough for us.  
  
 Q. I apologize if you already went through it in your opening
statement. But it looked like Melo hit his head a couple times. What was kind
of the process in terms of keeping him in the game the first time and then
taking him out after the second one?  
COACH TURGEON: Yeah, the first time he hit his head, he was fine. He bounced
up, everything was clear. No head, nothing. Evaluated by our physician, said
he could go back in. The second time he came out, he didn't pass enough of the
tests and his head was hurting. And so first time he was fine. Second time he
got kicked in the head, I think. And they said he can't come back.  
  
 Q. Did it look like watching -- it looked like watching him on the
bench looked like he was pretty upset. Did you guys tell him -- was it the
doctor who told him he couldn't go in at that point, or did you talk to him? I
was curious how --  
COACH TURGEON: The doctors decided. The doctors decided that he didn't pass
enough of the test to come back in. So, yeah, sure he's upset. He was playing
well.  
  
 Q. Did you get a look at the pick that knocked him down the first time,
or did you not see it clearly?  
COACH TURGEON: No, I saw it. And the referees looked at it and said it was
clean. I don't know if it was a clean screen. But they said it was. They said
there was no elbow.  
  
 Q. Did you think so?  
COACH TURGEON: I saw it in real time. I don't get to go over and look at the
monitor. But they promised me that it was a clean screen. So if it's not,
they're going to hear about it. And I told them that.  
  
 Q. Obviously the group was pretty emotional in there just now. And
talking a little bit about some of the stuff you said to them after the game.
I guess to the extent you want to share, what did you say to them during that
long meeting, huddle that you had?  
COACH TURGEON: I just thanked them. I mean, we were a team that was picked
tenth. And from the first time I worked with them in June until tonight, it
was an absolute blast coaching them. And they listened. They tried to get
better every day. And we did some amazing things this year. 28 wins, 26
regular season wins. 14 league wins. Second place finish. And I just thanked
them. I just thanked them for just being who they are. It's a special group.
And I thanked the seniors for setting a standard, getting us back to where
Maryland basketball should be. We haven't been here for about five years. And
I thanked the seniors for doing that. It was just really a great group to be
around every day. I'm really going to miss -- it's going to be hard, knowing
I'm not going to coach some of these guys again, it's really tough.  
  
 Q. Congratulations on your season. I apologize if it's already been
asked, but you talk a lot about how college basketball kind of works on a
cycle, on a one-year cycle, what do you have to do to build on this season
rather than have it reset?  
COACH TURGEON: Well, we've got a lot of momentum right now. And we have some
really good young players. I have a senior coming back in Jake Layman, who had
a terrific year. I have a guy sitting out named Robert Carter, he's pretty
darned good. And we're going to have two point guards on the roster next year,
which will help. We might add another one if we can. We'll add some pieces.
But the standard's been set. We'll work hard. Usually -- I haven't called them
freshmen all year -- but young guys from the end of their freshmen year to the
end of their sophomore year is when they really improve the most. So we have
four guys that I think are going to really improve a lot between now and a
year from this time. And so, you know, we've set a standard. And I think we
have the right pieces to keep this thing going.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach. Great season.

_COLUMBUS, OHIO_  
  

OKLAHOMA - 72  
DAYTON - 66

THE MODERATOR: We'll have the Dayton Flyers first. Please stand by for
realtime text. We're joined by Dayton head coach Archie Miller and student-
athletes Scoochie Smith and Jordan Sibert.  
  
COACH MILLER: Congratulations to Coach Kruger and Oklahoma. It's an impressive
team, and he's a terrific coach. It was a lot of fun preparing for them and
competing against them. I wish them well. For our guys, it was a really tough,
hard-fought game. I felt the start of the game, the wind, the legs, they kind
of shocked us a bit. But once we sort of get our feet on the ground a little
bit, we became ourselves and quite frankly we were right there. But we just
had a couple of plays not go our way. And give them credit for making them.
But it won't take away from the season. I'll remember this season for as long
as I live regardless of how long I coach. There will never be a team of seven
people duplicate what we did, win 27 games with six scholarship players, a
freshman, three sophomores. It will never been done again. And like I told
these guys, they've got nothing to be ashamed with how they've competed and
how they represent what we do, and continue to build on our program and a guy
like Jordan being a senior, I couldn't be prouder of him and what he was able
to accomplish and to be a difference-maker for us the last couple of years
really was a script that you couldn't have wrote any better. And, again, just
these guys did a great job.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. How much was fatigue a factor? I know you guys talk about never
getting tired, but you went ten minutes without making a field goal late in
the second half?  
SCOOCHIE SMITH: We don't get tired. We're still not tired. Won't be tired.
We're going to work out over the summer and be back next year and improve.  
  
JORDAN SIBERT: Yeah, just we just didn't make shots. Had nothing to do with us
being tired. Just some shots didn't go in. It's basketball.  
  
Q. Obviously it's disappointing the way this ended. But giving the
numbers that you guys had this season, the way things went, were you able to
be -- how happy are you and proud are you of the way you guys were able to
persevere and get to this point?  
JORDAN SIBERT: We lost the game, but one thing that I can say is I'm so proud
of my teammates. I'm so proud of this program and what we've been able to do.
I'm not a selfish person at all. I mean, of course I wanted to win for my
team. Stats, I don't care about that, I just wanted to win. But we started the
season together. We went out together. And I couldn't be more proud of these
guys. Like, these are my brothers, regardless. And I love them and I
appreciate them sticking with me, fighting every day.  
  
SCOOCHIE SMITH: We just had a good season, just staying together and
unfortunately we tried to win a game and do it for the Jordan in the senior
and try to make it remarkable and improve on last year's run and we came up
short.  
  
Q. What was it like at the beginning of the game when they were so hot
from 3-point range, and then what was it that you guys were able to do to have
that 15-0 run and get back in it?  
SCOOCHIE SMITH: They just shot real well from beyond the 3-point line. And
basketball is a game of runs. So we just stick with one another and try to run
them off the line and played a lot of team defense to get back in the game.  
  
JORDAN SIBERT: Just to go along with what Scooch said, just try to run them
off the line. I mean, their first, I think, four or five baskets came from the
3-point line. We knew we just had to limit that. And other than that just keep
playing team defense, do what we've been doing all year.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. I'll ask you the fatigue question. Obviously they're not going to
acknowledge it. Was fatigue a factor, do you think?  
COACH MILLER: Part of not acknowledging it is they were not allowed to
acknowledge it all season. We didn't let any outside words or noise or excuses
creep into the team. And it's one of the reasons we were able to be
successful. Fatigue played a role. I think to start the game our legs weren't
under us. But I did think we fought hard to get back. And I think the rest of
the game was much more like ourselves. But Jordan's really beat up. He's got
knees, he's got ankles, he's got this, he's got that. All the guys, when you
log the amount of minutes they've had year-round, it's tough not to have some
fatigue. But I'll tell you, I didn't sense that tonight's win or loss was due
to fatigue. I thought Oklahoma did a great job adjusting in the second half
and some things that they did I thought put us on some islands where we
weren't successful. And then offensively we weren't able to generate any two-
point baskets. The size bothered us, the physicality around the basketball, we
couldn't get any easy ones. But for the most part, I think if you watch the
game, I thought you would have said those guys were playing really hard.  
  
Q. You mentioned it during your statement about the numbers you guys had
and the accomplishments you guys made, how was this group able to do that
given the limitations of that?  
COACH MILLER: Tremendous togetherness. Tremendous togetherness, and there was
a tremendous chemistry on the floor that we were able to develop a lot of it
due to the returning guys understanding how we win and then they also got
tremendous chemistry as the season progressed because they played so many
minutes together. They sort of, you never really saw for long stretches guys
not doing their job, so to speak. So I think it was a combination of there was
experience level there. There was a lot of improvement in some of our players
from last year to this year, and I think us being able to keep our best
players on the floor helped. But there was a unique togetherness on the floor
and chemistry because I think a lot of it was just due to the amount of
playing time they did together.  
  
Q. I don't give a rip really about etiquette, John and I are seniors. We
want to say thank you for answering our questions for four years and are you
sad it's over especially this team?  
COACH MILLER: Of course. When a season comes to a conclusion you're always
down, especially the way we went down fighting all year, to get to this point.
But it's very unique to have a group deal with so much and then find a way to
not make any excuses and as a coach you want your guys to be together and be
unselfish and play in the right way, and I think that's the definition of this
group. This group will go down in the Dayton books as a very special one for
how they handled things. But yeah, I'm sad, when you're happy with your
players and you love coaching them, you want to keep going. And especially
when you've experienced this tournament like we have in the last couple of
years, advancing is something there's nothing like it. But we ran into a
really good team and I wouldn't be surprised if Oklahoma isn't playing in the
Final Four.  
  
Q. Talk about Davis. It seemed like he was growing up before your eyes,
canning those shots?  
COACH MILLER: Darrell is a terrific shooter. He went through an amazing
streak, I don't know if I've seen one right there about the end of December,
early January, I think he made 18 out of 19 or 19 out of 20 3s, and then went
through the freshmen ups and downs and bumps and grinds. And he finished
really well. The A-10 Tournament he didn't shoot the ball particularly well,
but he worked very hard and he stayed with it, and he stayed with it. And
without him we wouldn't have been able to advance. And today I think you saw a
little bit of a glimpse of what he can be as he gets older, more experienced,
stronger. He's a game changer from behind the 3-point line. And I think he's
got to develop some other areas. He's got to get stronger, number one, but to
be able to go through this year, play the amount of minutes he did, you know,
learn through some mistakes, my hope is his growing spurt will be like our
sophomores this year, and I think Darrell's got a bright future.  
  
Q. You were up 49-40, I think that Bobby Wehrli hit the 3. How good were
you feeling at that point?  
COACH MILLER: Really good. Defense was getting stops. And we were able to get
out in transition and we were able to make some shots. When we make shots, our
team's a little bit different. It felt good. And then right after that we gave
up a big 3. I think Booker hit one that cut it right back to six. That was a
really big play. And then as our lead was still within five or six, we had two
really back-breaking turnovers that sort of got their momentum back, and then
for us, we're a team that does a great job of really attacking the paint
through different positions, and our forwards really have success sometimes
with mismatches. I felt like Oklahoma's front line did a great job staying in
between us and the basket. And we had very tough two-point shots that a month
ago or whatever are a little easier to finish. You knock a couple two-point
shots down, you need some easy baskets. We weren't able to get that. And
credit to their defense, you know, I think they're the number one defense in
the Big 12. They also didn't foul. And we're a team that gets to the foul line
a lot. And we didn't get to the line today either. So they did some nice
things, taking that away from us.  
  
Q. Coach Kruger has now taken four teams to the Sweet 16 or beyond,
what's the significance of that to you?  
COACH MILLER: He's a Hall of Fame coach, and every place he's been he's done
it the right way. And every place he's been they play so hard, they play
together. I remember going to Arizona when he was at UNLV in these last couple
of years and we played them. And he did the same thing there and Hall of Fame
coach. A great guy, too.  
  
Q. In the past four years that you've been here, especially the last
two, can you just talk about the fan base, kind of the reenergizing of the fan
base and the following of the team and just the numbers out here tonight?  
COACH MILLER: Well, I mean, it's been well documented. I think one of college
basketball secrets. I think that's why our fans are so overwhelming when we
get to the point of this type of stage. People are enamored with it. But we
have that all year-round. We have that at home all the time. I do feel a sense
of pride right now that they're able to enjoy some of these march moments that
we're able to develop. I think this is the first time in two years -- I
believe this is right. The first time in 48 years that a Dayton team has won
and advanced in the tournament in back-to-back years. 48 years. They have a
lot to be happy for right now. There's some good things going on. And we gotta
keep building on it. But one of the reasons we're able to build on success is
our fan base is so good. So hats off to them. They pretty much took over
Columbus for us. If it wasn't for them, we wouldn't have been here anyway.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_COLUMBUS, OHIO_  
  

OKLAHOMA - 72  
DAYTON - 66

THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Oklahoma head coach Lon Kruger and student-
athletes Jordan Woodard, TaShawn Thomas, and Buddy Hield. Coach, an opening
statement.  
  
COACH KRUGER: Obviously great moment for the guys, my program, the fans.
Couldn't be more proud of them. Beat a really good Dayton ball club in a tough
environment. I thought Dayton played great. Coach Miller does a fantastic job.
And yet our guys hung in there, and Dayton made their run. I thought our guys
made some stops defensively right there. They converted into offense. And
again handled things well down the stretch. So guys did a great job. Proud of
them.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
 Q. Jordan, you and Buddy, could you talk about the play where they made
the steal late and the guy goes in for a layup, and Buddy blocks it. Jordan,
tell me what happened with the ball and what you saw in terms of Buddy, and
Buddy your block?  
JORDAN WOODARD: I should have took better care of the ball in that situation,
late game, but they made a great play on it. And Buddy, he made a hustle play,
winning play for us down in the stretch. We got a chance to get back, get the
ball back and close it out from there.  
  
BUDDY HIELD: Yeah, Jordan take the blame but he's the point guard, but it's
really my fault. Coach had me set up for a long time. I thought I was open for
a little ability. I felt him on my back. But I should have done a better job
setting up, but when the ball was stolen I had to get back and made a play on
the ball. I either had to foul them, don't let them get a shot up, but I made
a good hustle play. But he put the ball right in front of me and I just
blocked it, and it turned out good and Jordan got fouled, and he made two free
throws to put us up six, so it was a good deal.  
  
 Q. Jordan, when you're in the tournament bubble, obviously focused on
Dayton, how much attention can you pay to the rest of the region, 1 goes down,
2 goes down in front of you, how aware are you guys of that situation when you
go into a game?  
JORDAN WOODARD: Definitely, like in our off time, we watching all those games,
and we get to see who all is playing. But for the most part we're really just
staying focused on our opponent and taking one game at a time, one weekend at
a time, and that's really the only way you can advance in these tournament
situations. But yeah, we got a good matchup with Michigan State, and we're
excited to battle it out with them.  
  
 Q. Buddy, what were the huddles like when you were down seven, they
went through the second half, and then all of a sudden the defense just goes
up about nine notches?  
BUDDY HIELD: I thought it was crazy. We was getting after each other. And we
didn't play like how we wanted to play defensively. And Coach, we just stuck
with the process, trust the process. And Coach did a good job getting us
together. We stayed together, and Tay and Ryan were speaking up, and Isaiah
was speaking. We were all speaking up and we just trusted each other. Shows a
good sign for our team, trusting each other. Made big plays, you know, Frank
stepped up, made a big 3, went up nine. We did it together as a group. It was
fun.  
  
 Q. TaShawn, last part of the first, early part of the second half, your
defense was not very good. What happened there midway through the second half
where you guys shut them down, I think they went nine minutes without
scoring?  
TASHAWN THOMAS: I think everybody buckled down took care of their assignments
helped each other a lot more. I felt there were a lot of plays where it would
be, like, one person had to help and the second person had to help, and the
second help man was feeling like they didn't have to. That's when they kept on
getting a lot of open shots. And I felt we did like the little extra things
that just got us a little more stops and just being more physical through
screens and stuff like that.  
  
 Q. Jordan, how big a factor do you think the crowd was today?  
JORDAN WOODARD: Yeah, credit to them, they had a great crowd coming out. And
you could tell when they hit big shots, when they hit 3s and got off our
turnovers, and the crowd was going, but we just had to shut them down even
though they got the lead late in the game, shut it down and play our ball.  
  
 Q. TaShawn, can you talk about the start the team had? You guys just
sank I think your first four baskets with 3-pointers, stayed red hot. In the
second half you seemed to go more inside. Was that by plan, by design, or what
exactly happened with the offense?  
TASHAWN THOMAS: I think going inside was our plan coming in because we knew we
had a little size advantage. But I felt like that most of those beginning 3s
that we hit came off like inside, kicking it out to the wide-open 3. When we
seen that happen, everybody was like: Keep going inside and trying to find the
open 3-man, because they were doubling, but then they started switching it up,
and that's when I kind of started turning over the ball.  
  
 Q. Jordan, I think you had that big steal. You had one big steal, then
there was another steal in back-to-back possessions and Coach Miller was
saying that was a particularly pivotal part of the game. Were you guys trying
to extend the defense a little more? Was it just a matter of telegraphing a
pass? Was there something that you saw?  
JORDAN WOODARD: I feel like that might have been, we might have been coming
out of a timeout early. And the coaches challenged us to step it up on
defense, because we had to get the stops. And as a team I feel that's what we
were talking about, the first to win the game, we had to get stops and turn it
up a little bit. And I just wanted to make a play for my teammate on defense.
And I felt like Frank Booker got a late steal as well and that just helped us
get rolling on offense, too.  
  
 Q. Did you watch Michigan State beat Virginia earlier; if so, what were
your impressions of that game?  
JORDAN WOODARD: Yeah, I got to catch some of it. And I feel like they're a
great defensive team, well-coached team, and they play solid. I feel like it's
going to be a good challenge for us. But we've got to come out and play our
ball no matter who we're playing, Michigan State or Virginia. We've just got
to play the best ball we can play.  
  
TASHAWN THOMAS: Like Jordan said, I agree with that. I watched a couple of the
games. I mean a couple of, the end of that little game. And I just seen a lot
of energy. Michigan State playing with a lot of energy. And they kind of took
advantage away from Virginia. And I feel like if we let them do that, they'll
probably do the same thing. So we have to make sure that we stay together as a
team and just keep fighting with each other.  
  
BUDDY HIELD: What TaShawn said.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
 Q. I know this might not be the biggest blip on your radar screen, but
it's seldom a coach can say he's done something that no other coach has done.
What's that mean to you?  
COACH KRUGER: It obviously doesn't make a lot of difference in people's lives.
Certainly won't in mind. But it means we've had a lot of good players, a lot
of good programs and certainly proud of this group today. Kind of tough
conditions right there. We weren't playing the way we wanted to. I thought
Dayton was playing extremely well to dig in right there when they did. I
thought they showed a lot of growth on their part. And it's hard to do.  
  
 Q. When you as a coach and you have a region where a 1 and 2 goes down
in the opening weekend or with a conference that's had some teams lose games
in the first couple of days, is that something that weighs on a coach's mind?
Is it a concern? Is it something that enters your thoughts at all?  
COACH KRUGER: Not at all. We're going to play who is there. And we know it's
going to be tough. When you get to the Sweet 16, everyone deserves to be
there. They've gotten there for a reason. Obviously Michigan State is a
terrific program and Tom does a great job and they've got that NCAA success
culture. And our guys respect that. They know that the seeds really don't mean
anything. It will be a big-time battle, and we'll have to play really well to
have a chance to win.  
  
 Q. For lack of a better word how much damage control were you having to
do in the huddle there after Dayton made its run early in the second half?  
COACH KRUGER: We were a little fired up, a little excited. I think that's
normal at that time. I think the key is to calm down and stay poised and stay
within understand what each other's doing and stay together. And yet this
group, seeing a little fire out of them, a little emotion, is kind of good.
For them I think they've been more talkative in the last -- today and during
the game than probably I've ever seen them in terms of taking ownership and
taking the initiative and it's not a real talkative group by nature. So it's
good to see that. I think that's a little bit of growth that's good for us.  
  
 Q. What was the key defensively to when they just quit scoring at all,
about ten and a half minutes left in the game?  
COACH KRUGER: I thought our guys stepped up to the challenge a little bit,
fought the individual battles. I thought Pierre and Pollard are really tough
to guard in the post. I thought our big guys at that time had some really good
stops, stood their ground in there, did it without fouling, and that's hard to
do. Obviously on the perimeter. We had a couple of steals as well. Jordan is
very quick out there. Frank came up with a big steal. I thought we just took
on some individual challenges a little bit within the team concept at that
point.  
  
 Q. I think we first talked at the end of last year's NCAA Tournament
game about the need for this group to transform defensively to sort of take
the next step. Is today sort of fitting in the fact that that's really sort of
what turned the game and sort of got them where they couldn't go a year ago?  
COACH KRUGER: I think very fitting, because last year's group we just didn't
feel like we were made to get stops at critical times in ball games. We talked
about that. We could score, and obviously at critical times in this game our
guys come together and make several stops back to back. So the makeup of this
team, they're older, they're more understanding of what has to happen to win
tough games. And I thought that showed today.  
  
 Q. Buddy kind of makes the play of your guys' tournament so far with
that blocked shot, speaking of defenses, is that just him elevating his game
over this point last year?  
COACH KRUGER: Buddy is very athletic. He and Jordan were unhappy with the play
at mid court. So I thought Buddy's response, he's not going to give up on it.
He made it with effort and did it without fouling and obviously a key play in
the game.  
  
 Q. Last part of the first half, early second half, your offense wasn't
very good. But you scored on six of seven possessions after you got down nine,
got back in the game. What happened offensively to get you back sort of in
gear?  
COACH KRUGER: A little bit like what happened defensively in terms of being a
little stronger with the ball, being more aggressive on the attack. Reading --
seeing the defense. Finishing the opportunity. You gotta compete as hard --
sometimes we talk about competing hard on the defensive end. You have to do
the same thing on the defensive end. I thought we competed a little bit better
for the result right there during that stretch.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, congratulations. Good luck next week.

_COLUMBUS, OHIO_  
  

WEST VIRGINIA - 69  
MARYLAND - 59

THE MODERATOR: We're joined by West Virginia. We'll go right to questions for
the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Juwan, when you were a junior in high school here in Columbus, you
had a pretty special moment with LeBron James after the game, your state
championship game. What did he say during that long moment, and how big of an
impact did that have on you?  
JUWAN STATEN: You're taking me way back. He grabbed me close. He told me that,
he said that he lost a state final his junior year. He told me I was a special
player and to keep my head up. He told me to remember that moment for the rest
of my life. He told me to let that drive me for the rest of my life, never to
feel like that again. Those were wise words, and I've tried to live by them.
But that was just a lot of encouragement that he gave me.  
  
Q. To follow up on that, how neat is it going to be going to Cleveland
where he's obviously made a name for himself, and facing the challenge you
guys will be facing this week?  
JUWAN STATEN: I'll always be a LeBron fan but right now I'm not thinking about
him. I'm thinking about Kentucky. We have another game to play. We're in the
Sweet 16. It's one of our goals, and we just want to keep moving forward.
We've got a special group of guys, and we just want to take this team as far
as we can.  
  
Q. For all you guys, what's it like knowing you're now going against
Kentucky? What did you get done tonight? What do you think the message was you
sent tonight, starting with you Devin?  
DEVIN WILLIAMS: Pretty much just what we've been doing all season. It's
nothing that we've been -- is new. I mean, I guess it's kind of new to you
all, but the way we scrap, we get out there and we practice is the same way,
it's a (indiscernible) to the court. But pretty much we're just doing what we
do. And we just playing our hearts out and pretty much we just gotta get back,
prepare, focus and it's another team. It's another team. They put their
drawers on the same way we do. So that's pretty much it. We've just got to
prepare, and get our minds right.  
  
JUWAN STATEN: Dev said it best, they put their drawers on the same way we put
ours on. Like I said since we started we played the underdog role. They didn't
think we'd get past Buffalo. We got past Buffalo. They didn't think we'd get
past Maryland, we got past Maryland. I'm pretty sure nobody in the world
thinks we're going to get past Kentucky besides the 1.2 million that's in West
Virginia. So we're going to keep doing what we do. And keep playing.  
  
GARY BROWNE: We won't stop now that that got us all the way over here, so
we're not stopping. We don't care what other people say to be honest with you,
in my opinion. We have a small circle. We believe in our coaching staff. The
title don't have no name anyway.  
  
Q. Gary, could you tell, when could you tell you all were really getting
into these guys, maybe into their heads a little bit tonight with the
pressure, the constant pressure and stuff? When did it kind of turn, from your
vantage point?  
GARY BROWNE: When the guard worn out. When their guard worn out. That was a
big key right there for us. We told our guys, we make sure they he don't catch
the ball, we going to have other guys that can make great decisions make
decisions. That's what we've been doing all year and it worked today. And he
got tired. And I mean teams like that they don't know because they don't watch
us play all year. So...  
  
Q. Juwan, could you talk to that, too, the fact that you were able to
get the pressure going and the defense going better as the game wore on rather
than the other way around. It didn't seem like they figured it out. Seemed
like you sort of imposed it more as the game went on. What went into that?  
JUWAN STATEN: We had a game plan. We came into the tournament with a game
plan. And we said all we gotta do is get that first one. We didn't think teams
would be able to prepare for our pressure. Early in the game they we're making
good decisions. They were breaking our press. They were looking good, but they
were using a lot more energy than they had to use all year. So we knew that at
some point they would break. And they started slowing down. They started
getting a little shaky with the ball. And when we seen them throw it out of
bounds a couple times we tried to turn up our pressure. And pressure is -- you
know what pressure is. So we just wanted to turn it up on them and it worked
for us.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much.  
  
COACH HUGGINS: I'll try to say something intelligent that you didn't say.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Good luck. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Obviously when you install a full-court press system like this at the
beginning of the year this is what you had in mind. Did you think that these
group of guys could get to this kind of level the way you've played Friday and
tonight and shutting teams down, forcing 20-plus turnovers?  
COACH HUGGINS: Yeah, I did or we probably wouldn't have done it. You look at
the stats. We get 16 more shots than what they get. That's what we have to do.
We have to get more shots. We shot 36 percent the first half. They shot 55.
And we led by one. Because we get more shots. And that's what we are. We're
not -- it seemed like everywhere we go people say, well, it's not pretty.
Well, I think it's beautiful. I love it. I love the fact that we can not make
shots and still win, still find ways to score. We get 14 offensive rebounds.
We've led the country in offensive rebounds. And a lot of those things come
down to offensive rebounding and the pressure, comes down to -- it's hard
work. It's hard. And it comes down to having a lot of heart. And that's what I
told our guys at halftime. I said, you know, if you guys want to play pretty
we're going to lose. We've gotta do what we do. And they came out the second
half and did a pretty good job of it.  
  
Q. That was essentially what my question was. So thank you --  
COACH HUGGINS: I knew that, that's why I answered it there.  
  
Q. But given all of those things, the fact that you got 16 more shots.
15 steals, 14 offensive rebounds. You got bench points because you played 12
and they played seven or eight. Is this the kind of game that you can almost
frame and say, this is what we're supposed to be doing?  
COACH HUGGINS: Yeah. But I mean, honestly, that's what I told them the very
first day. The very first day we started that we can play a bunch of guys, but
you're going to have to play really, really hard. And it's going to be hard.
But we can do it. We can get you guys in the game. You can all have playing
time. You can all experience playing and have some success. But it's going to
be hard.  
  
Q. The players said they thought once they got past the first one, the
next one would be easier because they wouldn't have time to prepare. Now
you're back into that rhythm where you got a team that's prepared for you.
Where do you go from there?  
COACH HUGGINS: Fortunately they believe me when I tell them things like that.
Otherwise, I don't know where we'd be. But I mean, I think it is hard. I think
you've got one day to prepare for something that you've seen very little of
all year. I don't know. Cal's probably already been practicing it. I mean,
they let them play on Thursday at whatever, noon or whatever he's had a day
and a half already. And I'm not doing anything until tomorrow morning. I'm
tired. I'm going to get a break.  
  
Q. That's what I was going to ask you. You touched on this yesterday.
Does this put you all in a little bit of a bind, preparation-wise, basically
your biggest game of the year coming up?  
COACH HUGGINS: We're kind of used to it. We're kind of used to it. I mean, our
league plays Wednesdays, Tuesdays, Thursdays. So we're a little bit used to
it. The hard thing is we can't really do much tomorrow. So we'll practice
Tuesday and you really don't want to kill them on Wednesday because you need a
bunch of energy on Thursday. So it does hurt your preparation.  
  
Q. Follow up. Do you feel this team is ready for this kind of
challenge?  
COACH HUGGINS: Well, 36 people haven't been. I don't know. We're going to have
fun trying.  
  
Q. A lot of teams have been intimidated by Kentucky. It doesn't seem
like you've got a bunch of guys who are going to be intimidated by them.  
COACH HUGGINS: No. I mean, I wish I could sit here and tell you we're
definitely going to win. I can't do that. But I can tell you that we're not
going to be scared.  
  
Q. You seem to back off the picking up full court in the first half
quite a bit. A lot of the possessions. But did it a lot more in the second
half. Have you done that in other situations and why did you do it tonight?  
COACH HUGGINS: I don't know that we backed off. We just got spread out. We had
to change some things. And it's hard to change things without having some time
to make them understand what you want them to do. And we did a better job, I
think, after halftime, after we could -- I didn't want to give them layups. So
we were a little more conservative when they did some things that we really
weren't prepared for and then we went in and made some changes at halftime.  
  
Q. In your career, you've played -- you know, you've coached against a
lot of teams that were supposed to beat you. A lot of teams that you were
supposed to beat. Does playing against a Kentucky team, because of the streak
and that kind of stuff, does that mean anything different to you
professionally, do you think it will mean anything to the kids, or do you have
to approach it that that's irrelevant, it's just another game?  
COACH HUGGINS: I mean, it's not another game. It's because it's in the Sweet
16. It's in the NCAA Tournament and it's one-and-done. So you can't just say
it's another game. I just want our guys to make sure they know Cal's going to
have them ready to go. John and I go back 30, 40 years. We know each other
really, really well and we've played against each other a bunch of times.
Coached against each other a bunch of times. I wish I could play against Cal.
We'd have a better chance. But he'll have them ready. He always does. He does
a great job. And I think the hard thing is we don't know what their scheme's
going to be. That's the hard thing, you know, for us. Harder because --  
  
Q. (Off microphone)?  
COACH HUGGINS: You get tape and you try to figure out what people are going to
do. And we had an idea what Maryland was going to do. I don't know if
anybody's really pressed them. We'll have to go back and look. I don't know.  
  
Q. I think you're 8-2 now against John.  
COACH HUGGINS: Who is counting, Mike?  
  
Q. Somebody. Can you explain that sort of statistical edge, what the
difference has been?  
COACH HUGGINS: No. I can't. He's an absolutely terrific coach. He does -- very
few people could do what he did at UMass and then he went into Memphis when
they were struggling. And what he did at Memphis, I've got -- I mean John and
I tease each other a lot. But I've got great respect for him and for what he's
done and what he's been able to accomplish. So, like I said, he'll have them
ready. He always has them ready. You were there for a lot of the games. We
were fortunate. We won one time in Memphis because our guy thought we were
ahead and it was tied and he started dribbling it out, he was going to run the
clock out. And they jumped out and wouldn't let him take the ball out. I don't
know if they knew what the score was either. And he dribbled in, got a layup
and we won by two. I think you were there for that one. So, I mean, it's
crazy. But again I've just got great respect for Cal.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Congratulations, Coach. Good luck next week.

_COLUMBUS, OHIO_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
 Q. Gary was talking about you and the way you handled the ball and so
forth and stopping you, slowing you down will be a key. Wondering what teams
have tried to do against you this year and whatever kind of variance of
success they've had?  
MELO TRIMBLE: Mostly this year try to blitz the ball screens and pretty much
not letting me have the ball back once I give it up, and just deny me the ball
and stuff like that. And pretty much try to frustrate me, be physical with me
try to take me out of my game.  
  
 Q. Who is the best one?  
MELO TRIMBLE: I would say Michigan State team. Tum Tum really try to take me
out of my game by being physical and stuff like that. And when we played
Oklahoma State, they was a little bit physical too, and tried to frustrate me
and stuff like that.  
  
 Q. After having a day to reflect on what happened, how good does it
feel to be here and still be playing basketball the morning?  
DEZ WELLS: It feels great in the tournament, get a tournament win. That's big
for your program. So we just want to keep this going. But it feels amazing to
be here still.  
  
 Q. I'm wondering what is it like to try to prepare for West Virginia's
press on short notice? And also it seems like you guys have a lot of different
ball handlers other than just a point guard, but like four guys on the floor,
and your size at the guard positions, are those any kind of advantages in
helping you guys to prepare for the press?  
DEZ WELLS: We do have big guards. But they're a great team. So we just have to
prepare for them and be ready for whatever they throw at us. But they like to
play high octane and like to force turnovers. So I think we've done a great
job of taking care of the ball in those kind of situations. But I'm ready for
the challenge.  
  
MELO TRIMBLE: Pretty much what Dez said, we have big guards and stuff like
that. I think now that we're in the tournament, we play with more poise now
that we've seen how they press, and just be more calm, be more confident with
the ball.  
  
 Q. Melo, what impresses you about Juwan Staten, the West Virginia point
guard and how he plays?  
MELO TRIMBLE: He's a tough point guard, can score at all angles. He has a nice
pull-up. He's quick and explosive, kind of like myself. He's a veteran guard.
He's been in college for four years. So he's a great player.  
  
 Q. Dez, Jake didn't attempt a shot play until late in the second half
yesterday. It seems like he's been lacking in aggressiveness in the offense in
the last few games. In that sense, do you guys talk to him about being more
aggressive or do you think he needs to be more aggressive? Why do you think
he's been sort of lack of aggressive not taking shots on offense?  
DEZ WELLS: We let Jake be who he is on the court. That's what has allowed him
to elevate his game at times and stuff, but we just tell Jake to be who he is,
each and every day and each and every practice, and every time he steps on the
court to compete with us. I hadn't realize he didn't take a shot until the
second half. I remember the shot, they called a charge on him or something
like that. Jake is confident. He'll be back. He'll be ready to play tomorrow.
So we're not worried about that at all.  
  
 Q. Melo, wanted to ask you, when you get ready to play a team that
presses or gets after it like West Virginia, do you have to sort of psych
yourself up a little bit more than regulation, regular kind of team? How do
you kind of primp for that kind of pressure coming at you?  
MELO TRIMBLE: Just going out and playing with confidence, and not worrying
about our mistakes and playing basketball. We had teams press against us
before, the whole game, just like West Virginia, but not as aggressive. Just
going out there playing with confidence and we should be able to do fine.  
  
 Q. Dez, having been around a little bit, your roster's changed from
last year to this year but more importantly your success has changed, too.
What do you think was the key to turning it around this year and getting back
into the tournament?  
DEZ WELLS: I think the commitment day in, day out to a certain level of
excellence each and every practice and each and every game. You had a
willingness to buy into what Coach Turgeon wants us to do as a team and
everybody being unselfish and everybody's focused on winning. When everybody
has the same dream, the same goals in mind, it makes it a lot easier for Coach
Turgeon to coach and makes it a lot better and more fun for us to play with
each other.  
  
 Q. Their pressure is to force turnovers but it's also to set the tempo.
I'm wondering, they wanted to be at fast pace, is that something you guys are
comfortable with. It appears you like to run, too. Do they want to play a
little quicker perhaps than you do?  
DEZ WELLS: I think they like to play at a -- like a frenetic pace, but we're
used to that. Like we like to run. The challenge for us would be to recognize
when we have an advantage when we break their press. So if we don't have
numbers or we don't have an advantage against their defense after we break the
press, then to bring the ball back out and get it set up for a good play. Just
taking care of the ball. We can control our turnovers and control the tempo of
the game, then I think we have a good chance of winning.  
  
 Q. Daxter Miles said you two played against each other in AAU ball.
What do you recall from that?  
MELO TRIMBLE: At the time I was a little younger than him. From what I can
recall that he was a scorer, just like he is now. And he always played with a
heart and he always -- he was just out there competing a lot and playing good
defense, doing whatever it took to win.  
  
 Q. He said the team he played for tended to be a little bit more
physical than the team that you played for. Is that true? And does that kind
of remind you of what you're facing now with West Virginia?  
MELO TRIMBLE: That's true. But at the time we was young. So I mean that's
probably why they were more physical than us. But now things are different.
I'm with a better team. My teammates now, we all just want to win, do whatever
it takes.  
  
 Q. I think you all played at Ohio State this year, right? Which is the
better arena in Columbus, the Ohio State arena or this one?  
DEZ WELLS: I think any arena is better than a regular season arena when you're
playing in the NCAA Tournament. I'd say Nationwide is nice. But Ohio State has
a nice arena as well.  
  
MELO TRIMBLE: Yeah, like Dez said, Nationwide is pretty good. It's nice. But
Ohio State is better because that's where we're going to be playing, where
I'll be playing for the next four years or whatever. So, yeah.  
  
 Q. Just to be fair, since you are playing tomorrow, what do you all do
that's hard to prepare for that maybe people haven't discovered yet? A lot of
the conversation is getting ready for West Virginia and their pressure and
things like that, the other team will be, I'm sure you have things that you
think do well that's difficult to prepare for that West Virginia needs to be
aware of. What are those things? What has to happen for you guys tomorrow?  
DEZ WELLS: I think it's really hard to guard us in man, to guard us in man
because we have so many good shooters and so many guys that can penetrate the
ball. And we have a lot of guys who can do a lot of things with the
basketball, inside/out. I think that's a big adjustment. But from what I saw
they press back into a zone. So trying to figure out the key to breaking that
zone and their press will be essential for us. So it's going to be a great
challenge on either end.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
 Q. It's a little late in the season, I guess, making any changes. Do
you pretty much know what West Virginia is going to do? I assume they pretty
much know what you're going to do. Do you fine tune thing and hope to adapt to
personnel at this point?  
COACH TURGEON: West Virginia plays a style that we haven't seen all year. So
we'll have to prep for that. And they really don't allow you to run much
offense or doing anything like that. So we'll have to prepare and get ready.
We have different press offenses in and different things we do that we've
done. But, no, it's that time of year. You just give guys some information and
prepare them for certain things and hopefully you play well.  
  
 Q. Dovetailing off that, how do you prepare a team for pressure? Is it
mainly keep your cool? More than anything else? What's sort of the motto or
mantra there?  
COACH TURGEON: There's different ways to prepare for pressure. And whether you
attack, whether you -- you gotta play with poise. But I think it will take us
a while to get used to the pressure and the speed of the game. And hopefully
we'll adapt quickly to it. And then it comes down to the decision-making,
being tough, being strong with the ball and all that. They're relentless, like
no team I've seen in a long time, as far as constant pressure, pressure on the
ball. Doubling the ball type thing. So it's a unique style. It's worked really
well for them this year, obviously.  
  
 Q. West Virginia's defensive numbers improved from last year to this
year because they completely revamped what they were doing. Your numbers
improved. Did you guys make any tweaks from last year or was it simple
personnel or what went into the improvement of your numbers?  
COACH TURGEON: I think we have more defensive numbers, we have more length
around the rim. I think that's helped us. We have some pretty good depth. We
have some pretty good defenders. We have smart defenders. Really didn't change
a lot. So we press less. We were in the league a lot more this year which made
a difference, so we pressed less. But I think it's just having rim protectors.
Damonte Dodd and Ceko have helped with their length.  
  
 Q. Referring back to yesterday's game, you were on the other side of
defending a 3. How difficult is it to run a play that gets a good look at a 3
when at the end of the game situation and you know the other team has to get
that 3?  
COACH TURGEON: Offensively it's really hard. Unless there's just a huge
mistake made, it's really hard to get a clean look. So for us I thought we did
a terrific job on that whole possession before the timeout and after the
timeout. I thought we did a great job. But it's really hard. It's hard to get
a clean 3, especially when the defense is set.  
  
 Q. You've mentioned how relentless West Virginia is and they kind of
have that reputation nationally as being one of the toughest teams in the
country. Is that something that your team has a mindset of they want to step
up to that challenge or do they not care what people think about the other
team?  
COACH TURGEON: Yeah, I mean, we talked about it in scouting report this
morning. West Virginia has always played with toughness since Huggins has been
there. All his teams have played that way. So there's a lot of areas where you
need to be strong in double teams against pressure, when the ball's on the
glass is probably when they're their best. So there will be a lot of areas we
have to step up. I thought we played with more toughness last night than we've
played with in a while. But we're going to have to do that again and bring it
even a little bit more tomorrow night.  
  
 Q. It's kind of a unique game tomorrow in the sense that Maryland and
West Virginia, both East Coast kind of schools that are playing in conferences
more further west. Coach Huggins, since joining the Big 12, has made an effort
to try to kind of rekindle local rivalries and staying close in the non-
conference. Do you have to kind of look at that as well in your non-conference
scheduling? And question two, the size of your guards, being a bit bigger,
having a little more size, does that help in dealing with the pressure from
West Virginia?  
COACH TURGEON: Yeah, the first question, we just schedule the best we can,
whether it's local, national. We have some built-in things that give us a
chance to have a nice schedule. So we have that. It's a little easier when you
can play local teams as far as travel and budget-wise. I know that's always
big. And the second part of your question, I hope it helps. I hope that we can
see over the double teams. See over the traps. But we've got to be able to
handle them getting underneath us in that pressure. So that's key. But I do
have some big, strong guards that are pretty good at handling the ball and
hopefully that heighth does help us.  
  
 Q. This season when Damonte is in foul trouble, he's sort of been
rendered ineffective. Last night he had foul trouble all night, was still able
to have eight points, four blocks in just 16 minutes. How important was that
and what was the key to him overcoming that foul trouble and still being
defensive in the key?  
COACH TURGEON: He was good last night. And I think if you've been watching
Damonte really almost every game down here at the stretch he's improved and
gotten better and playing with more confidence. Last night he helped us
offensively too, got some putbacks and things around the rim. So good to see.
It really would be nice if he wasn't in foul trouble for a game. I thought the
Michigan State game hurt us with not having him and I thought last night it
hurt us, not having him in there as far as protecting the rim and good ball
screen defender, too. It will be hard because West Virginia just attacks all
the time. But hopefully he can figure out a way to stay out of trouble
tomorrow night and help us.  
  
 Q. Yesterday, just another close game for you guys. It seemed like you
handled that well, you're used to it. It tends to happen a lot in this
tournament, which I know you know that. What is it about your team or just
maybe the personalities or just even characteristics or statistics that you
think best explains why it's a tough-out in close games or even the
tournament?  
COACH TURGEON: For us, it's been we won some close games. And we had some
close games that probably shouldn't have been close. And it just kind of
became who we were. And so we'd get an eight-point lead and all of a sudden it
would be tied. We'd go back up six and be tied. It's kind of gone on all year.
The reason we've been successful in those games so far this year is when the
game's on the line we defend pretty well and we rebound pretty well. And we've
really had to work hard on execution late in the games because of it. And then
we have obviously a really good point guard in Melo and player in Dez Wells
and Jake Layman, guys we can go to. And knock on wood we've been able to make
free throws in close games. So really that's how we've been able to come out
on top in most of the games.  
  
 Q. Wonder if you have an opinion on an NCAA Tournament game starting
almost at 11:00, like last night's?  
COACH TURGEON: Yeah, my opinion is it's not good. It's not good for anybody, I
don't think. Not good for the players. Not good for the fans. I'll probably
get in trouble for saying that. But I wish we could start earlier. Long day as
it is sitting around being nervous.  
  
 Q. The two teams are somewhat similar in that the rosters have kind of
shuffled a little bit from the last offseason to this season, and it's not
easy blending in guys and getting back with a significant win improvement. How
has that happened on your watch this year?  
COACH TURGEON: I have good seniors, good leadership. Dez Wells, his leadership
has been terrific. We have a good group -- we have a group of guys that
respect each other on the floor and our pieces fit. Our personalities fit and
it's just been a real fun team. And I kind of knew way back in June when we
started practicing that we were going to be pretty good. I didn't know we'd
win 28 games and be sitting here today, but I knew we had a chance to be
pretty good.  
  
 Q. Bobby Hurley came up here the other day was mentioning when he was
trying to simulate Buffalo's defense he was out there joining his crew, to
join their full court press, that simulation. Kansas threw eight guys out
there. Are you guys trying to do anything else that's kind of a little bit off
beat to simulate what you're going to see from West Virginia?  
COACH TURGEON: It's really hard. We played a game yesterday. And we're going
to have to have a ton of energy for tomorrow night. So we can't practice too
much today. Something I never do but I did this year is we practiced on press
offense earlier this week versus six, seven guys. I had a feeling that it
might come to this. So we've prepared a little bit earlier in the week when we
had time for West Virginia. Today we'll add a few things, just have some
different looks. But not a lot of prep time. And I think Huggins had a press
conference right when I got into the tournament and said, we're going to be
really hard to prepare for for that second team. And he's right, because you
don't have a lot of time to prepare for all the things they do in their
presses. But we'll do some things. I've got smart players and they should be
able to react. And we couldn't simulate their pressure no matter how hard we
tried or their speed. So we're just going to have to get used to it tomorrow.  
  
 Q. I want to ask about Jake. How has he affected the game without
scoring, have you noticed? And what do you have to do to get him back to
scoring?  
COACH TURGEON: I thought Jake was terrific last night. He had a tough matchup
with Peters. Really competed. Rebounded well for us. Stepped up and made free
throws late in the game. But we need to get Jake going. We need to get him
more shots. But he's got to find shots. They were zoning. Jared comes out and
finds five shots in the first half. Jake's gotta find those shots, too, in our
zone offense. So hopefully tomorrow night, with the style of play we're going
against will open things up. For us to beat West Virginia we need Jake to get
going offensively. And I think it will be good. I think he'll be more relaxed
tomorrow night and ready to go and ready to help us.  
  
 Q. Want to follow up on what you just answered a little while ago. But
was it a little bit of a mind game for you to sort of like throw a little bit
of press, preparation in there early? You know what I mean, from a Jake
standpoint? How do you kind of approach that, because you know you've got to
play two games in three days?  
COACH TURGEON: I think the whole thing was, when I sold it to my players:
Guys, we're going to work on everything today. We had a couple of extra days
to practice. We went twice on Tuesday. I think we practiced twice Tuesday. So
I had time to do things. I said we're going to prepare for everything. We're
going to work on press offense, zone offense, this defense, that defense. So
kind of just had that mindset to kind of fool them. They're probably smart
enough to know we were working against West Virginia in that practice. But it
was good. It was 15-, 20-minute session on press offense and just did one of
two different things and just put a lot of guys on the court, made it really
hard for us.  
  
 Q. With regard to preparation, Dez said your half court offense can be
tough to defend. I think you and Melo both mentioned length, maybe even at the
guard position in particular, what advantages in short prep does Maryland have
that West Virginia has to get ready for?  
COACH TURGEON: I don't know what advantages we have. It would be really hard
to run a half court offense against these guys. I know that. But we have good
players. So if they're trapping us and pressuring us, we're good at driving
the ball. If they trap, we've got a lot of good players that can make plays.
So it's just that we don't get too sped up and make bad decisions is the whole
deal. But I like our team, when teams are trapping us and pressing us, because
I think we have really good players that can make plays.  
  
 Q. This has nothing to do with your game in particular, but it's been
45 years since Austin Carr set the record for 61 points in an NCAA Tournament
game. Looks like a record that may never be broken. Can you, with the style of
game that college basketball has become, could you ever -- is that an
unbreakable record? Could you ever even imagine a guy going off for 61 these
days?  
COACH TURGEON: I don't know if it's unbreakable. It will be hard in a
tournament game because you're playing against really good teams, probably
really well coached. To get to 61 would be hard. You don't know who is going
to come along next, who is going to be the next great player and have the
opportunity to get hot. And the team might -- but that's pretty amazing
record. And I was a big Notre Dame fan. So that was good to see. But it's
hard. But I think our game is terrific. People talk about game this, game
that, not scoring. Some really good coaches. Some really good players. Some
really good defenses. And I think our game's in great shape. Obviously by the
first day of this NCAA Tournament it showed that.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

### [Jordan Sibert](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26118)

### [Scoochie Smith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28633)

  
_COLUMBUS, OHIO_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with questions for the student-athletes.  
  
 Q. This program for 30 years won one NCAA Tournament game. The last two
years you won five. Where do you think the program is right now?  
JORDAN SIBERT: We're definitely changing. We're evolving. Over the course of
these years, well my three years and Scooch's two years, we've definitely
tried to change the mindset around here and focus more on winning and just
focus on together. Coach Arch has done a great job bringing us together and
having a true team philosophy that we've embraced. And I think it's really
working, and we've really been able to change the culture around there.  
  
SCOOCHIE SMITH: We have a real good staff behind us and just to bring in the
type of recruits that we have, just to be together and stuff, as Jordan said,
it just helps a lot to change the face of the program. And we're just buying
in on what Archie is selling us each and every day, which helps us play as
hard as we can and be for one another throughout the 40 minutes of the game.  
  
 Q. Scooch, I know you guys aren't tired. But what time did you guys get
back to the hotel? Did you get some sleep? Is there a nap planned for today?
The game was done at 1:00, but what was the sleep schedule for you?  
SCOOCHIE SMITH: For me I didn't get to sleep until about 3:00. We had brunch
today. But it's just back to work. So however much sleep we got, we're just
ready to work and just ready to play the next game tomorrow.  
  
JORDAN SIBERT: Kind of the same with Scooch. I didn't go to sleep until late.
Got a little extra treatment and I kind of crashed. But we'll figure it out.
Whenever we can get rest we'll get it. We're just excited to still be here and
being able to play.  
  
 Q. Sixth game in ten days now. How is your body feeling? How would you
describe what this sort of grind has been like?  
JORDAN SIBERT: We feel fine. Our training staff has done a great job of making
sure we get extra treatment. Our staff makes sure we get rest whenever we can.
And we've just done a great job staying off our feet and trying to take a more
mental approach instead of a physical approach. We have had a lot of games in
a short span of time, but we're just doing the best we can to make sure that
we're recovering.  
  
SCOOCHIE SMITH: We feel good. Getting a win and having another chance to try
to survive and advance, we get rejuvenated just from that. Everybody is
feeling good, getting recovery, treatment, eating well and drinking water and
staying hydrated and just not being tired.  
  
JORDAN SIBERT: Yeah, we don't get tired.  
  
 Q. Can you give us an analysis on what you see from Oklahoma or have
you had a chance to look at them?  
SCOOCHIE SMITH: I had a chance to see them a little bit this year on
television. But not so much -- I know they have great perimeter guard play in
their three guards, starting guards. And that's something that we have a
little bit of emphasis on for next game.  
  
JORDAN SIBERT: Kind of what Scooch said. Just great perimeter scoring. Gotta
work on our transition defense. We know they're great in transition. But
that's mainly what we saw so far on film. I haven't watched them like Scooch
has. But from what I've seen from film just a great shooting team.  
  
 Q. Scooch, can you talk about your comfort level yesterday going up
against Dunn. He hadn't played in the tournament before. Just your comfort
level as sophomore -- the same age as him, but the experience of last year and
coming out to a big stage like this and playing well?  
SCOOCHIE SMITH: Just being real comfortable and have my teammates and the
coaching staff believe in me, it just helps a lot and just being in this
moment before it also helps a lot, just to know what it takes to win and how
hard you gotta play, how tough you gotta be for the whole 40 minutes of the
game. And just stick with your team just to get that win and be right there to
win the game.  
  
 Q. I was going to ask both of you having the experience last year how
has that prepared you for the "grind" of the tournament?  
JORDAN SIBERT: Coming into it, we were used to it. Especially after last year.
You kind of -- you kind of get used to the feeling of what it's like to be on
the biggest stage in college basketball. You get used to the lights and you
get used to just being in the atmosphere. And it's good that we've been able
to stay close to home and we've also had our home crowd support us and that's
really helped us to victories. But it's a mentality. And winning is a
mentality. And over the course of these two years we've been able to gain
that.  
  
SCOOCHIE SMITH: As Jordan said, just being here, it helps to grind even more.
It puts you even more just to want to win. And just as a competitor you should
want to win regardless, and just being on the biggest stage in sports in
general is a blessing.  
  
 Q. It may be hard for you to answer this because you're inside the
bubble. But what do you think the perception is of UD nationally? Do you think
they think of you as a mid-major program. Is that something you hate that
label?  
SCOOCHIE SMITH: I think everyone says we're a mid-major program. But you know
we've battled with the best of them throughout my two years here at least, and
we just take pride in that. And as I said before, just being competitors and
just playing as tough as you can, you never know who will come out with the
win, each and every game.  
  
JORDAN SIBERT: I don't know what people think of us. And I mean me,
personally, I really don't care. I mean because regardless if they think we're
a mid-major team, they think we're good or we're not good, we still have to go
out there and we have to compete against high-major teams, against great teams
like Oklahoma tomorrow. And we have to prove ourselves regardless if people
think we're good or not, we have to go out there and play and prove it.  
  
 Q. Your crowd was tremendous last night. Can you talk about how big a
factor they were, and then you had them in the first game as well, and what
you expect against Oklahoma, from a crowd standpoint?  
SCOOCHIE SMITH: The Flyer Faithful, they're terrific. They support us wherever
and whenever they need to. Just to have them there they kind of get us going,
get us a little more energy. And they're behind us in our best moments and our
bad moments. And we're real grateful for that.  
  
JORDAN SIBERT: Kind of what Scooch said. It's great to have them there. It's
great to have them be able to travel. Travel as well as they do. And it was
great even yesterday watching Providence try to call plays and our crowd is so
loud they can't even hear each other call plays. That's a credit to our fans.
And we appreciate them so much for just coming and continuing to support us.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
 Q. I don't know if the nation needed a reminder, but do you think the
environment that they've seen for your two tournament games so far, and what
people have seen on television in Dayton and the games in Columbus, overall,
have provided an audience what basketball means to Ohioans?  
COACH MILLER: I think so. I think that our fan base, in my opinion, is the
best basketball fan base in the state of Ohio. I don't know if there would be
a lot of people that would argue with that, year-round. The fact that we're in
this timeframe and playing and they get to take center stage, I think it
almost overwhelms people to a point where they feel the need they have to talk
about it, it's so impressive. For my guys, our staff, it's common for us. We
know what they do, what they're about. And I think it's also why a lot of
people are probably picking at us a little bit for playing these "home" games,
because they know what's coming when we play close to campus. But I also say
this, if we were playing in Charlotte, if we were playing in Pittsburgh, they
would travel there, too. So I think that's the impressive thing about it.  
  
 Q. Since you've been in Dayton, how much have you gotten to know about
or know Roosevelt Chapman and what he did 30 years ago and his story,
particularly his game against Oklahoma out in Salt Lake City?  
COACH MILLER: I mean, that's part of the glory days, Roosevelt and Coach
Donoher a run in '84, and the all-time leading scorer in school history was a
terrific player. And Coach Donoher, about a year ago, it wasn't a year ago,
maybe a season ago, we were talking about zone offense, and he brought me some
old tape of his with Roosevelt playing against the zone and some of the NCAA
Tournament games, and it was amazing to watch him play at his size what he got
done and he'll probably go down as probably the greatest player ever to play
in this school.  
  
 Q. What's your stance now that you've played an NCAA Tournament game
starting at 10:50 p.m. local time, how much of kind of a bind did that put you
guys in?  
COACH MILLER: There was no bind. We took the extra time and got extra rest. I
was actually a little bit excited we got a few more hours off our feet. The
disadvantage of playing the game isn't actually the game, it's leaving the
arena and arriving at your hotel at 2:30 in the morning. When you have the
turnarounds in the tournament, that's something that you don't want to have to
deal with, because you know at 2:30 they're not able to sleep right away. I
know myself, it's 4:30, 5:00 in the morning, and you're still sort of doing
it. And then you wake up and you've got to deal with the hangover effect of a
late night. But young guys are resilient, we'll do our best to keep them off
their feet. By the time we get to 6:00 or whatever it may be tomorrow we'll be
ready to go.  
  
 Q. Your two players in here a while ago, they refer to you as Archie.
Is that understood?  
COACH MILLER: I've been called Arch my whole life. There hasn't really been
any other name other than what my mom calls me, which is Ryan. Everybody calls
me Arch and sometimes when you're recruiting them, it's Coach Arch, it's Arch.
And when you're around a lot of people that say the word Arch everyone says
Arch. I don't really get too bent out of shape about it. If I have to stop the
first-name basis with a guy, it's usually he doesn't deserve to call me Arch.  
  
 Q. Does that mean that you played six in ten games -- excuse me, six in
ten days. Does that mean that being tired shouldn't be a factor for you you
think?  
COACH MILLER: I don't think so. I think when you take the floor in the games
of these magnitudes, it's very, very difficult mentally not to be ready. I
think it's the mental. If you tell them you're tired, if everyone says you're
tired, and you allow them to buy in, they'll be tired. We haven't done that
all year. We've been dealing with these turnarounds all the way from December,
January and February, whether it be a Thursday game at home and a Saturday
game on the road. It's the same sort of feel for us. So we're used to it,
really.  
  
 Q. You talk about the turnarounds, now you're out of conference. When
you start scouting, putting together scouting reports for games like this,
does it become a matter of you start comparing them to opponents you've played
in the past and if so who might it be when it comes to Oklahoma tomorrow?  
COACH MILLER: I'd say yes that when you're playing against certain players or
you're going to do certain things scheme-wise you can refer back to some of
the things that you did against similar styles of play, so you can bring back
a game in January or February and remind them of what we're talking about in
terms of both sides of the ball, what we're trying to get in terms of the
visual. Off the top of my head, I don't believe we've seen anything like
Oklahoma. I think their defense is outstanding. That's the quickest perimeter
defense that we've seen, comparable to even a VCU. They're very good on the
ball. I think they do a great job of pushing things down. They don't give you
your normal reads that you're able to get. And their front court is very
mobile. So defensively they're very good. That's where I'm concerned. A lot
about the game plan in a short amount of time, not being able to rep your
offense versus -- defensively it's the fastest push makes and misses we'll
see. And they've got three guards that are great off the bounce that can
advance it. Their bigs run and they shoot the heck out of the ball. So to me
this is an Oklahoma -- when you think of Oklahoma, you think of Coach Kruger
as the type of team you think of. Well-coached. Battle tested, play extremely
hard and unselfish. This is a really good basketball team.  
  
 Q. I know why it happens and I'm sure we all know why it happens, the
late start last night, but is that fair?  
COACH MILLER: I don't think if you're in the East Coast you should start a
game at 10:55 or 11:00, not in the East. I don't know all the workings of when
games get started or whatnot. As a coach, I say that. As a player, I don't
think they care one bit what time the game is. If you told them it was at
midnight they're going to be ready to go at midnight. I don't think they care.
As a coach you worry about everything -- late start, late finish, how is this
going to play into the next day, yada yada. But I don't think it affects the
players at all. Just for me, it was kind of hard to figure out this morning
what time did they actually go to bed last night. What time are we actually
going to be able to do something tomorrow? Are they going to be too tired to
do it? To their credit we gave them the schedule. Boom, they were right on it.
We started with treatment. We started with film. They're over here. And when
you look at young guys, especially in this tournament, they're so excited to
be here and it feels so good to win, that there's very few things that can
actually disrupt them.  
  
 Q. To that point of the schedule is there anything you had to adjust
this morning because of the circumstances?  
COACH MILLER: We backed up, let them sleep. If it's the normal time you
probably move your day up just a little bit more so you can have some more
time to prepare. But at this point in time, with our guys, our team, the best
thing is to lay in bed probably all day long. Eat and lay in bed -- eat, lay
in bed. And we'll try to get a little court work or whatnot, a little walk-
through stuff. But for us it's recovery.  
  
 Q. I don't think Scooch came out of the game last night. But his
maturity level as a sophomore has been pretty high. Could you talk about how
he played. Dunn is the same age as him yesterday and he outplayed him big
time. Just the way Scooch runs the team.  
COACH MILLER: He's really evolved here in the last month. He's really evolved.
He's playing the game as a point guard how we envisioned him playing. And he
is the single biggest reason why we're playing today. You can point to a lot
of people on our team that do a lot of good things. He's irreplaceable at this
point in time. I don't take him out because he tells me not to. And I think
when a guy says he doesn't need a break or doesn't want a break, it tells me
how bad he wants to be out there. And his push right now in games, he's
getting absolute, putting a lot of pressure on the defense. He hasn't been
able to shoot the ball as well as he could, and I think that's a direct result
of legs. But he's been terrific. The way he's been able to run our team, make
big shots, attack the paint, make the pass. And all the while he's playing
defense down at the other end to the best of his ability. But he was great
against Boise. I thought he was terrific last notice. If you look at the A-10
Tournament, he by and far and away was the MVP of our team. It's nice to see
how he's continued to grow. I think when you have finishes like this, it's the
starting point of even bigger things. So as he continues to evolve going into
his junior season next year, he's got a lot of mileage under him. He knows
what to do and I think the big thing for him is to keep getting better in some
other aspects. But I'm really proud of him. He's done a great job.  
  
 Q. You guys were kind of Cinderella team last year, now you're back in
the round of 32. Where are you guys now as a program?  
COACH MILLER: Rising. Rising. We're not anywhere near where we want to be. I
think building the program to last is something that we talk about year in,
year out, being right there to compete for conference championships, to be in
the NCAA Tournament, to have a chance to make a run. Last year's year was
special. It created that confidence in what we do. It's carried over to this
year that the confidence of that run has stayed intact. And that's what I mean
by building to last. Last year's experience in gaining confidence builds to
this year's guys who were freshmen and sophomores. Dyshawn going from junior
to senior year next year, or Jordan going from last year's junior year to
senior year, they're better. I think being here every year, it's a step for
our program to win a conference championship. That's what I want the most. I
think if you do that year in and year out, I think you'll be in a position to
be here. The one thing that's very unique about this team, they've had
tremendous success in this tournament. There are some guys, I think I said it
last night, five of the guys, and Bobby didn't play last year, but there's
five players that played the majority of our minutes last year that had five
NCAA Tournament wins. That's a heck of a deal. It's hard to get one win let
alone five of them. And I think that when they take the floor, they know what
it feels like. And tomorrow is going to be just an absolute really hard game,
really hard game. Oklahoma is terrific. But I'm not going to say anything to
those guys. I'm going to let them be themselves because I think, I'm not going
to strip any confidence or any toughness or any chemistry things that they
have going for themselves right now.  
  
 Q. Does the home-court thing, you mentioned you've been getting picked
at a little bit, does that obscure a little bit what you described your team
has been accomplishing here and throughout the latter part of the season, do
you think?  
COACH MILLER: A little bit. I mean, I think a little bit. I think when you get
in the tournament, wherever they ship you, you've got a hard deal. And I think
our guys being put in the First Four immediately started to play the card of
that's unfair. I don't know what's unfair about somebody telling us that we're
in the tournament. I think that's the greatest thing in the world. Now, they
told us where to play. We had a drag-out fight with Boise. We were able to win
the game. Boise could have won the game just as easy. But if they would have
shipped us to Pittsburgh, I think we would have had the same crowd. I think
our guys would have played the same way. I think they approach it the same
way. The fact that we're in Columbus, I'm not sure that plays a big role in
our guys' heads other than the fact that they know when they take the floor
we're going to have a great fan base. And it's hard to -- it's hard for me to
be negative about being here. It's hard for me to apologize for making the
tournament. It's hard for me to apologize to our guys getting ready to play
six games in ten days. I don't think I have to apologize anything for what
we're trying to accomplish or where we're doing it.  
  
 Q. Comment you made about Scoochie, I'm curious as a former point guard
how is your relationship on and off the court, the conversations you guys have
about the game?  
COACH MILLER: Off the court, he's probably one of the most terrific kids I've
ever been around. If there's a more popular kid on our campus, I don't know
who it is. And that starts with professors to academic coordinators to tutors
to just regular students. Scooch is an unbelievable, charismatic kid. It helps
that he has the name Scooch. That's the first thing that helps him. He plays
off that a little bit. On the court, he does some special things that I really
like. There's also some things that I'm trying to get out of him and
challenging him. And at times I don't think that he says challenging him
motivates him. But he's getting better. And I'm going to keep working him over
a little bit, because his competitiveness right now is as high as it's ever
been. He's accepting more challenges. It's just not okay to go out there and
play average. He's attacking the game the right way. And as he continues to
get older, he's got to get better in some other areas. But I couldn't ask for
a better guy on our team. I trust him. I trust him a lot. I get on him a lot.
I think he just kind of shakes things off, he's that type of kid that has a
really good personality. He's a great teammate. And to me he's one of the big
reasons why we are who we are.  
  
 Q. I saw last night your brother tweet you and the team big
congratulations. How close are you following Arizona's run, and are you two
talking at all during the NCAA Tournament, or just kind of small little
messages?  
COACH MILLER: No, we follow each other pretty intently. I know they're playing
Ohio State today and everyone's going to -- this is Buckeye country, but I'm
killing for him to win. He's the guy that took time not just in the last
couple of years but he took a lot of time to help develop me for a long time
as a brother, as a player, as a coach. He invested in me. So I follow those
guys on the team a lot. I follow their coaches. I want them to do really well.
And I think knowing where I'm at at Dayton, him being at Xavier, him
understanding what it was like to take over Xavier in the Atlantic 10 to try
to build it. He understands sort of where we're at. And I think the fact that
we're in the tournament here back-to-back years, we're able to advance and do
things, I think he feels a little bit proud because the blueprint, the inner
workings of what we've done is really a big part of how he's taught me. And
that's a credit to who he is. But we don't talk much in the tournament. It's
very difficult in tournament to talk to anybody on the phone because you're
working at it. Whether it be just a text or just checking him out, I know this
will be a big one for him today.  
  
 Q. TaShawn Thomas had a big night for Oklahoma. He's taller than your
guys, not necessarily bigger, but how do you go into this game looking at that
matchup?  
COACH MILLER: The good thing about us is we don't get taller. It's the same
question over and over: What are you going to do with the big guy? Well, we
didn't grow overnight. We're going to do what we do. And we're going to try
like crazy to make his tough catches. We're going to try like crazy to crowd
the floor on him. But he's a great player. The thing I love about him is he's
not one-dimensional. 15 feet and in he can burn you, whether he's shooting,
whether he's driving. He's got an agility about him around the basket.
Spinning and moving. He can draw fouls and his offensive rebounding, timely
offensive rebounds yesterday, was really impressive. He's a terrific player.  
  
 Q. Your assistants have been with you since day one. What kind of role
has that played in your guys' success?  
COACH MILLER: Continuity is everything. And having the same staff every day
year in, year out in your office, with your players, it's unmatched. Our
system being able to keep developing and having a staff of people that know
how to teach it to your guys is huge. Our offseasons with our players and what
we do with them, they know what they're doing. To me it's that seamless,
everyday approach of we know what we're doing, let's not deviate. And they've
done a terrific job. They're all great people. One of the hardest years that
I've ever been involved with was this year and a big reason why we haven't
sank or didn't sink is because we got great guys on our staff who take care of
our kids. And it's a positive environment to be in. And it's good to have very
capable guys. All those guys, high level coaches.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [NCAA MEN'S 2ND & 3RD ROUNDS:
COLUMBUS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+2ND+%26+3RD+ROUNDS%3A+COLUMBUS)

### [Lon Kruger](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13820)

### [TaShawn Thomas](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26664)

### [Jordan Woodard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28808)

  
_COLUMBUS, OHIO_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
 Q. TaShawn, last night you were able to take advantage of a size
advantage and Dayton is a smaller team. Is that something you guys are
focusing on?  
TASHAWN THOMAS: We know that they play through their two big guys down there,
though, at the same time. We do have kind of a height advantage. But their two
guys are very aggressive. So we're just going to try to be more aggressive
than them.  
  
 Q. Jordan, did you guys get a chance to watch the game last night
between Dayton and Providence? And what were your initial takeaways just from
Dayton being able to win the game?  
JORDAN WOODARD: Yeah, we got to watch a little of that game. And we got to get
some film in this morning. And we just noticed that they're a real scrappy and
physical team. So we've got to come out and be tough for the whole 40 minutes,
because it's going to be a fight.  
  
 Q. This is a virtual home game for Dayton since their campus is 70
miles away. But how much of the Big 12 road schedule gets you guys prepared
for a contest like this?  
TASHAWN THOMAS: I think the fact that we had to play in a lot of tough road
games in the Big 12 is going to help us out a lot. It's not going to be
nothing new to us, just being in a hostile environment like that. So if we
come ready to play, and have our minds right, we'll be able to compete.  
  
JORDAN WOODARD: We had a lot of road experience, non-conference and conference
schedule. And the Big 12 helped us a lot. But we just gotta use that as
motivation that we can't have any breakdowns, limit our turnovers, take good
shots, things of that nature.  
  
 Q. Just talk about how much of an advantage it's been for you guys to
be able to start the same starting five all season long and just have that
consistency you've had?  
JORDAN WOODARD: This helped us build chemistry along the way. And I feel like
now at this time of the season we know what these guys are going to do and we
got a good feel for things like that. We've just got to keep playing together,
keep getting better game in and game out.  
  
TASHAWN THOMAS: Just being able to have the same starting five has been a big
thing for us, like Jordan said. The chemistry just grew and grew and me not
even -- being this is my first year at Oklahoma, I feel like our chemistry is
a lot stronger than everybody would think it would be. So I think that's an
advantage to us, just being able to have that same starting five throughout
the whole year.  
  
 Q. There was so much emphasis on getting this first win because you
hadn't done it and the coach hadn't done it at Oklahoma. Has there been any
talk about readjusting or making sure that you're not content with just the
one win?  
TASHAWN THOMAS: Yes, of course. We wanted to get that first win. But at the
same time we didn't want to just get that first win. We wanted to be able to
compete to keep going and we're going to try to do whatever it takes to get
this next one and continue to keep on going on.  
  
JORDAN WOODARD: Yeah, it really just made us hungrier. We're just not
satisfied at all. We've been talking about it as a team that we got that first
one out of the way and none of them are going to be easy, so you've just got
to fight a easy game, and hopefully we can keep advancing if we're doing our
jobs.  
  
 Q. How familiar were you with Dayton before you got here this weekend?
They're not a power-five conference school. Were you that aware of their Elite
Eight run last year? What do you know about them?  
TASHAWN THOMAS: I heard about them when they made that big run last year. My
dad kind of predicted that they might go on that big run last year, so I kind
of kept my eye on them when that happened. And this year I haven't really seen
too much of them this year, but I watched the game last night and the game, I
think was it Boise State they played against? I watched that game, I seen they
played real hard. They played with no fear and just playing hard every
possession seems like.  
  
 Q. What did your dad say --  
TASHAWN THOMAS: My dad watches a lot of basketball. Sometimes he'll just tell
me one team, there's a team you need to watch out for. And last year Dayton
was one of the teams he told me about. I don't know why he said it. It was
just something out of the blue.  
  
 Q. Talked a little bit about it basically being a home game for Dayton,
but you're the guys that earned the 3 seed. Do you think it's fair that you're
playing in the second round against a lower seed?  
JORDAN WOODARD: I wouldn't say that's unfair. That's how the draw goes
sometimes. You've got to come ready to play regardless where the site is at,
what the seeding is. Cuz this is how the tournament is. That's why they call
it March Madness. Anything can happen. You've got to worry about your team
playing their best ball.  
  
TASHAWN THOMAS: Yeah, it was kind of crazy that day, that was going to happen.
We kind of seen their crowd coming in at the end of our game last night that
it was just a lot of people -- that's when I found out that Dayton wasn't that
far away. It's kind of -- we kind of wish it was a different way, but I think
we'll be all right.  
  
 Q. TaShawn, could you take me again through the circumstances that led
you to leave Houston and go to Oklahoma and get to play the No. 2. Are you
surprised by how well you fit in you know what I mean on a quick basis?  
TASHAWN THOMAS: It was just a coaching change. That was one of the main
reasons. And just the way I fit in, I kind of felt chemistry as soon as I got
on campus at OU, like the teammates, they just came in, so welcoming. There
wasn't a teammate that just didn't like talk to me because I was the new guy.
Everybody wanted me to feel like I was at home. I feel like as soon as that
happened it was just chemistry from like even summer school we was playing
open gym. It was like instant chemistry with a lot of people on the team.  
  
 Q. Jordan, wondered if you've seen Kyle Davis, the Dayton player, No.
3. He's a defensive guy. And last night he harassed a lot, I wonder what you
notice about this guy on your quick scout so far or why he's successful?  
JORDAN WOODARD: He played, I saw he's really athletic. And he's real quick.
He's just got -- you can't play with the ball in front of him because he uses
his quickness against you. But you just got to be sound with the ball and
limit the turnovers because he's going to be a big energy guy for them. When
he gets turnovers, he's going to get the crowd into it. So we just gotta
limit, can't let him get steals.  
  
 Q. What do you like best about playing with Isaiah? What does he bring
to the squad? When you think of him, what do you think mostly of?  
TASHAWN THOMAS: First thing that I noticed when I started playing with Isaiah
was his defense, how hard he played on defense. He's always talking on
defense, making sure, trying to make sure that everybody knows what to do and
when to help out and everything. And he brings a lot of energy to the court.
Like if we're going on a little drive where we haven't got a stop in a while,
Isaiah is that guy that gets everybody ready for the next possession to
actually try to get a stop.  
  
JORDAN WOODARD: Isaiah is tough. He's not scared of the moment. And we could
rely on him to make baskets for us, get stops for us, and he just do it all.
He's solid. He has no weakness on the court.  
  
 Q. TaShawn, could you talk about Coach Kruger and his mentality? This
is your first year with him kind of winning that first NCAA Tournament game.
What's he like in a one-game elimination kind of field?  
TASHAWN THOMAS: He keeps telling us every day you all deserve to be here. It's
like you all put a lot of work in to get here. Just realize that. And at the
same time don't overlook anybody. You can't look at the seeding and be like
we're at 3 seed so we're supposed to beat this team. He tells us that you
gotta go out there and actually take it at the same time. So right now he's
just been trying to keep us up. He's not been too negative around us or
anything. Just keeping us positive and keeping us ready to play, basically
that's what the mode has been.  
  
 Q. TaShawn, to dovetail off that, both of you guys, can you tell that
your coach has a lot of miles on him? How does it -- he's been a lot of places
and had success in a lot of places, you understand what I'm saying? How does
that show up when he's talking to you guys, coaching you guys?  
JORDAN WOODARD: He's so consistent. He knows what he needs his players to do.
And he knows what he needs from his coaching staff, things of that nature.
It's like he knows the game. He's been in it for so long. It's like it's not
really new to him. He's been here before. He's been to the Final Four. So he
knows what it takes for us to be great.  
  
TASHAWN THOMAS: Coach Kruger, every time you see him, he always has something
to teach you. It's like you can learn something new from him every day. He'll
just walk by and just like: Tay, when you're shooting the ball try to do this
a little bit more. He's always got something positive and something to help
you out on the court. And even off the court, too.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
 Q. Somebody that hasn't maybe followed Isaiah since his Mount Vernon
days, what kind of player has he developed into for you and what does he mean
for your program?  
COACH KRUGER: Isaiah is great. He's worked so hard. He did that in high
school. He had a routine where he was always up early and he hasn't changed
that. In the gym all the time. Has really gotten better and better. He's one
of the most improved on our squad the last two years as voted on by the
teammates. Can tell you how much his work has changed off. He loves being in
the gym. He's a guy that led the conference in the 3-point shooting and I
think as a freshman he shot 20 percent from 3. So that's a credit to Isaiah
and how much time he's spent in the gym. But very good defensively on the
ball, very good quickness with the ball and creating shots for others. Real
good competitor. Love to see the progress he's made.  
  
 Q. The topic of the day is Dayton playing in Ohio. So two things: A, do
you think it's fair that you're playing them essentially in what is almost a
home game and, B, Coach Cooley approached it in the sense of he clearly wanted
to downplay this to his team or at least he did publicly try to downplay it.
Do you prepare your team as if you're preparing for a road game?  
COACH KRUGER: We do. And we don't worry about it. Fair or unfair. That doesn't
even come up. We're playing Dayton with a crowd that's going to be pro-Dayton.
But again that's the way it is. We're not going to worry about it. We
understand it adds to the challenge. But more importantly, Dayton is a really
good basketball team. I love their guys, the way they play and Coach Miller
has done a terrific job with their mentality, their toughness. They execute
things well. They're attacking all the time. We're a lot more concerned about
those guys than we are the crowd, even though the crowd warrants consideration
too. But concerning because they're a really good team.  
  
 Q. There's a lot of teams that go against Dayton with big guys, and
they're going to try to get the ball into the paint, and try to draw Dayton
into foul trouble. Does that mentality come into play here or is there
something different that you do if that hasn't been working against a little
team like Dayton?  
COACH KRUGER: We try to throw it inside. We always do. Not just because we're
not that much bigger than Dayton. But we always do. With TaShawn and Ryan in
there, we love to establish inside and play inside/out. Easier said than done
in a club that's as quick as they are. And their perimeter guys do a great job
of helping on the post and digging back in there and getting steals and
deflections. But we'll still try to throw it in there.  
  
 Q. What have you noticed about Jordan's game changing over the last
four weeks, and how important will he be moving forward as a tempo setter for
you guys?  
COACH KRUGER: At the point guard, it's always important that he does a good
job setting the pace, pushing the ball, the activity defensively, moving the
ball, he's taking good care of the ball, shooting it with more confidence here
lately. I think his game has progressed especially in the last month or so.
Big games come along, he's been there and he stepped up and he's delivered and
played well. So we need that out of your point guard especially.  
  
 Q. You've been at basketball schools. Now you're at a "football"
school. You were at Florida. How is that challenge? Are you embracing that?
What are the challenges of being at a "football" school when you're a
basketball coach?  
COACH KRUGER: It's great. We try to take full advantage of that, the great
atmosphere on football game days with recruiting. Bob Stoops is terrific.
He'll meet with recruits on game day. And he'll help out -- he's great with
all the other sports and the big picture of Oklahoma. And, no, we love it. We
think it's a great advantage. And we try to get recruits in town anytime we
can for a football game.  
  
 Q. I didn't realize this last night, I overlooked it, but you're the
first coach to win an NCAA Tournament game with five different schools, I
guess, and milestone. What does that mean to you? Is there a certain time when
you get in life where you've sort of seen it all or do you see new stuff every
day?  
COACH KRUGER: You see new stuff every day. It's the nature of NCAA basketball
or basketball in general. We've got good players. A lot of good schools. And
don't think about it other than when people bring it up and doesn't mean much
other than when people bring it up. So don't concern ourselves too much with
it.  
  
 Q. You guys are one of the few teams in the country that have able to
start the same five for every game all season long. Could you talk about the
advantages that gives you, that consistency?  
COACH KRUGER: It means, number one, we've been healthy obviously. Knock on
wood. But, number two, it also means that no one's really gone through a big
slump where you just need to get them out of there to get their minds
refreshed or reenergized. Ironically, we did the same thing last year. We
started the same five every game. So our people have trained well. Our
trainers have done a good job. And again we hope that continues.  
  
 Q. What is it -- you're talking about Dayton being really good, what is
Dayton really good at from your vantage part and what sets them apart? And
number two, TaShawn Thomas fit in immediately with you guys. But is he the
kind of guy that would fit in immediately anywhere?  
COACH KRUGER: I think he would. He's got that type of personality. He's very
mature. Very easy going. Wants to accommodate. Wants to please. Didn't want to
step on anyone's toes, and I think he'll be that way everywhere. I think our
guys are pretty easy to fit into, because they're like TaShawn in terms of
wanting to play and wanting to do well. Dayton does a lot of things well. I
think probably the thing that stands out, I just like their personality. I
like, they're attacking, playing off each other. They're playing for each
other, it appears to me anyhow. They're fun to watch in that respect. They
know what each can do and each takes care of their respective
responsibilities. And they trust one another to take care of it. So, again, I
like the look of their club, and again that starts with the coach. But they
appear to do a really good job.  
  
 Q. Until last year, Dayton I think had won one tournament game in 30
years. Now they've won five in the last two. How should they be thought of as
a program?  
COACH KRUGER: Probably what they've done the last few years with Coach Miller
has been fantastic. He's done a terrific job. And certainly they win. Their
players carry themselves like they expect to win and they have won. And no
surprise there. I think when you win games like they've done, you tend to do
that. So, no, I think everyone looks at Dayton with a great deal of respect.
The success they've had, the players they've got, they've done very well.  
  
 Q. Would you rather face a team with two smaller big guys but that are
very athletic and aggressive like Dayton has, or bigger guys?  
COACH KRUGER: We've probably been more effective against the bigger guys than
we have smaller, mobile guys on the year. I think it more depends on how good
those bigger guys are, how big those smaller, mobile guys are. In this case
it's the worst of both worlds for us because they're smaller guys, they're
very mobile and they're very good. So we've got kind of from both directions.
But we've got to figure that out and play better.  
  
 Q. Excuse my lack of history but I've forgotten, how close did you get
to the NCAA when you were at Pan-American?  
COACH KRUGER: Not very close, I don't believe. We got close to the NIT, I
think, one year. We got to over .500 one year and we were hopeful for an NIT
bid. We were an independent. We weren't in a league. That was back in the
early '80s. But no, there was never consideration for NCAA opportunity there.  
  
 Q. The Dayton game last night started at 10:50. We've asked a couple of
other coaches who have been in here, is that right, to start an NCAA
Tournament game that late and stuff? What's your take on that?  
COACH KRUGER: I think it's not good at all. No. I'd love to see that revisited
by whomever is going to make those decisions, because for the student-athlete
it's not good to start a game at 11:50 and have it finish at 12:30 at night or
whatever. I don't think any coach is going to be a proponent of starting a
game that late. And hopefully we'll express enough concern about that that we
rethink that, because I know there's dollars, I know there's all the things
that go into that, but still I don't think that's healthy for the game at all.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_COLUMBUS, OHIO_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by student-athletes Gary Browne and Juwan Staten.  
  
 Q. Guys, did you get to see Maryland? Did you watch any of their game
on TV or did have you seen film? Wondering what your impressions are so far?  
JUWAN STATEN: We had a chance to watch him. We stayed and watched half of
their game yesterday. We watched some film on them. But they've been on TV a
number of times this year. So we've got to see them a couple times. But
they're a great team. They play in a great conference. But we noticed that
they like to keep their pace. They play at a pretty nice pace. They don't
really like to get out of control. So we want to speed this game up and make
it into one of our type of games.  
  
GARY BROWNE: Yeah, I feel like he said it all. But at the same time, we watch
them. There's one thing we gotta make sure that we do, we keep the ball away
from their guard, Trimble, and that will be the big key for us right there.  
  
 Q. Just kind of wondering, I know it's hard to prepare for their guys'
full-court pressure on short notice. On the flip side, Maryland seems to have
a number of different ball handlers, maybe smaller lineup kind of deal. Just
kind of wondering -- and they have some size at the guard position as well.
I'm wondering if any of those two factors kind of -- what do you guys think
about those factors going into the game?  
GARY BROWNE: Like I said, we've got to make sure that Trimble doesn't have the
ball. They can all handle the ball but I don't feel like they would be able to
handle the ball with our pressure. They feel comfortable dribbling the ball in
the perimeter, but I don't think, full court, I don't feel like they are
comfortable doing that. So we've got to make sure we keep the ball away from
their guard and make other guys make all the decisions.  
  
JUWAN STATEN: We play one way all year. We haven't really changed up how we
play for anybody. So why start now? We're just going to turn it into one of
our games and that's just the game plan.  
  
 Q. Juwan, the morning after, how did you feel physically? How was the
knee?  
JUWAN STATEN: I feel good. Conditioning is a little -- it was a little shaky
last night. I was real tired. Kind of hit the bed early. But I feel good
today. My knee feels good. It's not a question.  
  
 Q. Juwan, you grew up in this state. What is the relationship between
Ohio and the game of basketball, and how do you think playing it in this state
contributed to your competitiveness to any skills you developed?  
JUWAN STATEN: It's a lot of -- it's great basketball in Ohio. From the time I
started until the time I left, it was great basketball. It's always a lot of
competition. So that's where you get your competitiveness from. And you just
learn to bring it every day. I think that's something that started in Dayton.
It's a lot of guys that you probably never hear about but a lot of guys that
can play pretty good basketball. I just learned how to compete. You never get
a break. It doesn't matter what city you go to in Ohio or who you play
against, it's always somebody that's a fierce competitor.  
  
 Q. You guys are both seniors. And when Coach Huggins says this year he
wants to institute this full-court press type defense here, was there any
resistance from you guys? Did you have any thoughts, man, this is so different
than what we've done in the past. It could be a lot of wear and tear. Was
there any kind of pushback from the players overall or did you just say you
know what, we'll welcome this, let's give it a try?  
JUWAN STATEN: Well, I think this is a way that we all enjoy playing. We're
playing fast. We're turning people over. We're trying to get out in
transition. And ultimately we have a great coach and we trust him and we
believe in him. And nobody's going to fight what he's talking about. So from
day one he told us this is the way we want to play. With me and Gary being
seniors, we wanted to relay that message to the new guys coming in. And that's
how it's been from day one.  
  
GARY BROWNE: Yes, he said it all. To be honest with you, we believe in what he
stands for and what he said. Whatever he said, if he told us this is what
we're going to do we're going to be right behind him.  
  
 Q. At one point yesterday the game seemed to be pretty much in hand and
then it got tight again. You guys had some turnovers or some botched plays.
Going forward, not just the next game but even games after that, those kind of
things can come back. Have you gone through that? Have you talked through that
or is that just something that you're going to have to live with as a team
that's part of your character, for somebody who hasn't seen you play?  
GARY BROWNE: We've been through that through the whole season. We've been
having the whole game in the first half and then the second half we have a
couple of turnovers or we made some silly fouls, and they come back in the
game. But one thing we've been doing a great job this year is keep fighting
back. We fought back like we did last night. And, yeah, we had a couple of
turnovers, but we didn't lose our focus, and we fought. And we finished it.  
  
JUWAN STATEN: Like Gary said, it's a part of the game. You can't always
control what's going to happen. But you can always control how hard you play
and how hard you compete. So we know that the ball -- we sometimes we're going
to turn the ball over. Sometimes we're going to make silly fouls, but as long
as we keep competing and playing harder and longer than our opponents, we
should have a good outcome.  
  
 Q. Regarding one of your assistant coaches, Ron Everhart, I was
wondering if it's obvious to you guys how close he and Bob Huggins are, and
what if anything he's been able to help you guys with over the past couple of
years?  
GARY BROWNE: Just like him and the other staff, they do a great job by helping
us on and off the court. He always tells us the story of how he rebound for
Hugs, so we know how much like he legit, like, love him. He tells us that
every time. But, yeah, he does a great job just like the other assistant
coaches telling us that stuff. It's special, but he do a great job with that.  
  
JUWAN STATEN: Like Gary said, we've heard stories of them two growing up and
how Coach used to rebound for him after games and stuff. That's pretty much
it, the extent of that. Coach Hugs is the coach and we listen to him. We
listen to all our coaches. So I don't really think it goes any further than
that.  
  
 Q. Just wanted to talk to you about, I know all season it's been
scoring by committee. There hasn't been one guy who has just led the way the
whole year. With that being said, Devin Williams seems like he's been a
different player since the Big 12 awards came out, wasn't on the first, second
or third team. And he's really stepped up his game. Leading scorer yesterday.
How important is he to the success of this team and especially establishing a
low post presence?  
JUWAN STATEN: Dev is very important to our team because he is our low post
presence. You can tell by just looking at him. He's built like a Roman god.
But just throw the ball in to him and let him work. When he's playing great
offense that's great for us because he's always going to be rebound no matter
what. When he can step up and score more points, that's great for us because
we don't have to turn into such a perimeter-oriented team.  
  
 Q. Curious, when you think about the Big 12 struggling at the start of
the tournament, with some losses and some high profile losses, did you guys
feel any pressure to kind of carry the flag of the conference?  
GARY BROWNE: To be honest with you, I mean, in my personal opinion I don't
really pay attention to what other people say. We have our goals. We have a
small circle. We don't care what other people said out of our circle. We care
about what we've got in our circle. Because if you care about that, then let's
say at the very beginning of the season nobody had no high expectations for
us, so why do we care what's going on after that?  
  
JUWAN STATEN: Yeah, I mean, that just kind of puts a little added motivation,
in my opinion. Just to see, we played against all these teams. We know how
good they are. And just to see some of them get knocked off early just kind of
lit a fire under us, let us know it can't happen to us. I guess we are -- us,
Kansas, Oklahoma -- trying to carry the Big 12 flag, but ultimately we feel
like we have our own goals, like Gary said. And we're not really worried about
that.  
  
 Q. Juwan, your first NCAA experience last night. Did it feel different?
Was it a normal basketball game in the end or was there more pressure,
different atmosphere?  
JUWAN STATEN: I would say, I mean, it was a big game but just another game. I
like to think that pressure is just something that you put on yourself. So I
mean, definitely felt great to play in the game. The atmosphere was crazy. But
after you play in so many games, they become games. It's the only extra, I
guess, fear or anything, that's the stuff that you put on yourself. I like to
tell myself it's a big game but it's just another game. And that's how I look
at every game.  
  
 Q. Juwan, starting with you, is it fun to play the style y'all play? Do
you understand what I'm saying, the get after it style, what's it like out
there when you're in the midst of it?  
JUWAN STATEN: It's very fun to play especially when you're fresh. When you get
tired it may get a little rough because you can never stop playing hard. But
when you're fresh it's a great style to play because it doesn't give you a
chance to kind of think about what's going on. You just have to play hard and
usually when you are playing as hard as you can good things come from it. So
it's a great way to play, especially if you're in shape.  
  
GARY BROWNE: I'm laughing now because I was thinking about the other day, I
told Hugs, we were on a radio show. And they asked how we like this style of
game. And I told Hugs, why didn't we do it the last three years? And he
started laughing and he said something back to me. But at the same time, I
like it. Like he always said, it's hard to play when somebody's in your face
24/7. No one's like that. So I bet no one like playing us, and that's good for
us.  
  
 Q. Have you all gotten used to being a member of the Big 12? You
understand what I'm saying, or do you feel like you're still sort of this
satellite campus out here out on the East?  
JUWAN STATEN: It's pretty new to us. We've been in the conference for a couple
of years. But it's still fairly new. But I think after this season, this past
season, I think everybody knows who West Virginia is. I think we're kind of
looked at as a stepchild before. But we raised some noise this year. So I
think that's pretty much out the door.  
  
GARY BROWNE: No, he said it all. And to be honest with you, when they say West
Virginia, they say Bob Huggins and the staff, the coaching staff. So they know
what it is. Just the last three years it hasn't been like that. But now we've
been doing so far a good job by bringing it back.  
  
 Q. When you watch you guys play, Bob is pretty animated on the
sidelines, both with the officials and kind of reacting when you guys do
stuff. I wonder if you guys notice that during the game and what it's like
playing for him? And also curious what do you think of his game day attire,
which is a little different than I think most coaches?  
JUWAN STATEN: Personally I like it. It's something that I had to get used to,
because when I first got here, it was kind of throwing me off. I never been
around a coach so animated. But as I've gotten to know him and as I've played
for him, it kind of gets me going more. When I first got here I wasn't a
player that was really animated. But if you watch me play, I'm always excited.
I'm kind of turned into a replica of my coach. So it's something that's grown
on me. And I appreciate it.  
  
GARY BROWNE: Yeah, I mean, you see our style of game, right? We gotta be
animated. We've got to have a coach like that. And he's doing a great job by
doing that. Sometimes we're not animated, he makes sure we are.  
  
 Q. What about the attire?  
JUWAN STATEN: That's up to him. I like it. Why follow the same tradition as
everybody else. Create your own. I like it. Especially the way he coaches.
He's going to do a lot of sweating. Why mess up a good suit. (Laughter).  
  
 Q. You guys talked a little earlier about being new to the Big 12. But
you do have some history, I believe, with Maryland. Can you kind of talk about
that and maybe not so much recently, probably after this -- maybe not you as
players, but I mean the university has had a lot of history with Maryland.  
JUWAN STATEN: Honestly, I don't really -- we haven't been around long enough
to really know that tradition between West Virginia and Maryland. We just know
that we're fighting for are our life. And we want to win. That's enough for
us.  
  
 Q. Similar to Maryland this offseason you guys had some turnover. You
lose Eron Harris and Terry Henderson, guys that are contributors? What do you
do as seniors to regroup your team and get to where you guys have gotten to
this point?  
JUWAN STATEN: It's a new season, new faces, new expectations. That's something
we always talk about. We don't want to live in the past. We're going to deal
with the guys we have in front of us. And me and Gary, we have a pretty good
relationship with Coach Hugs. We know what he wants. It's on us to relay that
message to the new guys from day one and it hasn't been a problem.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach.  
  
 Q. One, Maryland, size of guards, and they seem to have more than two,
three ball handlers. Wondering how does that affect preparations when it comes
to your full-court pressure. And, two, wondering over the years how many
Maryland stories have you heard from Billy?  
COACH HUGGINS: Let me answer the first one first. Every day. Billy's got more
stories, and probably rightfully so. And he's had some of his former teammates
come over to some games. So quite a bit. I actually visited Maryland when
Billy was a freshman and Billy showed me around. Well, actually I got away
from him. But yeah, I've known Billy for a long, long time. We're not going
to, at this point in time, change a whole bunch. Obviously we're going to make
adjustments according to what they're trying to do and how they're trying to
get us to play. But what are we, 31, 32 games in. I mean, we're not going to
change very much.  
  
 Q. Bob, somebody else you've known for a long time, Ron Everhart,
what's he been able to bring to your staff and being a former head coach for a
long time, how does it work with someone who has been sort of used to being
the main guy?  
COACH HUGGINS: Ronnie fit right in. But you've got to understand I've got
three former coaches on my staff. Actually, there's, counting me, there's
four. So I've got four guys that have been through getting hired as Division I
coach and getting fired as a Division I coach. So we pretty much run the
gamut. But Ronnie has brought great enthusiasm for the game and a great love
for West Virginia. Growing up right down the road in Fairmont. He's surrounded
by hire and friends. And he understands, I think, as well as anybody how
important West Virginia basketball is in our state and how much our state
rallies around it. And I think that's important. I think that's really
important, particularly because we have to recruit so many guys from out of
our state. And he's been great on the floor. I mean, when you have he and
Larry and Billy. And Erik played for me, so Erik's got a good idea what I want
done. I've got a great staff. I couldn't imagine having a better staff than
what I have.  
  
 Q. Can you talk a little bit about how clean you have to be in your
style of play going forward? Yesterday you seemed to have the game in hand for
a while and then a couple of alley-oops and missed alley-oops, a couple of
turnovers, whatever. The players seem to think that that's part of their
personality as a team. But again is that something you can continue to do and
continue to go forward? Is that some of the things you've got to clean up?  
COACH HUGGINS: Well, obviously we don't want to turn it over. But I mean
that's going to happen at the pace we play, we're going to turn it over some.
But the alley-oop thing, I don't know where it came from. We hadn't done that
before. And I think the first one, Wany tried to throw, Jaysean thought Wany
was going to lay it in and he stopped running. But the one or two, whatever it
was, were out of character. I don't think you'll see that again. I don't think
we have to worry about that. I think I've expressed my opinion strongly
enough. Actually may be abrasive, I think that's the word that's been bantered
around now. Isn't it a shame in today's world you can't tell the truth? If you
tell the truth you're abrasive. If you lie you're charming. (Laughter).  
  
 Q. Since you guys have been new to the Big 12, I know you and your
staff have tried to reach out to various schools for scheduling purposes. And
I'm wondering, was Maryland a school that you guys have talked to, or would
you like to see something with Maryland in the future?  
COACH HUGGINS: I talked to Gary before Gary retired. And I think Gary was open
to it. And I know you and I have discussed this before. But we still have to
generate income. So we can't play every game on the road. And so obviously you
can't play all home-and-homes. You have to buy some people in and make some
money too. And it's got to be worked into their schedule and worked into our
schedule, because, for instance, we just signed a ten-year deal for a home-
and-home series that you're aware of. And we're about, I think, to sign
another four-year home-and-home series, with another school who is the same
kind of proximity. It's just got to work out, that's all. It's kind of
interesting that everybody thinks we've played -- - we've played Maryland 36
or 38 times in the history and two in the last 25 years. And we're asking
those two guys and neither one of them are 25 yet. They probably didn't
remember anything. I don't remember. I played there -- I was there for four
years, and we didn't play Maryland. I think it was way prior when the games
were played.  
  
 Q. When you go back to October and you think about, I know for a couple
of years you wanted to install the full-court press type of system. But the
buy-in from the players, was that kind of a hard sale to them? And was there a
certain point, maybe a couple of games in, a couple weeks in when you saw, you
know what, these guys get it. They're fully committed to this now?  
COACH HUGGINS: No, it wasn't a hard sale at all. I learned most of what I know
from my dad. And I can remember my dad saying, every year he would say, we
have to build our defense from the inside out. Meaning you have to be sound
around the basket. You have to be sound in the half court, really the quarter
court. And we worked really hard on that. I mean, you could see we have foot
speed. And we've got guys who can run and guys who react pretty well. So we
knew we had that. I spent time, talked to a good friend of mine, Kevin Mackey,
who I thought was the best pressure defensive coach in the country. And my
question was how much do we have to work on, how much time is it going to
take? And he said, Hugs you've got -- you get to the mid-line. You guys
pressure the ball. You've got people built to run and jump. And he said I
don't think it's going to take all that long. And so we put it in. And I had
never played like this. We pressed, at Cincinnati we pressed. And we were
probably the best pressing team in the country in '92 and '93. But it was a
different kind of press. It was three-quarter court. And different trap areas
and those kind of things. So I'm learning. They're learning as we go.  
  
 Q. Maryland has three different players that earned all Big Ten honors.
I'm curious what you think the key to stopping them and slowing them down
is?  
COACH HUGGINS: Can you be a little more specific?  
  
 Q. So Maryland has Dez Wells, Melo Trimble and Jake Layman, all who
averaged more than 12.5 points. Is there a single guy you key on or is there a
certain philosophy you have to slow down a team like that?  
COACH HUGGINS: I don't think you can key on any one guy. Obviously they bring
different things to the table. Dez is probably as good a penetrator as there
is in the country. I mean, he does a great job getting the ball to the basket
and attacking the rim and putting a lot of pressure on the rim. And I think
Melo is terrific in transition. I think that's where he really excels is
transition, and getting the game to go at the pace that Turg wants it to go.
He's unflappable. And who was the other one?  
  
 Q. Jake Layman.  
COACH HUGGINS: He can shoot it and he can bounce it. If you can shoot it and
you can bounce it. If you can shoot it and bounce it, you're going to be a
pretty good offensive player. And he does a great job of they run some clear-
outs for him where he can attack the rim. But he's a guy you can't leave open
because he makes shots. We can't leave them open. But that kind of goes
without saying.  
  
 Q. Like you said, your dad -- you didn't say this but your dad is a
legendary coach in the state. But I'm wondering, at this stage in the season,
is it more about matching intensity as it is physical, because you're not in
this tournament unless you're physically gifted to be in it? But I'm just
wondering, what is the biggest challenge from one game to the next?  
COACH HUGGINS: I'd say if you have to worry about intensity, then you've got
problems. I mean, who is not going to be excited to play in the NCAA
Tournament? Who is not going to be excited to play against a team the quality
of Maryland? I don't see intensity being a problem. I think a lot of it is
matchups. It's how you matchup. If a team does some particular things that
you're not good at, then that gives them the advantage. And I was hoping we'd
get somebody who just hated to go against the press, and we didn't. But it's
been kind of the story of my career. But, no, this time of the year, you
prepare as best you possibly can and guys go play. I think the further you go,
the more players decide the games.  
  
 Q. Speaking of being excited, Daxter is young and seems kind of
excitable, and he's playing a game I get the feeling after talking to him he
takes a little bit personally. Do you anticipate any need to maybe rein him in
a little bit or settle him down? Or do you like that enthusiasm that maybe
boils over sometimes?  
COACH HUGGINS: He's been that way since he got here. I think to a large
degree, because of Dax and John Holton, really probably Jevon and the two
seniors, I don't have to go out there and worry about getting anybody jacked
up to play. They like to play. They enjoy playing. And Dax really enjoys
playing. He just loves basketball. He's like that all the time. He'd be fired
up to play whomever.  
  
 Q. Sometimes get too --  
COACH HUGGINS: Sometimes he commits fouls because he kind of overruns things
and stuff. But not really.  
  
 Q. I know this is a story you've told before but if you could indulge
me and some people who don't follow your team quite as much, but when did you
decide to go away from suits on the sidelines and why?  
COACH HUGGINS: Well, why, because I'm not a banker. Well, when did it start? I
used to dress really nice, by the way. If you all dig up some old pictures,
pretty good looking guy. I don't know who we were playing, but I was at
Cincinnati. And I went in at halftime and I was soaking wet. I was soaked all
through my shirt, my suit coat, pants and everything else. And I told the
equipment guy, go get me something to wear and he brought a pullover out. So I
put the pullover on. And the I coached the second in the pullover, and my
athletic director came in said, you look really good in a pullover. I think
that's what coaches should wear. So I got the green light now. So I started
wearing a pullover. And that worked out pretty well until I got a new
president. And then I found out my athletic director told the president he
told me I should wear a suit. And so I'm at the point in my life now, I'm on
the downhill. I've been doing this a long, long time and I'm going to be
comfortable, you know. I did wear a suit for a little while this year, just
because I don't like people to think they have me figured out. But that's the
only reason. But I didn't wear a tie. But I wore a bowtie to the Big 12 press
conference. If you come to the Big 12 press conference you never know what's
going to happen out there.  
  
 Q. I know you said during the season that part of what makes you guys
difficult to prepare for is that anybody can step up and score at any given
time. There's been numerous guys who have scored in double figures this year.
With that being said, Devin he's been great all season but especially since
the Big 12 awards came out, wasn't on the first, second, third team, he's
really stepped up his game. Is he a guy you could look to as being maybe the
No. 1 scoring option moving forward in the tournament?  
COACH HUGGINS: I don't know. I think Staten's capable of having a big game. If
you look, Jevon Carter has had big games. For that matter, Jaysean Paige has
had big games. Jaysean gets 18 against Baylor. I don't know that. And I think
that's what makes us hard to prepare for, because I don't -- if I don't know
who is going to score, I doubt very seriously if the other coach knows who is
going to score. I think Devin can be a little more consistent than some of
those guys because he's such a terrific offensive rebounder, and he scores
some goals off the offensive glass, which kind of gives him a little bit more
of an advantage in terms of being a little more consistent scoring the ball.  
  
 Q. I know you've seen a lot of things change about this basketball
tournament -- the conferences, the media landscape over the past couple of
years. Last night's last game started at 10:50 ended at 1:06 a.m. Is that too
late for people to be playing basketball, for players to be playing
basketball?  
COACH HUGGINS: Now you've got to remember this, it's all for the betterment of
the student-athlete. (Laughter) I've heard that. Yeah, it is. It is. But I
mean, what are you going to do? You've got all these games to cram on TV. And
it's going to happen. And one game runs over a little bit. Here's what I don't
understand. I don't understand in the same bracket how some people are playing
on Thursday and some are playing on Friday. So we win or Maryland wins and
you're going to get home probably on Monday. And you turn around and have to
leave again on Tuesday to play on Thursday, where the team that you're going
to play is playing today, and we're playing late tomorrow, you know what I
mean? That doesn't make much sense to me. I'm not sure who did that
scheduling. I'm sure it was TV. Or they had something to do with it. But I'm
just -- it just tickles me to death that we're doing this for the student-
athletes. It's all for the betterment of the student-athlete.  
  
 Q. You've talked about Tarik getting in the gym and getting up a lot of
shots. Was there a time recently when the light went off and he realized he
had to do that?  
COACH HUGGINS: Probably when his playing time went down. Our guys like to
play. The one redeeming quality that all of our guys have is that they really
like to play. And so when their time starts getting cut because somebody else
is playing better, those are the guys you find in the gym more, the guys that
are playing less because they want to get back in the rotation and they hear
from us all the time. If you want to play more, play better. It's a pretty
simple formula. How do I get more time? Play better. What do I have to do?
Make a shot when you're open. Run a ball down, get a rebound. But I mean it's
that simple. And to the question I was asked earlier, was it hard to convince
the guys to play this way, not at all, because what I said to them was: Here's
the deal. We've got 13 guys that can play that are going to play. And I could
play most of you, if we play this way. Now, how much you play depends on you.
And the better you play, the more you're going to play, obviously. But you can
all play. And we can get everybody in and our five probably not better than
most of people's five, but our 10 is probably better than most people's 10. If
we can play 10, 11, 12 guys, a lot of times that should be an advantage for
us. So that's kind of what we sell. I had the great fortune of spending a lot
of time around Jerry Tarkanian. And Tark said, he told his guys, when he had
Larry Johnson, he said: Listen, you're all going to get a piece of pie. But
there's just one pie. Pie being playing time. There's just one pie. And we're
going to split that pie up. He said now Larry's going to get a bigger piece of
the pie than the rest of you all, you understand that, but you're all going to
get a piece. And how big a piece you get depends on how much you deserve. And
that's kind of what it is. There's 40 minutes. There's 40 minutes times five.
And you divide that up according to who deserves the most. You probably grew
up like that, Greg, probably, your mom said Greg's a good kid, he gets half a
pie or Greg wasn't very good, he's not getting much pie. But seven kids in the
family when I grew up, man, I'm telling you what now, you didn't want to screw
around. There was about enough food to go around, that was about it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

### [Melo Trimble](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28602)

### [Mark Turgeon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13696)

### [Dezmine Wells](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23451)

  
_COLUMBUS, OHIO_  
  

MARYLAND - 65  
VALPARAISO - 62

THE MODERATOR: We'll have an opening statement from Coach Turgeon and open it
up to the student-athletes after that.  
  
COACH TURGEON: I want to say that we lost a good booster today in Jim Clark.
He's done a lot for our university and we dedicated this win to him and his
family today. He's been tremendous to our university and our athletic program
over the years. With that said. I was really proud of our team. I thought it
was a terrific win. I thought we were great defensively. I thought Valpo was
terrific. They made a lot of shots. Shots when they shot them I thought were
good shots for us. And they made them. The Peters kid is terrific. But we were
really good defensively. And we were just good enough offense to get it done.
We were in foul trouble the whole game. Had to play some funny lineups. Had
some young guys step up and play well for us. It's hard to win this time of
year, and really proud of my group. Another great close win for us.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
 Q. Melo, can you talk about the way the freshmen especially stepped up
tonight, you and Dion hitting a shot and obviously Jared with the way he
played in the first half?  
MELO TRIMBLE: I think we had confidence from our upperclassmen going into this
game, and basically we just played really loose and we didn't worry about,
well we worried about the outcome but we didn't worry about anything else,
just played basketball and that's what we did today.  
  
 Q. I know you've answered this question a gazillion times but here you
are again it's a one-possession game, late in the game. Do you ever wonder
like why does this keep happening, why are we always in these positions? What
do you think when you're in that position yet again?  
DEZ WELLS: I think it's just, I don't know, I can't really give you a
definitive answer on why that happens. But, I don't know, I guess it's just
the nature of our team. And when it gets down to like the grit part of the
game, we just find ways to win. And that's how we are. That's how we've been
throughout this year. So I think that works in our favor, because we've, what,
was it, like, 11 games we've won? 12 within six points. So like I said, we've
been battle tested throughout the whole year. So experience, as this is
experience for us. So that's something that we're ready for in any game. But,
I don't know, coaches and our poise and confidence regardless of what happens
throughout the game, and the adjustments we make in the game.  
  
 Q. Melo, word in the locker room is that you have a lot of day-to-day
battles with Varun. Could you describe what those are like and what kind of
defender he is?  
MELO TRIMBLE: Varun's a great defender. He always makes me better. When I'm on
offense he presses the ball, and even on offense he does a great job on
offense, makes me run around, makes me chase him, just makes me better, and he
got in today and played defense, and that's what he does on me every day.  
  
 Q. Dez, when you picked up the second foul today, did you have
flashbacks to last week at all in terms of the way the game started and
getting the second foul?  
DEZ WELLS: No, no, I just knew I had to stay ready, stay ready for whenever
Coach called my number and keep encouraging my guys and be the person that
I've been throughout the whole year, and keep my composure and make sure these
guys are ready for whatever adjustments he makes throughout the game.  
  
 Q. I was talking to Coach Warren in the locker room. He said the first
game in the NCAA Tournament is always the hardest, did you feel like that,
that you got over a hump today?  
MELO TRIMBLE: I was pretty nervous to start off the game. And this game right
here just got the nervousness out of me. Now I'm just ready to keep playing
basketball.  
  
DEZ WELLS: I would say in the tournament, each game is going to be the
toughest, but I'll say the first game is the way that it is for each and every
team in the tournament because of the excitement surrounding it, you want to
get all the butterflies out. But it's great to win our first game, to continue
the success so far.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
 Q. What exactly did you say to Varun in that last timeout? Was it your
instructions to foul or let him make that call?  
COACH TURGEON: I probably wasn't great in the timeout because I changed my
mind a couple times. Switched 1 through 5. Switch all screens, which we don't
practice a lot to let's foul, let's don't foul. Those timeouts are forever.
Gives me too much time to think. But if it was under 5 and they were still
struggling, which they were, we were supposed to foul. And as long as they
weren't in the shooting motion. But we didn't which was fine. And the whole
thing with Varun, with him you've got to dial him back because he loves to
play defense so much. I thought us getting through screens and executing
defensively was really good really the last 30 seconds of the game and
throughout the game. We were supposed to foul if they were dribbling out
towards half court. He probably didn't do it because he was on the side and in
the end it worked out for us.  
  
 Q. You just ran through all the things you were thinking about
defensively. But to put a guy in who had not played for 39 minutes, where does
that sort of inspiration strike? What is it about him that lends itself to
that situation?  
COACH TURGEON: Well, a lot of things. One is we have a lot of confidence in
him. Varun brings it every day. He's had to step in in a lot of situations
this year. But we were just in unbelievable foul trouble. And what I had left
to play, he was clearly one of our top five defenders to put in. And so it was
really without hesitation to put him in. I have confidence in him to do the
right thing. He's been with me now three years. So it was pretty easy. If we
weren't in as much foul trouble, probably wouldn't have done it but we already
had some guys fouled out and things like that. So we did it.  
  
 Q. All season you've consistently played 10 guys stressed the
importance of having a D team. You said before this tournament and the Big Ten
tournament you were going to expand your rotation. Tonight you played 11 guys.
How important is that mindset tonight, like tonight when you have the foul
trouble you do and need to play as many guys as you do?  
COACH TURGEON: The great thing is we played nine guys over 10 minutes, which
is great. We've got to turn around play Sunday against a team that is going to
press us the whole time. Got really good experience for a lot of guys to get
out there, play in the NCAA Tournament. We're our best when we're deep. And we
have confidence in all of our players. And sometimes a guy like Dion, if our
team wasn't 28-6, he might have played more minutes. But we had such a good
year going. Every game was close. He didn't play as much. But we continued to
practice those guys really hard. Make them do extra. And we knew their time
was coming. And Dion probably hit the biggest shot of the game when the score
was tied, down 1 or whatever it was. We weren't playing very well. And he
raised up and knocked it down. And when those two are on the floor we're
pretty hard to guard out there. So it's good to see. Good to see Jared. We had
no chance against the zone until Jared came in. He hit four for us. And it was
good. I think everybody helped us in their own way tonight. And just really
happy for them. Different guys had to step up because we were a little off
tonight with the foul trouble and everything.  
  
 Q. I was going to ask about Jared. He said that part of the reason he
has so much confidence is because you guys have told him to pull the trigger
whenever. What steps do you take to make sure they have confidence and how
special is it that they have that much confidence?  
COACH TURGEON: We've tried to have a lot of fun this week with the guys and be
loose. And we were still a little bit nervous. But we stepped to the line,
made 18 out of 24. I think everybody on the team and all the coaches expect
Jared to make shots when we want him to make shots. And I asked Dion at
shootaround how many 3s have you got in you today? He said four. He got one,
one big one. So we're always trying to give confidence to the young guys. And
to the whole team.  
  
 Q. I think you guys are 12-1 in games that are decided by six points or
less. Obviously it's a pretty terrific record in those situations, what has
allowed you guys to have so much success in close situations like that?  
COACH TURGEON: I think it's we defend and rebound when the game's on the line
and then we make free throws. And we usually execute. We had a couple of bad
possessions down the stretch today, playing in the NCAA Tournament. But we'll
learn from that and hopefully be better. But we have a lot of confidence in
those games. And we never panicked today. We let the guys know that Valpo was
a good game and they're going to make shots. In March those things happen, but
stay where we are, stay poised, and we did that.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_COLUMBUS, OHIO_  
  

DAYTON - 66  
PROVIDENCE - 53

THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening statement from Coach. Then we'll
turn it over to the student-athletes for questions.  
  
COACH MILLER: Really proud of our guys. They continue not only to defy a lot
of odds, but they just have an incredible toughness about them. And our
experience, especially with the five core guys that have played in the NCAA
Tournament now have won five games in the tournament in two years. I think
it's a big reason why we're able to continue to play the way we are is because
they know how to do it. And it's a credit to them. Every single guy to a man,
from Darrell to making shots, to Bobby Wehrli playing -- blocking shots,
whatever, you name it, whatever it is they do what it takes. And proud of
them. Excited to advance. And I know we've got our work cut out for us on
Sunday.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Dyshawn and Jordan.  
  
 Q. Jordan, can you talk about the defense again you guys had active
hands, blocking passing lanes. Seemed to stifle them the first ten minutes of
the game. Just how your defense helped you in a tight game in the half.  
JORDAN SIBERT: When we were prepping for them, Coach told us to make them feel
uncomfortable, whatever we do to make them feel uncomfortable, switch up our
defenses. We know Dunn is a great ball handler. He was great in transition,
great facilitator. So we just wanted to play a team defense, and just make it
uncomfortable for them.  
  
 Q. Dyshawn, how tough was it to maneuver inside against them? Obviously
they're a very big team. How did you guys adjust to that?  
DYSHAWN PIERRE: Just moving the ball around. We had a lot of -- we have a lot
of confidence in each other and just making the extra pass and knocking down
shots. Our shots weren't falling down in the first half. The second half a lot
of us stepped up and made big-time shots.  
  
 Q. Both players, how did you while away the hours waiting, and you get
close and it's almost delayed by an hour. You know what I mean, how did you
deal with that, the start of the game?  
DYSHAWN PIERRE: We were excited to play. We just started to prep a little bit
more with the time that we had and just staying excited and being ready for
the game and that was about it.  
  
JORDAN SIBERT: Just mainly staying off our feet, staying off our feet, trying
to recover as much as we can. Getting extra treatment, extra prep, like
Dyshawn said. Just staying together. We love being together and enjoying the
time we have, so just staying off our feet and staying together.  
  
 Q. I'm not 100 percent sure that the math is right but you guys played
five games in eight days. Is that right? Give me a little sense, Dyshawn and
Jordan, how you're feeling right now?  
DYSHAWN PIERRE: We feel fine. We have a good opportunity ahead of us right
now. We're not focused on how much games we've played, really, we're just
focusing on the next one coming up and getting some rest.  
  
 Q. Your teammate, Kyle, can you put into words how valuable he is for
you guys on the defensive end?  
JORDAN SIBERT: His toughness, I'll tell you, Kyle is the driving force on
defense for us. And his toughness is something that's unmatched. And without
him, you know, we wouldn't have won half the games this season. He's the
starter on defense and he leads the way, and without him, I don't know that we
would have got that win tonight. He did a terrific job on Dunn tonight.  
  
 Q. Jordan, was there a sense that eventually your shot was going to get
there tonight? You know what I mean. You were starting with 2 of 10, hit a few
down the stretch. What was that like, the intensity and how much did that add
to the frustration of shooting at times?  
JORDAN SIBERT: It's rough. It's rough when you're having an off night and
you're rushing shots and you can't figure out why they're not falling. But we
got a technical. Even though I was off, Coach put me to the line to shoot the
free throws. When you've got your people who are around you who believe in you
like that, it's not that hard to get your rhythm back and start believing in
yourself and find your shot again.  
  
 Q. Both players, what was the atmosphere like? Did it feel like UD
Arena?  
DYSHAWN PIERRE: We have a lot of fans wherever we go. One of the greater fan
bases in the country. And we appreciate our fans. And it was a really nice
showing tonight by them.  
  
JORDAN SIBERT: It was like a home game. They came out. They supported. We had
a great, great crowd again, just like we had previously in our First Four
games. And we needed it. Whenever we made stops or made a big run, we heard it
from the crowd and just like before, they gave us that boost we needed.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll dismiss the student-athletes at this point. Thank you.
Coach is ready for questions.  
  
 Q. Would you mind touching on the atmosphere a little bit. It was
obviously a very pro-Dayton crowd?  
COACH MILLER: It's powerful. I think our fans continue to be on front and
center stage right now. It's a great time of the year for them to be on front
and center stage. But knowing that we're playing in Columbus, I had a hunch
what it was going to feel like. And I remember playing Buffalo last year,
playing against Syracuse and thinking: My gosh, this is like Carrier Dome, and
I think it feels like a home game for us. I mean, it's an incredible feeling.
It's a genuine fan base. They're excited, and we appreciate them.  
  
 Q. Coach Miller, can you talk about Wehrli and what he gave for you
tonight. Boy, he just came through big time?  
COACH MILLER: Bobby's done a great job for us all year. I think one of the
things that Bobby has done right now, because he hasn't logged the amount of
minutes that the other guys have, he's got a great bounce about him. From the
offensive rebounds to the blocked shots and the way he's moving, he's got a
great freshness about him, and he's played in enough games now that he feels
he belongs. And I'm proud of Bobby. Bobby was on the bench last year, and he
never took his warm-up off. And he's developed. He's been coached, he listens,
and he's a valuable asset to us right now, and I think he's carved out a heck
of a niche.  
  
 Q. Can you just talk a little bit about Kyle's defense, another
stifling game defensively against one of the better guards in the country?  
COACH MILLER: He's got a great energy about him. He's playing to win. Watching
him tonight against arguably what I thought was -- still probably do think so
-- Kris Dunn is probably the best point guard in all of college basketball. He
is so fast, delivers the ball so fast. Kyle was able to at least contain and
keep him in front and be tough, especially when they were setting ball
screens, and I thought just in general his energy level here, to be able to
play the amount of minutes and as hard as he's playing against some of the
guards he's playing, it's sort of one of the big, big reasons why we were able
to win. It's one thing to shoot well and make free throws. It's another thing
to have just a total attention to detail and locked in on defense against the
other team's best guys. And it's not easy to do. But on this type of stage and
this type of environment, he's ready to go.  
  
 Q. Used to being smaller than the opponent? This was a different level
of smaller. How did you combat the fact, both on offense and defense, their
size?  
COACH MILLER: We are who we are. We are who we are. There's no real fear of
being small. I can't change the fact that we're small. But we can be nasty on
defense. We can play quick. We have to play hard. And we know there's no room
for error. So when you play with that type of urgency, defensively, it tends
to work out in your favor. There were a lot of plays in that first half that
just incredible help, incredible quickness and we've relied on that all year.
And sometimes, like I said big is overrated. We're getting hit pretty good on
the glass right now, but we're not turning it over. Those are two things we
have to have intact. As we move into Oklahoma, the 3-point line and the way
they shoot the ball that's going to be a whole other concern. We'll get back
after it. But we have a quickness about us. And I also think our guys, they
believe in what we do. There's no asking questions. They execute the plan to
the best of their ability and the results kind of speak for themselves.  
  
 Q. A number of guys went through this last year. You talked about how
that's helped. Specifically what, just they've learned and how to maintain
energy, bring energy? What is it about having gone through this?  
COACH MILLER: Learning how to win. And not learning how to win and saying you
hope you play well. Winning by executing on both sides of the ball. There's
got to be a plan intact. And we've really improved our defense, and our
offense has evolved. Our guys believe in what we do. We know if we're not
getting the job done, there's not a whole lot of change. We've just gotta do
it better. And I think figuring out how to win big games started a year ago.
And it went all the way through tonight. And I think being in the tournament
with so many guys that played a year ago is a benefit. You may be shorthanded.
But five players that started the game tonight played in an Elite Eight a year
ago. I mean, there's some familiarity to the game and how it's played at this
stage. And I really believe that even after the game tonight, as happy as I
was and as proud as I was, those guys expected that to happen. Whether it
happened or not, I don't know. But believing you can win, believing in what
you do, those are the most important things you have at this time of year.  
  
 Q. You told us about your team's experience. But what about your
experience, you're five and one now in the NCAA Tournament. I don't think you
used timeouts tonight, not that you had to, but the way you coach the game,
the way you go through this game at this point, sixth NCAA Tournament game,
how do you feel coaching-wise, confidence-wise?  
COACH MILLER: I feel the same. I'm concerned as much about every opponent and
how we have to plan and prepare. But I'm very, very confident in what they
absorb and what we're trying to do. It's one thing to go out there with a
group of guys that aren't together or hope they play well. It's another thing
to take a group of people who absolutely sell out every single day. These guys
have practiced at times this year with four players available for practice.
Four. You have an ankle sprain, you have an injury, you have a guy that needs
a break, how do you practice with four? But the four that are practicing,
they're practicing. And I think it's just a tribute to them. It doesn't really
have a whole lot to do with me at this point. The culture sort of is growing,
and I think the guys on our team have great character. They have great
togetherness.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_COLUMBUS, OHIO_  
  

WEST VIRGINIA - 68  
BUFFALO - 62

THE MODERATOR: We're going straight to questions for the student-athletes.  
  
 Q. Tarik, could you take us through the 3-point. How late was it in the
shot clock, whether you thought you had to hurry it and where was the defender
closest to you?  
TARIK PHILLIP: The previous possessions I got my shot blocked, so I was just
thinking to get it up. When he found me, I just though, get it up on the rim.  
  
 Q. Juwan, the last minute and a half, how tough a nut was that Buffalo
defense to crack for you guys and obviously Tarik steps up and hits the 3, how
tough was it there the last minute?  
JUWAN STATEN: They made it real tough for us. They were gapping everything and
forcing us to take outside shots. We tried to screen and rescreen a lot of
times. But every time I came off they kind of funneled me to one side. I just
had to probe and probe and see what the bigs was going to do. I noticed
Tarik's man was running in to help a little bit. So I had to get it to him. So
it wasn't that much time. He couldn't think about anything and he just made a
great shot.  
  
 Q. Devin, how intense was it out there? This was a game you guys had in
hand. And then it seemed to have in hand but then of course they come back on
you and stuff. What was it like out there?  
DEVIN WILLIAMS: It's been like that all year, definitely playing in the Big
12. It's always close. So it was something we was familiar with and
understood. We just had to stay composed and just do what we do. And that's
what we did. We just played with each other and things just happened to
happen.  
  
 Q. Devin, can you talk about the play when you went on the ground and
secured the ball in the timeout? Can you talk about that play?  
DEVIN WILLIAMS: I was just in the game. I just wanted to win and that's the
way we've been playing. That's the reason we're here now is because we make
them extra plays. We don't stop playing. So when the ball came off, I was just
-- just happened to get a hand in there and he lost the ball. So I just fell
on it and that was pretty much it.  
  
 Q. Juwan, yourself, was it tough to get a handle on this game today,
with the fouls and stuff? It didn't seem to be a lot of flow, a lot of tempo.
What was it like, I guess, out there?  
JUWAN STATEN: This game was pretty common for us. We've been fouling all year.
So this is something that we were familiar with. But that's how we play. We
play hard and you can't always control how the fouls go, but you can control
how hard you play. So we just played through anything and we try to keep it
ugly, because we're used to the ugly games. And we were just able to pull it
off.  
  
 Q. Devin, I think you hit the two free throws with 2:10 to go or so.
There was some question from the Buffalo players that was somehow a mystery
foul. Could you give your perspective on it?  
DEVIN WILLIAMS: I was just ready to step up and just shoot the free throws.
There wasn't much I had to think about. I happened to be there a few times
this year where I had to make some free throws and it was just pretty much get
my elbow up, follow through and just make the free throw. It wasn't trying to
overanalyze it or anything like that.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach.  
  
 Q. Was that your preferred style of play, the pace, the tempo, the way
it worked out for you, you think, for most of the game?  
COACH HUGGINS: No, I liked the early part when we were up about 15. We just --
it hurts our pressure when we lose Holton and/or Adrian. Our pressure is not
near as good at the point of the press. So we were playing pretty well until
those two guys got in foul trouble and it really hurt our pressure.  
  
 Q. Tarik's been in and out of your good graces at times this year.  
COACH HUGGINS: I've loved Tarik the whole time. I don't say that now.  
  
 Q. How about this, Dax or Jevon or maybe both of them that have been in
the game late at that position. What was there reason for Tarik, was it him
playing well earlier offensively. Did he have a good game defensively,
anything in particular?  
COACH HUGGINS: Tarik has the ability to be our best on-the-ball defender. And
he's really long and athletic. And I thought he'd do a better job of
rebounding the ball than what the other two guys would have. It wasn't for him
to really to take the shot. It was for the other end. It was for the defensive
purposes. And really I kind of thought why didn't I get him out and get J.C.
in to shoot the ball on penetration. And my absent-mindedness probably won the
game.  
  
 Q. Sound like a weird question but what's it like to see a kid step up
and make a shot like that, make a play in this kind of setting and stuff, from
your vantage point, to deliver, I guess?  
COACH HUGGINS: He's that kind of kid. He's a guy -- Dax has been that way as
well. They love that moment. Probably the only one who wanted Tarik to shoot
it was Tarik. He had to, it was the end of the clock. But he relishes that
kind of moment. And we're fortunate to have a couple of guys that do.  
  
 Q. Can you take us through the last couple of minutes after they tied
it? Obviously you were trying to shorten the game, particularly that one
possession where they got two timeouts and fouled right there under the
basket.  
COACH HUGGINS: I don't know that I was necessarily trying to shorten the game.
I was trying to keep it in Juwan's hands as much as we could and let him try
to create and make a play. And we wanted to throw it to Dev. We wanted Dev to
screen and roll at the basket. We thought we could get him better iso 'ed that
way because we did have him fairly spread. But it was more -- it was more just
to try to keep the ball in Juwan's hands than it was anything else. He's been
great. His ball security is really good. He's not going to turn it over. And
we're going to get a shot. It may not be the shot we want all the time, but
we're going to get a shot, we're going to get an opportunity.  
  
 Q. Their two timeouts and play underneath the basket.  
COACH HUGGINS: Their two timeouts?  
  
 Q. Yeah, right at the two minutes, they got the layup rolled off the
rim, off the inbounds.  
COACH HUGGINS: Yeah. I was glad he missed it. There's eight seconds. And I
thought we did a pretty good job of defending it. It kind of looked like they
were trying to get it in the corner and get it in and get him an angle. And I
don't know. I just kind of looked and Devin was laying on the ground.  
  
 Q. Where did Devin's performance tonight compare, stack up to compared
to what he's done all season?  
COACH HUGGINS: It's pretty much what he's done all year. I think the bigger
the situation, the tighter the game, the better Devin plays. And I said to him
after the game, I said, why don't you rebound the ball early in the game the
way you rebound the ball late in the game? And he said, sense of urgency,
Coach, gotta have that sense of urgency. But he's made huge plays for us all
year, rebounding the ball, giving us second opportunities. I think the play
that he makes diving on the floor and calling timeout was a huge play. Just a
huge play for us. And we were sitting in there, Wany said he was getting ready
to dive on it he said he saw the big body come flying in there, he said he got
out of the way. He's done it all year.  
  
 Q. Who is Buffalo like if they're like any other team you played before
this year, what adjectives would you use? And also did you use the fact that a
lot of people had picked Buffalo as motivation in any way when you talked to
your players?  
COACH HUGGINS: I'm really going to have lost my mind when I start paying
attention to what Jay Bilas and those people say. Jay always does those
tweets, gotta go to work, I'm trying to wonder what that is. But I don't pay
any attention to those guys. I mean really, honestly, if they knew everything
they probably would have a pretty good coaching job making a lot more money
than they're making sitting there in the studio. So we don't pay any attention
to that. What was the rest of the question? Buffalo. They're just so
competitive. When you watch them on tape, they'll do kind of what they did
today. They'll get down. I think the game, they had to beat Bowling Green, I
think to tie for the conference championship and they're down 14 and all of a
sudden they just, they start making shots and they make plays. I think Bobby's
done a great job of kind of inserting his personality and his will into the
team. Bobby played with such great will and just kind of willed himself to be
a great player and willed his teammates to be better. And I think he's done
that with his team.  
  
 Q. I think even President Obama picked Buffalo. Do you pay attention to
President Obama?  
COACH HUGGINS: Absolutely not. (Laughter).  
  
 Q. That wasn't my real question. What do you get out of a game like
this? You've been to the Final Four and stuff. Does a nitty-gritty game like
this help a team or is it just the fact that you've got the W is all that
matters?  
COACH HUGGINS: Well, it's kind of survive in advance. I guess it remains to be
seen. Dev's a little banged up and Gary and Wany played a lot of minutes for
not playing for the last four games. So I think it's a matter of how well and
how quickly they can recover to find out the effects of the game. We're not
going to be able to do a whole lot tomorrow, obviously. But we played so many
Saturday/Monday games, and at least we don't have to fly across the country to
play the next one on Sunday. So we're kind of used to it to a degree. And as
long as you win by one this time of year that's all that matters.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

### [Lon Kruger](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13820)

### [TaShawn Thomas](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26664)

  
_COLUMBUS, OHIO_  
  

OKLAHOMA - 69  
ALBANY - 60

THE MODERATOR: We'll open with a statement from Coach Kruger and then we'll go
directly to the student-athletes after that.  
  
COACH KRUGER: Really hard-fought game obviously. I thought Albany did a
terrific job. I thought Coach Brown had his guys really sharp and they did the
things they needed to do, controlled the pace, especially early. Spread us
out. And yet I thought our guys remained fairly patient and took opportunities
when we had them. But good win. It's hard to win tournament games. Especially
against a good ball club that's well coached like that. But I thought TaShawn,
Buddy, D.J. Bennett comes in, Khadeem Lattin comes in, plays good minutes.
Frank gets down, and Booker gets a couple 3s down. I thought our bench was
really important to us. But a lot of it started with TaShawn down in the
inside and he made some big plays.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
 Q. Can you talk about this getting the first win not only in this
tournament but the last couple of years, you've now gotten over the hump?  
TASHAWN THOMAS: This is my first time being in the tournament. And it just
feels so good right now actually to get the first win and just play good with
your teammates and just being able to extend your season a little bit longer.
I feel ecstatic right now.  
  
BUDDY HIELD: Been here for three years, my third year here now, and I fall
short twice. It feels good to come and get a win. Hats off to TaShawn. He
played a great game. And Coach Kruger did a good job exploiting the mismatch.
And he helped lead us to our first win, and I'm happy for that.  
  
 Q. TaShawn, did you come into the game planning on seeing the ball a
lot inside, or was that something you kind of adapted as the game went through
since you had a lot of success?  
TASHAWN THOMAS: I think that the game plan was to get the ball down inside
because we knew we had an advantage, couple inches. And I was just trying --
at first I was just trying to find other players, but Coach was telling me to
look to score first, then try to find other people. I think that's when we
started scoring more easily.  
  
 Q. TaShawn, you guys never really pulled big away from them. But did
you feel like you all were in control out there all night? What was the sense
of it on the court?  
TASHAWN THOMAS: I honestly feel like it was just hectic out there, because
they kept making runs and we just kept answering back. It was just going back
and forth. I think we just held our composure the most part of the game and
whenever we didn't, that's when Coach called timeout and that gave us a chance
to get our composure back.  
  
 Q. Buddy, Hooley had 10 points in the first half. Looked like you were
on him a little tighter in the second half. Any point of emphasis there in the
second half? Anything you did different?  
BUDDY HIELD: Coach get on us. You know we had a lot of good looks. And I
missed a couple of defensive plays, let them get a back door on me and missed
a switch-off and he got open. And I drove -- stopped him. And I feel like we
stopped him. We keyed them on the game and we did a good job on him in the
second half.  
  
 Q. Buddy, it seemed like every time Albany hit a big shot throughout
the game you all were able to answer right back. I think you had a couple,
Isaiah and Frank. How important was that, and specifically Isaiah's one with
about three minutes left that stretched it back to 9?  
BUDDY HIELD: It was very important. We needed guys to step up, make big shots.
We always felt at that moment when you are up by 8 or 9, you watch those games
and teams come back in less than 30 seconds. And Isaiah stepped up and made
some big shots. Frank stepped up, made some big shots. All those guys, tired
of losing in the first round. Hats off to Isaiah, he made a great shot. He
struggled tonight. And we were just happy guys stepped up to make shots. We
really needed that.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach Kruger.  
  
 Q. Did you start kind of building up TaShawn from Monday on that he
could have a big game in the post tonight?  
COACH KRUGER: TaShawn's done that for us frequently on the year. And we
expected to be able to get the ball in there, didn't know if they would double
it right away. I thought they started the ballgame doubling it. TaShawn made a
couple of nice plays out of there. Then they didn't double it for a while. I
thought Albany did a really good job mixing things up, changing things. I
thought our guys did a good job reading it and playing off of it. Still
everything started with TaShawn in the low post tonight.  
  
 Q. Especially after what we saw yesterday, how pleased were you with
the way your guys handled the pressure and the tension of a tight game with
three, three and a half minutes left?  
COACH KRUGER: I thought our guys did a good job. Credit Albany, they continued
to make shots to keep it in that six- to nine-point area. And anytime we'd get
a miss, we could have widened it out perhaps. And they didn't let us do that.
Yet, like Ryan said, we kept answering to widen it back out to nine or 10,
whether that be jumpers or at the free-throw line. But I thought our guys did
a pretty good job playing it out, not panicking, and getting to the free-throw
line when we needed to and then making shots.  
  
 Q. After the early knockouts the last couple of years, how important
was it that you get a win, first of all? Second of all, was that a point of
interest? Did you bring it up to them at all this year about what you had to
do?  
COACH KRUGER: Guys certainly were aware that we had lost in the first round
the last two years. Games are hard to win in a tournament. So, yeah, it was
huge. Guys all wanted to get a tournament win under their belt. I thought
TaShawn probably had a little different edge to his practice all week, given
that he hadn't played in the tournament at all. And he's going to tell the
other guys, this is pretty special. And I think that was a good influence on
the other guys in preparation.  
  
 Q. It was probably good, or how was it with Ryan Spangler getting early
points coming off the Big 12 Tournament, you probably couldn't have drawn it
up better?  
COACH KRUGER: It was great to see Ryan get off to a good start. No one felt
worse than he did after the Iowa State ballgame. The teammates picked him up
and he practiced well and hit down a couple of shots early probably helped him
as much as anything. I thought he almost had a double-double. 11 boards and
nine points, and pretty good response.  
  
 Q. In the first half, Ryan Spangler got some foul trouble. You were
able to put D.J. Bennett in there, gave you some quality minutes on both ends
of the floor. And Frank hitting a couple of big 3s as well. How important was
that bench production tonight?  
COACH KRUGER: Very important. You know, we haven't had a lot of point
production off the bench. I thought D.J. getting a couple of buckets down,
Frank getting a couple of 3s and I thought Khadeem played his minutes really
well, with his activity. Yeah, the bench was huge. I thought guys stepped in
there and I thought D.J. in the first half, especially when Ryan was in foul
trouble, getting down a couple buckets, picked everyone up and, like you say,
blocked the shot, changed a shot on the other end and had a real nice impact
on the ballgame.  
  
 Q. I apologize if you said this when you first got in. Isaiah's 3, when
the shot clock is running down, they cut it to 6, hit a couple of shots in a
row, things are getting tense. How big was it to not just get a 3, but after
working the shot clock down and running so much time off?  
COACH KRUGER: It was really big. If we don't get a bucket there, they go down
and score and all of a sudden it's a three- or four-point ballgame. That's
different from a nine-point ballgame for sure. But Isaiah can make shots
without a lot of rhythm. He's done that all year. He doesn't mind the moment.
He steps up there and shoots those. I thought he shot two or three others
really well that didn't go down. So he's feeling good right now about what
he's doing.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Congratulations, Coach.

_COLUMBUS, OHIO_  
  

WEST VIRGINIA - 68  
BUFFALO - 62

THE MODERATOR: We'll have an opening statement from Coach Hurley and we'll
then open it up to the student-athletes.  
  
COACH HURLEY: Obviously it's a tough pill to swallow. We were finished with
moral victories when we were at Kentucky and Wisconsin. We had the mindset of
coming here, trying to win this basketball game and advancing. And I was proud
of my team and how we responded to the deficit we had at halftime. And came
out really strong and put ourselves back in the game and they extended their
lead again a number of different occasions. In the second half we battled
back. Happy for -- I know Xavier Ford wants to continue and play. Right now,
and he's obviously disappointed that his career at Buffalo ended today. But he
had a huge 3-point shot. Had great numbers for us. Played a terrific game. I
think it came down to a couple of very crucial plays that went against us. The
foul call, when they had seven seconds left on the shot clock, was a tough one
to accept in a tie game. And then you gotta give credit to West Virginia and
Phillips for making a terrific shot. It's hard to simulate what they do.
They're really good. I don't know how much of this game would have taken out
of them physically and emotionally, but they're the type of team that's
physical and athletic enough to win games, moving forward in the tournament.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Shannon, could you talk about the press? It seems like you broke the
press, but then making the turnovers in the front court. Kind of just talk
about how you viewed that, how that went and what was the difficulty there?  
SHANNON EVANS: Yeah, they're very big and long and athletic. So their press is
really good. And we broke it a few times in the first half. But we struggled
as well. And I took a lot of credit for some of the turnovers I had.  
  
Q. Xavier, talk about that 3, and what was sort of the mindset from
there and stuff? Where do you think it got away from you guys?  
XAVIER FORD: The 3, I felt like I had a lot of space to shoot the ball. I was
confident. I spent a lot of time working on that shot. And so I just let it go
and it went in. And what was the second question?  
  
Q. Then as you look back on it now, as you think about it, where did you
guys lose it there?  
XAVIER FORD: A couple of plays got away from us. Like Coach just mentioned,
that foul call was a tough one to swallow. And I think there was a point, I
don't know how much time was left, I'll say about a minute and 15 seconds
left, I inbounded the ball and Justin does a great job of getting open, and it
just rolls in and out. And I think that would have tied it at one point. So
like you said, you've got to credit West Virginia, they're a great team, and
I'm just proud of my guys. We all went out here and battled and showed that we
can compete with anybody.  
  
Q. Shannon, so there were 12 turnovers in the first half. The second
half you only made five turnovers as a team. Could you just talk about
settling down and what was said at halftime and what you did right to put
yourselves back in the game.  
SHANNON EVANS: Coach got on us at halftime. Told us to take care of the ball,
be more strong with it. So we came out in the second half more composed and
tried to play with more poise.  
  
COACH HURLEY: Let me just elaborate a little further on that with Shannon. In
terms of that press, first of all, they're averaging 20 turnovers a game. So
for us to have 17, it's not a shocker for me. There's no way for us, and we
don't face teams like this usually that are physical in trapping and that are
relentless the way they play their defense. So I mean, they had a lot to do
with those. And also we tried to simulate the speed and the pace they would
come at us. But it's hard to simulate that. And I think our guys, as the game
wore on, started to figure out how hard they needed to cut, how we needed to
attack it. But initially, in the early stages of the game, it's just hard to
figure that out as a player. Just not something we face very often.  
  
Q. You played great teams this year. Had you ever seen anything as
physical as that? It was like hand-to-hand combat out there at times.  
XAVIER FORD: Like you mentioned, we played great teams. I'll say that's
probably the second-most physical. Kentucky is real physical as well. And
they're twice as big at every position. But that was a real physical game. We
all laid it out there and I'm sure everybody's bodies is tired. My body is
tired. And as well I think it took a lot out of them, too.  
  
SHANNON EVANS: Yeah, I agree with Xavier, like the second-most physical team
we played. But they're real fast and real big. So my body is tired as well.
And I know a few of their bodies are tired as well, too.  
  
Q. Xavier, can you talk, just, what's it been like for you being a part
of this run up until today. And culminating your career with what you guys
have accomplished over the last couple of weeks?  
XAVIER FORD: It's been great for me. I'm just so proud of my guys. I'm so
proud of this man sitting right next to me and Jarryn Skeete and Lamonte
Bearden really grew up, he's not a freshman no more. And Justin Moss going
from not even being noticed to being the MAC Player of the Year. And Raheem
Johnson, who grew up. And Rodell Wigginton and Will Regan, who took a back
seat in his game to be mature and to show how good of a person he is. This has
been a great run for me. I'm just happy for the city of Buffalo that we're
known for something associated with winning. We got the MAC championship, and
like I said a couple days ago, a lot of guys doubted us and didn't think we
would do anything. And for us to get out here and just make a national stand,
just to let the world know that we can play. If you had have told us there he
weeks ago or even at the beginning of the season that the president would pick
us to win in the first round of the NCAA Tournament a lot of people would have
laughed in your face. I'm proud of these guys and I love Coach Hurley to
death. He's done so much for me and everybody at the University of Buffalo. We
want to thank the university, the wonderful community for everything they've
done.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the toughness level in the second half, down 9.
You weren't playing well. Missed a couple of shots you normally make. A team
that's playing in the first NCAA Tournament might have packed it in and
conceded it. And you guys didn't. Can you talk about the way you guys finished
the game?  
SHANNON EVANS: I feel like it starts with our coach, Hurley. He has a lot of
passion. He came in the locker room, ripped us. I feel most coaches would have
patted us on the back and be, all right, you all hanging in there, you guys
are doing well. He came into the locker room, ripped into us, got into us and
we just responded.  
  
XAVIER FORD: Like Shannon just mentioned, we're always going to be aggressive.
This isn't the first time we've faced adversity. We've been down a few times
in the season. So we just knew we would get in there and eventually a couple
of the shots that we missed in the first half will eventually fall, and we
have some success. We just came up short.  
  
Q. Shannon, did you actually talk to Bearden a little bit to sort of
calm down a little bit? He seemed really in another gear there early, almost
out of control at times?  
SHANNON EVANS: Yeah. That's one thing we both do. Like sometimes I'm out of
gear, he'll come talk to me and I'll talk to him. And we try to communicate to
each other, because the ball is in our hands most of the game. So we like to
control the tempo ourselves.  
  
Q. X, how much better do you feel you're leaving this program than when
you came in four years ago, and what's to credit for that in that aspect?  
XAVIER FORD: I feel great. A lot of guys are returning next year. And a lot of
these guys are very talented players. I feel like we have a lot of high major
players in a mid-major team. I'm so proud of everybody. And I just again want
to thank Coach Hurley. He was a big part of my success. And Coach Hurley and
Coach Levi Watkins and Nate Oats and Ben Wood, giving me a chance. I know,
when I first got here, couple of years ago, 2011, people didn't really know
about Buffalo like that, outside of the MAC conference. We got Coach Hurley
and his name brings in a lot of press and media. And he's always a great
person, he did a great job with us in preparing us to lead the world as men
and handle adversity when we play. I'm just happy and confident that next year
the team will be real good and now that we went out here and put on for a
national team and national TV they can see that. There's good players in
Buffalo.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. What did you see on the off-the-ball foul on Moss with 2:10 to go?  
COACH HURLEY: I just can't get into it other than in this type of game, at
that point in the game, in a possession that really wasn't going anywhere, it
was just surprising.  
  
Q. Regardless of the result, you go 2-3 and you tipped the momentum
there. What went into that decision and why do you think it was effective at
that point?  
COACH HURLEY: I mean, we talked about it as a coaching staff, playing some
zone, because I knew our guys would be expending tremendous energy trying to
break their pressure. And for as good as West Virginia is in a lot of areas,
that they're not a great 3-point shooting team and despite Phillip hitting the
big 3, it was something that we felt we needed to do. And the only thing you
worry about when you're playing zone, can you rebound, because I think one of
the times we went zone and it didn't work out because we couldn't finish the
possession with a rebound.  
  
Q. As the game went on, it seemed like your ball-screen defense got a
lot better. Was there an adjustment necessarily? Because they came into the
game pretty good at that and you talked about that earlier in the week.  
COACH HURLEY: Staten is really good out there. And we did better down the
stretch. And we tried to suck in as much as we can with our guys off the ball
so that we would try to limit his driving lanes and their ability to break us
down in ball screens.  
  
Q. Did the amount of fouls called today, did that take away from the
rhythm, the flow of this game, the tempo? What's your view of that?  
COACH HURLEY: I don't think that that was the case. I mean, we knew that it
would be that kind of game, just based on the number of fouls that West
Virginia's committed this year and we're a very aggressive team as well. And
we at one point in the year we're second nationally in made free throws,
because of Justin Moss' physicality and our guards attacking the rim. For us,
we did some things uncharacteristic of what we've been doing, particularly at
the free-throw line. Usually we do a better job of making free throws,
especially in the first half I thought that contributed to us being behind the
way we were. And then also just missing some layups in the first half and we
can't afford to do that against teams like West Virginia.  
  
Q. What was your message to the team at halftime? And also what do you
attribute some of the poor play in the first five, six minutes to from your
team?  
COACH HURLEY: I just felt like, you know, just getting our feet under us in
this type of game, no matter how many big games you're prepared for, you
played in, there's no true preparation other than experience and being in
these kinds of games. And then as fast and as hard as West Virginia plays
contributes to us not playing at our best early. And then we just talked about
just doing the things that we've done all year, like make layups, hit your
free throws, and it would have been a one-possession game at halftime. And we
started doing a better job. And I loved how we started the half. And in games
like this, if you don't come out well to start, the teams like West Virginia
could put you away. We jumped right back in the game.  
  
Q. It seems like whenever I ask the guys about their character, they
attribute it to you. Can you talk about their toughness level, especially in
the second half and where that kind of comes from and it really does come from
you and how you kind of give that to them?  
COACH HURLEY: I got -- I've received and gotten way too much credit for us
being in the position we're in than I deserve, because I've just been
fortunate to have great kids. And when you have kids like Shannon Evans that
plays with his heart and Xavier Ford, everything he's been through, and to
have the season he's had for me. And Lamonte Bearden for some of the passes
I'm sure he wishes he could have back. For a freshman, man, he's so good with
the ball and such a playmaker. And Justin Moss who hasn't been himself and is
still not himself, but he just was a warrior and gave everything he had. So
it's really the type of kids that I'm blessed to coach here.  
  
Q. Now that the season is over, do you think you'll really have time to
kind of reflect back and really think about just how much this one season has
kind of meant for this program as a whole? Do you think you can now start to
reflect it, now the game is finally over?  
COACH HURLEY: It's a hard loss, because we didn't come in here satisfying
being the champion of our league. We felt we had a team that could win games
in the tournament. It didn't play out that way. We were a couple of
possessions here or there from that happening. But ultimately I'm excited
about the enthusiasm about our program and what we're doing and the excitement
that Buffalo had to back us here. It felt great. And it's something to build
on with so many returning players coming back.  
  
Q. As you mentioned, you have a lot coming back next year. But how much
will you miss Will and Xavier and talk about what you need to do to replace
them in the lineup?  
COACH HURLEY: Those guys, in their own way, are great leaders. And just in
terms of setting the standard of how to work and how to -- Will Regan is a
tremendous worker. Xavier Ford, the same thing. They brought so much to the
table when we had them. So it's hard to replace guys like that. But we've set
the standard and the expectations about what we're about and we have guys now
that have gained invaluable experience being in this kind of game and this
setting with this kind of pressure and handled themselves, conducted
themselves in the best possible way.  
  
Q. West Virginia had the ball for well over a minute there before they
got that final 3-pointer that pretty much sealed it. Could you have played any
better defense than that 60, 70 seconds than what you did?  
COACH HURLEY: Yeah, I mean, it was a two-point game. And there was no decision
as far as I was concerned about whether to foul. I mean, we were going to play
it out and need to get a stop and hope that we could get the ball back and
have a chance to tie it or go ahead. I mean, we closed out as good as you
could close out to a shooter and he made, Phillip made a great contested
3-point shot.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_COLUMBUS, OHIO_  
  

MARYLAND - 65  
VALPARAISO - 62

THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening statement from Coach Drew.  
  
COACH DREW: We knew whoever we drew was going to be a really good team, and
Maryland is an excellent team, one of the better teams in the country. I'm
extremely proud of our guys. It's been an amazing year with this group.
They're very special to us. There's a lot of tears in the locker room, not
just because we lost, that's part of it, but because of the friendships and
camaraderie and brotherhood that we've had together. And I genuinely think our
team is going to miss more than anything just being with each other every day
at practice and on trips and in games. It's something special when you have
that brotherhood together. Really proud of Tevonn and Alec. Thought they made
key baskets when we needed it. Kept us in the game and gave us a chance to win
at the end.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for student-athletes.  
  
Q. Alec, what was the thought process on the final 30 seconds there?
What would you guys have drawn up and what did you see?  
ALEC PETERS: We were down three. We needed a 3 in order to tie the game. We
wanted to extend the game to overtime. We thought we'd give ourselves a
chance. And they played great D. They switched the screen and I was supposed
to pop back for a 3 and just they guarded it well. They defended it well.  
  
Q. Alec, does this hurt more because it was so close?  
ALEC PETERS: Any game you lose hurts. And especially one that we knew that we
put ourselves in a situation to win. There were other things along the course
of the game. We missed more free throws. I missed two free throws, completely
uncharacteristic. And missed a couple of easy bunnies under the basket, just
different things that add up over time that could have helped us win this
game.  
  
Q. You had such a tough time getting to the basket and scoring in the
paint. Why was that?  
TEVONN WALKER: I find that they're really big in the post and made it tough to
drive and kick to open, wide open 3-point teammates of ours.  
  
ALEC PETERS: They took a couple of charges early in the game. And it just --
it kind of -- you kind of lose your aggression. Not lose your aggression, but
makes you second-guess yourself when you're driving into the lane. You've got
to start kicking out for open shots and they did a good job stepping in there,
taking hits and causing a couple of fouls.  
  
Q. Alec, what was it like playing with four fouls in a game like that?  
ALEC PETERS: You don't worry about it. You just gotta keep playing the game.
You gotta be out there for your team. You gotta remember to be smart. And if
there's a situation where someone's going to get an easy layup you just gotta
remember that you can't foul them. You can't foul someone on the drive to take
yourself out of the game.  
  
Q. Tevonn, was the game plan to shoot 27 3-pointers or was that what
they were giving you guys today?  
TEVONN WALKER: I think when we found out it was kind of difficult for us to
drive over and over again, we had to stick to what we were good at and what we
practice mostly in practice. And the 3-point shot was there. And it worked
well for us.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Bryce, did you expect that? Did you think they were going to foul at
that point to put you on the line or did you think you were going to have you
tie the game, go for the 3-pointer?  
COACH DREW: No we thought they would defend. They're an excellent defensive
team. They take pride in their defense, which they should. And I think any
coach that puts that much pride in your defense thinks you can get a stop to
win the game.  
  
Q. Pretty clear picture of Carter's hand getting hit. Sure there's a lot
of emotion in the locker room. How do you coach your guys through not pinning
it on the refs or anything like that?  
COACH DREW: You know, I think the game of basketball, there's a lot of ups and
downs, a lot of things that go on. And our team's whole focus all year has
been worry about the things we can control and a lot of that's our effort, our
execution, our togetherness. And, you know, there were probably different
things throughout the game that could have gone either way. I'm extremely
proud of our guys and extremely blessed to be around these guys for a year,
this group that we have. And we had our chances. We had several chances not
just the last possession but possessions before that we could have taken the
lead which maybe could have changed the tempo and the flow of the game.  
  
Q. What was the final play?  
COACH DREW: Yeah, you know, I'll take the blame for that. Our guys executed it
well. I thought Maryland did a really good job. We tried to do something a
little different off one of the plays we usually run. Because we wanted to get
obviously Alec Peters the ball to give him a chance to tie it. And it's not
just that he's a fifth-year senior, been in a lot of games. And he made a
really good defensive play at the end.  
  
Q. When you were drawing up the final play there, did you consider at
all throwing the ball in the back court, having that player throw the length
of the court pass to a guy who would tip it to a shooter?  
COACH DREW: We have a lot of different looks but that was not talked about at
the timeout.  
  
Q. Obviously you've been asked that a million times throughout your life
but having lived through a tight NCAA Tournament game as a player, and now
you're down to the last-second thing as a coach, just what are your emotions
having lived through it as a player and coach. It went a different way but I'm
sure you can relate to how your players are feeling having played that
tight?  
COACH DREW: It's easier as a player. You take it hard. But a coach, you don't
sleep very well for a long time. So you second-guess everything you do as a
coach. As a player, you go out and work harder in the gym. And so for a coach
I definitely think there's more of that that sticks with you for a longer
period of time.  
  
Q. Same question about 3-pointers. 27, I think, today. I think it's
three months since you've had that many in a game. Is that what they were
giving you?  
COACH DREW: Yes, their length really gave us difficulty at the beginning of
the game when we got to the rim. And every day in practice we work on
penetrating and passing, getting the extra penetration. And we haven't had to
do this in a long time. And I thought our guys made a great adjustment after
that initial start of the game to really penetrate and 12 3s is as good as we
shot all year, but that's what the defense was giving us. And so our guys did
a great job getting looks and penetrating to pass.  
  
Q. I'm sure you were in the moment. But during that timeout was there
one moment where you thought back to your shot?  
COACH DREW: No, I'm way beyond that.  
  
Q. Can you just kind of summarize your thoughts on how this year went
now, 28 wins with a group that was really thought next year was going to be
the year?  
COACH DREW: You know, kind of what I said earlier. It's been a great blessing
to be around these guys, not just for the 28 wins and making the NCAA
Tournament, but just everything else that goes along with them. It's a
sensational group of kids that you love sitting down, having dinner with.
They're just really, really good people. And they accomplish more than what
anyone thought we'd ever accomplish this year, winning a game or some games,
NCAA Tournament definitely would have been the icing on the cake. But I'm
proud of our guys. We were in a position to win, the last five minutes we were
in the position, and I think that's something they can be proud about.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_COLUMBUS, OHIO_  
  

DAYTON - 66  
PROVIDENCE - 53

THE MODERATOR: We'll have an opening statement from Coach and then we'll turn
it over for questioning to the student-athletes.  
  
COACH COOLEY: Well, obviously we didn't play well. Credit Dayton. They played
very well. For whatever reason, we didn't have it today. But, again, you've
got to credit Dayton. I thought they played well. When the game got tight they
made a couple of big plays. We had some errors. We had some uncharacteristic
turnovers, an uncharacteristic technical foul. I don't know where that came
from. It didn't cost us much other than emotion in the building. I'm proud of
our seniors and I'm proud of LaDontae. I'm proud of Tyler, Carson. Those guys
came to Providence when we were struggling with our identity. I couldn't be
more proud of our seniors to where we were some four years ago. I think you
gotta look at the big picture. It's terrible to lose this game. It's terrible
not to see these guys have a postseason win on their resume but everything
else they've accomplished. So I'm reflecting back a little bit because I'm
hurting more for them than the loss. We're going to lose games. And we'll be
back in this game again and hopefully it's a different result. But credit
Dayton, they did a good job.  
  
Q. What were they doing to bottle up defensively?  
KRIS DUNN: Really they're just a tough team. They play under you. They play
tail you. They did a good job today. They just played harder than us.  
  
Q. Do you think you pressed a little bit for some shots? That's
uncharacteristic shooting day for you?  
JALEN LINDSEY: I was just trying to do whatever it takes to help my team win.
You gotta credit Dayton. They played great defense on all of us.  
  
Q. Kris and LaDontae both, did the late starting time sitting around all
day, going out there at 10:30, obviously they're starting at the same time you
are, but did you think the late starting time had an effect?  
JALEN LINDSEY: Not really, no excuses for that. Both teams had to suit up at
the same time. Both teams had to wait. I don't think that had nothing to do
with it.  
  
KRIS DUNN: Yeah, no, that really wasn't the reason. We both had to get on the
floor and play at the same time. The ball tipped off. They just played harder
than us.  
  
Q. LaDontae, do you think your team was nervous? I think you had 10
turnovers in the first seven, eight minutes?  
JALEN LINDSEY: No, I don't think we was nervous. I just gotta give credit to
Dayton defense. They were pretty much everywhere. And they played great team
defense today.  
  
Q. What was the atmosphere like here tonight? Obviously this felt like a
home game for Dayton. Did that come into play?  
COACH COOLEY: This was a neutral site. It was neutral.  
  
LADONTAE HENTON: Like Coach said, it was neutral. We could have put it out if
we would have played better.  
  
Q. LaDontae, any thoughts as to why you didn't play better?  
LADONTAE HENTON: It was just one of those days. When the shot's not falling
for a lot of guys, we played bad offensively. We turned the ball over. It was
just one of those days for us. Happened to be on this court today.  
  
Q. Kris, when you guys weren't playing so well you were down by what,
44-41, were you surprised you never got any rhythm going?  
KRIS DUNN: Like we said earlier, they did a good job on us. They played great
defense the whole game. We tried to get it going. We just weren't making
shots. And credit them.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll dismiss our student-athletes.  
  
Q. On the technical looked like you were trying to fire up your team?  
COACH COOLEY: Honest, I didn't even know I hit the chair. You're coaching your
team. You're trying to put some emotion into your team. You know, puts the
official in a tough spot. And I was conversating with him and it was one of
those things, it was more emotion, trying to fire my team up. I actually moved
the chair out, I don't know how it looked on tape or whatever. But I'm just
trying to coach my team. That's what that was about. Honestly, I thought it
was, me personally, I'm a character guy. That to me was wrong, in my opinion,
from my seat. I'm coaching my team.  
  
Q. (Off microphone)?  
COACH COOLEY: Both apparently.  
  
Q. You described the turnovers early. It did look like multiple kids
were nervous?  
COACH COOLEY: I disagree with you. We weren't nervous. They played decent
defense. I thought we were in a rush. The term nervous to me, that doesn't sit
well to me. We weren't nervous. I thought we were rushed. Again, part of that,
you know, Dayton did a decent job. But it just was -- we didn't have a good
day. And that's on me as the coach. I gotta do a better job when I get my team
back here again.  
  
Q. Coach, halftime, were there any adjustments made or did you just feel
like taking care of the ball and sticking with the plan was the way to go at
halftime?  
COACH COOLEY: I think our game plan was fine. It's probably the first game all
season we have 10 2s. We're getting the ball in front of the rim. I thought we
were being pretty physical in front of the rim. We just was missing shots.  
  
Q. I believe they took 14 free throws before you took one and I think
the final disparity was 30 to 7. Any thoughts on how that unfolded?  
COACH COOLEY: Neutral site.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_COLUMBUS, OHIO_  
  

OKLAHOMA - 69  
ALBANY - 60

THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening statement from Coach Brown.  
  
COACH BROWN: I'm proud of my basketball team. I thought we did a really good
job competing against one of the best teams in the country. I felt coming in
there was a chance we were going to be overmatched physically and
athletically, especially in the front court. But, again, I thought we hung
around. We hung around. And I would have liked to have had the opportunity to
see what happened if Cousins missed that shot. We would have had the ball in
our hands and off to the races. But you've got to credit Oklahoma. Very well
coached team and they're a team that I know a lot of people expected to go
deep in this tournament. So great year for my players. And we're just sad it
had to end.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the players.  
  
Q. You guys kind of hugged in the final second or so. You guys came into
this program together. What was that moment like for you?  
SAM ROWLEY: It was special. This whole season has been special in good and bad
ways. Obviously coming in with Pete we've got a bit of a special relationship.
Not to keep using the word special. But we've been through a lot this year.
We've become a lot closer for it. So it's a shame obviously that the season
had to end. We've accomplished a lot. I think we've accomplished more off the
court than on the court. These are guys that I'll be friends with forever. And
Pete is just -- he's my best friend. So it's as simple as that. It was a
special moment for me.  
  
PETER HOOLEY: I think I just want to tell him how proud I was of him, just the
way he's grown over the last four years. And he's ended up being not only one
of the best to play for Albany but one of the best guys to ever be around. He
was always there whenever I fell down he picked me back up. It would be nice
to get another one for him. But he's going to go on to bigger and better
things. Just to let him know how proud I was.  
  
Q. Peter, talk about out there, especially in the second half. You guys
got close a couple of times, just couldn't get over the hump. Just how
frustrating was that?  
PETER HOOLEY: It's very frustrating. I think especially with these kind of
games, when you're playing such a big school you have to make sure that as
you're making your little run, when you get within six or seven, just one more
shot will help. As Coach said, if we got within three or four, maybe the game
would have swung different. Maybe they would have got nervous or something. We
always just hung around and we kept preaching to the guys, hang around and
we'll be okay. Cousins doesn't hit that shot, we get lucky on some of the
missed shots we had, and we might be in a different position right now. We
just had to stay the course and a couple more makes down the end and we might
have been okay.  
  
Q. Sam, you knew they had size but was it as physical down low as you
expected or even more than you expected?  
SAM ROWLEY: It was exactly what we expected. We knew they were not just
physical. They were tough and they were pretty skilled. So we were battling
down there for the whole game. You saw Mike get five fouls. It was tough in
that respect. And they did a tremendous job of just being a presence down
there. And that hurt us during the game. And they were bigger, they were
stronger and I thought in the first half they were tougher. Second half I
thought we played well. I thought we managed to sort of limit them. But that
was one of the differences in the game for sure.  
  
Q. Peter, usual, season just ended a couple of minutes ago but can you
put it in perspective what you've been through, or is that going to take
time?  
PETER HOOLEY: I think just the fact that we can still call ourselves
champions, I think I wanted this team to win our conference more than
anything. I think they deserved it, the way they battled through adversity.
Especially when I went home. The way they came together as a group is
something I never could say thank you enough for, the way they embraced me
when I came back. And I'll tell you, it was one of the toughest years for me,
obviously. And I think the guys can attest it was tough for them, too. That's
how close we were. I think as soon as we stepped on the court preseason this
group just jelled together more so than I've ever been a part of. One through
15 we love each other and obviously this guy next to me I love more than I
tell most people. But I'll tell you what, this group I couldn't be more proud
of them. Even though the season is over, I think a lot of these guys are going
to be ready and hungry to come back for more.  
  
Q. Sam, the last three years you guys have come pretty close to the big
teams, what do you think you guys would have needed to get over the hump?  
SAM ROWLEY: I think especially in the first half, it just came down to sort of
50/50 balls, toughness plays that we weren't getting. And every time we seemed
to get close, it seemed like they made a shot to hold us back a little bit. So
I thought we played well today. I thought we gave it our all. But to beat
these teams you need to play nearly a perfect game, and unfortunately we
didn't do that tonight, nor did we do it the last year or the year before.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, you talked a couple times this year about how you don't like
playing zone but you kind of maybe had to play some zone against them tonight.
It did seem to give them some trouble. What was working with that 3-2?  
COACH BROWN: You know, you have to pick and choose your poison I guess. And
playing man-to-man, you know, that's how we play at Albany. And they were just
getting the ball inside too easy to Thomas. We tried to double once or twice.
They made us pay. So the zone forced them to stand a little bit. It was a
little difficult to get the ball inside to their big guys. The concern with
the zone is when a shot goes up, we have to rebound the ball. That's the
biggest issue. We were overmatched physically and athletically, especially in
the front court. Sam is as good as any player they have in the front court,
but he's giving up four inches and 40 to 50 pounds on those guys. And whoever
was playing the 5 spot for us was going to be undersized. And over a 40-minute
game, that really wears on you. And we can't simulate that in a practice
setting, we really can't. So let's face it, Oklahoma is the better basketball
team. We only needed to be the better basketball team for one night. We
weren't tonight. So the better team won tonight. And they have a chance to go
deep in this tournament. I wish we would have shot the ball probably a little
bit better. I think the result might have been a little different. I thought
we got some good looks. And I think our guys were amazed and I think they
thought I was crazy because I kept telling them: Let it fly. Let it fly. I
told Sam if you get an open 3 shoot it. He was thinking, where has this coach
been the past four years? But all kidding aside, what's so tough is I'm not
going to be able to coach that kid anymore. There's not a finer representative
of our conference, of our university and our program, than Sam Rowley. Peter
Hooley is not far behind, and I'm very fortunate I get to coach kids like
that. I said it the other day, I can listen to those two guys talk all day,
all night. So you've got a proud coach right here. And somebody asked me how
I'm going to replace Sam. Let Sam graduate first. Let me be around him until
at least May. I'll continue to become a smarter coach and smarter man just
hanging around Sam. But like I said proud of the group. We led this conference
from the opening day until the end. We were fortunate enough to be able to
host games and the conference tournament. We ended up winning our league,
which is a good league. The America East Conference is a good league with some
good coaches and some up and coming programs. It's been a really good year and
a fun ride.  
  
Q. Could you talk about the adjustments you guys had to make with Mike
in foul trouble and Greig playing more than he has lately?  
COACH BROWN: Yeah, I mean, it's hard. I could sit there and let Mike sit on
the bench deep into the second half. But we gotta find a way to win that game.
So we gotta go with the guys that got us here. And I told Mike when we started
the second half, if you picked up No. 4 early, I'm leaving you in. If you foul
out, five minutes in, you foul out. I can't have you out there playing
passive. We had to win this game. We had to ride the horses. And that's really
what it was. Mike fouled out. Greig had to play extended minutes. We thought
about going small, maybe playing Dallas at the 4. But we gotta rebound the
ball. We've got to have some big bodies up there, Thomas and Spangler are big.  
  
Q. TaShawn Thomas had such a big game for them, 35 inside. Talk about
what he did to you?  
COACH BROWN: He's a terrific player. If I'm not mistaken, he was a first-team
all conference player at Houston last year. If I'm not mistaken he was their
leading scorer, leading rebounder. He's terrific. When you have the player of
the year in your league in Hield, who was tremendous in the Big 12, arguably
the best league in the country. And then you transfer like Thomas, who if he
stayed in Houston would have been up for player of the year in that league.
Then you got guys like and Spangler and Cousins and Woodard. They've got some
big problems. They're talented, well coached. And it would not surprise me if
they make a deep run in this tournament.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

### [Melo Trimble](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28602)

### [Mark Turgeon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13696)

### [Dezmine Wells](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23451)

  
_COLUMBUS, OHIO_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Melo Trimble and Dez Wells.  
  
 Q. Dez and Melo, I know you both could answer this question. You're
finally here, what's it like to look around this building you'll go out to
practice in a couple of minutes. What's it like to finally be in Columbus,
digging into the prep now?  
DEZ WELLS: It's a lot of excitement surrounding this tournament. Deservingly
so. A lot of teams are here that have earned spots here, and we're one of
those teams. So it's a lot of excitement around the program and everybody is
excited to take this further, try to make a run. So everybody is excited. Man,
this is the best time of the year and the best tournament of the year. So I'm
just excited for my team to try to make a run.  
  
MELO TRIMBLE: I'm just very excited and very blessed to be here.  
  
 Q. Melo, you've talked a lot this year about how you look up to Dez as
sort of a big brother. What has Dez taught you about the NCAA Tournament and
how have you leaned on him?  
MELO TRIMBLE: I mean, it's a big tournament. And just everything, it's still
the same, you're still playing basketball and people gotta stay focused
because it's a very important part of the year.  
  
 Q. Dez, as a freshman, you were in Ohio. You were in the NCAA
Tournament now it's come full circle. Have you reflected on that at all?  
DEZ WELLS: No, I do all my reflecting once my career is over. As of now I'm
ready to be a part of the legacy of Maryland and getting Maryland back to the
tournament and us trying to make a run. So I'm just excited about that. Once
everything is over with, I think that's when I'll reflect and stuff. I don't
want to reflect too early. And I feel like you get complacent when you start
doing things like that. You always want to be on your toes. I'll do my
reflecting after everything is done with.  
  
 Q. Has the past four years gone fast?  
DEZ WELLS: Yeah, it's gone very fast. I tell the young guys all the time, make
sure you guys work as hard as you can for as long as you can and whenever you
have the opportunity, because this goes fast. And this is the best time of
your life, like everybody in here knows, college is the best time of your
life. You've got to keep your priorities and everything in perspective. But it
goes extremely fast.  
  
 Q. Dez, you're one of a couple of people who have been on the team who
has been to this tournament before. Is there anything you've shared with the
team, something about this tournament or how you need to approach this
tournament different than the rest of the season per se?  
DEZ WELLS: I tell the guys that the window of opportunity shrinks. Shrinks
tremendously for us to do something really special in this tournament. So the
little things that we've been able to get by with or being able to win while
like not executing during the season we can't do that now. We have to have
everything -- has to come like full circle at this point. We have to box out
and limit turnovers and things like that and loose balls and all the little
things matter a lot. We have to continue to execute, but we have to just each
and every play means a lot. Play every possession like it's your last.  
  
 Q. Mark was saying yesterday how the preparation might shift a little
bit once you guys got here and you might get more into Valpo. How has today
been different, I guess, and have you guys started to delve more into Valpo?  
MELO TRIMBLE: I don't think anything has changed. I mean we did the same thing
we did in practice. We go over their plays and stuff like that and just
basically worry about ourselves and our offense and defense. And that's pretty
much what we've been doing all season.  
  
DEZ WELLS: What was the question?  
  
 Q. Mark said that the focus might shift today and tomorrow on Valpo.
You guys worked on yourselves all week. Have you seen that maybe the last 24
hours?  
DEZ WELLS: Yeah, Coach Turgeon, he stressed a lot for us to be ready for the
game when the game gets here. You prepare and do all those things, you get all
those things out of the way, but you can't play the game before the game gets
there. So we've been focusing on ourselves and doing a lot of great things in
practice. But I think we'll all be ready once the game gets here. Valpo,
they're a really good team. We'll prepare for them and be ready for them
tomorrow.  
  
 Q. This Valparaiso team is a pretty big team. Do you guys look at the
tape or see what they do? Does it compare at all to what you've seen during
the season with the Big Ten with some of these bigger guys?  
MELO TRIMBLE: They are a pretty big team, shot blockers. Basically they can
stretch the floor and shoot. All of them can shoot. [Indiscernible] We're
pretty much seeing that throughout the season different teams have different
matchups with us. They can shoot or just power it in, so it's nothing new
just. It's different, we're in the tournament now, so it makes a different
ballgame.  
  
 Q. I know you've talked a little bit about this, but what do you guys
remember of watching Maryland in the NCAA Tournament when you guys were
growing up?  
DEZ WELLS: Do you even remember that?  
  
MELO TRIMBLE: I just remember, I honestly don't really remember anything. I
just remember Juan Dixon throwing the ball in the air and they winning the
championship.  
  
DEZ WELLS: I'm a little older. I remember the fight, the fighting and stuff
they had to do to get there. It was amazing seeing Juan and Steve Blake and
Lonnie Baxter and Chris Wilcox and seeing all the things that they did, it was
amazing. Even thought I felt like I was there when I was watching and it was a
great building block to have like a foundation to have something like that,
and to have Juan on our staff and stuff. It was amazing. I remember, man. It
was an amazing feat that they did. I can't put it in words.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. We'll start with a statement.  
  
COACH TURGEON: Obviously we're thrilled to be here. It's been a while for
Maryland. And it's been a fun year. Got a great group of guys that have been
fun to coach and won a lot of games and we're looking forward to it. Happy to
be in Columbus. Big Ten country. And looking forward to playing Valpo.  
  
 Q. For those who haven't necessarily been in tuned to your team all
season, not as much was expected from others as what you ended up getting out
of this team, some transition as far as players in preseason. What came
together to get you to where you are at this point?  
COACH TURGEON: Well, one, we have great leadership. I think it starts there
with our seniors. But our personalities fit. Our pieces fit. Guys respect each
other. And I knew in June when we started doing our individual work and we
started doing some team stuff that we had a chance to be pretty good. We had
good pieces and the guys liked each other. And from there it's kind of grown
and we gained confidence. We played a tough schedule. We handled the schedule
and did, I thought, an unbelievable job in the Big Ten to be 14-4 this year.
So personalities fit. Pieces fit. Good players. Good guys. Just been a fun
year at this point.  
  
 Q. When you hear about Valpo, they've had all these injuries, they've
had to consistently reinvent themselves. How do you go about prepping for a
team then that's shown different lineups throughout the course of the year?  
COACH TURGEON: To be honest with you, I don't pay attention to injuries
because it's not going to be part of our game. I just watched the last seven
or eight games with what they have. And they've done an amazing job. Bryce has
done an amazing job with this team. They remind me a lot of us. They defend
well. Games are close. They're good in the half court when they need to be.
Guys step up and make plays. They've got a great player in Peters. Very
confident, very physical team. So I don't know what they were like when they
had those other players, but I do know what they're like now. And they battled
through the semis and the finals with a kid being hurt, which was amazing in
itself. So I just watched them lately, I know what they are and what we need
to do to be successful against them. This time of year no matter who you play
is going to be a heck of a team. We know Valpo is a heck of a team.  
  
 Q. You mentioned being in Big Ten country. Obviously a first year for
that. How was that transition for you guys? Do you think it helped you?  
COACH TURGEON: Well, I don't know if it helped us. I had a good team. We beat
Iowa State early in the year. And we won at Oklahoma State. So we had a good
team. I think we're going to be good no matter what league we're in. But
everything worked out well, considering you had to learn all these 13 new
teams, new coaches, new systems. My assistant coaches did an unbelievable job
preparing us. And obviously looking in now it looks like it was good for us.
It's a great basketball league, great coaches, great players. We got the most
teams, seven teams, I believe, in the NCAA Tournament. Tied the Big 12. It's
heck of a league. It was good for us.  
  
 Q. What I was getting at, you mentioned it. You had to prepare for each
team like a new team and that's what you've got to do for the tournament. Does
that help -- nothing is new when everything is new?  
COACH TURGEON: No doubt. Great question. Everything was new this year. So the
one thing I like about my team is we've been -- we've just been focused in
every game on that team and it's been an amazing deal. Now, we didn't win all
those games and we didn't play well in a couple of them but for the most part
we were dialed in the scouting reports and did a great job. So there's no
doubt in my mind that coming into this tournament that we'll be dialed in to
Valpo and what we need to do to beat them. So maybe going through what we went
through really helped us prepare for this tournament.  
  
 Q. You've got a few guys on this team who played in this tournament
before between Dez and Evan and Richaud. What have you seen from those guys,
those seniors, as far as shedding some light on what it's like to play in this
tournament and how do you have to prepare for it differently, per se?  
COACH TURGEON: We had a meeting last night and everybody that's been a part of
the tournament just talked about it. And obviously they shared some moments.
Just enjoyed it. Talked to the players about enjoying it. Don't make it bigger
than it is. It's a 40-minute game. Could be longer with overtime. But ten-foot
rims, free-throw line is still the same. Three referees, halftime is longer
but besides that everything is the same. But we're just preparing the way we
need to prepare. But no I think those guys have been helpful and I think a lot
of the coaches on our staff have been not only in the NCAA Tournament but
advanced in it and I think all those stories helped our new guys.  
  
 Q. You talked a lot earlier in the year about how you thought Dez's
injury and Evan's injury would help you down the road. Do you feel that's the
case now and how do you feel that guys like Dion and Jared are prepared for a
stage like this?  
COACH TURGEON: They've played a lot of minutes. Jared and Dion have played a
lot of minutes. Jared probably a little bit more. They're prepared for this.
They've played in all scenarios, tough road environments, great home crowds,
whatever it is. So played against all kinds of different styles. So they'll be
ready. Did the injuries help? Yeah, I think so. I think it helped us develop
our team a little bit. I think it helped -- probably wasn't the best thing for
Evan because he had multiple injuries, but Dez has been good because he's been
fresher down the stretch and I think he's been able to put us on his back here
when we won those eight straight games, because he was mentally and physically
fresh for us. And hopefully that will continue in the tournament.  
  
 Q. When you're at Wichita State and you're playing postseason and
you're at Texas A &M and you're in the tournament four consecutive years, when
you're here does it surprise you that it took four years to get to the spot
you're in?  
COACH TURGEON: So I've got an ego, so, yeah, maybe it did take longer than I
anticipated, because I think we're going to win every game and obviously we
haven't. But I'm really proud of what we've done at Maryland, I really am. Our
first year to win 17 games I thought was an amazing feat. Our second year we
came up just short and that's the year we could have got in. We were probably
one game short of the tournament. Went to Final Four in the NIT, I was really,
really proud of that team. And what we've been able to do this year. I think
we've won 84, 85, 86 games in four years but everything's based on whether you
get in this tournament or not. So I think I've enjoyed this year more because
of what I've gone through to get to this point. And luckily I'm a little bit
older, a little bit wiser, a little bit grayer, and I've learned to appreciate
good teams. And this team's been a lot of fun to coach. It's made up for a lot
of things we've been through to get to this point.  
  
 Q. They're bigger than probably a fair amount of mid-majors. Is that
something that you can sort of use to I guess maybe the best way to phrase it
would be, does that size make them a little different from most mid-majors,
and when you sort of point out, hey, to your team, don't overlook this team,
they'll look you right in the eye, is that something you can use and what
about their size and how to combat it?  
COACH TURGEON: Well, I think the thing that we look at first is 28 wins and
whether they were 6'10" or 5'11", 28 wins says a lot. I think it's probably an
advantage for us that they're bigger because that's what we're used to. If
they had a bunch of six-foot guards running around, center at 6'5", shooting
3s, those are hard teams to guard. So I think it's a little bit of an
advantage for us that they're this big. And their size is something that we
see every day when we play. So now just respect factor, one, we respect the
heck out of them. But the eye test, when you go out there, oh boy, they're
pretty big, yeah, probably is going to help, too. But this time of year you're
dialed in no matter what's going on. But they do have a very, very big, tall,
lanky team for a so-called mid-major team.  
  
 Q. You've probably been asked this before but why isn't Melo -- why
does it seem like he's not quite in that conversation with the sort of one-
and-done guys or top freshmen in the country?  
COACH TURGEON: I know why. I probably just won't say. But he's got great hair.
That's why he should be mentioned. At least he thinks he has great hair. I
think NBA looks for a certain style of player, certain type of player. Length,
speed. Above the rim, things like that. And he's not that guy. He's not the
six, seven wing span, run and dunk 'em kind of kid, he's just a really good
basketball player. So he's close to that conversation. And I think where he
was a year ago to where he is now. He wouldn't have even been considered in
that conversation but he shed 20 pounds. He's worked his tail off. Another
year or so, maybe the conversation will be different. But I'm just glad we got
him. He's a heck of a player.  
  
 Q. To that point about size, this Valparaiso team it's only been
outrebounded I think five times in the season. When you know that that's going
to be their strength, that's going to be what they want to do, do you guys
spend any extra effort battling them on the boards or do you say we'll rotate
and get back and we'll worry about it afterwards?  
COACH TURGEON: No, we're going to do what we do. We have not been a great
rebounding team all year for one of my teams. If you look at the history of my
teams we've always been good rebounding teams. This team for whatever reason
we're not. We got outrebounded both games in the Big Ten. But we were close,
one was one, and the other was three. We're competing better on the boards
than we have as the year's gone on we've competed better. So we look at it as
a challenge tomorrow. They're plus-7 on the boards. They've outrebounded a lot
of opponents. It will be a challenge for us, but we're not going to back away
or any of that stuff. We're going to try to compete.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [NCAA MEN'S 2ND & 3RD ROUNDS:
COLUMBUS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+2ND+%26+3RD+ROUNDS%3A+COLUMBUS)

  

## March 19, 2015

  

### [Archie Miller](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23486)

### [Jordan Sibert](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26118)

### [Scoochie Smith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28633)

  
_COLUMBUS, OHIO_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
 Q. Are you all tired?  
SCOOCHIE SMITH: We don't get tired. Can't afford to get tired.  
  
JORDAN SIBERT: Scooch said it best. Can't afford it.  
  
 Q. Could you give me an idea what the last 12 to 20 hours was like, in
other words, the game ends. Did you guys get a chance to get a full night's
sleep. Between the game ending and getting here, what was that like for you?  
JORDAN SIBERT: It was rough. Just leaving the game and trying to get on a bus
and come right up here right after the game. But we did a good job just
sticking together and making sure that we enjoyed the moment last night but as
soon as we got back, we tried to get rested up as much as possible. Now we're
just moving on to the next game.  
  
SCOOCHIE SMITH: Yeah, as Jordan said it was tough. Just to have all those type
of different emotions just going through your body after a win like that in
front of all those fans that just support you throughout the whole year. It
was just a good feeling and just to drive about 70 miles up north is just an
even better feeling.  
  
 Q. Jordan, excuse me for asking you to go back, the shot last night,
didn't realize the significance of it at the time. You end your career the way
you started it, with a game-winning 3-pointer. When did you realize that and
what was your reaction to it?  
JORDAN SIBERT: Well, I realized after the game after everybody was kind of
telling me about how important the shot was. I really didn't think about it at
all. Like I said yesterday coach called the play and Scooch made a great pass
and Kendall had a great screen for me and I was able to knock down the shot.
But just to be able to make that shot in my last night in the arena was just
amazing and the fans were terrific and they helped me concentrate and they
helped me focus. And I'm glad I was able to leave out a second time on a good
note.  
  
 Q. With the moment last night, how quickly were you guys able to kind
of turn your focus to Providence?  
SCOOCHIE SMITH: Just after the game, we kind of celebrated a little bit. But
we know we've got another task at hand and another game to try to win and try
to advance and survive. And that's what it's all about.  
  
 Q. Jordan, just to clarify, you guys did bus here last night? Curious
what time you got here. And also have you talked about Providence at all, seen
any film of them, or will that be tonight or even tomorrow?  
JORDAN SIBERT: Yeah, we bused here right after the game. I'm pretty sure it
was maybe around one-something we got in. But early this morning we were able
to watch film and look over Providence a little bit, see what they have. Great
team coming in here, have some good guys that we have to key in on. But it's
really not about them. We have to focus on what we need to do and prepare and
make sure that we're ready to go.  
  
 Q. You guys also played your championship game on Sunday in New York.
Does playing close to home, at least in some ways make up for the fact that
you've got this crazy schedule? Does it make it easier because you played home
game and now you're playing close to home?  
SCOOCHIE SMITH: We try not to focus on it being a home game. We know we're in
the NCAA Tournament just like everybody else. So we just try to stay true to
one another, and just be there for one another throughout the whole 40 minutes
of each and every game. And I think we'll just be right there to win the game
as we did every game this season, and I think that just helps if we just stay
true to one another.  
  
JORDAN SIBERT: Whether we're close to home or not, basketball is basketball.
We still have to go out there, stick together, stick to our principles. And
like Scooch said earlier we're still in the tournament. So even if we're close
to home or far away we still have to focus on winning because we're blessed
and fortunate enough to still have another game to play.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Coach, an opening comment.  
  
COACH MILLER: It's good to be here. It was a very entertaining and exhausting
night for us. A lot of adrenalin last night to calm ourselves down once we got
into Columbus. But it feels really good to be here. I'm really happy for our
players. I'm happy for our school and our fans. It's great to be on this stage
in March. Now we have our work cut out for us again against a terrific
Providence team. So we're going to take the next 48 hours or whatever it may
be and try to get ourselves ready to go.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
 Q. What is the challenge of playing five games and now I think it's
going to be eight days for you? That's the first one. The second one is
LaDontae Henton was signed to you. What kind of an attempt did you make to try
to keep him?  
COACH MILLER: The first one, playing our fifth game in eight days is difficult
on our team. We've lost a lot of practice availability. We've lost the ability
to do that in the last 10 to 12 days because of all the games. I wish we had
more time to clean some things up but it is what it is. It's more of a
physical thing. And getting ourselves ready to go physically is the biggest
thing, because mentally, we're ready to go. And we have a group that's very
together. They play the right way. They play to win. And I think that won't
change. But it's going to be taxing. I'm glad the game is late. The second
part, LaDontae Henton, he obviously signed to Dayton before I was ever named
the head coach. When you get that opportunity to become a head coach, the
first thing you're going to deal with is change. And I had an opportunity to
speak to LaDontae and his family and his high school coach probably a few days
after I got the job. And they didn't know me and I didn't know them. And I
felt really bad that he wasn't going to be able to come to Dayton but also
really understood and respected that's part of the deal, and he's turned out
to be one of the Big East's best players -- you know, 2,000 points, 1,000
rebounds. And what if sort of things for Dayton. Maybe they shouldn't have
hired me or something, get somebody else to keep him. But he's had a great
career. We're obviously here and we're proud to be here, too. So it's worked
out well for both of us.  
  
 Q. Obviously I'm sure you prefer to not have been in the First Four
--  
COACH MILLER: I liked it. I absolutely enjoyed being in the First Four. It was
one of the greatest experiences that our team and school will have. I don't
know if we'll ever have the opportunity to do it again. But to be in the
tournament was great. And to play a home game, I'll take that any day of the
week.  
  
 Q. I wasn't trying to knock you into playing at home. But obviously
this has been a pretty fortunate circumstance given that you did get a home
game and then play here. Is it kind of odd the way it's kind of broken out
that way in your favor, maybe?  
COACH MILLER: I think distance from home is a big, big part of the first
couple days of the tournament. You can see a lot of teams regionally are being
put in those situations. So I don't think it's very surprising for us to be in
Columbus at all. To play the home game, probably more surprised than us being
in Columbus.  
  
 Q. Playing in the game last night, coaching-wise does that change the
way you prepare for Providence? Did you already have someone getting ready for
Providence or was it not until you won last night that that all starts?  
COACH MILLER: Oh no. I don't know how every staff does it. We're scattered
out. You have to have one guy, Tom Ostrom would be the assistant coach that's
going to spearhead this scout on Providence, and he was ready to go last night
and when we played the next game or the next opponent, someone would be ready
to do that as well.  
  
 Q. You're going to face a pretty good player in Kris Dunn? What are his
strengths and weaknesses what kind of approach do you take to stop a guy like
that?  
COACH MILLER: He's about as impressive of a point guard as I've seen in a
long, long time. The last guy I think I've seen on film that startles at you
at that position was Kemba Walker, when we were getting ready to deal with
him. He's so dominating in the game on both ends of the floor. The ball hits
people's hands on time like I've never seen it before. Not only is he tough to
deal with as a scorer, he puts the ball where it needs to be at all times, and
I can see why so many people are high on him after getting a chance. We're
going to have to be who we are. I mean, we're going to have to play defense
the way we play defense and obviously there will be some scouting tidbits. But
he's a good player. And we dealt with a good player last night in Marks, and
you're going to have to react during the game to how things are going and you
gotta adjust. But we've done it all year. We've done it a long time, being
able to play the way we want to play. And Providence presents a lot of
challenges. Not just him. But he's really a special player.  
  
 Q. People look at your roster, they see the low numbers, they see the
lack of height and just assume that you're going to have trouble off the
glass. And that hasn't really been consistently the case. Does that just speak
to your team's toughness? Is there any way you can frame it?  
COACH MILLER: I think the big thing is rebounding the basketball, you have
five guys committed to it, and it's something that we know if we didn't do --
we wouldn't have had a chance. So we spend a lot of time -- I didn't think we
did a good job at all last night against Boise and it would have been one of
the biggest reasons why we didn't win the game if we didn't. But all season
long we've been able to commit to our perimeter players hitting, blocking out.
Dyshawn has done a terrific job all season defensive rebounding. I think the
one thing that Providence brings to the table is a real athleticism and
physicality on the glass. And it will probably be number one on the report of,
it's got to get done or the season will end. But rebounding the ball to me, I
think their size is overrated. I've said that. I think guys naturally are good
rebounders. Dyshawn is a great rebounder. He has a way of getting the ball.
Our perimeter guys will put their nose in there and go get the ball. Teams
that don't rebound well at times, I think it's about wanting to go get it.  
  
 Q. You've lived here. You obviously know your fan base. What do you
expect it to be like in terms of a home court advantage for you here
tonight?  
COACH MILLER: I know we'll travel. I don't know the numbers. But to be playing
in Columbus, clearly we're going to have fan support. And to be honest with
you, if we were in Buffalo we were going to have fan support. If they would
have sent us to Pittsburgh we we're going to have fan support just because of
who we are. We're a basketball program with basketball fans. And football
teams travel. They say that. We travel. We'll travel. And I think it will be
an Ohio crowd per se. But it doesn't play a difference. Last night was an
amazing environment. But Boise played right with us the whole time. And we got
our work cut out for us with a great team in Providence.  
  
 Q. What is it about Jordan, his makeup and his game, that allows him to
excel especially in late-game situations. He seems to make a lot of plays for
you when you need them late in games?  
COACH MILLER: Jordan's really evolved. Jordan wasn't a very confident guy when
we got him. And he took a year to work with him and develop and he worked very
hard on his shot. I think that's the first thing that he took care of. He
became a consistent shooter. And I think last year, playing the first time
with a real big role, he was able to play through the season and gain
confidence that he belonged again. This offseason, to his credit, was the best
offseason that he's ever had. He gets to the foul line a lot more. He's a
better handler. He's stronger. When you're a fifth-year senior, you're
different, the game is slower for you. I think as we've been able to win games
and gain confidence, he's just become that guy for us. He's an all-star all
year for us and I'm happy for him. He did it the old-fashioned way.  
  
 Q. A little bit off beat for you have Joey Gruden on your roster. What
kind of contributor, what kind of person has he been as a walk-on?  
COACH MILLER: Joey's a great kid. I know the Gruden name pops out there with
his family or whatnot. But he's just like one of the other guys. He does a
great job in practice with us, whether it's the practices, the scout team,
with our numbers this year, all those guys have been invaluable. And he's a
credit -- he's a great kid and I'm glad he's with us. I'm really glad he's
with us. He brings a good personality to the team.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_COLUMBUS, OHIO_  
  
Q. Buddy, you had initially said when you got the draw that Albany was a
good draw for you guys. Why did you say that?  
BUDDY HIELD: I just said it was a good draw. It's coming our team confidence
and knowing what we're capable of doing and just having confidence in my team
and I feel like we can go in there get after these guys a lot, just talking a
lot of confidence.  
  
 Q. Ryan and Buddy, last year you guys got beat in the first round. How
much do you think about that going into your first round matchup against
Albany?  
RYAN SPANGLER: We've been thinking about it. That's why we've had pretty good
practices the last three days. We don't want that to happen to us again. So
our goal is to come out on fire and give it all the energy we have.  
  
BUDDY HIELD: Like Ryan said, it's been in the back of our heads. We had a
couple of great practices to prepare us for this game and we're just ready to
get after it now.  
  
 Q. Buddy, Ryan sort of has a reputation as sort of a villain when you
go to opposing arenas. How much do you guys notice that, do you have fun with
it or take offense at it or how do you respond to that?  
BUDDY HIELD: We know that all right. It's fun, though, because Ryan
[indiscernible] because his tattoos he has, and everybody else asks him about
his tattoos. How he plays, he plays so hard. If I was playing against him I'd
be mad at him too. It's always good to help a guy like Ryan on our team. It
fuels him.  
  
 Q. There's going to be a lot made of pace of play after Iowa State was
upset today. How do you describe the pace of play from Albany and how does
that match up with what you guys like to do?  
TASHAWN THOMAS: I think they're like more of a half court team. They like to
execute in the half court and move the defense around. Just try to catch them
sleeping by backdoor or something like that. And I believe if we get the tempo
up that we'll be able to execute what we want to do.  
  
RYAN SPANGLER: Like he said, I think they like to play, slow it down, play
half court game. Obviously we want to get out and run. So we know it's going
to be important for us to start out early and try to set the tempo for
ourselves.  
  
 Q. Tough loss to Iowa State. Do you say that -- I know you said you're
focused coming into this, are you loose, tense, how are you feeling coming
into this?  
BUDDY HIELD: We can't worry about the game. It was a tough loss for us and
we've got to move on to the next and the next game is tomorrow night. We've
just got to be locked in and focused. We can't worry about what happened to
Iowa State. Watching Iowa State, you see what happened to them, so we can't
let teams get their head up and we got to be ready to fight because every team
is coming at us.  
  
TASHAWN THOMAS: Like Buddy said, I feel like we're not really tensed up right
now. We're just ready to play. We haven't really thought about the last loss
because we came in looking at it as if everybody is 0-0 everybody's trying to
get their first win and try to get some momentum going. That's how I think
we're looking at it right now.  
  
RYAN SPANGLER: I think we're pretty loose. Like I said earlier, we had three
really good practices. I think we're feeling good about ourselves right now.
We've been waiting for this game for a while and we put work in for this game.
So we're ready.  
  
 Q. Albany has made a lot about how confident you guys are scoring from
all five positions at any time on the court. From your perspective, how
confident is this team putting the ball in the basket from any position?  
RYAN SPANGLER: I think we're pretty confident. Like you said, any of our guys
can score at any time. If somebody's having a bad night. That's our goal on
offense is to get everybody touches and get the best shots possible. No matter
who takes the shots.  
  
BUDDY HIELD: Like Ryan said, we're comfortable with everybody scoring from 1
through 5, even guys who come off the bench. Whenever guys get hot we stick
with him and we like to move the ball a lot to get the shot in rhythm. Coach
always tells you to shoot the ball, spread the floor and get the shot
regardless of how Coach you're going to ride that guy.  
  
TASHAWN THOMAS: I think anytime you have a team full of people -- the whole
five can score we're confident. Of course we're confident with that. It just
gives you the chance not to depend on one or two people on the court that when
you need a bucket you can always look at somebody else and just see who has
the opening right there.  
  
 Q. TaShawn, the games today have all been close, even the 3-14, 2-15
type matchups. Do you anticipate this game being up for grabs in the last four
or five minutes tomorrow night?  
TASHAWN THOMAS: Kind of. Watching the games, watching the NCAA Tournament,
I've always noticed that all the games usually are close. Never really too
many blowouts unless it's just like one great team or something like that.
But, yeah, I kind of anticipate the game being close and us just having to be
strong at the end of the game and be together.  
  
 Q. You guys have made the tournament the last three years. I'm just
wondering why it is that you haven't broken through. You've made the
tournament. You must be a pretty good team. But you just haven't gotten
through that first game?  
TASHAWN THOMAS: I can't really speak on that because this is my first year
with Oklahoma. So I'll pass it on to them.  
  
BUDDY HIELD: Something about that had some -- when I came in first game as a
freshman I've been there. But I feel like we had games we were capable of
winning, we didn't really execute in the last five minutes. And this team is
different this year. I know I said it last year but I feel this team is ready
to take the next step and I'm tired of losing in the first round. It's
lighting a fire under my butt, and I know Coach Kruger is doing a good job
getting us ready. We have good leaders -- me, Ryan, Tay and Isaiah. And we're
getting the team ready for that. We're just up for the challenge now.  
  
RYAN SPANGLER: I think last year's losses hurt us. And I think we worked
pretty hard all summer and getting ready for this year. So I think we're
different this year. I think we're more mature and we know how to win a game
like this now.  
  
 Q. Do you guys pay attention to what other Big 12 teams are doing right
now? As it looks right now the league's kind of having a rough start to this
tournament. Does that concern you as you go into the NCAA Tournament?  
TASHAWN THOMAS: Of course we watched the other teams, just because we played
them in conference. You just want to see how they're doing. I don't really
think that the fact that the score is really bothering us any. We're just,
like, kind of amazed at the same time that Iowa State kind of lost that early.
A lot of people predicted them to go further. A lot of people were shocked by
that. But at the same time I don't think it affects in any way how we're going
to play tomorrow.  
  
BUDDY HIELD: Just watching the games, I feel like my first two years, I came
in we opened the first day, the first Thursday and I think it's like watching
Iowa State loss gives us a -- opens our heads up, we can't relax on teams that
we're supposed to beat. We can beat them, they can't beat us. Let's open our
minds, we need to wake up a lot more.  
  
 Q. The new Albany program has gotten a lot of publicity with their
Peter Hooley, the junior guard whose mother died of colon cancer, he hit the
big shot to win their tournament. Are you aware of that and the reaction to
the story it's become?  
RYAN SPANGLER: Yeah, I feel bad for him. Anybody that goes through that and
we'll be praying for him. But on top of that, we've got to play our game and
not think about that and hopefully come out with a win.  
  
BUDDY HIELD: No, like Ryan said, I feel bad for him. If I lost my mom I'd feel
bad. And happy he made that shot. He made that shot, it was good for him, but
we've just got to worry about what we have to handle, and we'll be praying for
him and hopefully he gets through it.  
  
 Q. Somewhat tied into that, you guys were tremendous -- Iowa State was
the home team, if you will, in the tournament -- because of Peter's basket and
maybe the location up here and his story, there's thought that Albany will be
considered the home team. Any thoughts about coming into the tournament again
playing against -- in that situation?  
RYAN SPANGLER: I think we're used to playing at away sites. A lot of Big 12
teams have good home court advantages. We can't think about it. We just have
to go out there and execute. If you execute the fans can't get into the game
that well.  
  
 Q. With a win in this NCAA Tournament Lon can become the first coach
ever to have five NCAA Tournament wins with five different schools. What's it
like to play for a guy like that?  
TASHAWN THOMAS: This year's been really exciting for me to play for Coach
Kruger. It's just something different from what I'm used to and just the trust
he has in all of us on the court and off the court. Just shows a lot in him as
a person. He's a great coach. And it's an honor to actually be able to play
for him. I wish I could actually play for him longer. So it wraps it up.  
  
BUDDY HIELD: Yeah, Coach Kruger, he's been so great from my freshman year. I
came in and he never promised me nothing and I respect that out of him. He
always showed true to the game and he did everything right. He made all us
players better. He made us players believing in what he's doing, and you see
why he's done so much around the league and everywhere he went he was so
successful. And he's been coaching good and I respect what he's doing and he
got the best out of me and got the best out of Ryan and all his players and
making us play hard. He's bringing teams that people didn't pick to make it
further and just making the best out of his players and I really respect him
for that.  
  
RYAN SPANGLER: I think it shows how good of a coach he is. He's able to make
us better players year after year and make us grow up on and off the court and
he's been able to do that every place he's been.  
  
 Q. Since we've been sitting here Baylor got beat as a No. 3 seed.
Georgia State beat them. All of a sudden two number 3 seeds from the Big 12
have gone down. Does that help you guys in terms of getting your focus
straight or does that worry you, hey, maybe the league is cursed or what's
your response to that?  
RYAN SPANGLER: I think it helps us. It shows us that anybody can beat anybody
when it comes to March. And we'll be thinking about them two losses tonight
and see where they went wrong and try not to let it happen to us tomorrow and
make sure we come out with fire and ready to play.  
  
BUDDY HIELD: Yeah, we gotta come out with a lot of fire and a lot of energy.
Watching Baylor, Baylor's a pretty good team. I had them going far, too. But
it's a tough loss. We had a good league and it was the best RPI league in the
nation. Anything happens in March. We can't let whatever happened to Baylor
affect us, we have to go out, execute our game plan.  
  
 Q. Ryan, would you give an example of what it is about Coach Kruger
that you particularly are fond of? I know early in your career you really
appreciated him.  
RYAN SPANGLER: As a player?  
  
 Q. However you wanted to address it.  
RYAN SPANGLER: I think as far as being his player, college players, high
school players want to be good at everything all at once. And I think he's
good at talking to you and kind of showing you, hey, if you'll work on this
one thing, whether it's rebounding, defense, shooting, whatever it is, you
work on that one thing for a while and then you perfect it and then you're
able to move on to new things and perfect them slowly at a time. And I think
he's good at that.  
  
 Q. TaShawn, yesterday the NCAA closed the rule that a guy could apply
for a waiver to play immediately. Of course, if that would have been the case
last year you would have been heavily affected. What's your reaction to that
rule being changed and what you were able to do no longer being available to
players?  
TASHAWN THOMAS: That's kind of -- I don't know what word to say for it -- but
I'm just thankful that I actually got the chance before that rule came into
play. Just me being able to play this year, just showing me a lot of things. I
went to a lot of places I haven't been to my life, actually making it to the
tournament for the first time and going to the Bahamas, just things like that.
So just being able to play this year I'm thankful I had the chance and I feel
bad for anybody that had to go through what I had to go through after this
year.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
 Q. Coach, we were just finishing up talking about the Big 12. Maybe we
can start off there. We had two teams now, two 3s falling by the wayside does
that tell you anything?  
COACH KRUGER: Just heard about the Baylor score. Very surprise, two great
teams that had great years and outstanding players. That's the nature of the
NCAA Tournament, I guess. It's surprising anytime that happens but it's
happened before.  
  
 Q. That's two No. 3 seeds that lost, the other No. 3 seed Notre Dame
almost lost. Only one 3 seed to play in the first round, that happens to be
you. What kind of -- does this help you tomorrow getting you guys focused,
realizing that nothing's easy or did they already know that or how do you
think what's happened today affects tomorrow?  
COACH KRUGER: I hope they already knew nothing was going to be easy. If they
didn't, I guess this would reinforce that they've got to be ready and battling
every possession and respect the opponents. I know our guys definitely respect
Albany and how good they've been and their culture of winning and three
championships in a row and so it shouldn't be a problem. Our guys have
practiced well all week in preparation and again know how good Albany is.  
  
 Q. If you win an NCAA Tournament game here at Oklahoma, you'll be the
only coach ever to have five wins at five different schools. I know you're
focused on the game, but what kind of achievement would that mean if you were
able to earn that?  
COACH KRUGER: Not thinking about that at all, of course, just more concerned
about winning the game for the guys that are in the program and for the
program. But we've been at good places. We've been with good players. They've
had a lot of good times. So it doesn't mean too much more than that.  
  
 Q. You've had some time now to look at film of Albany. What do you
think you have to do to beat them?  
COACH KRUGER: We've got to play well. Coach Brown does a terrific job.
Watching his teams on tape, very solid, very sound, fundamentally good on both
ends of the floor. Play extremely hard. Very well organized and well prepared.
We played against those type of teams all year and our guys understand that we
have to play well to win. If we don't, we probably won't win. And that's been
the way it's been in the Big 12 and that won't change now. So really good
team. Really good Albany team that knows how to win.  
  
 Q. I'm wondering, in the last two years, when you got knocked out in
one game, was there a trend or was there an overriding factor; was there
anything that happened in those two games that you might have been able to
correct or work on going into this game?  
COACH KRUGER: The two years were different. Last year we just didn't do the
job defensively at critical times in that game to get some stops. Had a chance
to get a little bit of a margin down the stretch and didn't. Two years ago
played a very good San Diego State team that got away from us a little bit
midway in the second half. Different type games. And if that one didn't go
down to the wire, last year it did. Just didn't get the stops last year that
we needed and hopefully this team is in a better position to do that.  
  
 Q. The pace of play with you two clubs seems to be quite different. How
do you address that with your club? What would be important for your guys?  
COACH KRUGER: We've gotta do a good job defensively in terms of trying to make
Albany take tough shots and giving them only one on their end and trying to
push the pace offensively, get good looks on our end, need to take good care
of the ball, get a good shot out of each possession. Rebounding in a game like
that is always important. Trying to get some second-shot opportunities on our
end and try to limit Albany on theirs. But sometimes it's easier said than
done, but our guys, again, have a great deal of respect for how hard Albany
plays and how good of a job they do.  
  
 Q. Eddie Sutton used to talk about this a lot about how much the NCAA
Tournament changed over his career. You've been coaching in it a long time,
played in it a real long time ago. How much different is it from, say, the
mid-'70s or mid-'80s?  
COACH KRUGER: It's different than when we played, there was only 16 teams in
the event. You won a ballgame, got the Elite Eight game. But the number of
good teams, the number of good players has changed a lot over the years.
That's why I think there were more perceived upsets today because there's more
good players on each team, and players that are used to playing each other in
the AAU events in the summertime, it's not such an awe factor perhaps for some
of them like it may be used to be 15, 20 years ago. Just more good players.
More good players. More good teams. I think all coaches do a great job. So
it's hard to win games in the tournament.  
  
 Q. I don't think you can argue that Oklahoma has a more athletic team
than Albany. Does a more athletic team usually have the advantage then?  
COACH KRUGER: Not necessarily. It depends on the team that makes shots
probably has the advantage. Making shots in the tournament I think is the most
important thing. A lot of times, certainly you have to get stops, get
rebounds, but you've got to make shots. And being athletic or non-athletic
doesn't always make a big difference there. We've gotta do a good job. We've
got to be sound. We have to use, if there's an advantage athletically, we have
to use that to our advantage and be disciplined with it and do a good job
especially on the defensive end.  
  
 Q. The Peter Hooley story is catching on. It's obviously a major story
in this region. Your thoughts on if that is an impact in any way in terms of
the game out on the court and your thoughts of him as a player?  
COACH KRUGER: I respect what he's gone through and how difficult that must be
during the basketball season or any other time, to see the highlights of his
game-winning shot, and felt really good for him at that moment. And the story
-- that was the first time I had really heard the details. And, again, it's a
tough situation, I guess a feel-good moment, to hit a shot like that. But I
think when the game starts, I don't know that that will play a big part in the
games. I doubt the players on either team are thinking too much about that.
Certainly him making the shot's a nice story leading up to it.  
  
 Q. By looking at film of Albany, is there one player that you think you
have to concentrate on to stop and make sure he doesn't beat you?  
COACH KRUGER: They've got several actually. I don't know if that's one guy.
Again, I don't know them as well as Albany or perhaps you might. Seems like at
different times during the year different individuals have stepped up and made
big plays. They've got four guys averaging right around double figures or
better and seemed like all those guys have been capable of stepping up and
making big plays at critical times. We're not looking at just one guy. We're
looking more at the five-on-five and being good defensively as a team and
being aware and helping each other, and so nothing really different. It's not
like there's just one guy. I think you have to do a good job on all of them.  
  
 Q. Anything you've worked on with Buddy -- his shooting numbers have
been down for a while. Anything coming into this tournament that you've
stressed with him that you could tell us about?  
COACH KRUGER: Not anything different. Just balance, working hard to get
separation. Trying to be low, be on balance. We want him shooting the ball. We
want him being aggressive. He's done a good job for us all year long. Of
course, defenses are gearing to stop him more and more and it makes it more
difficult to get separation and get open looks. But he's aware of that, and
he's worked hard to improve on that.

### [Bobby Hurley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28714)

  
_COLUMBUS, OHIO_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Buffalo student-athletes Shannon Evans and
Xavier Ford.  
  
 Q. I just wondered if you guys anticipate with the first trip to the
NCAA are nerves any consideration for you.  
XAVIER FORD: We've been prepared well. We don't have that much nerves. We
understand that we're in a great opportunity, and it's a great chance to go
out here and showcase our talents. We're just blessed to be here on this
national stage and to represent our school and to be representing Bobby
Hurley. We don't really have no nerves. We've prepared the last few days.
We're going to go have fun, at the end of the day it's been a basketball game
and we've been playing it our whole lives.  
  
 Q. How important is it to really take care of the ball and avoid those
big momentum swings that we always see in tournament games in a game like
this?  
SHANNON EVANS: West Virginia, they press a lot and they're real big and
athletic. So it's very important that we be strong with the ball and make
great passes and just get in the offense as smoothly as possible.  
  
XAVIER FORD: Like Shannon mentioned, just taking care of the ball. We've got a
good group of guards with Shannon Evans and Lamonte Bearden and Jarryn Skeete.
Our guards just going to do a good job of taking care of the ball to limit
runs because they're going to make a run with the press and all the stuff they
cause and limit the runs and handle it well.  
  
 Q. You played much better in the last two or three weeks to get here.
What do you think that's been that maybe wasn't there before then?  
SHANNON EVANS: I feel like we all bought into our system. If you've been
around us, you know like we're really joking type of group, and we love to be
around each other and we're starting to play better as a team. We all know our
roles and know what we do best. So we'll start playing more team basketball
and sharing the basketball, getting great shots. I feel like it's a
combination of things that all came together at the right time, like we're on
an eight-game winning streak. And it all came because we're all playing
together, we're all bought into the system and we all care for each other.  
  
 Q. Your coach's experience in the NCAA Tournament as a player, does
that factor in, does it give you comfort he's been in this kind of environment
before and also just the second question, did you guys know who Bobby Hurley
was when he was hired?  
SHANNON EVANS: I've heard the name before. I wasn't really familiar like what
he had done, but as I got more further in my recruitment process, I did my
research so I knew he was a great point guard. And what was your first
question again?  
  
 Q. In terms of his experience.  
SHANNON EVANS: Yeah, I mean, me and Coach Hurley we've had a great
relationship. He talks all about his NCAA championships and all the Final Four
runs he has. I know a lot of stories about that and he try to share his
experiences with me. So I feel I have a great knowledge of what he has done.  
  
 Q. I'm just kind of wondering, what things has Coach Hurley done to
turn around the program as quickly as he has? Is there anything that you guys
can pinpoint? I know people have talked about he's been the aggressive and
he's a good guy to play for, I'm wondering what else is there that he's done
to turn around the program so quickly?  
XAVIER FORD: Coach Hurley, he's very intense. He comes from winning. His
father's a winner. Coach K is a winner and he holds us accountable for
winning. It's a standard that's been set as I've mentioned by his father and
Coach K. And we always emphasize the value of the little things, the
fundamentals, taking care of the ball, being unselfish. He's just brought a
winning attitude and unselfishness that we've all bought into and he also has
a great coaching staff in Levi Watkins and they also do a great job preparing
us for this type of moment. So we're all happy to be playing for a guy like
Coach Hurley.  
  
 Q. What has changed about coach from last year to this year in terms of
getting used to being a coach and kind of how he's running the program and
stuff what do you guys notice about how he's changed or has he changed at all
from year one to year two?  
SHANNON EVANS: I think he's stayed consistent since day one. He holds us
accountable for winning. He doesn't accept anything less than winning. I feel
like that came from his father and also Coach K. He holds us accountable. He
installed the mindset of winning here at Buffalo.  
  
XAVIER FORD: Could you repeat your question one more time, I'm sorry.  
  
 Q. Did you notice any change or kind of how he's growing in the job?  
XAVIER FORD: His first year he was kind of feeling his way into it. First head
coaching job. And he was learning how to push our buttons. We have some
success and we have a real talented group this year and he picked up the
intensity a lot this year. He got more comfortable with us, learning how to
push our buttons. He knows what makes us tick and we know what makes him tick.
I would say this year he stepped up and have been more aggressive and
confident in himself and we as players all notice and when we have a confident
coach, it helps us be confident when we're out there performing.  
  
 Q. Have you guys played any teams like West Virginia that has the bulk
of the Devin Williams and Elijah Macon, like that?  
SHANNON EVANS: We played Kentucky that's the best you can get. The Harrison
twins, they're pretty big, they're like 6'6". Real fast. Tyler Ulis, one of
the top point guards in the nation. So that press that Kentucky has is just as
good as West Virginia has if not better.  
  
 Q. When the brackets came out, you guys seemed to be the popular pick
among a lot of people for a 12-5 upset. How does that affect your mentality or
your preparation going into the game?  
SHANNON EVANS: We try not to listen to ESPN and Jay Bilas. He picked us to
win. We try not to listen to that as much. We try to stick to our principles
and we know what we have to do to go out and win and we try to stay true to
ourselves as well.  
  
 Q. Can you talk about what can you take from the success you had in the
first half against Kentucky, Wisconsin into these games this weekend?  
XAVIER FORD: We realized we're playing at a neutral site, playing at Kentucky
is one of the toughest places I've played in in my college career. And we had
the opportunity to go in there and know the league. We're just going to go out
there and try to put two halves together and stay confident with ourselves at
the same time we know West Virginia is a good team and they're going to cause
turnovers and go on a run and we just have to limit that run. And us being at
Kentucky and experiencing the atmosphere of a crowd in Wisconsin and
understanding that the runs are going to come, we should be able to sustain a
run if possible.  
  
 Q. Juwan Staten back in the lineup for West Virginia, his ability to
draw extra defenders in the lane a big reason why Mountaineers are number one
in offensive rebounding. Just the challenge that presents to you guys and
Xavier, I guess, specifically, the job that you guys have to do and how
important it is to keep them away from second-chance points?  
XAVIER FORD: It's very important to keep them away for second chance points.
We understand that they're really good offensive rebounding team. Guys like
myself, Justin Moss and Will Regan, are going to do what we have to do on the
backboard, but at the same time we're a good offensive rebounding team too. So
we understand they'll be crashing in. And they're going to get some offensive
rebounds, they're real good at it and it comes with the territory. It's just
limiting those offensive rebounds and us, bigs and guards, we're going to
attack the offensive glass and try to force turnovers as well.  
  
 Q. Generally does your coach talk a lot about his days as a player to
try to get you guys familiar with situations, and have you heard any more or
different stories from him this week leading up to the game in that regard?  
SHANNON EVANS: I feel like I've heard all the stories from him and me and him
had a great relationship and talked to him a lot in between classes and stuff.
So yeah, I think I've heard them all and I try to relate to the experiences as
well. Obviously they're not as big because he was at Duke and I'm at Buffalo.
So they're a high major program, so it's not as big. But me and him relate in
many ways. So I feel like his experiences at Duke and Final Four and the
national championship he won really affected me in a way.  
  
 Q. Xavier, this is for you. What did your performance in the MAC
Championship winning that MVP and stepping up for Justin Moss who was limited.
What did your performance do for your confidence that you're taking into
tomorrow?  
XAVIER FORD: It really didn't do much. I have confidence in myself as a
player. At the same time that MVP award, it wasn't only a single award. My
team had a part in that, too. I feel that award could have been given to
anybody. Shannon Evans had an MVP performance that night, too. So it was good
to have that. But at the same time that was more of a team thing. So that MVP
award was like an MVP team thing. I mean, it's good for my confidence but at
the same time it's good for everybody's confidence.  
  
 Q. You mentioned playing Kentucky and how good they are. Do you take
certain comfort coming into a tournament like this knowing that you've pretty
much played a team -- you won't face a tougher team, you may face very tough
teams but you won't face a tougher team, is there a comfort level or something
that you gain from that coming into this tournament?  
SHANNON EVANS: Yeah, definitely. We feel like we played the best of the best,
Kentucky and Wisconsin. So going to this tournament, we know that we can hang
with the best. So now, with us trying not to be content just winning the MAC
Championship and come out here and make a run at it.  
  
 Q. Has it been a little bit odd seeing how much attention is being paid
to the program now? Go back to the beginning of the season you had a hard time
getting people in your building, now you have a city, people across the
country are becoming more familiar with your school?  
XAVIER FORD: We understand the territory that comes with winning and losing,
nobody wants to be associated with a looser. We knew we would be confident
with ourselves because at the beginning of the season a lot of -- even our own
paper and our own school paper said we'd be lucky to finish. 500 and we'll be
mediocre in the pack. Having Coach Hurley, he always uses stuff like that, any
edge he can get to motivate us to do better, he'll present that to us and he
presented that to us throughout the season. So we understand that being a
winner comes with a lot of stuff, accolades and media and stuff like that. But
at the same time we expected the success because Coach Hurley holds us to a
high standard. So again we're just happy to be here and to be able to keep
putting mid-major schools on the map and put off our community in Buffalo and
try to make a good run and make special things happen for our team and our
players.  
  
 Q. Staying on the Kentucky theme, with the success that you guys have
had, what will it take for a team to finish the job against Kentucky, and do
you think that given the teams out there, do you think that's going to
happen?  
XAVIER FORD: Are you asking about Kentucky winning?  
  
 Q. What will it take to -- you guys had success for a half, what will
it take for a team to finish that job?  
XAVIER FORD: Luck. (Laughter) It's like have you seen Space Jam? It's like
playing against the Monstars. So you gotta do everything right against a team
like that. Everything right. You can't have no mistakes. It's basketball. Any
team could get beat on any given night. But a team like that you would have to
be doing everything right. I don't know if anybody can answer that question.  
  
 Q. Just wanted to ask about the press defense. Have you guys faced
anything like that in the MAC conference, and talking to Big 12 coaches
throughout the season they said they tried seven or eight guys on defense
during practice to make the guys move. Have you guys practiced anything like
that?  
SHANNON EVANS: We definitely had, like, seven guys on defense as well. I don't
think we faced anything in our conference like that, because West Virginia is
so big and athletic, we don't have anything like that in our conference. But
like I said, going back to when we played Kentucky, their press was pretty
big, too. They've got 6'6" guards up there, long and athletic. So we kind of
relate back to that. We also watched film and we found ways we feel we can
break it. And we have really good guards. Me and Lamonte and Jarryn Skeete are
really quick and fast so hopefully we can break it ourselves.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach.  
  
COACH HURLEY: I'm obviously really excited to be here, what we accomplished at
Buffalo, winning our conference tournament and getting a chance to play in the
NCAAs for the first time in school history. So just thrilled to be a part of
the NCAA Tournament, and our players are soaking it all in and enjoying it.
We've had a few good practices and feel good about where we are and how we're
playing right now at this time of year, after winning eight straight games,
haven't lost in a month. So I feel great coming into this.  
  
 Q. Every time you mentioned the words NCAA Tournament, there's kind of
like a grin or smile that comes to your face. How does it feel to be back in
it as a coach right now, how does it differ as a player, I know you haven't
played the game yet?  
COACH HURLEY: I'm excited for my players. I know what they sacrificed and what
they go through and how hard they've worked to get here and have had some
peaks and valleys this year and had some difficult times that we've overcome.
And I know what it feels like, the excitement, the memories that you take from
playing in this tournament and I'm glad that my players get to enjoy that and
experience it.  
  
 Q. When you were a player going into your first tournament game, how
did you take the advice you were given by people who were telling you what to
expect to actually be applicable compared to the environment, any nerves, was
it something that clicked right away for you as a player?  
COACH HURLEY: I grew up with the NCAA Tournament. I watched Jordan hit the
shot and Villanova beat Georgetown, N.C. State beat Houston. Those were my
childhood memories. For me it was trying to calm down. So I'm going to try and
be as composed and as calm with my team as possible. I know that motivation to
play is not going to be something that I'm concerned about. And so we'll try
and just keep them, their emotions in check. And I don't want them to feel
uptight or play uptight because we're a very good offensive team in our
league, one of the best offensive teams. And we play very fast. I want them to
have fun playing and not feel like it's any different than any other game as
much as I possibly can with them.  
  
 Q. I know you went against Coach Huggins when you were in the
tournament, when he took a team to the Final Four. What have you known about
Coach Huggins throughout your career playing and now coaching and what you see
of him in this team that you guys are facing?  
COACH HURLEY: I obviously have a ton of respect for all these accomplished and
enjoyed watching his teams play because I respect teams that play defense and
that are tough and his teams reflect that. They're a team this year, I don't
know if there's a team that gets after it any harder on the defensive end with
their pressure and how physical they are and how they rebound. So that's a
great formula for winning a lot of basketball games. And they don't stop. They
keep coming at you for 40 minutes. And they've been in a great league and
they've made some really good teams in that league look average this year. So
we have our work cut out for us.  
  
 Q. What was it like those years you spent on the bench with Danny. I
say this with a smile on my face, what if anything did you learn from him?  
COACH HURLEY: Dan gave me a great opportunity and it was a chance for he and I
to spend a lot of time together, two guys that are very close. We have a close
relationship. He built a high school program, St. Benedict's, and turned it
into one of the best in the country, and he wanted to make a move to the
college game and I just watched them. I saw how he conducted his practices,
how he recruited, how he built the program and he allowed me to have a voice
and we worked very closely together and we're still constantly in
communication almost daily during the season about our teams. So it was
special for me to have the opportunity to work for him. I don't think I would
be in this position if I didn't have that chance.  
  
 Q. How much of an advantage is it for you guys that you don't need to
have that one go-to scorer, that you have so many guys who can pick up the
scoring slack if somebody has an off day or two guys have an off game?  
COACH HURLEY: I think we have pretty good balance on offense. And things
usually start with Justin Moss and his physicality inside and his versatility
to score inside and out. And then our guards are kind of unpredictable in how
they attack you and are very good off the bounce trying to create offense for
us. So we try and -- we have an eight-man rotation. So we're not as obviously
not as deep as West Virginia, but we do have guys that are capable of making
plays at a number of positions.  
  
 Q. Back to your brother Dan for a moment, any family bragging rights
trending, bragging rights over your brother getting to the dance first?  
COACH HURLEY: Not really. It was one of the hardest conversations I had, like,
this year with him after we won the MAC Championship Saturday night and before
we played we tipped off at 7:30, I knew that they had lost a close game to
Dayton and that probably meant they weren't going to get in the NCAA
Tournament. So that was affecting me. I was thinking about that. And then
afterwards, to talk to Dan, knowing how disappointed he was that they were so
close and on the verge of getting in the field and then just not making it, I
was so excited for Buffalo and our players and the whole deal, but a big part
of me was obviously upset and disappointed for him.  
  
 Q. We spoke briefly a couple days ago about your message to the team,
what have you told them over the last couple of days in preparation for
tomorrow's game?  
COACH HURLEY: Just to try and stay focused on not listening to what people are
saying and who is projecting what to happen in the game and just stay
consistent to our message and what we're talking about. I also want them to
have fun with this. I mean, they put in so much work to get to this point and
this is a once-in-a-lifetime experience. And to soak it in and have as much
fun with it as possible. But be able to flip the switch when it's time to
work, to work when it's time to work, when it's time to prepare, we're
preparing and when the ball goes up, we've got to play fearlessly like we have
the last month of the season.  
  
 Q. Just a quick question, first of all, Justin Moss, what's his
availability?  
COACH HURLEY: We've been fortunate this week. Last week we were under the gun
with Justin, and he was somewhat limited in our semifinal game, and he made a
big improvement in the final and we were able to play him more minutes. He got
a double-double in that game. We monitored him very carefully this year. We
managed his repetitions carefully. He's getting close to 100 percent. And
he'll obviously be out on the floor today and in our open practice. And I
would think by tomorrow that he's going to be very close to being himself.  
  
 Q. You played a couple of heavyweights in Kentucky and Wisconsin. Can
you compare and contrast the task you've got at hand now with what you faced
with those two?  
COACH HURLEY: West Virginia is going to present every bit the same challenge
that those two teams presented. They're different, but they do certain things
well that above anyone else in the country, turning teams over, offensive
rebounding. Their physicality and their depth. And the other thing is they
take you out of offense. They don't really always let you run your offense
because of how aggressively they trap. So we practice a number of different
things this week just to try and prepare for that. But they're that type of
physical team like Kentucky was, like Wisconsin was, and they're obviously one
of the best teams in the country.  
  
 Q. In terms of the way the game has evolved since you played it, is
there any more premium on guard play than there was back in the '90s and if so
what's the biggest difference in terms of in the tournament?  
COACH HURLEY: I don't think a whole lot has changed in that regard. It's
always key when your season's on the line to have the right guys making
decisions for you and making plays for you to extend your season. As a coach,
you go into a game where everything's on the line and if you have players that
you trust at those positions with the ball in their hands creating and making
plays, then you're going to have a good chance to win and advance. I feel
great about our guard play, even though we're really young starting a
freshman, Lamonte Bearden, and Shannon Evans, a sophomore, those two have been
through the wars in our league and are both very productive. Shannon is a
dynamic guard that can score and plays with great energy. I mean, I could
never play at the pace and the energy that that kid plays at. It's amazing.
And then Lamonte for a freshman has such a good assist-to-turnover ratio and
has great instincts. He's a natural. So I'm trusting those two guys tomorrow
against West Virginia.  
  
 Q. The fact that you were ahead of Kentucky and Wisconsin at the half,
what do you take from that? How much confidence does it give you especially
being a first-time team here?  
COACH HURLEY: Last year we lost three starters. We lost the player of the year
in the conference. It was natural to assume that we would take a step back,
even in our league. And in individual workouts I kept watching Justin Moss
just destroy people in the gym. And then seeing what Shannon Evans, knowing he
was going to be in a starting role this year, I knew he would take a big jump.
So even though the perception outside of our program was that we were going to
take a step back, I didn't think we necessarily would. And those games
validated that for me, just being in those type of games I think prepared us
to know that we could be such a good team. And as a coaching staff, I said now
like you showed us what you're capable of doing here, so maybe you shouldn't
have done that because now we're going to ask for it and we're going to demand
it the rest of the way. And I think those kind of games help you for when
we're playing in our conference tournament and the championship game and in
this type of game to know that we're capable of playing with those kinds of
teams.  
  
 Q. When you got the technical 55 seconds into the game you went on
Twitter and made fun of yourself for it. But in general, that fire you bring,
have you had to check that or manage that at all?  
COACH HURLEY: I kind of toe the line. And last year it was just trying to
figure out what I could get away with and what I can't. I think this year I've
done a better job of getting my message across and then knowing when to pull
back. And this is really not the setting in this tournament, where that's
something that I'm going to be able to do, spend a lot of time with the
officials. I know with how hard this game is going to be and how West Virginia
is going to be coming after our players that I'm going to need to be
completely focused on them and helping them get through this game in any way I
can.  
  
 Q. A lot's made of the 5 versus 12 matchup. What's your take on why the
5 is so vulnerable and why the 12 has historically had success against the
5?  
COACH HURLEY: I have no idea. I mean, I keep seeing the stuff. And I have to
keep reminding our players, hey, you guys are not favored here. West Virginia
is from the Big 12, had a great season. They're the 5 seed, you're the 12. And
you have a lot of people that think that we should win this game or have
selected us. And that's great. I tell our guys, if someone picks against you,
use it as motivation. If someone picks you, don't listen to them and just stay
focused on what we're doing.  
  
 Q. Did you practice with seven guys on defense at all this week? And
then, West Virginia's traps and watching it on film, are they more different
kinds of traps than any other team you've seen?  
COACH HURLEY: Yes. We did practice with multiple defenders. And usually we
have a guy sitting out and we have another walk-on that doesn't travel. So as
a matter of fact I was one of the defenders this morning. So we've been doing
this a lot to try and assimilate what it's going to be like. And we've talked
to our players about being real physical on defense, even fouling so that we
get used to the aggressive style of defense that we're going to face. And then
the traps come in a variety of different ways. They could come in the back
court. They could come as soon as the ball is entered. And actually before all
that even happens, getting the ball in is an adventure against West Virginia
because of how good they try and deny passes. And then also they'll trap as
you cross half court. So it's very random and it's very unpredictable and hard
and those are typically the pressure defenses that are the most effective.  
  
 Q. Coaching in your first NCAA Tournament game feel anything like
playing in your first NCAA Tournament game, and what are you doing to prepare
for that moment tomorrow?  
COACH HURLEY: Yeah, for me it was just trying to even bring myself back from
the euphoria and how great I felt for our players Saturday night and for the
school and the community and then just the responsibility of all the media and
to make sure that we take advantage as a school of all the exposure we can.
And it's all positive. So we want to get our message out about what our
program's all about. And we have a lot of good young players in the program.
So we want to do that. So for me just managing my time. I mean, I've been
really, really scheduled out the last couple of days. But find enough time to
do what I need to do to prepare and get myself ready to coach the best game I
could coach on Friday.  
  
 Q. You mentioned Moss. If you go back to the Kentucky game, when Moss
threw it in Cauley-Stein's face. Do you think that had any trickle-down
effects confidence wise, toughness-wise?  
COACH HURLEY: I just think that was a signature play for us this year and
something that I tried to get a picture of it and I can't anywhere because I
wanted to put it on the wall. We just redid our locker room. No one could find
the picture. I'm amazed that UK, we just couldn't get it. But I think it shows
that our players don't back down. They don't get intimidated. And that's
showing me a lot how we played in that game, because they were playing like
out of their mind at that point, they were annihilating teams. So that was the
first time that someone stepped to them like that and part of it was Justin. I
think we all feed off each other. Shannon Evans, his energy, and Lamonte
Bearden. The guys get excited for what we're doing out there on the floor.  
  
 Q. When your playing career ended you got away from the game a while.
Did you need that? And what got you back into the game, what got you back into
coaching? And the second question, your players have described you as intense,
and I'm wondering, do you see yourself as an intense coach? Do you think
you're more intense as a coach than you were as a player?  
COACH HURLEY: Well, when my pro career ended, I was frustrated. A little bit
burnt out. My dad was a coach. I grew up with the game. I worked as hard as I
could work to get where I had gotten playing and it just didn't work out for
me professionally. I didn't achieve anything close to what I intended on and
was very frustrated. I had a lot of injuries and things. So I wanted to do
something different. I did that. I always had the itch to coach and I
understood the commitment and what it takes to coach and the time you need to
invest. And I was enjoying watching my children grow up and that was a part of
it. But then I knew I got to a point where I was either going to do it or not
do it. And it all fell into place with how my brother was in a transition and
I trusted him going into a great situation with him. I knew we would do a
great job together. So it all worked out. And I wish I had done it sooner
because I love doing it. The time you spend in the gym with the guys, the same
competitiveness I brought to the floor as a player, I think I bring as a
coach. So it replaces it. And also you feel like you're helping kids. And
tournaments like this, days like this, it's worth it, because my players are
experiencing what they're experiencing.  
  
 Q. Rodell's given you good minutes for you off the bench, especially
defensively. With this eight game win streak he seems to have stepped it up on
both wins, scoring more, he's getting more rebounds, 60 percent from the
field. What has he given you that maybe he didn't give you or what you didn't
have earlier in the year?  
COACH HURLEY: I think sometimes with kids, they just start to get it. Rodell
has gotten it. He isn't identifying himself as being a scorer. Scoring just
happens naturally as a part of the game as it's flown with him. But at some
points early in the year you might look at his stat line and see that he had
two points or four points and that would bother him. And I think we broke
through and he's broken through to just say you know what, I'm going to guard,
I'm going to play with great energy. I'm going to rebound and during the
course of the game he's going to put up his numbers that he puts up. He's been
a difference-maker, because we didn't have anyone like him last year on our
team. And being 6'5", 215, very physical, and playing way above the rim, he
adds a different dimension on our team.  
  
 Q. When a player of your caliber played on this kind of stage and yet
you know one bad night sends you home, how do the great players rise to the
occasion, what was in you and guys you played with that enabled you to succeed
at this level and this one-and-done situation?  
COACH HURLEY: I just said to myself, I'm not going to let my teammates down
and I obviously wasn't perfect. And I had my games to -- my freshman year in
the championship game, I was brutal in that one. So I wasn't always perfect.
But you played with teammates that you trusted would be playing at a high
level with you. And that gave you confidence to play better. So Laettner, I
knew he would be there, and knew Grant Hill would be showing up and these guys
would be there with me and it makes my job easier to have the confidence in my
teammates going into games like this.  
  
 Q. UB's style of play, it's up-tempo and it reminds me I guess of
watching the Duke teams play. Do you see any of those similarities and how is
it similar or different?  
COACH HURLEY: Coach K impacted my coaching philosophy in that regard. He
demanded we play defense at the highest level and get after it. If you didn't,
then you weren't playing. But on the flipside it enabled us to create
turnovers, get out in the open court and play an exciting style. And I enjoyed
it as a player. I know my players like getting up and down the court. And
we're in the top, I guess, 25 nationally in pace of play. And at the same time
our guys have taken care of the ball, and we're turning the ball over at a
good clip, considering we play as fast as we do. I feel good about how we
play. I know that as we recruit and we try and bring players into the program,
they want to play in an open game, in a game that resembles what it's going to
be like professionally for some of them down the road if they work and get to
that point.  
  
 Q. You talk about Kentucky, one of your players said it was like
playing in Space Jam and said it would take luck. Having been in a situation
like that, playing UNLV in '91? What will it take for a team to beat Kentucky
this year?  
COACH HURLEY: It's scary when you see it on film. And we broke it down and we
had their complete attention after like the first 30 seconds of the video. And
it's just dunks and their athleticism, their length, if you allow them to set
their defense against you the whole game, then you're in big trouble because
there's nowhere to go in the court with their size and mobility. They're going
to have to not shoot well. You're going to have to take care of the ball and
not let them go on the runs that they go on during the course of the game. And
then you're just going to hope that they're not having their best game. And
you could put what we did against UNLV, I think, was we made a statement early
in the game. We jumped them like 14-4 in the first four minutes and we said,
hey, we're here to play. And we kept it a very tight game throughout. And then
at the very end we made it a one-possession game where they started feeling
the pressure of the undefeated season and we were able to make enough plays at
the end to win it.  
  
 Q. [Indiscernible] for the program how much of a bump do you see in
recruiting, particularly in New York state?  
COACH HURLEY: It's exciting. We have some exciting kids coming in that will
join our program that I think are going to even take it to another level and
this is a platform to really start getting your brand out and for recruits to
see your team play and how you play. And so it's important. It's not like
right in the forefront of my mind right now because I'm kind of in the moment
of coaching this game but it's definitely something that's going to help our
situation long term.  
  
 Q. Are any of your family members coming tomorrow, your dad, your mom,
your brother, anybody coming?  
COACH HURLEY: My brother advanced in the NIT, beat Iona the other night. So
they'll be traveling to Stanford. So he won't be able to be there. But my mom
and dad are going to be making the trip in for the game.  
  
 Q. I saw you had a ring on, I think it might be from your first
championship. I was curious why you had it on, do you wear it all the time and
why so?  
COACH HURLEY: I really didn't wear it last year my first year at all when I
coached. When we went to Kentucky before that game I said, I think I need
something extra here for my confidence to go into that place. And so I put it
on as a subtle reminder of like what I used to be capable of doing to try and
build my confidence and boost it as much as I could for my team. And then when
we played well there, I said, all right, let's stick with it. And since then
I've worn it for every game and every road trip. I just want the kids to keep
seeing it, too. We're getting rings, too, and our athletic director, Danny
White, is in the back there they now want rings that are sort of like this
with the diamonds and the way -- so that's what you have to look forward to
because they've seen this now. This is our repeat, the year we repeated it's a
combination of both years, yeah, for both years.  
  
 Q. A lot of coaches that come up and come through this platform in the
MAC have said a lot of the pressure, particularly people like you that have
played in bigger colleges said the pressure is so much different at this level
to get here than it is at Duke or wherever. Wanted to get your reaction to
that. Is that true? Maybe not pressure but just a different level. And what do
you go through?  
COACH HURLEY: It's fair. Our league is so under rated. The MAC was rated
number 10 in the RPI, ahead of some other multi-bid leagues this year, so that
just tells you the quality of the competition in our league. But it really
came down to, for us, knowing that we would have had a very difficult chance
getting an at-large. We knew and felt the pressure. I felt the pressure. I
tried to shield our players from feeling that as much as possible. But knowing
that, I think it prepares you in a way for this moment because we've already
been in that position. Some of the other high major schools have built their
resumé and even though they're going to play their conference tournament that
hard, they already know they're in the field. We weren't sure about that. And
we attacked our conference tournament like that was our chance to play in the
tournament.  
  
 Q. With regard to tempo on offense, that's when you're going at your
best, West Virginia's defense at its best really speeds teams up. What are the
ways you stay in character for you guys on offense and not slow down but also
not facilitate them?  
COACH HURLEY: I mean, they're so good and physical and they're pressing, and
so taking care of it, and then just having five guys on the same page, because
as much as I'll say, it's Shannon Evans and Lamonte Bearden's responsibility
to handle pressure. Those two guys can't beat it alone. We all have to be
ready to help and move the ball quick. At times we'll have to try to beat it
to score and if they get back properly then we're going to have to pull it out
and run some clock and we'll do a variety of things to try and handle it. But
this game comes down to more of me trusting my guys that they're going to be
able to improvise and make some plays, because we run a lot of set plays and I
just have a really strong feeling we're not going to be allowed to run a lot
of them and that's based on the film that I'm watching and seeing how West
Virginia has played a lot of other really good teams this year.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [NCAA MEN'S 2ND & 3RD ROUNDS:
COLUMBUS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+2ND+%26+3RD+ROUNDS%3A+COLUMBUS)

  

## March 19, 2015

  

### [Homer Drew](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28720)

### [Vashil Fernandez](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28719)

### [Alec Peters](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28718)

  
_COLUMBUS, OHIO_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Valparaiso.  
  
 Q. Do you see an advantage inside against Maryland the way you rebound
the ball?  
ALEC PETERS: We try to use our size to the best of our ability every game we
play and outrebounding our opponent is definitely a focal point of everything
we try to do throughout the game. We do have great size and great length, and
we've got to continue to use that to our advantage especially in this game.  
  
VASHIL FERNANDEZ: Just like Alec said, we try to use the advantage we have.
And one of the things that we are challenged every game to do is try to
outrebound our opponents and we try to go out there, do it every day.  
  
 Q. Alec, Jake Layman talked yesterday about possible matchup with you.
Do you have thoughts on him and what he does well and possibly matching up
with him tomorrow?  
ALEC PETERS: He's a good player. He's very athletic, very good shooting
basketball, he can take it to the hole. He can do a little bit of everything.
He'll be tough for anybody who guards him on our team. As far as it being a
little bit of a matchup, he is a great player, like I said, and if it comes
down to it and I have to guard him, I'll do my best to stop him and hopefully
he misses shots.  
  
 Q. Vashil, what's different this time around for you here at this
tournament?  
VASHIL FERNANDEZ: I would say I have a lot more experience being a senior now,
I've been through a lot of different, with a lot of different teams and been
playing a lot, just getting better each year.  
  
 Q. A lot of times in the matchups like this, you have a power-
conference team against a team from a mid-major, there's a size advantage for
the power-conference team. With you guys, that's not really the case, you're a
really good rebounding team. Do you think you can be as good of a rebounding
team against Maryland as you were during the regular season?  
ALEC PETERS: Yeah, I do. I think that our length and our size and our strength
that we have on our team is really beneficial. It doesn't matter who we play.
It's going to come out and we're going to showcase that to the best of our
ability.  
  
 Q. Vashil, can you talk about the pressure their guards are going to
put on your team and when they get past your guards, how much pressure does
that put on you?  
VASHIL FERNANDEZ: I don't think it will be that much of a pressure because our
coaching staff has been working with us all week, helping us learn how to
guard their plays and stuff like that. I think that's helped us to be a better
all-around team.  
  
 Q. What do you see from their guards, the way they penetrate, both Dez
and Melo?  
VASHIL FERNANDEZ: I think that they try to go hard to the hole and try to get
fouls and stuff like that. And I think what we've done so far has helped us to
be able to combat that as a team overall.  
  
 Q. Alec, this is obviously a big stage. What do you guys need to do to
minimize the distractions and everything that comes with this stage?  
ALEC PETERS: We have to have our daily routine, stay the same, whether it's
just a normal road game or being at home. We'll eat pregame meal the same time
before game that we usually do and wake up usually the same time, and go
through our meetings, and do everything like that. And just try to keep
everything as routine as possible.  
  
 Q. A lot of mid-major teams use Coach Drew's shot as motivation when
they're coming into a tournament like this. How many times have you guys seen
that shot, and can he use that? Because you know Coach Drew so well, Valpo
history, can he use that, hey, this is what's possible if you do what needs to
be done?  
ALEC PETERS: Everybody on our team has seen it multiple times. It's hard to
count how many times we've seen it. It's on pictures throughout our campus.
And it's very memorable when you think of our school. And I don't think he has
to preach on what kind of moment he had in that situation and how we can
achieve the same thing. I think the biggest thing that we have to go through
thinking is that we want to create our own moment. We want to have something
like that that we can remember just like he did with that shot.  
  
VASHIL FERNANDEZ: It's pretty much like Alec said. We want to create our own
moment just like Coach Bryce did.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.  
  
 Q. In terms of what you've been able to practice, how hard is it to
replicate a Dez Wells and Melo Trimble with your scout team?  
COACH DREW: It's definitely difficult. We've had a lot of injuries this year.
To be honest, we haven't done a lot of practicing and practiced live stuff.
This team has been very good at watching film and going through walk-throughs
and taking over to the court. So obviously we try to be those guys in
practice, we're not going to do it. We've watched a lot of film and tried to
get a game plan from that the best we can.  
  
 Q. Bobby Hurley was in here saying he had to practice with his team.
Did you have to get on the court?  
COACH DREW: Bobby is probably in a little better shape than me, a little
faster. So he could help them get better. I think I'd bring our level down so
I stay away from that stuff.  
  
 Q. You talk about, first of all, for those who haven't really followed
your team very closely, you talk about how you had several injuries this year.
If maybe you can give us a little detail on that. And then you're pretty big
up front. That's not always the case when you have a mid-major against one of
the power conferences. How did that sort of even up the playing field, so to
speak?  
COACH DREW: With the injuries, I think Dayton and us, I can't think of any
other programs that have had the adversity that we've had in this season. We
lost our returning starting point guard in August to an ACL. And then 13-2
going into league. And second league game, our point guard who was our leading
scorer in league up to that point, was out for over a month with a toe injury.
So we ended up playing a 6'8" point guard who had double hip surgery in the
offseason, the Alex Rodriguez hip surgery, major hip surgery. Didn't know if
he would play this year. And he stepped in and played point guard. And
conference tournament came, our starting 2 guard was injured, couldn't play in
the championship game. It's been a great blessing, all what God's done with
our team fighting adversity and different guys stepping up at key times. As
far as the height, at certain points we'll have four guys 6'7" or bigger on
the floor, so we have a lot of interchangeable parts. So there's not really
one or two guys that's dominant, but collectively we try to rebound with our
height as a team and try to use our length the best we can.  
  
 Q. Coach Hurley was in here, obviously went to a couple of Final Fours,
won some national championships. You've played in the NCAA Tournament. Do you
think coaches that have been through this, what do you guys share with your
players about your March Madness experience and does it help at all?  
COACH DREW: I think every team is different. Some teams might need more prep
or need to hear things. Other teams are very focused and ready to go. As far
as this team, you know, we're the least experienced team in our conference
this year, but yet they've played with a lot of maturity especially in big
games. And so I just kind of get out of the way and let them do their thing
because they played so well in big games this year so far.  
  
 Q. With the amount of turnovers with injuries and everything, dealing
with that, what is it about your defensive scheme that has made you guys able
to get the consistent results throughout the season?  
COACH DREW: I think everybody is bought in. We have five guys on the floor
that all work together. We don't have just one dominant guy. But collectively
we all work together within our schemes. And I think the guys really take game
plans and they execute. They're the ones on the court that are getting it
done. The anchor of our defense is Vashil Fernandez. He's our single season
block shot leader and he does a great job at altering shots when we do get
beat on the perimeter.  
  
 Q. I'll break out the traditional story line with you, but do you guys
still practice that play that you ran for the shot?  
COACH DREW: You know, I will say it's not in our recruiting presentation. It's
not in our playbook. But it's definitely something we could draw up if we
needed to in the last seconds.  
  
 Q. Have you ever seen just through the years your teams just trying to
mimic it, see if they could pull it off. They sat in here, said they couldn't
avoid it if they tried. It's all over campus. Have you seen them try to do
that on the court?  
COACH DREW: I have not. But I'm sure when the coach isn't looking, a lot of
things go on behind your back, in a funny way. So they may have done it but
nothing really in front of me.  
  
 Q. A lot of amateur coaches have run that in the last -- does dad ever
take credit for that, say it's the greatest play ever?  
COACH DREW: No, because we got it from the Indiana Pacers. I think every good
play you see is borrowed from someone else. That's where we got it. The play
was actually called Pacer because that's where we got it. But I will get an
e-mail or a phone call or something every year or so a couple times saying
this high school team ran it or this person ran it and they won the game. So
it's neat to have people share their stories.

### [LaDontae Henton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26672)

  
_COLUMBUS, OHIO_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Kris Dunn, LaDontae Henton, Tyler Harris and
Carson Desrosiers.  
  
 Q. LaDontae, this is probably an interesting matchup for you
considering that you had signed with Dayton. Could you talk about obviously
you changed your mind after they changed coaches. Talk about that decision and
just the matchup with them.  
LADONTAE HENTON: I'm a firm believer in everything happens for a reason. Coach
Gregory left Dayton. And I opened it back up. And Providence came calling me.
It's been a right fit ever since I came here. And I think it's one of the best
decisions I made in my life to come to Providence College, and everything is
working out for the best.  
  
 Q. You guys had a tough loss last year to Carolina, terrific game. I'm
sure you're aware of the results today. You see Iowa State go down. You see
Baylor go down. Notre Dame barely gets by Northeastern. Particularly as a
senior, how is this tournament, how is this kind of game different for you?
This really is the one-and-done. How does that affect you as a player and what
will you say to your teammates?  
LADONTAE HENTON: Last year was a great experience for us. I understand that
you can't take anybody lightly. Anybody can beat anybody on a given night. The
younger guys just gotta be prepared mentally, and you just gotta experience it
and have fun with it and make the most out of the opportunity.  
  
 Q. Kris, watching the tournament last year, unable to play, what can
you take from that experience that you think will help you going into this
year's tournament?  
KRIS DUNN: Last year was just a blessing for me to be on the sideline actually
seeing my team achieve something. So special getting back to the tournament.
Just watching them play and work hard out there was just motivating and
inspiring for me this year, and I just took a lot from it and just hoping that
we can go out and make a run this year.  
  
 Q. Carson, I'm curious what you guys did last night during the game and
your reaction to playing Dayton?  
CARSON DESROSIERS: We watched it as a team together in our film room at the
hotel. And it was a pretty good game. Both teams were definitely -- definitely
belong in the tournament and we were watching with an open mind. We already
scouted a little bit of each team the previous two days. Now we're looking
forward to playing Dayton tomorrow.  
  
 Q. Kris, do you approach this game, do you try to teach it really as
just another game or do you realize the stage that you're on and the
importance of this game and because of that how are you personally going to
approach it?  
KRIS DUNN: We're just going to try to approach it as another game. I mean the
atmosphere is definitely going to be exciting. Dayton's going to have a lot of
fans and it's a big stage but right now we're just focused on how we're going
to win the game and I think all of us have a great mindset going in, that
we're just going to try to work as hard as we can.  
  
 Q. Tyler, what are your memories of the last ten minutes of last year's
game against North Carolina where you guys had a lead, lost a lead, had a
chance. It was really a great back and forth game.  
TYLER HARRIS: Yeah, it was definitely an intense game. We was going back with
North Carolina up and down. And I mainly remember is us losing that last
rebound at the end and that's something you have to have urgency on,
especially in these type of games that we play. So it all comes down to our
urgency.  
  
 Q. LaDontae, what have you and Kris done leadership-wise to try to get
the team to this point?  
LADONTAE HENTON: Just trying to lead by example and tell the young guys what
it takes to win at a high level. Guys on this table is experienced and they've
been at this level before. So just the experience in being able to mentor the
younger guys and tell them what it takes is big for us. And the young guys
that are coming along helping us out a lot.  
  
 Q. (Off microphone)?  
LADONTAE HENTON: He's one of our energy guys. He's very vocal. We feed off of
him and as he plays great we play great as a team. He's our point guard, our
floor general and he's the motor to the team.  
  
 Q. Guys, you've been called, LaDontae and Kris Batman and Robin. If
you're Batman and Robin what are Tyler and Carson?  
LADONTAE HENTON: I don't think we're Batman and Robin. We're just two players
that want to win just like the guys next to us. We're all leaders on the team
and we mean everything to the team. Everybody on the team mean something. It's
not really Batman and Robin.  
  
KRIS DUNN: Like LaDontae said, there's no Batman and Robin. Everybody has a
role on the team, specific role. Everybody help out. And right now we're
playing good basketball and hopefully we can just keep it going.  
  
 Q. LaDontae, is there any concern on your part, is there a danger to
try to do too much? Obviously you're a team leader. You're a senior. It's
going to be the biggest game you're going to play this year in tomorrow night.
Do you have to guard against that to try to keep your emotions down a little
bit?  
LADONTAE HENTON: I've been here before. If it was my first time maybe it would
be a little tougher. But I know I've been here before and I know what it takes
so just having that experience under my belt will help me out a lot. I know
the guys next to me are also helping me out a lot. Everybody wants to play to
win. We have to play with a sense of urgency but we've also got to play smart.  
  
 Q. Given that you're playing a team that's just a little ways down the
road, is there any fear of the crowd being slanted in the other direction and
maybe kind of feeling like it's a road game tomorrow?  
LADONTAE HENTON: It's not really a fear. I mean we have played a lot of road
games during the year. So if it is a lot of Dayton fans so be it. We have to
play through adversity like we have all year.  
  
 Q. Do you think it's fair that -- obviously you guys are the higher
seed and the lower seed is from an hour away. Do you think -- I know it didn't
have anything to do with it -- but do you think it's fair, if anybody wants to
answer that, kind of the way it's played out?  
TYLER HARRIS: I think it's just it is what it is. You've still got to go out
there and play the game and compete. So we've got to be aware that it is
somewhat of a home game to them. But at the end of the day we've just got to
go out there and play our game.  
  
 Q. Carson, do you think there's any advantages or disadvantage that
Dayton has played a game already, they're kind of already in tournament mode,
how do you kind of see that?  
CARSON DESROSIERS: I think we've gone through this season. I can think back to
finals week in early December. The Big East gives us a break at some point in
the middle of our Big East schedule as well. So we've come off breaks like
this. We just played on Friday and we've prepared well. We've practiced pretty
hard. So it's not like we've been kind of out of it. We've been practicing
really hard and I think our practices are harder than the game. So we'll be
ready.  
  
 Q. Carson, obviously you wanted to repeat as Big East Tournament
champions. But looking back on it, does the tough loss to Villanova,
especially the way it ended, in some ways prepare you for the idea that
starting tomorrow it can end that fast?  
CARSON DESROSIERS: Yeah, I think you want to come into the NCAA Tournament
ideally without a loss, on a win streak, which is what we did last year. But
we're playing pretty good basketball right now regardless of the outcome of
Friday's game. So we all know that. And we have the opportunity to start a
winning streak, and that's what we want to do.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Coach, a brief comment about being in Columbus.  
  
COACH COOLEY: Well, first of all, I want to thank the President of the United
States for taking the time to do a bracket for college basketball. I really
do. To have the Commander-in-Chief have so much admiration for college
basketball definitely tells you how valuable our sport is to our society. So
Barack, Mr. President, thank you. We're really excited to be here. Our
players, our administrators, this is a dream come true for us. It's a great
opportunity and we're humbled and we're excited to compete.  
  
 Q. Would you say that the president knows more about foreign affairs or
college basketball?  
COACH COOLEY: I think he knows a lot about what he knows.  
  
 Q. Particularly having been through it last year with North Carolina,
which was also your first NCAA Tournament game as a head coach, will you
approach it any differently? Will you prepare your kids not so much the Xs and
Os as mentally any differently because of what this tournament is?  
COACH COOLEY: Great question. Last year, again, being the first time here, a
little nervous. Not that I'm not nervous now because I think we're getting
ready to play a great team. It's just a little different. You're feeling --
our veteran players in particular, Carson, LaDontae and Tyler -- have a
different aura about them that I like. When you play in this tournament here,
it's more about emotion, passion and energy. The Xs and Os, you gotta call a
couple of good plays but it's going to be about who brings it, who has great
effort. Some 50/50 balls, can we get to those. It's not so much Xs and Os as
it is determination and grit.  
  
 Q. Are you at all frustrated by the fact that you -- obviously
mentioned Dayton's a quality team -- I know you have to play them, they're 75
miles from their home arena.  
COACH COOLEY: Not frustrated at all. We're actually excited about it. I think
the NCAA does the best job of all the tournaments. And that's just the way it
shook out. If we're worried about what Dayton's doing, we're not concentrating
on what Providence is doing. Providence College is here to compete. We're here
to compete the best we can, and not so much worry about the crowd. If we do
what we're supposed to do and we play as a group, we share, we care, we love,
we are going to find ourselves in a great situation. So I'm not worried about
that at all.  
  
 Q. You talked yesterday about how there might be a little bit of
anxiety not knowing exactly who you're going to play. Do you think that there
was a benefit to that, though, that you get to maybe focus a little bit more
internally on what you guys need to do to get a win?  
COACH COOLEY: That was something that I've never gone through as an assistant
coach or head coach, being in that, you know, you're trying to prepare for two
teams over three days. And so what it did allow us to do is to concentrate on
us. And at the end of the day that's what it's really about. But when we found
out -- we watched the game last night as a team and we did some team scouting.
It was a great game with Boise and Dayton. So our guys were familiar when we
got to the practice court today. But that was a different experience and
something that we'll learn from. And now we know who we're playing. So we're
excited.  
  
 Q. First of all, could you give us an explanation of your hat?  
COACH COOLEY: Well, my wife is a retired police officer. And I love the
police, and I thank them for what they do protecting our freedoms within our
city and our country. So the gentleman who is here with me today, I told him I
wanted to bring that up to honor our police because I think they do a great
job and sometimes they're looked at in the wrong way.  
  
 Q. Secondly, I noticed in your schedule you had some great early season
wins, and then after Kentucky you lost a couple of games to some teams that I
think were not tournament teams, let's put it that way. Do you think there was
a Kentucky hangover, or is that just coincidence that you went into a little
funk after Kentucky?  
COACH COOLEY: I've got a young team. I think what a lot of people don't
understand is we only had three players on our roster that actually played in
a game here in the NCAA Tournament last year. I don't know if it was a
hangover, yet we were still growing. I think we became a better team because
of those games, and I just shared in the locker room with our team: Enjoy this
moment. This is a great moment. Don't take it for granted. Let's have fun.
Let's do the best we can. But we didn't have a Kentucky hangover. Hey, first
of all, a lot of people are going to have hangovers when they play Kentucky.
And we just -- we played on the road up at Boston College, and I think a lot
of teams that are in this tournament had bad games against opponents, but
don't take anything away from Boston College or Brown or Kentucky, I think
they're good teams.  
  
 Q. You brought this up about Barack Obama, do you know who he picked in
this game, in your game, he picked Dayton?  
COACH COOLEY: That's fine. You know what, I respect our president for what he
does. It's just an opinion you know what I'm saying. You've got to play the
game.  
  
 Q. LaDontae Henton, obviously a key player. He originally signed with
Dayton. Could you explain the process by which you got him?  
COACH COOLEY: Well, I think one of the most undervalued things here at
Providence College has been our staff. I think we have one of the best staffs
in the country. I think our administrators, our support staff, our assistant
coaches have done a great job. And one of our coaches had a relationship once
he opened up his recruitment and allowed us -- he was our first-ever recruit
here. So I'm really -- and he's probably one of the all-time greatest players
to ever come to Providence College. So I'm happy for LaDontae that he's able
to have back-to-back tournament appearances. Hopefully he has saved his best
for last playing in the place that he was originally going to.  
  
 Q. What specific challenges does Dayton present to you and in
particular Jordan Sibert?  
COACH COOLEY: Terrific player. I think Coach Miller has done a great job here.
They have some team toughness. I think less has been more, when you look at --
they know exactly the way they want to play. They're going to spread you out a
little bit and drive it. Everybody talks about our length versus their
undersized. It's not about size or girth in these games, it's about how big is
your heart and how willing are you to give it up for your teammate to move
forward. They've got a lot of things that are going to bother us, but I'm not
going to share that with anybody in here. I'm pretty sure Archie is going to
say the same thing. We have some things they have to address and they have
things that we have to address. At the end of the day it's going to come down
to grit, passion and energy on who's going to moving forward.  
  
 Q. I understand you're obviously very focused on Dayton and your own
game I can't imagine you're not aware that Iowa State lost today, that Baylor
lost today.  
COACH COOLEY: Wow. I didn't know that. That's what the madness is about.  
  
 Q. And Bill Coen, good friend of yours, arguably should have upset
Notre Dame, they had the ball at the end.  
COACH COOLEY: I watched that.  
  
 Q. What do you make of that? They're 14 seeds playing 3 seeds. Two win,
the other one very easily could have won. What do you make of that?  
COACH COOLEY: I think that's what this tournament has always been about. And I
think every single year this tournament gets better and better because of the
parity in college basketball. When you see -- I don't know if it's higher
seed/slower seed, whoever is in the white jersey I guess is the higher seed.
But it goes to tell you how special this tournament is. And if you don't come
to play, you can be the greatest team ever. You've got one game. You've got to
throw out seeds. You've got to throw out uniforms, mascots. You have one game
to perform. If you don't perform on that one game, you're going home. I hope
we're at the party and I hope the Friars are going to dance for a long time.
But we've got to play one game at a time.  
  
 Q. Wanted ask about your freshman, Ben Bentil. He seemed to play a lot
better late in the year, double-doubles in both of the Big East games. So much
of your scoring at least on paper is done by LaDontae and Kris. Having that
third guy, is he sort of becoming that third guy, or what was his development
like as the season went on?  
COACH COOLEY: Ben has always been somebody who is anxious all the time. And
when we decided to bring Tyler Harris off the bench we needed some experience
off the bench because we didn't have any at all. I still think Tyler is our
third option if you want to call it an option. But our third scorer. And Ben
is just emerging in front of ours eyes every single day. And the more he slows
down, the more efficient he's becoming. He's not thinking. He's playing. He's
not trying to have special plays. He's taking shots when he's open because I
think he's a really, really good shooter. But it takes time to develop those
young guys. When you talk about the early losses that we had, that was those
young guys trying to identify roles and where do they fit in and how do they
fit in. And I hope he has a big tournament left in him, because he's getting
better by the second. I'm glad he's a baby. I'm really glad he's a freshman
because I think he's going to do some great things in Friartown.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_COLUMBUS, OHIO_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by West Virginia student-athletes Juwan Staten and
Gary Browne. Questions.  
  
 Q. For both of you, I assume that you've had an opportunity to see
Buffalo, what are your impressions of them, what concerns you the most?  
JUWAN STATEN: Well, they like to play in transition. We do a lot of pressing
and trapping. And we ultimately want to turn teams over. But they get out in
transition and they're heading downhill pretty much every possession. So
that's something we definitely gotta get back out of our press and play good
half court defense.  
  
 Q. Is that something you would like them to do, don't you want to play
the same way they want to play too?  
JUWAN STATEN: Yeah, we want to speed the game up but they excel in transition.
So knowing we want to speed the game up we still have to get back and play
great defense, because they'll always be attacking the rim.  
  
GARY BROWNE: I feel he said exactly what we want them to do. At the same time,
I feel like they're a scrappy team. They're a team that like to iso a lot, and
they also want to run the court. I mean, we want them to play fast, but at the
same time we want to be able to control the game. So we gotta make sure that
don't happen at the game.  
  
 Q. Juwan, how is your health?  
JUWAN STATEN: I've practiced for the last two days with no restrictions and no
limitations. I'm feeling good.  
  
 Q. I was wondering, when Bob talks to you guys to try to prepare you
for moments like the one you're going to face tomorrow, what type of
storyteller is he in terms of going back to some of his experience with other
players and how much do you actually take from those into games and have you
ever really recognized when it's helped?  
JUWAN STATEN: We've been programmed from day one to play a certain way that's
as hard as we can, and that's what we've been doing all year and that's why
we're sitting in the seats we're sitting in now. But he talks to us a lot
about that Final Four team and the things they did to prepare for the
tournament and how they took it one day at a time or one game at a time. So we
kind of want to do the same thing. He tells us a lot about how we need to
prepare for the game and some things that we need to know about Buffalo. So we
just try to pay attention, soak everything in and go out there, play as hard
as we can.  
  
GARY BROWNE: He's definitely got a lot of stories to tell us, him being in the
game for more than 30 years. He tries really hard to fire up before the games,
even in our practice, but he do an amazing job at that. But at the same time
we know how much this means to us. So we are coming to play as hard as we can.  
  
 Q. The fact that Coach Huggins, I think this is his 21st NCAA
appearance, do you guys consider that almost an advantage, just that he's got
so much tournament experience and probably seen it all?  
JUWAN STATEN: Definitely. He's been here like you said 21 times. He knows what
he's talking about. I've personally never been. This is my first time. That's
all I have to go off of. He's a great coach. He prepares us well. As long as
we listen to him, we always seem to be in good position. So that's what we
just want to continue to do.  
  
 Q. Juwan, what do you do when you are in big games to stay in the
moment, to stay composed, not try to let the situation overcome you so you can
play?  
JUWAN STATEN: Well, I've played a lot of basketball up until this point, AAU,
high school. I've played college basketball. So I've had a lot of experience.
I've played overseas. I've done a lot. So I just sort of count on all those
experiences to help me. I just try to tell myself that it may be a big game
but it's just another game. That kind of helps me settle down.  
  
 Q. Juwan, [indiscernible] were you to get a chance to play back in
Ohio, close to home in Dayton. What kind of support from friends and family
support do you expect this week?  
JUWAN STATEN: It's a special feeling just to be playing in my first tournament
game. It's my last season and I get to do it in my home state. So that feels
amazing. I have a lot of family and friends coming. I actually feel kind of
bad because I had to tell some people they had to buy their own tickets. But
it's just a great feeling. And I've definitely been feeling the love from
everybody that I know in Ohio.  
  
 Q. Juwan and Gary, when you originally got hurt it had to go through
your mind that you wouldn't be able to play today or tomorrow. What went
through your mind, what were your emotions at that point?  
GARY BROWNE: Well, it was very sad when we both know that we were hurt and the
kind of injuries we had. But at the same time we both I feel like we both
believe in God and we have faith and we knew that we worked so hard this
summer to end up like that it was not going to happen. So we did our best day-
by-day working with our trainer and getting better and until this day, thank
God, we are able to play. I mean, it's his first time playing, it's going to
be my second time playing. So it's our senior year. We at his place so you
couldn't have asked for anything better than that.  
  
JUWAN STATEN: Gary said it best. First the news was kind of devastating
because this is exactly what you want to come back to school for. But like he
said, we both have faith in God and talking with my parents a lot and just
keeping the faith, just knowing that he wouldn't have brought us this far to
forsake us. So just staying strong to my belief and doing everything they
asked me to do in the training room. And I'm just glad and blessed to be able
to play.  
  
 Q. I guess this is a question for both of you guys, but Gary, it's been
much discussed that you're the only player on the team that's had experience
in this tournament. How much do you relay your experience to the rest of the
guys. And Juwan how much do you talk to him about what this tournament's
like?  
GARY BROWNE: The guys laugh because we talk about it every time, all they know
is about winning, us going on a tough play and win games and being able to win
games most of the time. But I mean me and him have been through a lot. We
didn't get a lot of wins. So my freshman year at first I thought I was happy
to make it. And I had two seniors, Kevin Jones and Chuck Bryant, and they were
pissed that we lost the first round, but I was happy that I made it because it
was the biggest accomplishment because I was just a freshman, because I
thought we were going to make it the next three years. But look at now. We
didn't make it the last two years but we finally made it, but at the same time
it's been a lot. But I try to make sure to tell the guys that do something you
want to enjoy but at the same time you want to take advantage of it because
you don't know when is the next time you're going to be here.  
  
 Q. How do you feel? Are you both 100 percent? Where are you at in that
regard? And second, I'm wondering about the run-up to this game seems like
it's been all Buffalo, everybody's talking about Buffalo and Hurley and the
president picks Buffalo. I'm wondering has Coach Huggins challenged you guys
and what's it like in the locker room in that regard?  
GARY BROWNE: We don't really pay attention to what other people say, because
if we were to pay attention to that from the very beginning of the season we
would not be here right now because all the expectations from the beginning of
the season wasn't positive. So right now we have a small circle. We have our
teammates. We have our coaching staff. We have our state. We don't really care
what other people say. But at the same time it fires us up a little bit. But
until this day, if we wasn't that good we would not have made it this far so
far. So we don't pay attention to what all the people say.  
  
JUWAN STATEN: I honestly like playing the underdog role. I feel like we've
been in this position before. And it kind of keeps us going. When people pick
against us, it gives us that extra feel. And honestly I don't know how we
would play if we were always favored to win. I think that's a big thing that
drives us. Everybody on our team, I feel like it's been slighted in some way
in their career. I feel like they deserved more in some way. So this whole
season has just been about proving people wrong, and I think we done a good
job up until now and I think we'll keep doing a good job of that.  
  
 Q. How are you feeling?  
JUWAN STATEN: I'm feeling great. If I wasn't feeling good I wouldn't be
playing.  
  
 Q. What's the biggest difference in the personality of this team from
this year compared to the last two years when you guys weren't able to get to
the NCAA Tournament, weren't able to get over the hump here?  
JUWAN STATEN: Personality of the team. I think last year as a team we were
kind of divided, kind of had different little groups that hung out. But from
day one, with this team, everybody's been together. We've done team events.
We've been together a lot. Everybody hangs out. Everybody gets along with
everybody and sometimes it's to a fault. In practice talking too much or
laughing too much and we get in trouble by our coaches. But ultimately that's
what brings us together as a team. And that's been a big part about how we've
been able to come so far.  
  
 Q. Just for both of you guys, I was wondering when you guys were out,
did you see anything in your teammates' games that you didn't know what was
there that kind of you saw from afar having watched it?  
JUWAN STATEN: Yeah, definitely seen a lot especially from our freshmen with
Dax and Jevon. They stepped up big time in the games we weren't playing
because they had to handle the ball most of the time. They definitely showed
that they could score a lot, that they're mature freshmen, not your everyday
freshmen. It's something that's going to be big for us if we want to make a
run in this tournament. It was good to see all the pieces come together,
without me and Gary. So when we're back in the lineup and playing everything
can come together and we can make a special run.  
  
GARY BROWNE: I agree with what he said. I mean, you couldn't ask for better
freshmen than we have. So they've been doing an amazing jobs, and I feel like
the coaches and ourselves have been helping them a lot because we know that at
some point in the season something like that could happen and it did happen.
They handled it way good.  
  
 Q. Gary, you were saying on Selection Sunday it was special because
earlier in the season a lot of guys on the team were able to go back to Puerto
Rico see where you're from and back in Ohio where a lot of these guys are
from. How cool is that to be around this part of the state and to see the
looks on these guys' faces when they're back home?  
GARY BROWNE: I feel, to be honest, with you to be more happy for him he's a
senior never been in a NCAA Tournament and for him to go back now to his
hometown and play his first game of the NCAA here in front of his family and
friends and everybody, it's very special. When you're a senior, you want to go
out with all the great memories you possibly can get and I had mine in Puerto
Rico. Now he's going to have his in his hometown. So I feel very happy that
we're here. Now we've gotta do the same thing we did in Puerto Rico, do it
over here.  
  
JUWAN STATEN: It's like he said, it's a special feeling. I saw how happy Gary
was in Puerto Rico. Family, people that haven't got to see you play since you
were a little kid. And now at the end of your career, end of your collegiate
career they get to see you again. That's the biggest feeling. I have a lot of
people -- my grandmother she doesn't really travel at all. But she's going to
be here to watch me play. And that's something that's special to me. Just want
to take advantage of it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
 Q. Just wondered, you had Juwan and Gary up there. Wondering how
they've been at practice. Do you think they're both 100 percent?  
COACH HUGGINS: Juwan has been terrific. Gary's been good. Probably not as
bouncy as what Juwan's been, but they're both good. They're both going to go.  
  
 Q. Wonder from what you've seen on video, what concerns you the most
about Buffalo and their style of play? Does it coincide with what you would
like to do in a lot of ways?  
COACH HUGGINS: I think the biggest thing is they really try to play downhill.
They do a great job of pushing tempo. They do a great job of creating numbers.
But that's kind of what we like to do too. And I think they've taken on
Bobby's personality. I think they're extremely competitive and play extremely
hard.  
  
 Q. I know it's been a lifetime ago, but do you remember anything about
your first NCAA appearance, or were you just kind of swept up in the madness
of it all?  
COACH HUGGINS: Yeah, I remember we lost. What do I remember -- we led at
halftime, I think. We led at halftime and played the best team in the country
at that time, the No. 1 ranked team in the country. And I remember being
incredibly proud of the guys I had. I had a walk-on start at 2 guard and a
football player play center. So I was extremely proud of their effort and what
they did that game.  
  
 Q. A lot of the players for both teams have talked about hearing about
stories and anecdotes about what it's like to play in the tournament. With
your experience, when you had players that haven't had that experience of the
tournament, do those stories really help and when do you notice the experience
sort of kicking in?  
COACH HUGGINS: I don't think it has anything to do with anything. I went to
Cincinnati, they hadn't been in the tournament for a long time. And the first
two years we're in the NIT, and in '92 we go to the Final Four, and '93 we go
to the Elite Eight and lose to Carolina in overtime, who won a national
championship. And those guys hadn't been in an NCAA Tournament. Actually the
majority of those guys were first-year guys. So I really don't think it has a
lot to do with anything. It's just you go play basketball and hopefully you
have a good day and make some shots.  
  
 Q. Wondering about the run-up to this game. It's been much about
Buffalo and Hurley and the president picked Buffalo to beat you guys. And how
much have you used that and challenged the guys?  
COACH HUGGINS: I haven't. I think they're aware of it, obviously. They watch
ESPN. But I haven't said a word about it. I mean, it comes down to, we have to
go do what we're good at doing and try to do what we do better than what they
do at what they do. And all that other stuff it sounds good and it gives you a
column to write, which I know you struggle mightily at times to do. But in
terms of winning and losing the game, I don't think it has much to do with
anything.  
  
 Q. Is the leadership group of this team, at least the guys you count
on, compare favorably to any teams you've couched that have had success in
tournaments in the past?  
COACH HUGGINS: We've had a hard year in some ways. We lose Juwan early and he
misses the first week and a half of practice, and really he and Gary and Devin
Williams are the guys we have back that had some experience. And Gary was
terrific. I can't say enough good things about how good Gary was in terms of
his work ethic, his attitude, the way he tried to get other people to
understand what we did. Devin was the same way with the bigs. I mean, those
guys were terrific. And then we get Wany back and Wany gets sick the first
conference game and we don't have Devin in the Oklahoma game and then Wany
goes down and Gary goes down. And you walk into Lawrence and Allen Fieldhouse
with two freshmen guards and they were fine. I mean, I think it's so much more
about personalities. I mean, the two freshmen we've got don't walk anywhere
without any fear. That never registers with them. They love to play. They love
to play. They love to compete. And I think because of that, we were able to
overcome some things. Somebody said the other day, well, you were, whatever we
were, 5-6 in your last 11 games. I said, let anybody else play who we played
and see what their record would be. We played whatever it was, we played the
fifth, I think the fifth most amount of ranked teams in the country, games
against ranked teams. It's not like we haven't been tested. It's not like our
freshmen haven't grown up a bunch. But the truth of the matter is they never
really -- it wasn't like I had freshmen. They weren't apprehensive about
anything and they didn't fear anybody.  
  
 Q. I just wondered, have you thought any about Dan Peters this season
or in the last few days?  
COACH HUGGINS: I think about Pete all the time. We were very close from the
time we were probably 19, 20 years old on. And so, yeah, you think about him
all the time. I talked to Danny Joe periodically. But you can't spend that
much time together. I mean, we literally spent a lot of days every waking hour
together. So you can't be around somebody that much for that long and not
think about him. I think about him. I think about Charlie Spoonhour. I think
about -- somebody will say something and Spoon pops in my head. I think when
you're around people and you have the kind of relationship that I had with
those guys, you're going to think about them.  
  
 Q. What have you seen on film about Shannon Evans and Lamonte Bearden
in the back court and the challenges they present?  
COACH HUGGINS: I think they've got great speed with the ball. And they appear
on film to be fearless. They continue to attack and attack. And they've had
games where they were down 14 and they're very capable of erasing big leads in
a very short period of time. They're a good team. They're a good team, they're
extremely well-coached.  
  
 Q. Juwan said earlier that one of the good things about this team is
how much they all enjoy being together and how that kind of didn't exist the
last couple of years, there was a little bit of a divide on the team. Was
there a point early on where you saw something click with this group or you
saw that they could be a special group?  
COACH HUGGINS: Well, I think the thing that was most evident from the
beginning and continues to be is their enthusiasm. I mean, they've just got
great enthusiasm. They love to play. Sometimes you have some teams where guys
come in and it's like a chore for them to be there, and they don't act like
they really want to be there. This team is not -- it's not like they want to
be there, they're extremely enthusiastic about being there. They want to get
better. They love basketball. And if you think about it in anything and any
workplace, I mean that's what you want. You want enthusiastic people, people
who care. And these guys sincerely care. They've got great attitudes. They've
got great enthusiasm. I have said for a long, long time it's hard to -- it's
hard to motivate people to work hard and teach at the same time. If you're
constantly trying to motivate them, you're spending your time trying to
motivate them, you're not spending your time trying to teach them. And I think
we got better day in and day out because they come in with the idea that
they're going to be enthusiastic and then we don't have to worry about
motivating guys to be excited about it and to listen and to do things, because
they already do that. So then you can coach them.  
  
 Q. You're from Ohio. You've coached most of your college career in Ohio
or close to it. I just wonder if it means anything extra just to be playing
the game here?  
COACH HUGGINS: No, not really. I'm not very nostalgic. I've told this story
several times, but at the risk of boring some of you, I grew up in a town of
500 people, two stoplights. This guy used to come around and pick up Gene Ford
and I. Gene's a coach at Muskingum College now. He used to pick us up to play
in different towns around in the area. And I got in the truck one day and I
looked and he didn't have a rearview mirror, and I said, Phil, you don't have
a rearview mirror. He said, boy, we're not going backwards. That's kind of how
I've lived my life. I don't look backwards. I don't have a rearview mirror. I
just look forward.  
  
 Q. Just wanted to ask you about with Juwan and Gary going down towards
the end of the season, being out for a few games. How beneficial was that for
the other guys Jevon, Tarik, Daxter to get that playing time that added
experience starting games and all that?  
COACH HUGGINS: I think obviously it helped us. I think it helped probably J.C.
more than Dax in that J.C. became the point guard. So the thing about being a
point guard is you just don't have to know what you're supposed to do. You
have to know what everybody is supposed to do. And really what I don't think
the vast majority of people didn't realize is that we didn't just lose our
point guard, we lost our point guard and our back-up point guard, because if
you remember when Wany was out we gave Gary the ball. So we lost both of our
point guards and both of our guys with any experience at all. So giving J.C.
the ball, now he understands, I think, so much better what's supposed to
happen, where people are. And I think it will help our offense, because he
does understand now to look here and if that's not there to look here. So he's
not -- he's much better than just knowing what he's supposed to do now in
terms of the overall what we're trying to accomplish.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_COLUMBUS, OHIO_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
 Q. Already today two No. 3 seeds have gone down. Are you aware of that?
And what are your thoughts about that going into tomorrow?  
SAM ROWLEY: We are aware. We were watching the games. You know, it gives us a
little bit of motivation, a little bit of excitement. You know it can happen.
You know it does happen. Obviously it doesn't change our game plan in any way,
shape or form. But there's other teams that have gone out and done it,
obviously gives precedent for us to go out and do it and we're excited for the
game.  
  
 Q. Peter, I just wondered, in the wake of your story coming out on
Saturday, just are you still flying high? I just wondered how has this few
days been?  
PETER HOOLEY: It's been pretty crazy. It's been pretty full on. But it's been
something I'll obviously remember forever. And I'm glad that I've heard a lot
from people saying they've been touched by the story and it's helped them in
many ways. I said from the start, if it inspires one person to help get
through a tough time then it's done its job. And as far as I'm concerned I
think once we all get ready to hit the court tomorrow, then we have one goal
in mind and that's all we'll be focused on. So we'll be ready come tomorrow.  
  
 Q. Have you talked to your family since that night?  
PETER HOOLEY: Yes, I have. I speak to them regularly -- dad and my sister, my
uncles and aunties and stuff -- and I think they were planning a big viewing
party to watch which will be pretty cool. Obviously you wish they were here
with you, but I've got through it before so I'll be able to get through it
again, and I talk to them as much as I can so it's good that they're still
there.  
  
 Q. Have you seen the shot again?  
PETER HOOLEY: Too many times.  
  
 Q. How many do you guess?  
PETER HOOLEY: You see it on different types of platforms and stuff. It's
pretty exciting. It's a fun time I'll definitely never forget.  
  
 Q. Do you almost think the way the tip -- that's almost like better
than the shot, right?  
PETER HOOLEY: Yeah, exactly.  
  
SAM ROWLEY: Yeah, it was.  
  
PETER HOOLEY: He can claim it. He did it. There's plenty of hands in there.  
  
SAM ROWLEY: Thanks for the credit.  
  
PETER HOOLEY: Plenty of hands in there for the ball to come to me. Everything
had to go right. Somehow it did, it's pretty special.  
  
 Q. You mentioned how you've seen the shot so many times now, kind of
the way the last week has gone. Are you glad that now you can finally get back
to playing and kind of put that stuff to the side now after the way the last
few days have gone?  
PETER HOOLEY: I wouldn't say glad. I think I'm pretty good at making sure I
focus on what I have to at the right time. I think all these guys are. When it
comes down to it we still have to put the ball in the basket on both ends.
That doesn't change anything. It has been a hectic few days. I think we've all
handled it well, I think I've handled it well. I think Coach has handled it
well, and I think we've been through so much this year we know what it takes
to prepare for game time tomorrow.  
  
 Q. Obviously today there's been a couple of upsets for 14 seeds. I'm
sure you're confident anyway but does that give you added confidence that you
can come in and do the same thing for tomorrow?  
PETER HOOLEY: Yeah, it definitely does. I think you can't help but watch any
player who is a part of March Madness -- maybe not any college basketball
player who says they're not watching the games is lying to you. Obviously
we'll see what happens and it doesn't change anything for us. Still have to
prepare the same way, we're still going to go out and play the same way and
make sure we stick together and grind it out.  
  
SAM ROWLEY: Just reiterating what Pete says. It doesn't change our game plan
at all. But the fact that other teams have done it gives us more confidence.
It can happen. It does happen, and hopefully it will happen.  
  
 Q. When we were talking to Oklahoma, they were saying that one of the
big things for them was controlling tempo and kind of setting a fast tempo
because you guys like to play in the half court. But after seeing you all
season, you guys can get out in transition. Do you think you can maybe use
that to your advantage tomorrow?  
SAM ROWLEY: Yeah, we hope to, certainly. If the opportunity presents itself.
But we are historically a more half court team. That's sort of the way we
played this season and I think we certainly don't want to come out and change
the way that's been successful for us. And we certainly understand that
they're a very fast, athletic, quick team. And we certainly want to stop or
limit them in transition because we know how effective they can be.  
  
PETER HOOLEY: Yeah, I think as Sam said we're not going to change what's been
successful for us. But we need to make sure that we just don't get thrown back
off of on the back foot, that we keep our foot forward and attack them. It's
all about who is going to weather the storms, who is going to throw the first
punch, who is going to throw the last punch. We're just going to stick it
together and ride it out.  
  
 Q. What did you learn from your past NCAA experience that's going to
help you tomorrow?  
PETER HOOLEY: I think we just learned how to stick it together and literally
grind it out. Sam and I have been here for the last two when we played Duke
first then Florida last year and obviously they're major programs. And we just
try to let these guys know on our team that anything can happen. It's March.
Anything can happen. And as long as we stay together and do what's successful
for us, the coach has given us the best game plan possible as they always do.
We stick to that, stick together, and good things should happen.  
  
 Q. You've both seen film now of Oklahoma. What has to happen for you to
beat them? And the other thing, Peter, I guess you're going to start tomorrow,
your thoughts on that?  
SAM ROWLEY: Okay. For us to beat Oklahoma we obviously have to play very well
on all fronts. We have to shoot well. I think defense is the biggest thing for
us. They've got a lot of guys that can score. We need to limit them. And we
just need to shoot well. I think we need to be willing to take shots that
perhaps we wouldn't normally take because the truth is we won't get better
opportunities. And we need to be confident enough to step up and knock them
down. And then in transition, just halting them and limiting them in
transition. The way they play is very run and gun. They're very fast and
athletic. And we can't let them play to their strengths.  
  
PETER HOOLEY: Yeah, as Sam said, they are a terrific program. They've got
scorers all over the court. Anyone can put it up at any time. They all have
the green light. So I think it's paramount that on defense we stick together
and limit their transition opportunities and try and just play, play five guys
on defense at all times guarding the ball and in terms of starting, it doesn't
change much for me. I think as you saw as I started to come back even when I
came off the bench my game was still the same. Still stayed as aggressive as
it was. It doesn't mean much for me. It just means I start out a bit earlier.  
  
 Q. What lures guys from Australia to go to Albany?  
SAM ROWLEY: The weather. (Laughter) I think the fact that they take us, more
than anything.  
  
 Q. Was there something at school you wanted to study?  
SAM ROWLEY: No, honestly it just started with a teammate who graduated last
year. He was the first to go. It was really successful, said great things
about the program and that led to the beginning of the sort of cross-
continental relationship and it's blossomed from there.  
  
 Q. Sam -- Peter I know how you feel from your tweets about the kind of
your mom thing. But Sam, did you believe in, I don't know, divine
intervention, or the angel, you know what I mean?  
SAM ROWLEY: I won't touch on that. But I know that Pete's mom was an amazing
lady and she's always with him, she's always looking out for him. She supports
him now as she always has. It was an amazing moment. Knowing what he's been
through, being sort of alongside him for most of the way. I'm really happy for
him and I'm happy that his story is out there and that it's managed to touch
as many people as it has, because it's a pretty amazing story.  
  
 Q. You guys have been here before three times in a row now. But what
have you seen from the guys who haven't been here before, going through kind
of the workings of practice and prepping for tomorrow?  
PETER HOOLEY: You see a lot of excitement at least some of these guys have
dreamt of this as kids. I think everyone wants to play in the Big Dance.
They're excited, relishing this opportunity, and you just know they're good
enough that when that ball gets thrown up tomorrow they'll be ready, they'll
be focused and they'll be ready to go on all cylinders. As exciting as it is,
they're enjoying this opportunity. I'm sure they'll never forget it for the
rest of their lives. When the ball throws up they'll do what they've done
since they first started playing basketball and that's to try to put the ball
in the hoop.  
  
 Q. Time zone challenge. What time is tip at home? Is it a reasonable
hour, do you know?  
PETER HOOLEY: 9:00 a.m. or 9:30. It's different for both of us.  
  
SAM ROWLEY: It's doable. Early in the morning.  
  
 Q. You touched on the fact that you guys will use motivation, the fact
that 14 seeds have beaten 3s already. But on the opposite side I'm sure it
will open the eyes of Oklahoma a little bit more as well. Do you agree with
that?  
SAM ROWLEY: Yeah, I mean if I remember correctly, they lost in the first round
last year, I think. So they're going to give it their best shot no matter
what. I don't think they're going to underestimate us in any form, no matter
what in a first-round game. So I think we all expected to get their best shot
perhaps even more so now. I don't think it's going to change their approach at
all. It's pretty late in the preparation for anything sort of dramatic to
happen like that. I don't foresee them playing any differently. But obviously
the fact that it has happened means that it can happen. And I'm sure they'll
be very aware of that.  
  
PETER HOOLEY: Yeah, they'll be ready to go. They know what it takes. They're a
big-time program and they have guys who know what to do in these situations,
guys who have the ceiling through the roof in terms of basketball. All these
guys who can play, who can score, exactly, they're going to come out ready to
go. There's no chance they weren't focused before what happened today. And if
they were, they definitely would be focused now.  
  
 Q. Sam, for a lot of this season everything that you guys have done
offensively has kind of flown through you in the post. Oklahoma has a bit of a
size advantage on you. So what do you feel like you have to do?  
SAM ROWLEY: Just be willing to distribute, I think. A lot of guys touch the
ball on our offense. We just have a lot of different guys that can score. So
on any given night it can be anybody willing to step up and make shots or take
shots. So whoever is having the hot hand we've got to make sure we find them,
and just more now than ever I think in this game given their defensive prowess
we need to find guys that are willing to take shots and are open. And if they
collapse on one guy we got to find the open guy. Simple as that. I don't think
it's going to change our game plan dramatically or our offensive plan. But we
just have to be willing to distribute.  
  
 Q. We're talking about the pressures of the NCAA Tournament. But there
really isn't any pressure on you, is there, as a 14 seed. It's on Oklahoma; is
that correct?  
SAM ROWLEY: I would say so. Obviously they're the favorite, as they should be.
And despite the fact that we've had sort of lesser seeds in years past, being
a 15 and then a 16, we may put pressure on ourselves, I think all the pressure
is on them.  
  
PETER HOOLEY: Yeah, obviously I agree with Sam. Even though things have
happened differently today in the rest of the bracket, the pressure is on
them. But as you said, they're a talented program. They're a big-time school.
They know that the pressure is on them and they know how to block it out when
it comes to putting the ball in the hoops. They'll throw the ball out and be
ready to play.  
  
 Q. Peter, I wanted to ask about when you came back after the eight
games you missed, what was the reaction from the team? I'm sure they were very
enveloping, how can you describe what it was like?  
PETER HOOLEY: It was pretty special. I think that was going to be one of the
hardest things for me was coming back after I went home and they had so much
success off the court. To see when I came back they were all waiting in my
room for me and refused to shake my hand they gave me a hug and made me feel
special, and welcomed me back pretty much, literally with open arms, made me
feel back at home and made me realize this is where I was supposed to be right
now.  
  
 Q. I know there's a fan bus coming out here tomorrow. You guys were on
the bus going from just Albany to the airport yesterday. Can you imagine being
on a bus for 10 or 11 hours coming out here?  
PETER HOOLEY: We've been on planes for 16 hours too. So I think we're well
aware of what that's like. I think it will be pretty exciting for everybody to
come out. We'll love to have everybody here. We love playing in front of our
fans in when we play in Syracuse. I think it's going to be great to step on
the court and see a lot of purple out there.  
  
SAM ROWLEY: The same. We enjoy playing in front of our fans. We're fortunate
to have some very loyal fans willing to make that bus trip out. That not
everybody wants to sit on a bus for that long. So we appreciate that. And we
hope to give them a good show.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Coach, can you tell us about your arrival in
Columbus and what you think at this point.  
  
COACH BROWN: So far so good. Took us a little while to get here but once we
arrived, everything's been great. We're looking forward to this opportunity
that we have tomorrow night against a very good Oklahoma team. And we're proud
to be here representing an outstanding conference like the America East
Conference and our tremendous university, the University at Albany. So we're
looking forward to it.  
  
 Q. You've been probably aware watching games today, you've seen the two
14s have beaten a 3. What are your thoughts on it happening again tomorrow?
Notre Dame almost lost too?  
COACH BROWN: This is what I'm thinking -- two Big 12 teams have already gotten
beat in the first round. Oklahoma, we're not going to catch them sleepwalking.
They're going to be ready. They're going to be excited to play. They also lost
in the first round last year. So I think they're going to be ready. Tremendous
program. Lon Kruger is one of the best coaches in the country. Won everywhere
he's been. Arguably, I've heard several people say this, they might have the
best starting five in the country outside of Kentucky. So they're good,
they're going to be ready to go and we're looking forward to the tremendous
challenge that's in front of us.  
  
 Q. Sam and Peter have been here before three times and you've got some
guys gone through the process before, maybe not seen a lot of minutes, but
what do you need from those fresh faces here?  
COACH BROWN: Well, I need our new guys like Evan and Ray Sanders and Richard
Peters, who have been really good for us all season long, I need them to
continue to do what they've been doing -- just relax, play the way that we
play. Don't waiver from what you've done individually, don't waiver from what
we've done as a team and take the game to Oklahoma. Take the game right to
them. We can't get back on our heels. We've got to be the aggressor. We've got
to be a smart aggressive. But I want our guys to relax. No reason for us to be
tight. We were really tight in the America East Conference Tournament
championship game in our building. We were not relaxed for whatever reason. So
I think we'll be much more relaxed in this environment knowing that we're in
the NCAA Tournament representing University of Albany the America East
Conference. I think we'll be ready to go. Whether it's good enough or not,
we'll find out tomorrow night.  
  
 Q. After such an emotional victory, do you wander is that going to lift
your team up or do you wander what's next?  
COACH BROWN: It's so hard. We're not a BCS-level conference or school. So if
we come in fifth or sixth place in our league we don't get an opportunity to
come to the NCAA Tournament. So it's a grind. We won the regular season, which
was a tremendous accomplishment, but the bottom line is you have to find a way
to win your tournament. We're a one-bid league. So it was a tremendous
accomplishment to win both. And I wanted our players to enjoy that. Once we
got to Monday, all business. Focus on Oklahoma. We're here to win a game.
We're here to win more than a game. We're not just happy to be here. We're
going to have to rely on Peter Hooley and Sam Rowley, guys that this is the
first time they've been to the NCAA Tournament. We need to be able to rely on
those guys early and often. We're here to fight, to win, to scrape, to claw,
find a way to get it done. That's our mentality right now. I think what
happens, when you're just happy to be here, that's when you get beat and you
go home. And we want to stay here as long as we can.  
  
 Q. This season, what can you say about --  
COACH BROWN: I could have sat back there with everybody else and listened to
those two individuals talk all day and all night. I get to coach those two
kids, Sam for the past four years. Peter for the past four years as well. And
I was a proud coach back there listening to them. I wish they could sit here
and answer the questions for me. We build our program around character. I've
got high character kids, tremendous students. We had three of our student-
athletes on the all-academic team. It's a five-man team in our league. The
most all-academic selections in our conference. This is about basketball and
trying to win the NCAA Tournament and the national championship, but Peter has
had to deal with so much. Our university, our conference, our community, our
team has rallied around Peter and supported him and his family. Coaching is
easy. The Xs and Os, it's simple. Putting together a game plan for Oklahoma,
simple in comparison to what Peter has had to endure and what he continues to
go through. And it's my job as a coach to sit there and help him in any way
possible so he can move forward. My wife, Jamie, deserves a lot of credit,
because she's become very close with the Hooley family. Peter has a twin
sister who is 21 years old. My wife's been on the phone with Emma every day
since mom's passed. And it's hard. We're dealing with it every day. But Peter
has done a wonderful job. I don't know if anybody saw the New York Post today.
Peter won a 700-word guest column for the New York Post about what he's been
through and his experience. Like I said, they don't teach you as -- nobody
prepares you as a coach how to deal with situations like this. It's sad. It's
unfortunate. That's why I can't think of a better individual to hit that shot
the other day than Peter Hooley and I firmly believe his mom, Sue, guided that
ball a little bit and made sure it dropped through the net for us. So it's a
process. And it's ongoing. But Peter has handled this as well as a college-
aged kid could handle this. And I think he should be commended for that,
because it's a very difficult situation.  
  
 Q. What has to happen for you guys to win tomorrow? And secondly when
did you decide to start Peter even though I know he played the whole second
half against Stony Brook?  
COACH BROWN: I think if Hooley hits ten 3s and Rowley fouls out their entire
front court we should be in good shape. No, the tough thing about Oklahoma is
they're one of, in my opinion, one of the top five defensive teams in the
country. Terrific in the defensive half court. Then you turn around they can
score from all five positions. They're big, strong, physical and athletic. I
think they're a top 10 team without question. Usually in these games what
we've tried to do, especially the past two years, is make them ugly. Control
tempo. Limit possessions. The tough part with Oklahoma is if we pass up a
decent shot, we might not get a better shot during that possession. So we're
probably going to have to take some shots that we ordinarily wouldn't take.
We're going to have to take more 3s than normal, and we're going to have to
step up and knock some of those shots down. So when we attack their pressure,
I told our guys, if we're open from 3, let it fly. We get a good look, shoot
it with confidence. Just please make a few.  
  
 Q. What about Peter starting?  
COACH BROWN: He's arguably the best guard in our league. It's just that I
think now is a good opportunity to get him back into the starting lineup.
We're going to see a lot of pressure from Oklahoma early and often. It's
another ball handler on the floor. This is the third time that Peter's been in
this situation. We need to rely on his experience, and it's crucial in these
games that you get off to a good start. So I think the timing is right for
Peter to be back in the starting lineup.  
  
 Q. Three straight trips. But you also had a pretty good run in 2006.
What have you learned from all these trips that you can use tomorrow against
Oklahoma?  
COACH BROWN: I've learned we didn't play well the first time we were in
Columbus. I know that. Just to relax. Don't be happy to be here, but relax, be
aggressive as long as it's a smart aggressive. Don't get caught up in the
atmosphere. We're going to have to rely on Peter and Sam early I think because
they've been here before. Third time in a row for each of them. This never
gets old. The one thing I want to make sure our guys do is they embrace the
opportunity, they respect the opportunity. Because you don't know if you're
going to have another opportunity. It's so difficult. The America East
Conference is a good league. There's some really good coaches in our league.
We've got a great commissioner, and we're growing, and it's going to continue
to get better and better as we move forward. But again, it's a special
opportunity that we have. And I want all of our guys to enjoy it. But we have
to rely on our guys that have been through it before, I think. Those guys have
to relax and show our new guys or our guys that haven't been here how it's
done.  
  
 Q. Obviously you mentioned everything Peter's been going through, it's
been kind of a crazy week. Given kind of all the attention that's been on him,
everything that's been happening, is there any concern that he might just kind
of be spent by the time the game comes tomorrow? Obviously that's not a knock
on the way he's handling it.  
COACH BROWN: Not at all. It's a tough situation. With every request that I've
received for access to Peter, I went and I asked Peter: Are you okay with
this? Because he's being asked the same questions over and over about his mom.
So everybody's asking him about it. So obviously that's all he's thinking
about. And he's handled it with class and he's done a great job. I just want
to make sure that he's relaxed heading into the game. Even though it's tragic,
the situation and the circumstances, I do think it's been good for Peter. I
think it's been good for the university. And I just think that he's handled it
really well. And he's wanted to do this. As you're well aware, he's on the
back page of the New York Post, full page, and he wrote a 700-word column. He
did it on the plane and he did an unbelievable job. I'm sure you read it. And
he wanted to do it. So I do think in a way this has been good for him. And he
would tell me if, hey, Coach, this is enough. He's that type of kid. But it's
been good for him, and I'd like to thank all of you for your patience and your
interest and your support of Peter, because he really respects that.  
  
 Q. I'm curious about the Australia connection. Was there somebody, I
don't know, kind of opened the door?  
COACH BROWN: Sure. Sure. Absolutely. One of my former assistants, Jeremy
Friel, his college roommate was from Australia. He played at the University of
New Hampshire. Since then, the individual has moved back to Australia, and
he's director of basketball in the northern territory in Australia. Kind of
got the pipeline going. If you follow college basketball, years ago, Saint
Mary's really started that Australian pipeline with Matthew Dellavedova in the
NBA and Andrew Bogut, getting those guys. A lot of Australians that have come
over to the United States and had success. There's several in the NBA. The
coaching is good over there. They're tough, hard-nosed kids, high basketball
IQ and they value an education. Those are the kids I like to be around. So
what happened is five years ago we were fortunate enough to sign Luke Devlin
from Sydney, Australia, and the pipeline developed. The one thing about the
Aussies, it's not about levels. It's about comfort. And once we got Luke, he
became our best recruiter. And then we were able to get Sam. Then we were able
to get Peter. Then we were able to get Mike Rowley, Sam's brother, and we were
able to get Geremy McKay, and it's really worked. Very low maintenance kids. I
love them. They're a coach's dream, every single one of them. And we're going
to continue to recruit Australia. It's been good to us.  
  
 Q. What would it mean to you and this program if you're able to pull
off an upset tomorrow night?  
COACH BROWN: Well, it means we advance to the next round. It means we live for
another day. It extends our season. It would be an upset. Obviously it's a 14
beating a 3. My goal is for us to go out and play well and represent our
university and our conference. The goal is to win. Our program's continuing to
grow, so is our conference. I think it's a win-win for our university and for
our league. It's the next step for our program, to be honest with you. And
we'd love to have an opportunity to play on Sunday, and that's our goal right
now.  
  
 Q. Just one thing I wanted to qualify. When you said Peter kind of
needed this, like a catharsis-type thing?  
COACH BROWN: As far as the attention?  
  
 Q. When you said you think it's good for him, in what way did you mean
that?  
COACH BROWN: I think he's comfortable right now. I think he's proud of his
mom. She was a wonderful woman. And if you spend time talking to Peter, you
know she was his biggest fan. She was his biggest critic. It's an unbelievable
family. And I think Peter knows that she's watching and she's listening. And I
think every time he talks he's sending a message to her and I think he enjoys
that. I think he enjoys it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_JACKSONVILLE, FLORIDA_  
  

NORTH CAROLINA - 87  
ARKANSAS - 78

COACH ROY WILLIAMS: Well, we're excited. I feel very fortunate. We beat a
really good Arkansas team that's had a great, great year. Mike Anderson has
done a great job with that team. I think it's three years back there and what
he's done with the club has been impressive. He went back to Nolan's days and
understanding all the time he's replacing Nolan, and that's not easy. I know a
little bit about those kind of things myself. But I hate it this time of year
because the kids just think about the outcome of today's game and don't feel
as good about what they should feel as good about, and that is what has
Arkansas done all year. For us I just thought that the second half -- first of
the game, they hit us right in the mouth and we stumbled a little bit and we
got it righted and we attacked the press and got some lay-ups, got us back in
the game. Three point game at halftime, and then the second half we ended up
shooting 55 percent. I thought Marcus was sensational in the second half. He
was 1 for 8 in the first half. He was 4 for 6 in the second half. He was 3 for
3 from the three-point line. He did have three turnovers, which I didn't
appreciate that, but he can't be perfect. Justin had 14 in the second half,
made some big shots. Marcus and Justin and Brice, I think, at halftime were 4
for 20. Brice never really got it straightened out but he rebounded the heck
out of it. J.P. had eight assists and zero turnovers against a team that was
pressing us all day. Again, all those kids, Brice didn't score but ended up
with 13 rebounds for us, so it was just a great time for us.  
  
 Q. J.P., just curious, we asked Marcus about this in the locker room,
when you guys went small in the second half, not something you've done a lot
this year. What was that like for you guys? How did that work against the
press?  
J.P. TOKOTO: It worked fine. It's like putting another ball handler in the
middle, which helped us a lot. It wasn't anything new to me. We do it in
practice all the time, just situation type things, and I'm a basketball
player. You've just got to adjust.  
  
 Q. Marcus, after going 1 for 8 in the first half, what do you think
when you go up there and shoot? Do you ever lose confidence, and how do you
turn things around like that in the second half?  
MARCUS PAIGE: Well, like he said, like Coach said, he let us know that we were
4 for 20 between the three of us, Justin, myself, and Brice, and I knew that I
was getting some decent looks. I didn't take very many bad shots, I just was
rushing it a little bit. I think their pressure sped me up a little, so I just
wanted to come out and let the game come to me in the second half. And I
didn't really force anything and was able to get a couple good looks and after
that I got in a rhythm. I didn't lose confidence. My teammates have a great
deal of confidence in me and they put me in a position to succeed a lot, so
that helps.  
  
 Q. J.P., Coach mentioned your assist-to-turnover ratio. In this kind of
game with an up-tempo style, does that fit you better than any other style of
play?  
J.P. TOKOTO: Definitely. I like to play fast, fast tempo. I was definitely
looking forward to this game. I mean, it kind of fired us up a little bit, and
in press conferences they said we were going to turn the ball over. It's kind
of motivation, take care of the ball. That's exactly what we did.  
  
 Q. For J.P. and Marcus, what's it like to be a player at North Carolina
when you don't have the same kind of success that maybe people expect the last
couple years? And then how satisfying is it to have turned this season in the
right direction and get to this point?  
MARCUS PAIGE: Well, yeah. That's a good question. We didn't have the type of
regular season we wanted to. We had some bumps in the road, and we weren't a
typical Carolina team in terms of our record this year and our seed and stuff.
Our fans expect us to have a No. 1 seed overall every single year.
Unfortunately it didn't happen for us this year, but we understand the moment,
and you've got to win six games. Once you're slotted in the tournament and
you're in position, it's up for grabs. And we knew that we had the talent, we
had the capability, we just have to buy in and do what we're told, and we've
been playing a lot better. Even if we have a bad regular season by Carolina
standards, you can make up some ground for that by playing well in the
tournament and making things happen late in the season.  
  
 Q. Marcus, Brice said that at some point last year you were given the
nickname Second Half Paige. Was that a media thing, a teammates thing, and do
you like it?  
MARCUS PAIGE: Well, if I could play just as well in the first half as I do in
the second half, I would prefer to do that, but sometimes it happens that way.
I think it's more the media that pegged that name on me. My teammates kind of
went along with it after it got some notoriety, but I don't know what that's
all about. I just try to help my team win, and in big moments I feel like I
get put in a position to succeed by my teammates that do a great job screening
for me and looking for me. Sometimes if you have a poor first half, you want
to do whatever you can to erase that and make up for it the second, and that's
what I've been able to do a couple times.  
  
 Q. Justin, what was working for you after halftime? You had kind of a
rough half, especially being a freshman on the stage. What kind of clicked for
you after halftime?  
JUSTIN JACKSON: I was just getting easy looks. My teammates were setting me up
great. It wasn't really much that I did. I was just trying to cut, get to the
open spot, and my teammates were finding me.  
  
 Q. There was a point there when Isaiah picked up his fourth foul, I
think Marcus was coming in for Nate at that point, and I think it was Hubert
who said go small and you sent him in for Isaiah instead and obviously at that
point things really clicked for Marcus. What was behind the decision to go
small there, and why then?  
COACH ROY WILLIAMS: I think we had gone small in the first half, also, and
we've done that a lot in practice. We really have. And so at that point, I
even said, I said do we want him to go for Isaiah, do we want him to go for
Nate? And I think I told him first -- I told him Nate, and then all of a
sudden, it was another foul on Isaiah, so let's go ahead and go small at that
time. But we have, we've done that quite a few times. I don't think there's
any problem -- we do it in dummy offense on the day of games, J.P. goes
through all the out of bounds plays. There's not that big a difference in our
offense because we're more of a freelance offense anyway. The biggest thing
for me of going small is I wanted to have more ball handlers in there. Kennedy
was in foul trouble, Isaiah was in foul trouble, Brice was in foul trouble, so
that had a lot to do with it, as well. One thing, let's not have
misconception, these kids have had a pretty doggone good run for the last
three years. We've won 25, 24, and 26, and I'm not getting on the young man
down here about his question, but a lot of teams would like that and we have
had some problems. We've lost some games that we wanted to win, there's no
question. And there's nobody in the world that idolizes Coach Smith more than
me, but there was a five-year period there where we lost in the first round,
went to the Final Four, lost in the first round, lost in the first round. When
I got there nobody on the club had ever been to an NCAA Tournament, so we've
had some tough stretches, but these guys -- we had some injuries, and we had
to go small one year. We played four guards and still won 25. I feel really
good about what these kids have accomplished, I really do.  
  
 Q. I wanted to follow up on that point because ever since 2012, when
you had some bad luck in the tournament, seems like there's been a little bit
of bad luck the last couple years. So to finally get it back -- turned around
to where you're back in the Sweet 16, I'm just sort of curious your thoughts
on the last couple years --  
COACH ROY WILLIAMS: They've been really --  
  
 Q. Especially when you had it rolling for so long.  
COACH ROY WILLIAMS: Well, in 2012 John Calipari and I could have a great
discussion because I thought we were the best team in the country, but we
can't show that because John has got the ring and his players deserved it. The
injuries did hurt us at that time and then the last two years we've had some
tough times. We had to go small, we lost Reggie and P.J., and after Marcus's
freshman year, I was dumb enough to make a statement I wouldn't trade our
perimeter guys we'll have next year for anybody in the country because we were
going to have Marcus and Reggie and P.J. And then I looked around and we
didn't have either one of them, so that's -- what you're talking about there I
can understand, but boy, I feel really good about what these kids have done
this year in a really difficult league. Somebody said the only team we lost to
that wasn't playing was Pitt. Everybody else was still playing. And we played
19 games against teams in the tournament, we played 10 games against the top
four seeds. But Marcus said it best, shoot, we wanted to win the whole thing.
We wanted to win the regular season. But I do really feel good about what
these kids have accomplished.  
  
 Q. Did you guys hear the announcement during the game about the NC
State score, and what do you think about both you guys going to the Sweet
16?  
MARCUS PAIGE: Well, it's good for our league. Obviously we're rivals, and when
we're playing against each other it's heated and everything, but the ACC has
done really well in the tournament, and that just shows the strength of our
league. We're happy that the ACC is doing as well as they're doing. I didn't
hear the announcement during the game or anything. I just learned about it a
little bit ago. But I wasn't surprised because they're one of the better
offensive teams in the country and they can really fill it up. Good for them.
But if we happen to cross paths, it'll be the same way it's always been.  
  
COACH ROY WILLIAMS: We did just hear about it when we got back there. Unless
Justin was listening for the public announcer to say some things during the
play because he's a freshman. The kid got a bloody nose and came back in the
game pretty quick. He's tougher. I like that.  
  
 Q. You have been the Chair of the Rules Committee. Would it be good for
the game if more teams played at the pace that you and Arkansas played
tonight?  
COACH ROY WILLIAMS: You know, I love the ball going up and down the court.
I've got a copy of the original copy of the 13 original rules of the game in
my home, and when I was coaching at Kansas. And I love a free-flowing game,
but everybody doesn't love it like that as coaches. But the Rules Committee, I
was on there for six years and loved it, but I felt a great deal of
responsibility. And I think that we all need to look at things we can do to
perhaps speed things up or make it a more free-flowing game. But I think
everyone agrees that we need to do that. But just because Roy Williams likes
something doesn't mean it's the best thing for the game. I mean if it was up
to me, we'd have a 15-second clock, and it would really be fun then. J.P.
would cross over seven times and then the clock would be run out. (Laughter).  
  
 Q. We've talked a lot about the adversity that you've been through
personally this year on the court, off the court especially. Given all that,
is this run to the Sweet 16 in some ways more meaningful maybe than any
other?  
COACH ROY WILLIAMS: Well, you know, I'm an emotional guy. When they told me
out on the court -- and Steve asked me the other day, one of you guys, I
forget who it was -- asked me about if we win today I'd tie Coach Smith for
the second most wins in the NCAA Tournament. That means a lot to me. Losing
Coach Smith, losing Ted Seagroves, my big-time buddy, Stuart Scott, the stuff
that we've had going on, Mitch Kupchak's daughter, it's been a hard year, it
really has. I probably acted sillier in the locker room after this game than I
have in quite a while. I'm going to try to enjoy the dickens out of this one
for a while tonight.  
  
 Q. How have the difficulties this season, like you just mentioned, how
have they really framed the season and how have you kind of adjusted to
them?  
COACH ROY WILLIAMS: Well, you know, it's been hard. Basketball is a game. It's
entertainment for everybody in the crowd. My wife gets really upset with me
when I say it's my life, but other than my family, it is my life. It's been
some rocky times. I told the kids this week, the only difference between
stepping stones and stumbling blocks is how you look at them. But the things
I've had personally have been really, really difficult. But I've loved
coaching my team. I've loved coaching this team.  
  
 Q. Do you have an update on Kennedy Meeks and whether you'll have him
next week, and what do you mean by you acted silly in the locker room? Can you
give us a brief glimpse into how you acted?  
COACH ROY WILLIAMS: It would be the most embarrassing thing of my life
probably, so I'll just leave it like that. But I do enjoy acting silly and
having fun. I am emotional and wear my feelings on my sleeve a lot in both
directions, very happily or very mad, too. But we played in the ACC
Tournament, my high school coach said I've never seen you that mad. I said,
oh, I've been that mad. These guys have seen it more than he has. But at the
same time it's a wonderful feeling to have a bunch of kids trying to make
sacrifices towards a common goal. I'm glad -- I hope the cameras weren't all
over the locker room, let's put it that way. Kennedy has a knee sprain. That's
all we're saying right now. We think that's all it is, but we'll get some
X-rays or MRIs or both when we get back and find out what it is.

_JACKSONVILLE, FLORIDA_  
  

XAVIER - 75  
GEORGIA STATE - 67

COACH RON HUNTER: Well, first of all, I'm very, very proud of my guys. I
thought they were terrific. I thought Xavier did a great job. We said that
they would have to make some mistakes for us to beat them tonight, and they
didn't make any mistakes. They played very well. Congratulations to Xavier.
Well-coached, good basketball team. I'm proud of how my kids played. It was
just an unbelievable -- they played well. It's our third game this week. I was
worried about us being a little tired. You play three games in a week, it's
really tough. I told them not to be sad. What a great week, unbelievable week.
There is nothing to be sad about, especially for me. I'll be honest with you,
the greatest week of my life. The greatest time I've ever had to be a father,
doing this with Kevin Ware and the rest of this team, but man, I don't want
these guys to be sad. We helped Georgia State out. Georgia State people know
about Georgia State. We'll be back. We're going to get some young guys, but
it's not even about that right now. I just -- as a coach, best time of my
life, but as a father (tearing up) -- I love this kid, man. I love you.  
  
Q. R.J., y'all were down by six with 2:55 left, about the same time,
half the margin against Baylor. What was going through your head at that
time?  
R.J. HUNTER: Just keep battling, man. You know, after yesterday we felt like
anything was possible. We battled, man, all the way to the end. We fought and
clawed. But that's a good team. Dee Davis willed them. They didn't make any
mistakes. He's a hell of a player, a hell of a competitor. I'm proud. That's
how you go out, man. I thought we went out swinging, and that's how you do it.  
  
Q. R.J., you guys were able to get a good handle on Matt Stainbrook.
What were you expecting from Jalen Reynolds who ended up scoring a career high
21 points?  
R.J. HUNTER: I thought he got good looks. I don't think he was doing any moves
or doing anything crazy. I thought he was getting easy baskets. I thought we
gave Stainbrook a lot of attention, and he made good plays and was in good
spot.  
  
Q. When you guys walked off the floor, you immediately acknowledged the
Georgia State fans, and Coach, you were clapping. Could you just talk a little
bit about that, instead of going out with your heads down and walking off
solemnly, could you talk about how you acknowledged your fans?  
R.J. HUNTER: I mean, how couldn't you? They were down here like we were at
home. They brought so much energy and so much just support. Every time we went
somewhere it seemed like they were there. They were loud and they were proud.
I think they understand what we did, too. I just told our guys in the locker
room, man, if you're crying, it's tears of joy because we completely just
turned the culture at Georgia State.  
  
KEVIN WARE: I mean, they've been here for us all year. Honestly we just had to
pay our respects. That's as much as I can say honestly. I'm kind of a little
upset over here, honestly.  
  
Q. Is there one lasting memory that you have from spending the week here
in Jacksonville?  
R.J. HUNTER: This whole thing, man. I tried to suck it all in. My first time
in the NCAA Tournament, I dreamed about this moment, and it came to me, and
God blessed me with a crazy week, man, the best week of my life. There's been
so much going on. I can't wait to just sit down and digest it, man, and not
worry about the next game. It's bittersweet right now.  
  
Q. Coach Hunter, have you ever faced a team that has gone 81 percent in
the second half?  
KEVIN WARE: What?  
  
COACH RON HUNTER: No. (Laughter). But they almost had to play the perfect
game. I thought our game plan was great. If they had just made a couple
mistakes here and there, and they just didn't. They couldn't crack. We just
kept talking about if we could just get them to crack. Kudos to them. They
beat us, we didn't beat ourselves. We can walk away a little bit more proud
because they beat us instead of us getting beat.  
  
Q. Kevin, I know you're upset, so a two-part question. What bothers you
the most right now, and could you sum up the whole experience of getting back
to the tournament two years later?  
KEVIN WARE: I mean, I was just confident that eventually they would crack,
like Coach said. We were here Thursday against Baylor, and nothing went wrong.
They're an excellent team. Like Coach said, we didn't beat ourselves, they
beat us. We can digest that and we can take that in, but it's just still like,
man, we were right there, and that's just really how I feel about it.  
  
Q. And your experience being down here for the tournament?  
KEVIN WARE: This was great. I couldn't ask for a better group of guys. R.J. is
like a brother to me, even if we're not related. Coach Hunter is like a dad,
and I couldn't ask for a better group of guys to do it with. It's been a long,
hard season, but I'm so thankful for these guys. I've matured because of these
players, and I couldn't ask for a better group.  
  
Q. R.J., you talked about your next game. Fill us in on where your next
game is going to be.  
R.J. HUNTER: I have no idea, man, but again, I just can't wait to sit down and
talk about this with my family and just talk about the season. Nothing else is
on my mind, man. This is history, and like I said, I can't wait to just go to
sleep and wake up without any texts about being here, being there. Just
excited to just reflect on this.  
  
Q. Coach, I saw you walking off the court with your arm around your son.
You've been able to coach as a father and a coach. It's been a unique time for
you. How do you put that into words?  
COACH RON HUNTER: You really can't. I said it yesterday, man, if you're a dad,
just go home and hug your kid, man. This is a special thing. The one thing
that I got from this is that you don't take these things for granted. I don't
know if we'll ever get a chance to do that again. The next day isn't promised
to you. I've said it before, he's a really, really good player, but guys, he
is a much better son, and that's the fun part. I just want to enjoy it, and I
did. I wanted to win games here, we were able to win one and not the second
one. But the second goal was, and I attained that, I wanted to be a coach this
week, I wanted to coach my kid and be a dad, and I was a dad, and I
accomplished that.  
  
Q. Coach, Ryan gave you some pretty good minutes at the end of the first
half. Was he just not able to go late in the game, hurting a little bit too
much?  
COACH RON HUNTER: Yeah, we kind of pushed it a little bit and we knew we were
going to do that. He did a great job of keeping us in the game a little bit
early, made some big shots. It was just so hard for him. Defensively we were
worried because they just went by him, he couldn't even move laterally. So
when we got down in the second half, we knew it was going to be hard because
we had to get stops. They were playing so great offensively and we had to get
stops. If you had told me he was going to play 19 minutes, we had no intention
of that getting done. I'm proud that he gave that effort today to step up and
come out and play.  
  
Q. When you see a team shoot like that, especially in the second half,
talk about the adjustments that you guys made. Obviously there was a lot of
time-outs taken, so in those time-outs what did you tell your team about
making adjustments on defense?  
COACH RON HUNTER: We the first thing we do defensively is tried to get a
disconnect between point guard and coach and we've been able to do that for
the most part all year. Dee Davis was terrific, he was absolutely terrific,
and he was able to stabilize the team. I thought he played great. Our game
plan really worked to be honest with you. We took the Big Fella completely out
of the game for the most part to be honest with you. We spaced and those kind
of things, but Dee Davis was the key. He ran that team, and in my opinion he's
one of the top five point guards in the country.  
  
Q. R.J. was talking about he doesn't know where his next game is going
to be, and that's tough for you. How much tougher is that conversation when
he's your son as opposed to just another player going to the draft?  
COACH RON HUNTER: I will tell you this, I will be 100 percent dad with this,
and again, there are a lot of factors. I know it's not a foregone conclusion.
There are a lot of things that will go into this. We will do this, though, and
R.J. and I have agreed to this, we are going to make this decision fairly
quickly for a lot of different reasons. This isn't going to be something where
it's going to be long drawn out, whatever. As a family we're going to make
this decision very quickly.

_JACKSONVILLE, FLORIDA_  
  

XAVIER - 75  
GEORGIA STATE - 67

COACH CHRIS MACK: Coming into the game the thing we felt like was probably the
most important aspect of how we handled ourselves on the floor was being able
to limit our turnovers, and we didn't do as good of a job as we needed to in
the first half. When we did take care of the ball, we got great shots. We shot
such a high percentage from the field, and, you know, it's one thing to talk
about it and prepare in a 24-hour period of time. Your guys have been through
the wars. It's hard to really go full speed in a practice the day before you
play such a meaningful game. It took our guys, I think, a half to realize how
much of a gambling attitude and type of style of play that Georgia State
employs. In the second half we go four turnovers and we continue to shoot a
really high percentage from the field. I thought all these guys up here had
terrific nights. Dee has been playing as well as any point guard I've coached
for the last month and a half of the season. He makes us go. Myles who hasn't
shot it well down the stretch, I thought his two buckets the other day were
huge for his confidence. He didn't miss a shot in shootaround today and was
lights out today. Jalen was a man inside, did a great job of being able to
finish, and I don't know how many centers that you can have around college
basketball that you can feel equally comfortable with him on the perimeter as
in the post. Matt calms us down and does a great job of being able to
recognize what kind of pressure they're putting, what kind of zone they're
putting on our team, and find the right guys. I'm tremendously proud of this
group. The older guys have been through a lot, and they've continued to
maintain our culture and believe in one another, and really excited to be
moving on.  
  
 Q. Myles, you guys missed three shots in the second half and I reckon
my question is, "Are you kidding me?" 88 percent, miss three shots. What kind
of offense do you have to be running out there and what kind of mindset do you
have to be in to pull that off?  
MYLES DAVIS: Well, I didn't even know we only missed three shots in the second
half. That's crazy. I think the best part about this team is that we are a
very unselfish group of guys. You can get a different scorer every night, and
the best part about it is we're going to give each other confidence and
confidence and tell each other to keep shooting as much as possible. We just
stuck with it, and I'm so proud of this group of guys, and I just love being
on this team right now.  
  
 Q. Dee, you've been through so much during your time at Xavier, and to
get back to the Sweet 16 now for the first time since your freshman year, what
does that feel like for you.  
DEE DAVIS: It's a great feeling. Like he said, we've been through a lot. My
freshman year we made it to the Sweet 16, you know, with Tu Holloway. You
know, the initial point guard played a lot of minutes so I was more so
watching him and I just did my part. Being able to do my senior year and
having a major role on the team, it feels great.  
  
 Q. Their coach said that the biggest thing they tried to do was confuse
opponents and make a disconnect between the point guard and his coach, but you
were immune to that today. How were you able to weather that storm?  
DEE DAVIS: Oh, no, we always stay connected. We've got to know what each other
is thinking. That's my job as a point guard is to be a coach on the floor. I
didn't feel any disconnect at all.  
  
 Q. Matt and Jalen, I noticed in the post that you guys seemed to have a
lot of chemistry down there, working with the bigs and you getting the
rebounds, Matt, and Jalen, putting it in the basket. How did you develop such
a chemistry? You guys pretty much seemed like you took control of the post.  
JALEN REYNOLDS: I would say Coach Pegues, that's the way he prepares us, just
taking our time down there, trying to get the shot we want, and just trying to
finish through contact.  
  
MATT STAINBROOK: Yeah, a lot of it is patience and trust. I know Jalen is a
really good player, and I think he equally thinks the same about me, where we
don't care who's scoring, we just want someone scoring. And I always have
trust in him when I give him the ball and cut to the hoop and dive that he's
going to finish the play, he's going to score the bucket, take care of the
ball. I think a lot of it's patience, trust, and we've practiced a lot
together and have good chemistry.  
  
 Q. Jalen, you mentioned after the Ole Miss game that you kind of wanted
to put that game behind you. It wasn't your best game. To come out and have
one of your best, what was working well for you and can you talk about your
reaction there at the end when you fell to the floor in ecstasy?  
JALEN REYNOLDS: First and foremost, just want to thank God because without him
we obviously wouldn't be doing what we're doing right now. I just knew how bad
I wanted to win this game, how bad my teammates wanted to win this game, so I
knew I had to step my game up, and it turned out well.  
  
 Q. Chris, I just looked at some numbers, and I believe that heading
into this tournament, eight of the last nine games you've played you've played
against opponents in the Big East, including the tournament, who at one time
had been ranked in the top 25 in the nation. In order to finish games like
this, what kind of benefit is that to be able to play in a league like that
all year long and get that kind of experience?  
COACH CHRIS MACK: Well, it certainly helps because you're put in a ton of
those situations down the stretch. Virtually every game that we play and have
played has been a close game. Even if the margin says 10 or 12, that simply
isn't the case. You're talking about a two, three possession game with a
couple minutes left and free throws maybe ice it, being able to get the
basketball into the guys, the right people at the right time, and again, we
played some tremendous teams. I think we've been put in a lot of situations.
When you have seniors, and again, I keep saying it, but Dee has seen a million
different zone defenses, presses, end of the game situations. Matt, as well.
They calm your team down. They settle your team down, and I thought down the
stretch we did a great job against the pressing and trapping and steal the
ball type team.  
  
 Q. Coach, I was just wondering, as good as y'all were on offense,
Georgia State still was scoring the ball effectively. Are you worried about
how you played defensively this game?  
COACH CHRIS MACK: We didn't play our best. You know, Georgia State had
something to do with that. They've got an NBA prospect that a couple of his
shots were 26, 27, 28 feet. We tried to go back and forth a little bit between
zone and man. They did a good job attacking. Ryan Harrow changes the
complexion of the game when he's on the floor because he's so quick, he's so
explosive. They have three players, R.J. Hunter could have played anywhere in
the country out of high school, Kevin Ware did, played at Louisville, and then
Ryan Harrow, you know, NC State to Kentucky. Those guys are legitimate high
major players, and there was a lot on the line. They wanted to win. I'm proud
of our group that we were able to make the plays when we had to.  
  
 Q. Chris, your thoughts on playing Sean in the Sweet 16, and then also
just curious when you talk about maintaining the culture, how tough is it to
maintain the culture while also, during the transition, making sure the
program is yours and not his?  
COACH CHRIS MACK: You know, it wasn't necessarily tough to maintain the first
couple years, but we hit some speed bumps, some self-inflicted, others not. We
had a couple ineligibility rulings that I thought were unfair at the time and
still have issue with, but it's in the past. And we were down to eight
scholarship players, and we're playing walk-ons in Dee's sophomore year, and
it was very, very difficult. But these guys continued to come to practice
every day, believe in one another, believe in our message, and we've got more
players on scholarship that have gotten better under the leadership that these
guys have provided. As far as playing Sean, it's really tough. I don't think
it's tough for anybody up on the stage because they don't really know Sean.
They didn't recruit him. I recruited all these guys that play for me. But Sean
gave me a heck of an opportunity to come back to my alma mater. He put a lot
of responsibility and trust in me. He ultimately really pushed for me to
become the head coach, and for that I'm eternally grateful. It's hard to play
against one of your best friends in the business. But it really won't matter
to our guys, nor will it matter to Arizona, because they don't know me from a
bucket of paint.  
  
 Q. Chris, I don't know if one of those eligibility issues has anything
to do with Jalen, if that's one of the guys you're referring to, but what does
it mean to see him have a game like he had tonight, considering what he's had
to overcome in his career there?  
COACH CHRIS MACK: Yeah, I'm really proud of Jalen on a couple levels. You
know, number one, and I think Dee and Matt can attest to it, when Jalen was
first starting with us as a freshman, he had a real tough time remembering
defensive principles and where to be on offense. And the growth that Jalen
Reynolds has had in that sense, they always talk about how the game slows down
for guys as they get older. It's really slowed down for him. He knows when he
makes a mistake now defensively. He has gotten so much better. You know,
that's on a larger scale. If I flip it and talk about a smaller scale, Jalen
played terrible against Ole Miss, and he put his head down and he was really
disappointed in his play, and we talked a lot between games about just having
a next-play mentality. And for him to turn around and have his best game after
the performance he had against Ole Miss, says a lot about his resiliency and
the message getting through. Our team needs him. If he plays at a high level,
there aren't many power forwards in the country that are better than him.  
  
 Q. Matt, a question for you. You played at two schools, but came into
this tournament without a win in the NCAA Tournament. Now you have two heading
to the Sweet 16. How special is that for you personally and what is special
about this team, do you think here, in the last four weeks or so?  
MATT STAINBROOK: Yeah, no, it's really special. It's something where, on the
ride over, I was trying to explain to some of the freshmen that this
opportunity doesn't come a lot. I spent two years at Western Michigan and we
didn't do anything. I spent my first year here, we made it barely and nothing
happened, and making the Sweet 16 is not something that's really common among
teams. I think our team is doing a good job of realizing that and taking the
opportunity for what it's worth. You know, what's really special about our
team is that we've grown a ton. I think at the beginning of the season we were
a little -- not battle tested. We were a little -- had a learning curve, and
over the season, we've done a good job of learning from our mistakes and
getting a lot better. I think it's great that the Big East has been able to
test us with some really tough teams, and I think the fact that we've grown as
a team together has made us really special at this point.  
  
 Q. We've been watching the NCAA for a few years now, so my question is
for Coach Mack and Mr. Davis. How do you remain poised going back to college
next week, the student body, the campus, everybody is going to be going
bananas. Are you going to get enough sleep as you prepare for the next
situation?  
COACH CHRIS MACK: Honestly, we won't be around campus that much. We're going
to get back here probably late tonight. The coaches will take the next 48
hours to really get up to speed with a system that we know fairly well, but
personnel that we don't. These guys will be in classes on Monday and we'll be
flying out on Tuesday, so our time on campus will be very, very brief. I guess
that's why we'll handle it. But these players next to me, they came to Xavier
in large part because the expectation is to get to the tournament, is to
advance, is to be relevant, is to be on the big stage. I don't think anybody
is going to be awed in any sense of the imagination about being on a bigger
stage.  
  
DEE DAVIS: For me personally I don't have too many classes. I've got one at
1:00 p.m. so I'm going to have a lot of sleeping time. I think our guys are
going to be fine. I think we're on a fine line right now, made it to the Sweet
16 for my second time. I'm going to make sure that they're ready, and I'm
pretty sure Matt is going to do the same thing. I'm not too worried about us
getting rest.  
  
 Q. Jalen, kind of similar to what I asked Coach, but you had to go
through a lot of adversity in your career to get to this point. How were you
able to stay focused and remain on track and kind of keep your head looking
forward?  
JALEN REYNOLDS: Well, just a system that they prepare for us, it's just an
everyday thing. Just obviously putting it behind me and just moving forward.
Just kind of can't let things affect you, just keep moving forward and focus
on what's more important, and that's winning games and being the best I can
be.

_JACKSONVILLE, FLORIDA_  
  

NORTH CAROLINA - 87  
ARKANSAS - 78

COACH MIKE ANDERSON: Well, first of all, congratulate North Carolina. I
thought it was a hard-fought game by two teams that were trying to get to the
Sweet 16, and we just ended up on the short end of it. Now, the two things
that stand out in my mind that really didn't let us get over that hump was the
unforced turnovers. We had a bunch of unforced turnovers which is very
uncharacteristic of our team. We only average, I think, 11 turnovers a game.
So that was part of it. And then they got points off of that, so you talk
about points off turnovers and then you also talk about some offensive
rebounds where they got points off offensive rebounds. Those were big stats,
and then you look at the free-throw line, they made their free throws. Kudos
to Coach Roy Williams and his team as they continue to advance. Paige, a
tremendous player. They made plays when they had to, but it wasn't because
these guys had a lack of effort. I was really proud of our effort. A lot of
people didn't think we'd be here, but we got here, and the one thing I said, I
didn't want to just get to the dance, I wanted to dance. And we danced a
little bit, we did the one step. But I promise you in the future we're going
to do a lot more stepping because the foundation has been laid, basketball is
big time revelling at the University of Arkansas.  
  
Q. Bobby or Michael, could you talk about the impact that Marcus Paige
had in the second half? You held him to 1 of 8 shooting in the first half, but
he kind of went off during that stretch midway through the second half which
was kind of the difference in the game.  
BOBBY PORTIS: He just did what big time players do, stepped up for their
basketball team when they needed him to. In the first half he kind of
struggled, but in the second half he came in for his basketball team and
started being a leader and started being more dynamic on the court. Congrats
to him for stepping up and being that leader for his basketball team.  
  
Q. How disappointing is it to come so far and play so well and just fall
a little bit short tonight?  
RASHAD MADDEN: I mean, it hurts to lose the game, especially the type of thing
that we're playing for. We're playing for a championship, so it hurts a lot to
lose right now.  
  
MICHAEL QUALLS: Yeah, you know, just to back up what he just said, you just
want to play for the seniors because it's their last ride. We just came, fell
short. That's life. You get knocked down, you're going to get back up again.
It hurts now, it's going to hurt for a while, maybe hurt until the first game
of the next season. But North Carolina, they came to play, and they just
wanted it a little bit more than we did.  
  
BOBBY PORTIS: It's a bad feeling because just to wake up every morning at 5:00
a.m., and run in the morning time, and practice in the morning time, and go as
hard as we did, and for this to be our last game, I feel like it hurts me a
lot just because now we have to wait until a whole 'nother season to play
another game. It hurts a lot.  
  
Q. For Mike and Ky, what do you think was the problem with the turnovers
because that's very uncharacteristic?  
RASHAD MADDEN: Probably trying to get ahead of ourselves, trying to make too
many plays. We had to settle down and try to make the correct ones, but it
happens in the game of basketball.  
  
Q. The first half was played up and down real fast-paced, entertaining.
Second half slowed to a crawl. How much did that affect you, the whistles, and
just not being able to have some consistency?  
MICHAEL QUALLS: You know, that was a big part of it, not really being able to
get after it because we would probably have a spin, then a turnover, then the
ref would blow his whistle, so we couldn't really get after it how we really
wanted to. Fatigue just can play a factor because we didn't get the stretches
that we needed to go up and down, up and down. The ball was stopping every
couple, 40 seconds. Then that takes away a lot of what we want to do. We want
to tire the other team down, and with that, it couldn't really never happen.
We couldn't just get into our groove. It was just key for them tonight.  
  
Q. Could you just echo what Coach said about laying a foundation this
season? I know it's tough right now, but just looking back at the season and
looking ahead to what you guys did this year moving forward?  
RASHAD MADDEN: Well, for me, just laying it, it feels great. Where I come
from, we didn't really win too many games my freshman year, and to be here
now, it means a lot, and I hope these guys continue to take it up.  
  
MICHAEL QUALLS: Coach did a great job. It's not the end. Like I say, Arkansas
basketball is trending in the right direction. We didn't make it to where we
wanted to make it this year, but as you can see, every year it's a lot of
improvement. I have the utmost faith in this program. I know Coach will get
the program headed in the right direction.  
  
BOBBY PORTIS: Just making progress every year. Last year our team went to the
NIT and then we came this year and made it to the 32, so hopefully next year
our team can just make their stride and try to win that National Championship.  
  
Q. Paige, I think they had a 17-4 and Paige scored 11. Seemed like he
kind of took over the game at that point.  
COACH MIKE ANDERSON: Yeah, he did, and as Bobby said, that's what great
players do. They take that lead, they take that charge. We did a good job of
really finding him in the first half. In the second half we had some
assignments where guys should have been out there with him, because he has
pretty unlimited range and he knocked down a couple of shots. And before you
know it, it kind of put us back on our heels. But again, that's what good
players do.  
  
Q. Following up on what the players said, I know it's a tough loss
tonight, but overall how do you feel about the season and moving forward?  
COACH MIKE ANDERSON: Well, the hardest thing is I've got two seniors, Ky and
Alandise and this is their last game. And there's a lot of emotion in that
because they're Arkansas kids and they've had the best year that's taken place
in Arkansas in many, many, many years. My mindset with those guys, the last
game they went out fighting and lost to a very good North Carolina basketball
team. How they went out, to me, that's the disappointing thing. The things
that we value with our basketball team, we came up short doing that. So I feel
like I let them down, but at the end of the day, they went out fighting. But I
just think these guys have done a tremendous job this year of staying focused.
The one thing about it is that, as the season progressed, we never got ahead
of ourselves, even as we got to the NCAA Tournament. They took the one-game,
one-mindset approach, one game at a time, and so the Wofford game, a team
that's very experienced, and we saw their experience on display. Our guys were
able to weather the storm and find a way to win. All that does is gives you
confidence even as we came into this game. And just think, we had 21 turnovers
and we're right where we needed to be. We gave up 20 some odd points off of
offensive rebounds, I mean, second chance points, and you're losing by nine,
ten, whatever it is. We're right there in the ballgame. That tells me our guys
have really taken heed to the things that we've been trying to teach them. But
it's been a very good year. It's been a very good year, and there's room for
improvement. We've got a great base coming back, and that's the thing I'm
really excited about. We'll add some more pieces, but again, I just think the
nation got a chance to see the Arkansas Razorbacks on display.  
  
Q. What did North Carolina do defensively to force the 21 turnovers, or
was it a case to some extent of also some unforced errors?  
COACH MIKE ANDERSON: I think a lot of them were unforced. You think about
Alandise, he started off with like two and turned his back to a guy. We had
three or four travels. We had nine turnovers in the first half and that's
unheard of. They went to the zone, that slowed us down a little bit. We had
balls slipping out of our hands. We'd steal it and we'd throw it right back to
them. Those things happen in a game. But I thought it was an entertaining
game, at least that first half was really entertaining. It slowed down a bit
in the second half. But they're long, they're athletic, they get in the
passing lane. They do a good job of that. But I thought a lot of those
turnovers were really unforced by our basketball team.  
  
Q. Do you like teams that play as fast as you guys do, or does that
somewhat negate the advantage --  
COACH MIKE ANDERSON: No, I thought it was a great match-up. They had a few
more players -- when you talk about some of the guys that play real well for
them, Justin Jackson, Paige, Tokoto. You talk about those guys and what they
brought. I thought their bench played well for them. It was just a case where
they had a little bit more in the tank or they made a few more plays -- they
shot a lot more free throws than we did. I know that. That was the difference.
I thought it was a game that we matched up well, they matched up with us.
That's what you want in a college basketball game. I was looking forward to
the opportunity to get up and down the floor and guys not holding the
basketball. They attacked us. Guess what? We attacked them as well.  
  
Q. Have you had any conversations with Bobby and Mike about whether
they're coming back or moving on, or do you have a sense for which way they
may be leaning?  
COACH MIKE ANDERSON: No, we haven't had that conversation. Now that the season
is over with, we'll sit down and we'll visit. Right now these guys, they just
lost on the big stage. They're very, very disappointed. And so the worst thing
to do is go to them right now. But we'll sit down, we'll have some dialogue,
and it'll be some productive dialogue, I'm sure.  
  
Q. You mentioned it briefly, but the match-up, the two high-speed teams,
there were like 80 possessions in the first half and then they threw the zone
at you. Do you feel like they had to do it to slow you guys down?  
COACH MIKE ANDERSON: Well, they did a good job. It slowed us down to an extent
and made us try to execute. Even with that we still had some bad turnovers
that took place against their zone, and they ran out of it. It just changed
the rhythm of the game. Here we are, we want to speed it up, and we went to
some zone as well, maybe not as effective. But I thought the thing that really
disrupted the game was a lot of free throws, a lot of whistles, a lot of free
throws, and that -- it was almost opposite of the first half. The first half
they let them play, and I guess in the second half they said, let's slow this
down, we can't keep up with them, let's slow it down.

# [NCAA MEN'S 2ND & 3RD ROUNDS:
JACKSONVILLE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+2ND+%26+3RD+ROUNDS%3A+JACKSONVILLE)

  

## March 20, 2015

  

### [Justin Jackson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26736)

### [J.P. Tokoto](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28484)

### [Roy Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14130)

  
_JACKSONVILLE, FLORIDA_  
  
Q. For both guys, I think last night Harvard outscored y'all something
like 27-5 in points off turnovers. That's a stat Arkansas really thrives on.
How concerned are you guys after what happened last night going into a game
against a team like Arkansas?  
J.P. TOKOTO: Not too concerned about it. We know what we did wrong. We had
some turnovers that were unforced and that we're not worried about making this
next game. Easily fixed errors that we worked on today, we worked on the
press, press offense, and going to get prepared for what they throw at us.  
  
 Q. The turnovers were obviously an issue last night, but at the same
time you out-rebounded Harvard and you shot 55 percent and yet the tone seemed
to be, boy, we played poorly. Were there some bright spots that you can take
out of last night's game other than the win?  
JUSTIN JACKSON: I think the bright spot is we came out with the win.
Defensively we didn't play like we wanted to the entire game. Like you said,
we still had some good stats, but there were some things that we easily could
change, and that we have changed in practice, and that we're going to get
ready to play against Arkansas next game.  
  
J.P. TOKOTO: Kind of piggy-backing off what he said, just our resiliency. We
did have a few turnovers and they hit a couple tough shots down the stretch,
and after that four-point play, most people kind of counted us out, and we
kept fighting, got some boards. They missed some shots fortunately, and we
just kept going. Like I said, we're not really worried about the turnover
thing for the next game. We know what we can do, we know we can take care of
the ball, we know we can attack under control. That's what we're going to look
to do.  
  
 Q. I know you didn't get a chance to watch a lot of games yesterday,
but there were so many close ones. Why do you think this tournament has seen
the amount of upsets it's had, the close games it's had?  
J.P. TOKOTO: It's the best of the best. I said this two days ago in an
interview, there's no easy games in this tournament. Everybody is here for a
reason, whether they played into it or throughout the whole season earned
their spot in it. So I mean, in my eyes, there's really no upset, it's really
just a number beside a game. Every team deserves to be here, so you've got to
come with it every night when you play.  
  
 Q. Is there anybody that y'all play this year in the ACC or non-
conference this year that reminds you of Arkansas? Their style is pretty
unorthodox. How hard is that on a one-day turnaround to get ready for a team
that is really going to be in your face the whole game?  
JUSTIN JACKSON: I think there are a lot of teams like them as far as -- the
biggest thing that Arkansas does is they just play hard. We played Louisville,
Virginia, all those teams play just as hard as they do. As far as the way they
play, as much as they press and the amount of pressure that they put on us,
we've played basketball long enough to be able just to make plays. We'll run
through everything we need to run through, but whenever it comes down to it,
it's just hard and just making plays.  
  
 Q. What do you guys know about Bobby Portis? Is there anybody that
you've played against that reminds you of Bobby Portis?  
J.P. TOKOTO: What we do know about him is he was SEC Player of the Year. He
earned it, looking at his stats and the way he played. Coach gave us a crazy
stat, something like he shoots 52, 56 percent from the field, while being
doubled-teamed. Our bigs get double-teamed every now and then, but it's a
night-in, night-out thing for him. He makes tough plays and he's known for it,
so going into this game, he's going to hit tough shots. He's going to be ready
for what we throw at him. We've just got to keep playing through it. As far as
anybody we've played against so far, I mean, I don't guard 4 man or 5 man, so
I couldn't really tell you.  
  
 Q. You guys are pretty young. Arkansas and North Carolina have a pretty
decent history, they've played four or five times in the NCAAs. How do you
look at Arkansas as a program because you guys are obviously one of the blue
bloods?  
JUSTIN JACKSON: I mean, last night Coach told us, I guess, it was back
whenever he was at Kansas, he played against Arkansas, and it was a great game
in the tournament. Obviously we know Arkansas is a great team for them to even
be here. So we're just trying to prepare, get ready for them, and we've just
got to go out there and play.  
  
J.P. TOKOTO: What we do know about them is that they play extremely hard and
that's what their MO is and that's what they're know for, playing extremely
hard, and they're very athletic. Can't have any let downs tomorrow. You spoke
on the turnovers and we've got to take care of the ball because that's where
they get most of their points is off turnovers. That's one of the things
that's hurt us all season. If we can buckle down, focus, and play the way we
know how to play -- and that's the correct way -- we'll be just fine.  
  
 Q. Did Coach Williams happen to mention the last time he played
Arkansas he beat them 108 to 77 in 2008?  
J.P. TOKOTO: He didn't give us any numbers like that. He did give us a couple
stories.  
  
 Q. Why would he mention the game at KU and not the last time he played
them?  
J.P. TOKOTO: His point was that they have a history of playing extremely hard
and playing smart, and he was just telling us how they get their points and
kind of going over an overview of what the team is like. We only have two days
to prepare for them, so he's throwing a lot of different stuff at us, and this
was before we went over personnel and everything and the scouting report. He
was just kind of giving us a little history of it.  
  
 Q. You are one win behind Coach Smith in NCAA Tournament wins, and I
know you probably don't think about that kind of stuff, but does that number
mean anything to you?  
COACH ROY WILLIAMS: Well, it does now. I didn't know it beforehand. Wow. You
know, the other night after a game in the ACC Tournament, they told me that we
had passed or tied Coach Allen, Dr. Allen, and I didn't realize that, and I
didn't realize this about Coach Smith. I really do appreciate those kind of
long-standing records. But please remember what I said, that we were able to
pass Doc Allen, and if we win, we have a chance to tie Coach Smith, because
that's the way I look at it. If you find anybody that says, Roy Williams says,
oh, I've won such and such, that's a lie, because I've never said that. But I
do really love the tradition and the history of college basketball, so that's
a pretty neat deal. I don't think I'm going to put any extra pressure on my
team, though, because they look at it like it's my record, and that's not what
it is.  
  
 Q. We've talked a lot about fouling too much, not shooting enough foul
shots, and why that's happened. Does that stat kind of speak to the kind of
core of your philosophies of just pounding it inside, why it's an important
stat? Does it remind you of anything else you've seen?  
COACH ROY WILLIAMS: Well, it's been the most, if not the most important
offensive stat in my entire 27 years as a head coach. You go back to the
really, really, really good years in 2005, Sean May fouled out half of
Illinois team. You go back to 2009, Tyler Hansbrough fouled out half the
United States, and we were pretty doggone good. It's always been something I
truly, truly believed in. The difference is this year is we're just making so
many little silly fouls, and that just drives me crazy. You reach in and touch
a guy on his little pinky as he lays it up, so it's a three-point play. We
had, who was it, I guess it was Duke, we gave them three old-time three-point
plays just by barely reaching in. That probably drives me more crazy than
anything. But we need to be more aggressive attacking the basket with our post
players and our drives to the basket both. But I really have -- you can go
back and listen to any press conference from 10 years ago, 20 years ago, I've
always thought that you want to get to the free-throw line more than your
opponent. It's always a reason I believed in getting the ball inside. In 2005
at the end of the game, Illinois's center was sitting out. He was not in the
game; he had already had five fouls. So my philosophy is the more you get
fouled, the greater chance you have of their better players not being in the
game at the end.  
  
 Q. You guys had a lot of turnovers last night, Arkansas likes to turn
people over. How concerning is that stat, and just what's your take on
Arkansas and their style and pressure?  
COACH ROY WILLIAMS: Well, there's no question, if we turn it over at the same
rate we did last night, we won't have anybody left at the end of the game,
including the head coach, because we're going to fight somebody, and that
usually means our players. If we turned it over 17 times last night in, gosh,
I think I saw a 60-something possession game, it's going to be more than 60
possessions tomorrow, so we understand that. That's -- 50 percent of our
practice discussion out there on the court was not turning the basketball
over. I don't mind some turnovers. Coach Wooden used to say he didn't mind
turnovers at all, which I do. I'm not going that far because Coach Wooden
thought that meant you were trying to accomplish something. But some of ours
are like our fouls. They're just silly turnovers. We've got to stay away from
the silly turnovers. We've got to make sure if they're pressing that we've
want to attack. Because if they're going to get a turnover, we've got to get
some lay-ups at the other end, also. I've been -- one of my greatest friends
in coaching for a long time was Nolan Richardson. I've known Michael forever.
I used to go up to Arkansas and play in their college coaches' golf
tournament. I love the way they play. We've got to turn our motor up higher
than it's been all year long. We've got to turn up our intensity higher than
it's been all year long. We've got to turn up our toughness because you're
going to be double-teamed, you're going to be triple-teamed, you can't start
crying for mama, come help you. You've got to be ready to play.  
  
 Q. Some of your players were talking about how you brought up the '82
52-50 game against James Madison last night, and they were talking about some
of the anecdotes that you just constantly pull out. Is that a personality
trait in terms of story telling? Is that something you picked up as a coaching
tactic years ago?  
COACH ROY WILLIAMS: I'm sure it's a personality trait because I talk too much,
but also I want guys to understand things are okay. I didn't like the look on
our guys' faces last night when they sat down in front of me at that time-out
like they were about to panic, like oh, my gosh. I explained to them that this
is NCAA Tournament play. In 1982 we had a guy name Worthy and a guy named
Perkins and a guy named Jordan, and we absolutely blew out James Madison
52-50, to get them to realize that what was happening is I didn't expect
Harvard to quit, I expected us to play better. I didn't expect us to give up a
four-point play. I didn't expect us to miss two one-and-ones and all that kind
of stuff. So I think it is a personality trait. But last night specifically,
and a lot of times I do it, is just to tell them things are okay. You can go
back and watch it, not that you should, but in 2005 I called a time-out right
-- three minutes left in the game. And they came over and I said, I don't have
anything to say to you, I just wanted you to rest for a second, and God, isn't
this fun, we're getting ready to win a National Championship. It depends on
what's going on, but yeah, I talk too much, too.  
  
 Q. There was a story by North Carolina alumnus, S.L. Price in this
week's Sports Illustrated questioning whether Carolina had lost its way trying
to balance athletics and academics with regard to the scandal and what's been
going on. As a coach, what is your message to either recruits or Carolina
supporters or just casual observers who see stuff like this and may infer that
Carolina has lost its way in that regard?  
COACH ROY WILLIAMS: Well, we've been going through this, I call it stuff. I
used to say junk and people didn't necessarily like that, so I'll stick with
the stuff. We've been going through this for three years, seems like a
lifetime. Carolina has not lost its way. There are things in college athletics
that people may think don't fit together. I happen to think they do fit
together. I think that you can have a great academic institution and have a
great athletic program. That doesn't mean that it's impossible to make
mistakes. I said our University, we had some mistakes. I'm very proud of my
degree. My son and daughter went there. I'm very proud of the degree they
have. I have a five-year-old and a three-year-old grandson, and I hope like
crazy they go to school there and I'll be extremely proud of their degree.
Some people's attitudes or ideas are out in Never-Never Land and think
everything in the world is perfect. I don't happen to think everything in the
world is perfect, but you can make really, really positive things if you
really want to. I walked by a building over here, and there was a building, I
wondered, did they run out of money or something? What happened? They had a
mistake, concrete didn't work, part of it fell in, so now it's all up in
trials and everything. That doesn't mean that building things have gone to
crap. You just have things that are mistakes that you can't do over. It's not
like golf. I love to play golf. I don't take Mulligans, okay, but you can't do
that. But no, I disagree. I don't think Carolina has lost its way. Carolina
had some mistakes. We've made so many changes, it's unbelievable, on our
campus. Right now, if I decided I wanted to go to the Chart House tonight for
dinner, I've got to get the approval of 12 committees and the disciples of the
Lord before I can go. And that's okay. But, no, I disagree, I don't think
Carolina has lost its way. I think our degree, our educational institution is
one of the most fantastic places in the world.  
  
 Q. Have you noticed any kind of effect?  
COACH ROY WILLIAMS: Oh, not just that article. For three years, we've been
putting up with some of the negative recruiting by other schools. We've been
putting up with some things that aren't very pleasant. But we're still
playing.  
  
 Q. Coach, you said you wanted your bigs to get away from those
turnaround jumpers and fadeaways, but isn't a lot of that part of Brice's
game, that little soft jumper?  
COACH ROY WILLIAMS: Well, think about -- go back and think who I've said that
the most about, Kennedy. Have you seen many of Kennedy's turnaround fall-away
jumpers go in? I haven't, either, so that's one thing I'm really bad -- I
don't like those things. Brice is a turnaround jump shooter. I want him to get
closer position to get in tighter to make more of them. But Kennedy last
night, he takes one of those, why would you do that? It just doesn't make
sense. He's guarded by a guy that looks like me, and he's shooting fall-away
turnaround jump shots. Thank goodness for Tommy's club there was nobody on
Harvard's roster that looked like me. That's the whole thing is we want Brice
to get lower because I'll tell you what, Brice makes more dunks than he does
turnarounds, so the closer he gets the better he is. Kennedy is the one that
shoots -- to be honest with you, get Joel on the right block, he turns to his
left shoulder and shoots that shot, I don't say much to him because a lot of
times that sucker goes in.  
  
 Q. I'm sure that you like to believe or hope that you have everybody's
attention at a high level at all times, but it's human nature. Do you think
with last night's game, did you sense that you really had their attention
today in practice, that maybe there's -- their eyes are open just a little
wider and their ears are open a little wider?  
COACH ROY WILLIAMS: I don't know that I've ever gotten my club's full
attention. You've got to know them. They're a bunch of goofballs. But the
attention to detail in practice today was pretty doggone good. In regards to
what you say and how much you try to praise Harvard's club, they think it's
Harvard, and that's bad. You should respect everyone, fear no one. That's what
I tell them all the time. But they also saw how aggressive those clips were on
TV about Arkansas and know that a little bit. We did have their attention
today pretty doggone good.  
  
 Q. So as badly as you felt last night, do you feel really good now
about going into tomorrow night?  
COACH ROY WILLIAMS: No, because I've seen Arkansas play. They're scary. They
really are. And some of the clubs this year, we played Louisville at
Louisville in the last ten minutes of regulation. And in the overtime, their
frenetic pace and the aggressiveness really hurt us, so we've got to make sure
that doesn't happen. But to your question, we had a pretty doggone good
attention span this morning in practice.  
  
 Q. Roy, with the exception of Jackson and Stillman, nobody in that room
has been to the second week of this tournament. How important is it for those
kids for Marcus and Brice and that group to experience that, and from a
program standpoint, there was once a time where UNC and the Sweet 16 were
mutually exclusive, and now to get them back, what would that mean?  
COACH ROY WILLIAMS: Well, two or three answers to that. I said, Marcus, have
you ever been to the third round, J.P., have you ever been to the third round,
Brice, Joel, and the answer was no, and I knew that because I told them about
it. But it's not just our exclusive right. I was just going through the stuff
that we get. I think this may have been from the ACC, there was a five-year
period where Coach Smith's team got out of the first round once in five years.
It was '76, '77, '78, '79, '80, something like that, so it's not our exclusive
right. I didn't tell that to the kids, but you ought to feel pretty doggone
good to get in the tournament, to win a game in the tournament. You win
another game, you feel a little better, you win another game, you feel -- but
that's not a rallying cry. It's not like Bobby Frasor walking in in Detroit in
the semifinals in 2009 saying, okay, we know how we felt last year after we
laid an egg. There hasn't been any of that kind of thing.  
  
 Q. The last time Arkansas was in this tournament, they got eliminated
rather decisively by North Carolina in '08, National Championship year for you
guys. Razorback fans remember that. What do you remember about it?  
COACH ROY WILLIAMS: I can even go back farther than that because one of my
greatest feelings I ever had was '91, the first time we went to a Final Four.
We had to beat Arkansas to go there, and again, that was when Nolan was the
coach who was a great, great friend. But my guys weren't even born in '91, so
I don't talk a lot about -- they don't know what Mark Randall and Terry Brown
and Alonzo Jameson or Adonis Jordan, that was starting lineup. They don't even
know who those guys were. Last night I brought up Jordan, most guys still know
who he is. But in '08 we played really, really well. That was the weirdest
thing. I go out in the Final Four in San Antonio, I've been trying to forget
that Final Four in 2008. And as I'm walking out on the court, I said, well, we
prepared exactly like we did last week, I feel just as confident as I did last
week, and last week we were great, and I think we beat Arkansas and Louisville
to get to the Final Four that year. Wasn't a few minutes later we were down
either 28 or 38, so I've got rid of those nostalgic feelings because I'm
serious I walked out on the court and I was trying to question myself, and I
said, we are prepared just as well as we did last weekend. We are just as
ready, we are going to be great, and Kansas had us -- it was either 28 or 38
or 88, something like that in the first half, so I've forgotten about all
those years.  
  
 Q. You prepared for a lot of great players this year. What are your
impressions of Bobby Portis?  
COACH ROY WILLIAMS: I've seen Bobby a lot. I saw Bobby a lot in high school,
whether it was in the Pete's Jam or some of the national AAU type competition.
Arkansas has one of the best AAU team that really is an AAU team. Everybody
uses that to describe all of summer basketball, but the Arkansas Wings is one
of the best organizations you have in the AAU. I've watched Arkansas players
ever since I recruited a guy named Richard Scott from there 100 years ago. So
I've seen Bobby play a lot. He's a big time player, and he's very versatile,
big guy. He doesn't mind catching the ball out 15 feet from the basket and
driving to the bucket. He doesn't mind catching it out there and making a pass
to a guy cutting inside. He can get it in close to the rim. As John and I were
talking about, the can really score against you inside. He can defend his
position. He's one of the better players we'll play all year long. If I'm not
mistaken, I think I heard last night on the broadcast that he was SEC Player
of the Year and I guess only the second one. He and Corliss. I've had a chance
to coach Corliss with some international basketball, but Bobby is a big time
player.  
  
 Q. You mentioned on Mike Anderson, what have you thought about the job
Mike has done, and this is really his third big rebuilding job.  
COACH ROY WILLIAMS: Mike's best characteristic is his wife. She's really
helped him out a heck of a lot. We have some fun together on some trips. I
tried to teach her how to shoot craps one night and she won money, so she
thinks I'm a pretty good guy. Again, Michael was with Nolan forever. I think
he coaches like Nolan with the foundation and the beliefs, but he coaches like
Mike Anderson coaches. I coach like Coach Smith with the foundation and belief
that I think I'm different, and I think Michael is different. I think he's
done a great job at every step he's been. I hope I get a chance to come back
and play in their golf tournament they do for charity in the spring. And he's
just one of the good guys in the coaching profession that I've really enjoyed
and he's gone to some places and really done a good job rebuilding them. But
you can tell him I said the best thing about him was his wife.

_JACKSONVILLE, FLORIDA_  
  
Q. Guys, you've won the past four games, all pressure-filled games,
important games. At the beginning of the year, Old Dominion, Colorado State,
some of those games you had leads and couldn't hold on. What's changed the
past four games or what did you learn from those losses that you've been able
to apply?  
RYANN GREEN: We really just wanted to learn from our mistakes, and I know
early on we were a young team, we were still learning together. And I feel
like later on those lessons that -- we lost early on in the year, that really
taught us to win these games late in the year, and that's what Coach told us,
just stick through it, and it'll all work out at the end.  
  
 Q. What were the mistakes that contributed to those losses?  
RYANN GREEN: Late-game turnovers, mistakes, not rebounding the ball, a lot of
mistakes really cost us, and we really tried to fix those down the stretch.  
  
 Q. Ballpark estimate, how many times have you seen the shot?  
R.J. HUNTER: I'm going to be honest, I YouTubed it like 50 on my own, and just
watching TV, around 50 more, so I'd say roughly around 100 times.  
  
 Q. Kevin and R.J., do you guys have anybody in the Sun Belt that's as
big and as tough inside as Matt Stainbrook, and any impressions of watching
him?  
KEVIN WARE: If we had to compare him to anybody, it would be Long from
Lafayette. He's a great player and he's got great moves inside. He's a great
passer, so we've got to apply a lot of pressure. We can't just let him get in
his sweet spots. We watched a lot of film on him, and we're going to continue
to watch a lot of film on him.  
  
 Q. Ballpark figure for any of you, how many times have you seen the
video of the coach and his chair?  
KEVIN WARE: The memes are crazy. I've probably seen 100 different memes from
Coach. They've got him falling outside of the White House. That's probably the
funniest one I've seen. But they've got real creative with it.  
  
 Q. If I could do a follow-up, where was the chair last night? What
happened to it?  
R.J. HUNTER: I haven't seen it. That's crazy you asked that. Where did it go?  
  
RYANN GREEN: I hope they retired it because that one wasn't working.  
  
 Q. R.J., just curious, your career and this shot, has it been harder
being the coach's son or has it made it easier growing up your entire life
next to a basketball court?  
R.J. HUNTER: You're talking about just in reference to the shot or just in
general?  
  
 Q. Both.  
R.J. HUNTER: Well, at this point, it's great because my whole family is here
and this is something my family has worked for. When you have that and you
have something that you worked for and your family worked for together, it
makes it that much more special. I think the shot just -- I mean, it just put
the cherry on top of all of it.  
  
 Q. Dee Davis said he knows you, you guys are pretty good friends. Can
you talk about your friendship? Did you meet each other playing AAU ball and
did any of you guys know any other players growing up?  
KEVIN WARE: I used to watch Myles Davis when he used to play with the players,
him and Kyle Anderson, all those guys. I'm from New York so watching them play
IS-8 and things like that, they were always the younger guys that were next up
for us. We've seen Xavier play numerous times just on TV being that they've
come on TV a lot, but they have a great team. It's going to be hard for our
game tomorrow.  
  
R.J. HUNTER: I know Dee Davis. He's from Indiana and he's on a two-time State
Champion team, and we're friends, but I'm not too fond of him beating me every
time. He's a real good high school player, man, and we had a lot of battles. I
think I won one out of three. And Trevon Bluiett, that's one of my best
friends. We played AAU growing up since I was like five years old, and he's
really becoming a good player, and he had a great high school senior year, and
I'm looking forward to seeing how he goes forward in his college career.  
  
 Q. If you could go into more detail about the success you've had
against Sean Long and some big men this year, what has made you so
effective?  
KEVIN WARE: We just know how good of a player they are, so it's just the
utmost respect that we've got to give them when we play them on the court,
honestly.  
  
 Q. What do you guys think is working well, not just yesterday for
yesterday's game, but the last few games for you defensively as a team?  
RYANN GREEN: I think it's trust, and it took us a long time to kind of get
that trust as a unit. But it really came together at the right time for us,
and down the stretch it's really played a big part in our success, knowing
that we can get stops whenever we want to and just knowing that our teammates
will have our back if we gamble or if we make a mistake. We know we'll have
each other's back.  
  
 Q. It's been now almost a week since Coach injured himself. Are the
jokes now -- have they stopped or do they just keep coming? Are they going to
ever get old?  
R.J. HUNTER: No. And especially if he's falling out of his seat every time
something happens. He's only adding to -- we've got some more jokes now. We've
got him falling out -- of the White House. There's a Life Alert thing with him
and his leg up. We have way more heat now, trust me.  
  
 Q. Do they just keep coming?  
R.J. HUNTER: It's all fun. He's a jokester, too, so he'll say something to you
back.  
  
 Q. Ryan, you're the one giving him the most grief?  
RYANN GREEN: No, definitely his son.  
  
R.J. HUNTER: It's Kevin.  
  
RYANN GREEN: Before yesterday it had started to die down. Everybody was like,
all right, but we was all interested to see how he would coach with the leg.
Just for that to happen, it was like, oh, here we go, we've got something else
to get on him about.  
  
 Q. Do y'all prefer the stationary Ron Hunter or the running around
waving his arms --  
KEVIN WARE: Stationary.  
  
RYANN GREEN: Well, I like him to be there in the corner because it creates
another defender for us.  
  
R.J. HUNTER: I hope y'all saw when we were pressing yesterday he was sliding
up, so it was like six on five yesterday.  
  
 Q. I know it's been 24 hours now. I'm not sure if it's sunk in, but you
have a chance to make history. Very few teams seeded where you've been seeded
in the tournament have reached the Sweet 16. Have you had a chance to think
about what a win tomorrow would mean for your legacy and for the program?  
KEVIN WARE: We're not so worried about our legacy. We just want to go out
there and win the game. We've got a good opportunity to get to LA, play in the
Sweet 16, and that's all we're worried about. We've got to face a good Xavier
team, and it's going to be tough, but I kind of feel like if we do what we've
been doing all year, we've got a good chance.  
  
 Q. Kevin, you've kind of had some NCAA experiences. I think that's an
understatement.  
KEVIN WARE: Yeah, yeah.  
  
 Q. Two years ago, break your leg, you're on a team that's supposed to
win and wins. Now, you're on a team that wasn't supposed to win and won in
pretty unbelievable fashion. Which one is more fun?  
KEVIN WARE: Definitely this one. I love being the underdog. Nobody is picking
us to win these games, and that just gives us a bigger chip on our shoulder.
We've just got to go out there and have fun and play how we've been playing.  
  
 Q. R.J., did you have more fun doing the imitation of your dad falling
out of the chair or getting on him about all the criticism in good fun that
he's gotten for the Obama bracket?  
R.J. HUNTER: There's a lot going on there. I would definitely say the
imitation because the Obama thing, he's kind of taking a swing in the
ballpark. But I think the imitation was fun. I didn't even know it was going
to be aired. They just told me to do what I saw, and it kind of hurt, so I
imagine it hurt him yesterday, too.  
  
 Q. At halftime of y'all's game yesterday, they announced the UAB score
and I saw your eyes got big, your mouth got big, and you turned and started
talking to some of your teammates. What was it you told them?  
R.J. HUNTER: I said we're here. I mean, we played Iowa State and I could swear
there going to get to at least the Elite 8 because that's one of the better
teams we've played. That actually gave me confidence. It's funny you said that
because once I heard that score, I was like, okay, it's March now, you know
what I mean? I told one of the coaches -- the coaches looked at me like let's
do it now. So that's what that was.  
  
 Q. There's a certain stigma about being a 14 seed and a certain
connotation about being a Cinderella team. Do you feel like you're a
Cinderella team at this point?  
KEVIN WARE: Not a Cinderella team at all. If you ask guys in the Sun Belt,
we've been playing good all year. Back-to-back regular season champs, we just
won the actual conference. I wouldn't say Cinderella. If you look at seeding
as being Cinderella, then that's cool, but we just feel like we can play with
anybody in this tournament.  
  
 Q. Kevin, does Xavier remind you of any team that you've played this
season, and what do you think you guys' advantage is against a team with so
much length like they have?  
KEVIN WARE: Any team that we've played? I wouldn't say team, but like I said,
they definitely -- definitely their big man reminds us of Long from Lafayette.
What was the rest of the question?  
  
 Q. Against their length, they have a lot of length, what gives you guys
an advantage, do you think, in a game against a team with their makeup?  
KEVIN WARE: I kind of feel we played the longest team in the tournament in
Baylor. That's definitely frustrating for us yesterday. We're going to watch
some more film and see where we can pick our points and attack them.  
  
 Q. Ryann, you guys don't have Harrow, and for about 37 minutes
yesterday, R.J. was struggling, but you guys were still there, despite not
really having those two guys. What are you guys doing to, first of all, make
up for the absence of Ryan, and then when R.J. struggles, what do you guys do
to keep him up, keep him going?  
RYANN GREEN: Well, first of all, R.J. knows he's a great player. We know he's
going to get shots, he knows he's going to get shots, everybody in arena knows
he's going to get shots. We know he's going to knock them down eventually. As
a team we're doing a good job of stepping up in different roles and just
taking on our roles with full throttle. I made some big plays, Isaiah Dennis
made some big plays, Markus Crider stepped up, Caleb played well. But we all
just tried to play as a team and just tried to get there to the end. We knew
R.J. was going to make a big shot at the end. We just tried to get it there.  
  
COACH RON HUNTER: Where do I start? We're happy to be here. I'm really shy
doing this right now. This isn't something I'm very comfortable with, talking,
so I'm going to let you guys ask me some questions because I'm kind of
uncomfortable here with this mic and all you wonderful people out there.  
  
 Q. What are your initial impressions of Xavier and are they a team that
you watched even casually during the year?  
COACH RON HUNTER: Well, of course I know a little bit about Xavier because I
played at Miami-Ohio and I'm originally from Dayton and -- great basketball
tradition, unbelievable coaches who have come out of Xavier. My personal
record, me as a player, I had some fun beating up on Xavier at Miami-Ohio, and
they got me maybe one time. Tremendous program. It really is. To me this would
be a bigger win for me personally than the Baylor win, just because being a
Midwestern kid and understanding that and knowing it's Xavier, and from the
Larkins and everything that's come out of Xavier. This is kind of a special
thing for me and my family because my family all still lives in Ohio, so for
us, this is a big game for us.  
  
 Q. And your thoughts on Xavier?  
COACH RON HUNTER: Xavier is a good team. They've got some kids from Indiana
that we know. Of course R.J. has played with a lot of those guys. Very
talented, very well-coached, they shoot the ball well, change defenses,
unbelievable length, their length, and just a solid basketball team. I just
told my guys, they're not going to beat themselves, we've got to go beat them.
They're not going to just do crazy things. We know we've got to go win the
game, they're not just going to give us the game.  
  
 Q. Y'all had a lot of close losses early in the season, games in which
you had a lead and just couldn't hold on to it. What did you learn from those
losses that you've been able to apply, particularly in these past four games
that were all very, very important?  
COACH RON HUNTER: Well, as you know, I've always said, a season is a process,
and you've got to go through the process of figuring out who you are and what
you are, and I think we were able to do that. But I've also said that I don't
care what team you have, at some point of the season, you peak, and once you
hit the peak, there's only one way to go, and that's down. Fortunately for us,
we've started playing our basketball about 14, 15 days ago. That's when I
thought we really started to play our best basketball, and that's why we're
playing well now. Fortunately or unfortunately, we had to play without Ryan
Harrow, so since Ryan has gone down with his injuries -- I think our record is
10-0 now without Ryan Harrow. So we've kind of peaked and we've done some
things differently, and we've had some injuries throughout the year early,
trying to get some guys back, and we're just in a great rhythm right now. I
love the confidence. This morning when I saw our guys for breakfast, the
confidence level of our guys right now, it's unbelievable. They're enjoying
this. I told them we're not going to be one of those teams that you get here
and you get nervous and all that. Man, we're going to go to the beach, we're
going to enjoy this. If we win Saturday, we're going to bus to LA. We're just
going to take off, and this is going to be like the Brady Bunch, Partridge
Family. This is fun for us. We're enjoying this. But make no mistake about it,
now, I've got a good basketball team. I've got a really good basketball team.
I've been saying that from day one, and this is the stage to be able to show
that.  
  
 Q. I can't imagine you handling the ribbing of a bus ride with those
guys, but maybe. How are you feeling? You fell yesterday, and with your foot,
any pain there?  
COACH RON HUNTER: You know, I try to keep it a secret. As you know, I love to
talk so I can't keep if a secret. My doctor is on her way here because I
cracked the cast so I'm getting recasted today, because I cracked the cast on
the fall. And when I got to the locker room, I started pulling some of the
stuff away and it just opened up, and she looked at it, she said this is
wrong, you're making it worse. I've got to recasted. I don't even know what
recasted means, and she said something about a saw and oh, my goodness, I
don't know. This has been an interesting, interesting week. We're winning, I'm
getting banged up, I'm getting cut on, I'm getting everything. The players are
absolutely just killing me with all this right now. I'm rolling around in, not
even a wheelchair, in a scooter that's half broken. The thing I sat in
yesterday, I have no idea what that little circle thing, that stool that I
think you sit in if you're typing something. Just been an interesting week,
but I won't trade this for the world. It's been great.  
  
 Q. And your fame continues to grow. How are you handling that, and have
you watched replays of the shot and yourself falling?  
COACH RON HUNTER: I'm still trying to get fame in my own house. I don't know
what you're talking about. My daughter is here. She's getting married in a few
weeks, and we had breakfast this morning, and all she asked was for another
check to write out for this wedding thing. I don't know what fame you're
talking about. I'm writing checks out for a wedding right now. My son is not
listening to me. My wife is doing interviews. I tried to talk to her this
morning, and she said her people would get with my people. I don't know what
fame you're talking about. I have no fame.  
  
 Q. What about the shot and the fall? Have you watched it?  
COACH RON HUNTER: No. I actually saw -- about 2:30 this morning, because I
haven't been able to sleep, but I actually saw the shot, and you call it the
fall. I don't know what to call it. But yeah, it was great. I heard a lot
about it. I haven't been able to catch up with my texts and all those other
things. The great part about all this, about all this, it takes the pressure
off my guys, and that's what's great. They're joking at me and laughing at me
and wheeling me around. They had to bring me some breakfast and I said, guys,
I was hungry, and they brought me seven grapes. Seven grapes. That's what they
brought the coach to eat this morning. I had a list of stuff I wanted to eat
and the freshmen brought me seven grapes. They're enjoying this, trust me.  
  
 Q. I read where you consider yourself a pretty good athlete. Are you
honing your technique for using the chair tomorrow? Is there a little
technique? And are you going to use that same chair?  
COACH RON HUNTER: I'm definitely using the same chair. That chair has been
locked and covered right now. That chair has more protection than the
President of the United States right now. I want that chair back. I don't know
where they got it from, but that chair, it will stay with me for the rest of
my life. Whenever we leave, I'm taking that chair with me. Win, lose or draw,
that chair is going to be in my house with me the rest of my life.  
  
 Q. Did the doctors sit you down -- I know you said I'm coaching, we're
in the NCAA Tournament -- but from a medical standpoint, was there any kind of
serious discussion like hey, look, here's what can happen, maybe you should
have surgery or they cleared you?  
COACH RON HUNTER: Well, I did get cleared. They said surgery, and you might as
well have cleared me because I wasn't doing surgery. I wasn't going to miss
any of this. I've got a terrific doctor and our team doctor has been terrific.
She said, I won't do surgery if you just promise me you'll sit down and you'll
rest. That hasn't worked quite yet. We might have surgery when this thing is
done.  
  
 Q. How difficult was it for you to coach from that chair yesterday? I
mean, I've watched you for four years now. What could you not do that you
would normally do?  
COACH RON HUNTER: I'll be honest with you. I think the bad start, I really put
on me, and I say that because of the injury. You know I've never sat down my
entire life in coaching. That's not who I am, and I couldn't bark out the
signals like I wanted. I couldn't get comfortable. So something that they've
been used to -- especially when you think about our seniors, guys that have
played for me for a long time, they're used to hearing certain calls and
signals that I would do, and I couldn't get those calls. I couldn't get
comfortable enough or close enough to them, and then once I got comfortable
and I started moving just a little bit, I felt a little bit more comfortable.
Now, I think I'll feel a lot more comfortable because we're going to change up
some things a little bit with our defensive calls on Saturday. It's important
I'm able to do that. What I didn't want to do is I didn't want this to be
difficult for the players. I can sit down if it's just for me, but they're
used to their coach coaching a certain way, saying certain things. I think you
could tell they were turning and looking and didn't see me at a certain spot.
They understand -- if I'm on the edge of the baseline, I could talk to the
back line guys and say some things, especially in the first half when I could
control our defense when I couldn't get to the baseline side. So that was --
we had to make a couple changes with that. That was one thing I worried about,
but I think we'll be a little bit better with that Saturday.  
  
 Q. If you wouldn't mind a little Xs and Os, but Matt Stainbrook, not
only is he a big guy but he's got some real good ball skills, moves around the
basket very well. Have you guys faced anybody like him and do you have
particular -- what's on the to-do list to control this guy?  
COACH RON HUNTER: Don't make him mad. That's the first thing, because he's a
big fella. But again, we can't duplicate that. We've got 24 hours to get ready
for a guy like that. He's a tremendous basketball player, got great hands.
I've seen him play in high school. He's a tremendous, tremendous player.
Again, we'll try to negate the things the way we -- when we play teams, we
don't spend a lot of time worrying about the other teams. We worry just about
us. We have a system that we run. If you beat us with our system, then we'll
congratulate you. We spend most of the time -- what we just did out there is
work on our system. We're going to pressure you, we're going to get after you,
we're going to change defenses inside a possession, we're going to give you
seven or eight different zone match-ups that you've got to see. We want the
disconnect between the point guard and the coach. We want them confused. We're
going to play aggressive. And if you can handle all that, we don't worry about
all the other things. We just worry about what we do.  
  
 Q. You mentioned Ryan Harrow earlier. How is he doing with the
hamstring strain and is there any possibility he would be able to play
tomorrow?  
COACH RON HUNTER: You know, he could. We're just in a situation right now
where we're in a pretty good groove. I don't want to play him at 70 or 80
percent. I know as a senior this is a tough thing. He moved actually fairly
well today in practice. If he does play, it'll be one of those things where I
would bring him off the bench in a special situation, but right now we're
playing about seven guys that are really in kind of a groove right there. But
if we need him -- he didn't even dress yesterday, but he will dress for this
game here.  
  
 Q. Speaking of the President and security, were you surprised, shocked,
whatever adjective you'd care to use, that people actually thought you poking
fun at the bracket was like some sort of violation of security laws?  
COACH RON HUNTER: Yeah, and I know that camera is here. Let me say this. I was
just playing with the President thing, man. I didn't mean that. The guy has
done a great job, man. He's made one mistake since he's been a President, and
that's choosing against Georgia State. But man, stop the emails and all the
political stuff. I'm not a political guy. I could care less. I exercise my
right to vote. But quit sending me emails about that, that I'm disrespecting
the office. The office of what? I'm not causing anything. We're talking about
a basketball game. Please stop with the emails. I'm nervous. I'm thinking my
taxes are going to get something. I'm not getting money back anyway, but I
think I'm going to owe more money, and I'm looking for Secret Service guys
coming to get me. So please stop. They got me so nervous about it. I was asked
a question and I answered it, but President Obama, listen, you're a great
President, man. I'm sorry, I did not mean anything. Please get your people off
of me. I am so sorry. Thank you for asking that question.  
  
 Q. Obviously I know you're very proud of R.J. Harder on him than the
other players as a dad and as a coach?  
COACH RON HUNTER: Yeah, and I've said it before, that's the hard thing. I'll
look back on this, and you always want the best for your kid. And I know that
-- I would let the guys go home, R.J., you're going to shoot another 100
shots. Another guy would make the same play but I'd get harder on him, because
again, you want the best for him, you want to do those type of things.
Sometimes if I can see the frustration. I remember there was one time this
year that he was really struggling with all the box-and-ones and I could see
it in his face he was struggling, and I kind of snapped at him a little bit.
And I look at those times now and wish I had been dad at that particular
moment. That's what was so beautiful for me about yesterday. I told you
before. I spent the entire time being dad, and I'll continue to say it, man.
Next year or two years from now, you can win a National Championship, I can
hit the lottery, there's a lot of good things that can happen to me, but
there's nothing that's going to happen better than the experience I'm having
with R.J. right now. We're having a ball as father and son. This is like an
early Father's Day present for me. We're laughing and joking. This is
something that, as I told him yesterday, we'll be able to tell your kids and
my grandchild about this 20 years in now. I want to make sure he understands
that 20 years from now. Let's get through some things first.  
  
 Q. Do you have a name for the chair, and some of the Georgia State fans
want to know if y'all are going to wear the lucky black jerseys again
tomorrow?  
COACH RON HUNTER: We are wearing the black jerseys, and again, I just said
that the chair is under security. We're giving no names, we're giving no
information about my chair. R.J. actually got in a little trouble because he
actually tried to sit in the chair. No one sits in the chair, including R.J.,
the wife, seniors. That's my chair. That's one thing -- I don't get a lot out
of this. I think I got one goody bag from the NCAA since I've been here, but
I'm taking that chair with me.  
  
 Q. I was curious. You have a chance right now to do something very few
teams have done where you've seeded and reach the Sweet 16. I know Xavier is
front and foremost, but in the few brief moments you've had in the past 24
hours, have you thought about what a win tomorrow could mean for you and this
program?  
COACH RON HUNTER: No, one of the things we've said from day one is we want to
enjoy the moment. Control the things you can control. When I saw Chris
yesterday -- we had a meeting, and Chris said, man, wouldn't it be great if we
play each other and he was kind of half joking. Well, guess what, we get to
play each other. I didn't think -- I'm pretty sure that they weren't really
spending a lot of time preparing for Georgia State. But again, they're a good
team, but we've come to play. I can't wait for you to see this team play
tomorrow, man. These guys are really, really excited to play. We'll see what
happens. But they've got a great program, and I can't wait to see what
happens.  
  
 Q. Did you bring the chair with you or did you request this from the
host committee people here at the arena for something specific that you felt
like you could get up and down on, be more comfortable coaching? Where did the
chair come from?  
COACH RON HUNTER: We had about seven or eight different things, including --
someone flew this -- it came to the hotel, and it was like a crutch, but you
don't hold it here, and it's specially made for people that have Achilles or
problems and you basically just kind of walk like -- I've had like six or
seven type of things and I've tried out all of them and none of them kind of
worked. And then this chair, our trainer, Dinika, brought the chair out and
said let's try this, and I said this is what we're going to go with, and it's
been great.  
  
 Q. Where did she get it from?  
COACH RON HUNTER: I have no idea. I told her I don't want to know. You guys
are not listening to me. I'm not giving my secrets away about my chair because
I think it's bad luck. I really do. I'm a superstitious guy and I think if you
start telling all your secrets, man, I'm not going to do that. I'm not going
to tell my new son-in-law, although I've got some things I want to tell him
but I'm not going to tell him about the chair, any of that. This is for me.
This is for me, and it's going back to Atlanta with me, in my office, in my
house.

_JACKSONVILLE, FLORIDA_  
  
Q. Myles, now you've had some time to digest Georgia State and watch a
little bit about them, what are your impressions of that team heading into
tomorrow's game?  
MYLES DAVIS: They might sound like they're a lower division team, but they
have some big name players. With Ryan Harrow, we don't know if he's going to
play but we're acting like he's going to play; R.J Hunter, big time player,
Kevin Ware; and all the rest of those guys. We're treating them like we'd
treat anybody else. They're a really good school. They're here for a reason.
We can't let our guard down because they're a 14 seed. We're going to go into
this game like we do every other game and try to play harder than them.  
  
 Q. Myles, you struggled from three-point range probably through the end
of the season, Big East Tournament, but were able to get two to fall
yesterday. How important was that for your confidence and moving forward?  
MYLES DAVIS: It feels good to finally see a couple shots go in. The best part
about it is my teammates always are going to tell me to keep shooting the
ball, and the coaching staff, too. I'm going to keep shooting. That's what
shooters do. Hopefully I can make more shots to help the team out more. If I
bring more offense, I feel like we're a more deadlier team. Hopefully I can
keep it rolling.  
  
 Q. Matt, I know no one has ever asked you about being an Uber driver
before, but I saw the shot of you after the game. When do you have time to do
that? What are your hours? Have you ever given your teammates rides, and is it
something you plan on doing after you finish basketball?  
MATT STAINBROOK: Yeah, first off, I don't plan on doing it after basketball.
Certainly that's not in the game plan right now. But on off days, on days
where we have a couple days off -- especially before the season sort of
started and we only had practice and didn't have a ton going on, with my grad
class schedule, I don't have a ton of classes so there's a little bit of
downtime. It helps me relax, it give me a chance to clear my mind and not have
to think too hard. I'd say right about now I probably do between 10 to 20
hours a week depending on how busy the week is. Obviously not doing a lot this
week. In the off-season -- I'd say at the beginning of the season, I was doing
20, 25 hours. But yeah, no, just trying to pay some bills and have a good time
with it.  
  
 Q. Do you ever give your teammates rides?  
MATT STAINBROOK: Once before. Not Myles. Myles isn't grateful, so I don't give
him rides, but I've had some other teammates that I've given rides.  
  
 Q. Matt, any inherent pressure in going up against what has become
America's team or at least one of the teams out of the first day that seems to
have captured some nationwide attention?  
MATT STAINBROOK: I don't think so. I think our team is preparing for them like
any other team. We're not going to over-hype them as being the nation's team,
but we're also not going to downplay them. We know they're a very good team,
and I think we're excited and preparing so far very well for a very good team.  
  
 Q. Trevon, yesterday Dee talked about being friends with R.J. and today
he said he's also friends with you. Can you talk about that and do you know
other guys on their team, and what's it like to play a team where you're
familiar with so many of their players?  
TREVON BLUIETT: Yeah, me and R.J., we go back, probably since third grade, we
played on a couple teams together, probably stayed ten minutes away from each
other, a couple of weekends we'd stay over at each other's house. We were
pretty close back when we were younger. I don't really know anybody else
personally on that team. I think it'll be a good experience to be able to go
against somebody that you grew up with. I've never played anybody as close,
relationship-wise, as I'll be playing him tomorrow, so it'll be kind of good
to get back and play with him.  
  
 Q. Matt, when you had your technical foul yesterday, what happened, and
how does that sort of fit in? I know you want to play close to the edge but
not go over it. How do you sort of get up to playing right up to it but not go
over it like maybe you did there?  
MATT STAINBROOK: Yeah, so after he dunked the ball, he had a couple words for
me and I wanted to make sure that I reiterated that we were equally -- we felt
the same way. But it was one of those things where you don't want another team
getting excited, getting hyped, getting their momentum shifted their way. But
at the same time, I can't get a technical and allow that to be another change
in emotions for other teams. I just wanted to try to play with intensity and
it kind of spilled over a little bit too much. I don't think that's going to
happen again, so yeah.  
  
 Q. Jalen, it seemed like yesterday you were a little bit outside your
comfort zone, weren't playing maybe the way you had in the past. Was that more
the opponent or was it you or maybe jitters, first NCAA Tournament game?  
JALEN REYNOLDS: Definitely wasn't jitters, it was just shots wasn't falling
for me last night. I have to put that behind me and focus on the next game and
just focus on making shots for the team.  
  
 Q. Dee, as someone that's been to the tournament before and won, do you
give any advice to your teammates, or is it at this point, it's different
team, different players, and you kind of roll with what you guys have done so
far through the Big East Tournament?  
DEE DAVIS: Mostly all I've been telling them is not to overlook an opponent.
My freshman year Lehigh beat Duke, and we were supposed to play Duke after
playing Notre Dame, and Lehigh had us down maybe 15 points at one point in the
game. Really just not overlooking the opponent and coming out to play.  
  
 Q. Myles and Dee, how much comfort is it to have Matt playing the way
he's playing right now? He seems to be really comfortable, and obviously has a
size advantage at the post. But as guards how do you try to incorporate him
into what you guys do?  
DEE DAVIS: Well, playing with Matt makes it easy, especially if he's playing
well and confident. Playing inside out makes the game a lot easier for us. It
gives us the opportunity to have open shots, and if he's scoring and getting
fouls on the other team, it gives us a better opportunity down the stretch.  
  
MYLES DAVIS: I feel like Matt is one of the best big men in the country. We
like to play inside out with Matt. Not too often do you get to have Matt,
being a great passer, starting to pass the ball a little bit more than Dee,
which is kind of surprising. But no, Matt is a good big man, and without Matt,
we probably wouldn't be as far as we are right now.  
  
 Q. Trevon, kind of digging into your past, when you were looking at
schools and making a decision and settling on Xavier, picking Xavier, was
there tradition in the postseason, their ability to get to the tournament, a
factor in you choosing the school?  
TREVON BLUIETT: Yeah, you know, when I was choosing schools, one thing that
would stick out to me would be how good the basketball program would be. And
looking at Xavier, not a lot of people look at them as a team to really go
deep in the tournament. Ever since -- I think I read a stat -- like since
2008, they've made the Sweet 16 a couple of times. People don't really notice
that and take notice of that. But I do, and I think that's the one thing that
kind of factored into my decision in coming to Xavier, is just that Xavier is
actually a prestigious basketball program, but people -- it just takes a lot
of time to look into it to see that.  
  
 Q. Do you feel like you're coming into this game with a chip on your
shoulder? Going back to the Big East Tournament, people thought you weren't
going to beat Butler or thought they were going to be playing Georgetown, and
maybe no one thought you were going to make it to the championship, and here
you are a win under your belt in the tournament. Do you come into the game
feeling like people underrate you at all?  
MYLES DAVIS: I definitely feel like people don't look at us as a big-time
program, and the thing is we take that and we use it to our advantage. We try
to come into every game and try to prove people wrong. It gives us an edge. It
makes us play hard. We've been trying to prove to people all year. We've had
our ups and downs, but the best part about it is we're starting to play our
best basketball towards the end of the season. Yeah, we have a chip on our
shoulder and we love trying to prove people wrong, and it just -- it's great,
and it's fun out there when you get to see Xavier basketball, how well we move
the ball, and how good our defense is starting to become. Hopefully people
start recognizing us more, and that's our plan is just to go out there and
play hard.  
  
JALEN REYNOLDS: And just to tie into what Myles is saying, it's not about what
everybody else is saying, it's about what we do and how we produce on the
court. We're obviously all in this together, so just keep it going until the
wheels fall off.  
  
 Q. Chris, how did you decide to take Matt Stainbrook from Western
Michigan? I saw pictures of him when he was there. His body looks different
than it does now. What did you see in him and did you imagine him becoming the
player that he is right now?  
COACH CHRIS MACK: Well, Matt's first college game for Western Michigan was
against Xavier in the Cintas Center, and that was his first game. And we had a
center named Kenny Frease who was really good player, an All-Conference type
player. And I think Matt, on his first game of his career, if he didn't get a
double-double, was right there, nine points, eight rebounds, and really played
Kenny toe-to-toe and held his ground. So just made a note of that like wow,
how did we not recruit a guy from Lakewood, St. Ed's, a storied program, a guy
that certainly looks like a player to me, a little out of shape. And then a
couple years later he ends up transferring, and we just asked a couple of our
colleagues that played against him, that coached against him, their thoughts,
and Rob Senderoff of Kent State says, man, I love big guys and he has a good
touch. And you look at Matt's statistics as a sophomore, and he's pulling
double-doubles against Duke, Colorado, Temple. Seemed like the bigger the
competition, the better he played. So we brought Matt down to visit, and he
was interested. Just had a very open and honest conversation with Matt, told
him that we weren't going to take him unless he was serious about basketball.
He couldn't show that he was serious and still weigh 320 pounds, said we're
going to try and get you down to 260 pounds. I told him you're going to take
off your funky elbow pads and your knee braces, and your wild hair, you're
going to cut. And he was like, Coach, that's no problem, I'll do that. I'll do
anything you ask. We had heard a lot of people say he'll do anything that you
ask. And we had heard a lot of people say that he will do anything that you
ask him to do. I told him, you're going to take off those hideous looking
goggles. He said, Coach, I sort of have a lazy eye, and they're prescription.
I said, all right, buddy, you can keep the goggles, and that's sort of how we
went about it. Then we were also able to give Matt a workout, and we did a
post drill that we do every day in the off-season, in the preseason workouts,
and Matt was the best guy of our post guys. He knew how to seal, he knew how
to use his body, and I said right there, if he can do that at 320 pounds,
imagine what he can do at 270 pounds. From that day forward, I kept texting
with Matt when he was still at Western and then when he was back at Cleveland,
before he came down in the summer, this is what you're going to run today. I
want to know your time on the track, you're going to do two and a half miles
today, tell me your time. Every day he would text me back, Coach, this is what
I got. And he showed up on his unofficial visit at 320 pounds, and in about a
month's span before we got him, he showed back up at Xavier to start summer
classes down 17 pounds, so I knew that he was serious at that point.  
  
 Q. Yesterday he's obviously playing extremely well, he gets that big
basket and the technical foul. I mean, is that him, that sort of fiery, right
on the edge player, and how much did you -- how unhappy were you at that
moment given everything?  
COACH CHRIS MACK: Well, you never want your players to get technicals. You
know, Matt can get chippy, and oftentimes it can be with the wrong people. It
can be with the referees. He generally doesn't say squat to his opponents. I
really don't know what happened. I don't know if they were exchanging barbs
with the dunk at the end, and Matt, this was sort of his way of getting back.
All that stuff is really meaningless, and you've got to be above that. And
Matt is a fifth year senior for the most part, and his career has always been
above that. But you do want your seniors to play with some urgency, to play
with some fire, and I think Matt is certainly playing like that here down the
stretch.  
  
 Q. With such a short turnaround, your team, their team plays what you
are, who you are, as you are, and Coach Hunter said that what they like to do
is confuse opponents on defense, try a lot of different looks within one
possession. Have you seen that before in other opponents this year, and what
do they do to really kind of disrupt teams on offense?  
COACH CHRIS MACK: Well, they reach constantly. They employ a match-up zone. We
have to do a great job of being ball strong. When you drive around your man,
most teams try to get back in the play. Georgia State is content to let you go
around them and then reach from behind. That's why they're fourth in the
country in turning people over. Our guys have to be cognizant of that. If we
can take really good care of the ball, get good shots and be good on the
glass, I think our offense will be fine, but easier said than done. Georgia
State is in this game for a reason, and we just have to take really, really
good care of the ball.  
  
 Q. Of all the crazy things that went on yesterday in the first day of
the tournament, Georgia State seems to be the best nationwide story. They're
inspiring a lot of attention. What are you going to do with your kids to keep
them concentrating on the task at hand and not get caught up in we're going
against what has essentially become America's team?  
COACH CHRIS MACK: I mean, our guys don't read USA Today. I don't know how to
answer that question. I mean, I think fan bases in general get caught up in
that. Players don't. I'm more worried about players understanding zipper
flair, understanding when they run a stagger ball screen, they'll either
stagger away for Hunter or they'll pop the 4 man. That's the only thing we
concern ourselves with. We don't worry about the nation's feel-good story.
They can find another story after Saturday if we do our job.  
  
 Q. Myles struggled from three-point range in the Big East Tournament
and for the first part of yesterday's game. How much does that impact you guys
to maybe have him making some shots and have that confidence?  
COACH CHRIS MACK: Well, he's one of the best shooters on our team. Matt -- not
only Matt, but certainly out of the post, Matt, finds our guys on the
perimeter when they choose to double. I think we've been a really good passing
team all year, and if you've got guys like Dee and Myles and Trevon and J.P.
hitting shots, it makes us that much harder to guard. It was really good to
see Myles knock in a couple. He's worked at it. He's got to understand last
year was last year. This year is a new year. He's had a phenomenal year. He
could have easily been named the most improved player in the Big East based on
what he did as a freshman versus his sophomore numbers, and he's got to play
like that. And I thought when Dee went out with foul trouble, Myles assumed
the point and did a great job, and it was good to see those two threes go in
for him.  
  
 Q. What does Jalen need to do to play more like Jalen in tomorrow's
game as compared to the last game?  
COACH CHRIS MACK: He needs to focus on the next play. You know, like Jalen
sometimes plays as if he's that character on Charlie Brown that has the rain
cloud above his head all the time. So if something goes poorly for Jalen, he
slumps his shoulders and drops his head, and what he doesn't understand is
that affects the next play. You've got to have a short-term memory, and that's
part of the reason that makes Jalen such a great player is he cares so much
and he's bothered when he doesn't play well, but the really good ones I've
been around have a next play mentality. What can I do to help my team on the
very next play, whether it's defensively, offensively, and he and I talked
about that, and I'm confident he'll be a better player tomorrow. He usually
shines when we need him most.  
  
 Q. What about Dee? Has he shined, not necessarily on the court, but
maybe in the locker room or talking to guys, because he's had this experience,
he's been here before, and a lot of the freshmen obviously haven't.  
COACH CHRIS MACK: Well, I'm incredibly proud of Dee. I think he's been
maligned throughout his career as just an average point guard. The fact is
he's one of the top 15 assist men in the entire country. He does a great job
of running our show, running our team. It doesn't matter if you throw out a
zone, a press, man-to-man, he runs our stuff and gets guys in the right spots,
and there's a comfort zone when Dee is on the floor. When he's hitting shots
and people don't respect his ability to shoot the three, he's had some really
big games in his career, none bigger than yesterday. I'd like to think that
his experience as a freshman in the NCAA Tournament, being part of a Sweet 16
team, has really fueled his desire to be even more so of a leader here as of
late to get that feeling back and to get back to the stage that he was on as a
freshman in a bigger role. I'm really proud of Dee.  
  
 Q. How much is R.J. a key to his team? He didn't score much in the
first half of the last game, but obviously made the winning shot and came up
strong.  
COACH CHRIS MACK: They wouldn't be here without him. The truly great players
can shake off a bad game personally and make plays like he did, whether it's
on the defensive end on or the big three that you mentioned. As I said
yesterday, he's an NBA-caliber prospect, and our players understand that.
We've got guys that are from Indianapolis. Trevon Bluiett knows R.J. Hunter
extremely well and his family. Dee, those Indianapolis kids know one another,
so there's going to be no wow, I didn't know he'd shoot that shot or I didn't
know he had that in his arsenal. We understand that R.J. Hunter is completely
capable of going off for 40 at any point in time. We have to do our best to
chase him off screens, make life difficult for him, and at the same time,
they've got other very, very good players, talented players and are really led
by their perimeter players, and it's a different style than we've seen.  
  
 Q. I know you know Coach Hunter just from the recruiting trail, but did
you remember watching him when he played at Miami when they played Xavier when
Byron was a freshman?  
COACH CHRIS MACK: I don't think they had televisions back then. I listened to
him on the radio a little bit, he and Byron. No, the Miami teams back then
were really, really good. Ron Harper, Coach Hunter, Little Newsome, those guys
were really, really special. I remember all those wars growing up and just
falling in love with basketball, whether it was just going to games, listening
to them on the radio, following them when your paper was 15 pages long and was
full sized and not four inches by four inches and a lot of car ads. Yeah, I
remember those days.

_JACKSONVILLE, FLORIDA_  
  
Q. Obviously this is a chance to play in the second round of the NCAA
Tournament against a very good basketball team. Just talk about your thoughts
on North Carolina and what you see out of them.  
BOBBY PORTIS: They're a very experienced and poised basketball team. They have
a great leader in Marcus Paige, who always dominates the ball throughout the
basketball game. So I feel like if our team just gets it out of his hands, it
will be towards us.  
  
 Q. Admittedly not a lot of people know who Wofford was or where they
are. North Carolina is a different deal. Talk about going from playing a team
pretty far under the radar to somebody like North Carolina?  
MICHAEL QUALLS: It's the big chance. Match-ups are a particular thing.
Wofford, they matched up perfectly. They was a totally different team than we
were, so they was battling and bringing it to us all night. North Carolina,
they're a bigger team. I feel like our press will be more effective against
them than pressing all those guards for Wofford. It's just a big thing, and
we're just happy to be here.  
  
BOBBY PORTIS: I feel like with us playing UNC, it will benefit us better
because Wofford has four or five guards in at a time. I think that kind of
hurt us a lot just because they had four or five ball handlers in. I think
with us playing UNC it will benefit us.  
  
 Q. But is it just more exciting to play a big-name team like North
Carolina in terms of national prestige?  
MICHAEL QUALLS: I'm more excited to be just in this round. Every game that we
win, every game -- that's life. We're still going. It's win and survive. No
matter who we play, we're going to have to step up and play to the occasion if
we want to stay here.  
  
 Q. Last night was the first tournament game for everybody on the team.
Is there a new comfort level going into tomorrow now that you've got your feet
wet?  
BOBBY PORTIS: Oh, no doubt, just because I feel like yesterday our guys had
the nerves going for like a half just because we're just out there just trying
to play instead of just playing how we normally play. So I feel like tomorrow
it'll be a different story for us.  
  
 Q. North Carolina had like 17 turnovers last night. I think Harvard
outscored them 27-6. That sounds like what you guys do to some of the smaller
teams. What goes through your mind and do you feel like that's an area you
could really exploit tomorrow?  
MICHAEL QUALLS: We're not Harvard. They probably just had a hell of a game,
but it is our strong point to try to make you turn the ball over. We've seen
that. We're going to watch film on it later. Just try to play the way we play.
Try to get the ball out of Marcus Paige's hands because he can do some real
damage. He's a dynamite player. We want to speed them up, let Bob get some
more isolation, and they won't have the net share defense that Wofford had.  
  
BOBBY PORTIS: I feel like with North Carolina, they try to speed the game up
like we do, so it's going to be a fast-paced game. And also I think that was
their first game yesterday, too, so I feel like they had some of the same
jitters that we had, also, so that could have caused some of the 17 turnovers
also.  
  
 Q. You talked yesterday about how at halftime you guys came together as
brothers and really rallied together. Can you elaborate a little bit on that
and just how this group of guys has become so close and how your teammates
thrive on each other?  
MICHAEL QUALLS: Yeah, all year we've worked for this, 5:00 a.m. workouts, all
the hard last-second losses, all the last-second wins that we had. It was a
big year for us. We've worked to be here, and we just had to remind each other
that we're not trying to go home. If we're going to go down, we're going to go
down playing our style of basketball, and that's what we did. We came
together, and I feel like it was almost like a sigh of relief, and everybody
just relaxed, and we got after it in the second half and actually started
playing basketball.  
  
 Q. Bobby, I think you had 15 points and 13 boards last night. People
talked about you were struggling, off your game. Those are pretty good
numbers. Do you ever feel like people have unrealistic high expectations for
you based on what you've done all year?  
BOBBY PORTIS: Yeah, for sure. I feel like people expect me to go out there and
get 30 points and 20 rebounds every game and that's not realistic. With the
defenses, how I'm being played, there's always a man on me and a man in the
paint, so people that know basketball know I can't force the issue on offense.
I can't just force to try to get stats or anything. It's not about that.
Primarily it's about us winning. If our team won and I did what I did, then
I'm satisfied with that.  
  
 Q. You guys have had a lot of firsts the last couple years. You'd be
the first Arkansas team to the Sweet 16 in 19 years. Do you guys think about
stuff like that?  
BOBBY PORTIS: I've never thought about that. I was just trying to win. I never
thought about what happened 19 years ago. That has nothing to do with us. But
in a sense it does just because we wear this Arkansas jersey, and like our
history is still a part of us.  
  
MICHAEL QUALLS: You know, like Bob said, I'm not too deep into the Arkansas
fun facts. I just know we worked for where we are right now. Of course we have
Arkansas pride. We play for the city, the state, and the University, but it's
just one game at a time, so we just focus on this game. Of course, if we play
the way we are supposed to play tomorrow, good things will happen. If we just
try to overlook things, that's how you slip up. So we're just going to focus
on this North Carolina team one half at a time, play a good first half and a
good second half, and I feel like we'll be where we want to be.  
  
 Q. Talk about practice today, a lot of games over the last two weeks,
how you guys feeling? How are the legs? How is everything going there?  
BOBBY PORTIS: I'm feeling good. Last night I got a good seven, eight hours of
sleep. That's more than like what I normally get, just because I probably
sleep like four or five hours in a normal day just because I be so anxious to
play. So I feel like I'm more well-rested, and today I also got some treatment
with Dave, so I think that kind of helped me out, too.  
  
MICHAEL QUALLS: I think it's time to get some shots up. We're going to come
out here, we're not just going to get after it. We going to save our legs for
tomorrow. More of a mental teaching aspect, we'll probably go run through some
half court plays, just get on the free-throw line. I felt like we kind of
struggled last night on the free-throw line, just the basics. It's not rocket
science when you've made it this far. We're not going to change anything. We
are who we are, we're just going to come, get some shots up and relax and then
get ready for tomorrow.  
  
 Q. You've been part of a lot of North Carolina-Arkansas games as an
assistant coach. Did you not play against them when you were at Tulsa, too?  
COACH MIKE ANDERSON: Yes, in 1981, and I think that's the year they won it,
'81. Did they win in '81? '82. The previous year we won the NIT Championship
at Tulsa, and we had a game scheduled at, I guess, in Chapel Hill, and we
played this team -- we were like No. 9, I think they were like maybe 4 or 5 or
something like that. And we played this team with a guy by the name of Michael
Jordan, freshman. I guess he was one of the first freshmen to start for Dean
Smith, and he happened to drop 22 points on us. So when you talk about -- I've
had a chance to play against Michael that year they won it against Dean Smith
and North Carolina. Then the next year, I was a volunteer coach and we played
there in Tulsa, in the All Capital Classic, and we beat them. There's a
history there with Coach Richardson, but for me to have an opportunity to play
against them as a player, that was interesting.  
  
 Q. You've beaten them as an assistant, now you get a shot as a head
coach. This is going to be the fifth time that Arkansas has played Carolina.
It's the most anyone has played Arkansas in the tournament. Talk about the
history and playing Carolina again.  
COACH MIKE ANDERSON: Well, obviously I was an assistant coach there. There
were some great games. They were basically in the tournament. Some of those
games that I coached with at Arkansas, they were -- I think one was in the
Sweet 16, one was in the Championship, in the semis 20 years ago, in Seattle,
against Stackhouse, Rasheed Wallace, Jeff McInnis, that group there. We were
fortunate to beat them to get into the championship game against UCLA. Now,
we're in the NCAA Tournament again, so it's an opportunity for us to play
against an historic program. Coach Dean Smith, his soul rest in peace,
established a dynasty there at North Carolina. And, of course, one of his
proteges -- and Roy Williams is after him now, and we know there's an
unbelievable tradition there. So it's a great opportunity for us to play
against an outstanding program. And we've got some tradition at Arkansas, as
well. It's going to be Arkansas versus North Carolina to vie for a Sweet 16
berth. It's an opportunity. It's a great challenge there. They're a dynamite
team, great size, great length, great athletic ability. Paige is without a
doubt an All-American type of player, but it's not just Paige. They've got
Meeks in the middle, they've got the Johnson kid. They've got a lot of
players. We've got to play a very good basketball game in order to have a
chance with this team. Their size is something that really concerns me.  
  
 Q. Coach Williams described you as -- some of the relationship that you
guys have and said your best attribute as a head coach is your wife. Would you
agree, and also talk about your relationship with Coach Roy Williams.  
COACH MIKE ANDERSON: I am a recruiter, I can recruit my butt off. I'm very
fortunate, very blessed to have a wife of over 30 years, and we have a
beautiful family. She's kind of the wings up under my -- puts the air up under
my wings and I can fly a little bit. But she's a good one. She's a keeper
here. I guess I'm a good keeper, too.  
  
 Q. Carolina had 17 turnovers last night, and I think they've had
18-plus about five or six times. Harvard outscored them 27-6 on turnovers.
When you see a stat like that, what comes to mind, and do you feel like that's
an area you can really exploit tomorrow night?  
COACH MIKE ANDERSON: Well, I think, first of all, you've got to draw back --
the first game in the tournament is always the most difficult game. You don't
know how your kids are going to come out and perform, and so it was a game
that they had going away pretty handily, and now Harvard has nothing to lose,
and they get after it and they turn them over a little bit. One of the things
we do thrive on is trying to apply pressure to teams. We cannot sit and play a
half court game with a North Carolina team. We've got to hopefully cause some
chaos with our defense. And hopefully we can get some turnovers. But more
importantly, I think we've got to defend and we've got to rebound the
basketball. I think that's going to be big. Our guards have got to get in
there and rebound the basketball.  
  
 Q. None of your guys have ever played in the NCAA Tournament. How do
you feel about getting those first game jitters out and do you think they'll
be sharper against Carolina?  
COACH MIKE ANDERSON: I really do. The first game you never know how -- the
psyche, how they're going to come out. And for us to finish the game off,
especially when you look at the way that game was going, the crowd getting
into it, and as a team, let's say a Wofford, all you want to do is hang around
and give yourself a chance to win. But I thought our guys did a tremendous job
in the last four and a half minutes. I thought our defense was probably the
best it was all night long. They only scored three points going down the
stretch, and I thought we did a good job of executing, whether it be on half
court, we started making half court offense, and then we started making some
free throws going down the stretch, and we rebound the basketball when we had
to. Again, we did a lot of good things last night from a defensive standpoint.
And playing at the pace of Wofford, so that tells me we've got a good
basketball team. We prefer to get up and down the floor and cause havoc, take
a shot every five seconds, six seconds if we can, but that wasn't the case
last night. We have to have some patience with our defense, and we did at
times, and we had to have some patience from an offensive standpoint.  
  
 Q. Bobby has been playing very good, but his offensive game, shots are
not coming down like we've been accustomed to seeing them fall for him lately.
Is this one of those things where you think he's pressing or is it something
that happens throughout the season?  
COACH MIKE ANDERSON: Well, he's been playing at an unbelievable clip. This guy
has been a double-double producing machine, night-in and night-out,
defensively just been active, blocking shots, just doing a lot of things for
us. He may hit that wall a little bit. He's been playing a lot of minutes.
Hopefully he'll have some recovery time where he can come back and really come
out and put on a good performance. One thing about Bobby, it's not going to be
because of lack of effort, and I think we'll see it on display tomorrow. When
you're playing against, let's say, a North Carolina, that tends to give you
even a little bit more extra energy, so to speak. But we know what Bobby is
capable of and he's the bell cow that we're going to go to. But it's good to
see other guys pick up the slack when he's not playing well. From a scoring
standpoint, he had 13 rebounds. I thought he played well to tell you the
truth. He took some shots, he didn't make them, he missed some free throws.
But Michael Qualls only missed one shot last night, did a good job of
rebounding going down the stretch, getting some offensive stick-backs last
night for us. I thought Alandise Harris, his defense, his presence on the
floor was really big. And Ky, I had to take him out of the game to kind of
settle him down. He was falling on the floor and I thought he was kind of
anxious, but he came back and I thought he did a really good job of running
the ship. He ran the show. He had the assist that got Alandise, that got us
the and-one to go up, got some rebounds going down the stretch, defended
Cochran. I'll say it again, we've got multiple guys doing some great things
for our basketball team, finding ways to win.  
  
 Q. You had expectations for Bobby heading into the season. Has he
surpassed even what you thought he could do, and talk about Corliss
Williamson, what he meant to Bobby growing up and getting him to where he is
now?  
COACH MIKE ANDERSON: Well, first of all, when you talk about Corliss --
Bobby's mentality to me reminds me of Corliss. Corliss coming out, he was one
of the best players in the country. He was the No. 1 player in the country,
and Bobby is one of those kids that had to work at that. And I just see a
humbleness, as good a player as Corliss was, he was one of the most quiet and
humble guys you'd ever come across. But when he hit that floor, he was the big
nasty. Well, with Bobby Portis, this guy has come on like gangbusters. We knew
he had the potential coming in. His freshman year was very good. His sophomore
year has been even better. He's the Player of the Year in our league, and not
only one of the best players in our league but in the country, and that's why
as we continue in this tournament, we'll see what Bobby is made out of, and I
think we've seen throughout the year. So if you say did he surpass what I
expected out of him? They never do that, but no, he's had a phenomenal year,
he really has.  
  
 Q. How well has Qualls been playing for you down the stretch? He's put
up double figures now every game except Texas A &M since the beginning of
February.  
COACH MIKE ANDERSON: He's doing well. I thought starting off in conference
play, he took a little dip there, and now I think he's maybe seeing the
opportunities where he can really impact this team. The beauty of this team is
that it shapes up to me right around February, late February, and on into
March, and I think we're seeing the identities of these different guys at
different stages of the season stepping up for us. Like Michael Qualls, right
now, we're starting to see his toughness, we're seeing his athletic ability,
we're seeing his energy be contagious to our basketball team. Bobby has been
consistent throughout the year, and even though he's not scoring at the high
clip, he's doing other things for our basketball team. Alandise Harris, he's
given us a toughness that we've got to have. Guys can lean on him. He can
defend a guard, he can defend a forward. Now we're starting to see him defend
the basketball. Ky Madden, I think Ky is becoming more of a facilitator. Early
in the year he was trying to get some buckets. Now he's being more of a
facilitator, and being that guy and maybe have to get to the line and make
some plays for us. Anthlon Bell, he was hurt there for a little while, and in
the Southeast Conference against Georgia, he came on and did the things we've
got to do, knocked shots down to open up the floor. So we get different guys
doing different things. Beard, he's found his niche, he's no longer a freshman
anymore and he's playing with a gimpy ankle and that shows me he's got big
time heart, big heart. As we get to this Carolina game I think our bench is
going to be critical, really critical in this game here.  
  
 Q. Last night when Qualls responded with Arkansas is a big time
program, too, it seemed like you had a grin of approval on your face or a
smile of satisfaction. What's it like to see those guys believing that and
playing on the court to where they're back to being nationally relevant?  
COACH MIKE ANDERSON: Well, I think it's like anything else, confidence. We
know we have a tremendous program, and throughout the year, a lot of things
have been thrown at them, a lot of things have been said, and they're still
standing. They finished second in the league against the -- with the best team
in the country in our league. They finished second in the SEC. Now let's go on
and continue to make a statement, and how do you do that, have an opportunity
to go out on the floor and let people see what Arkansas is made of. The pride,
I think that's what to me -- they've got the pride in the uniforms they wear,
and it ain't about the name on the back, it's the name on the front.  
  
 Q. Kind of following up on that, everybody talks about they don't know
much about Wofford which is understandable. Everybody knows about Carolina.
What's it like playing Carolina after playing Wofford, a team that's really
good but under the radar?  
COACH MIKE ANDERSON: I always said, I don't look at names of teams. Everybody
has got good players. There are only 13 scholarships, so that means you've got
-- every team has good players, and it ain't about the talent, it's about the
team. I said that last night, and I honestly believe that. That's hard maybe
to convey to your student-athletes. There are teams you don't have to get them
ready for. Hey, they know that North Carolina is an outstanding team. They
know that Kentucky was an outstanding team. They know the teams in our SEC
were very outstanding. So now we're in a tournament playing for a
championship, and it's survive and advance. It's a big game, and that's how
we've treated each and every game. It's a big, big game. North Carolina,
Arkansas, we've played through the years, and so we're playing for a berth to
continue to play. We want these seniors to go out the right way.  
  
 Q. I'm curious when you saw Jacorey Williams fling the shoe down the
court last night, what went through your mind?  
COACH MIKE ANDERSON: First of all, I still haven't figured out how it got off
the floor. I don't know how Ky got the shoe off the floor. But I'm standing
there and I heard something, and I just see something just go right by me,
like here's your shoe. I never seen anything like that. I mean, because my
question for him was you threw it to him, but what the hell was he going to do
with it? Was he going to stop and put it on? I've witnessed some things, man,
but I've never witnessed that. But you know what, it's something I can talk
about now. It's a teaching point. Why? Because you threw things on the floor,
I think they tell the fans that. I think I need to tell my players, you cannot
throw anything on the floor, man. People can get hurt. It whizzed right by me.
It was quite interesting.  
  
 Q. Pretty good arm, huh?  
COACH MIKE ANDERSON: Pretty good arm? Yeah, I don't know if he threw with his
right hand or left hand. I don't know.

# [NCAA MEN'S 2ND & 3RD ROUNDS:
JACKSONVILLE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2015&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+2ND+%26+3RD+ROUNDS%3A+JACKSONVILLE)

### [Roy Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14130)

  
_JACKSONVILLE, FLORIDA_  
  

NORTH CAROLINA - 67  
HARVARD - 65

COACH ROY WILLIAMS: I've got so many thoughts running through my mind right
now, it's hard to think of something. Our SID just showed me the notes and
information, and I was demoted. I'm an assistant coach. Steve Robinson is the
head coach, so I don't know why I'm up here because it said in error that I
was the assistant coach, so that's No. 1. No. 2, I asked Justin Jackson if he
had ever made a big shot to tie the game and another shot to win the game and
his coach went and screamed at him and reamed him out in the locker room, and
he said no. And the third thing is I feel like I've won the lottery because
Tommy Amaker did a much better job with his team than I did with mine. We were
extremely lucky. It's the luckiest I've ever felt after a basketball game in
my entire life. In saying that, I'm thrilled that we're still here and we're
still playing. These two guys beside me, Marcus made two big shots and Justin
made two big shots. If we had played a little bit better, it may not have
required that but you've got to give Harvard credit for driving me whacko.
I've got a guy that made his last two shots and should be on top of the world,
and I was screaming at him and the whole bit, but I did get him to grin once
we left the locker room, and a little bit there. That's it.  
  
 Q. Just comment on Wesley Saunders. Did you have a strategy for him,
and did you talk about him in the second half?  
COACH ROY WILLIAMS: Well, we thought we had a strategy for him but it didn't
work. But we had a couple of silly mistakes. We make a three -- Justin makes a
big three to start the second half, and I think we were up like 11 at half, so
we make a three to go up 14, and then two of our more experienced players
decided to leave their best player wide open and he makes a three immediately.
I'm looking at Marcus. He was one of them. The other one is not up here. But
he was a load, and we knew that. Last year he was Player of the Year in the
league. We tried to focus on him with our team. J.P. really did a pretty
doggone good job, but he was really, really hard to guard, and he had 15 at
half. I think we did a little bit better job in the second half. He finished
with 26, so not that much better. But yes, we went zone one time and that
didn't work, and we tried to go another defense and double one time and that
got a foul. So we just stuck with our bread and butter down the stretch and
got them to miss two shots.

_JACKSONVILLE, FLORIDA_  
  

XAVIER - 76  
OLE MISS - 57

COACH ANDY KENNEDY: Yeah, tough afternoon for us. Obviously the end comes to
most every team at this time of year. Really proud of our group for getting to
the NCAA Tournament, for advancing to the NCAA Tournament. We certainly did
not play well today. All credit goes to Xavier. They had complete control of
the tempo from the start, and we were never able to wrestle it away from them.  
  
Q. M.J., how much did it affect your game to pick up those two fouls so
quickly in the first half, and also can you talk about what it was like to go
against Matt Stainbrook and try and contain him?  
M.J. RHETT: I mean, he's a big body. He got me in foul trouble two minutes
into the game. Me being out of the game affected the team because I could have
brung way more energy in the first half, and I had to sit for the last 18
minutes. I mean, it was just tough.  
  
Q. Was the vibe in the locker room at halftime this time any different
from BYU or what were you guys saying this time?  
M.J. RHETT: I mean, I don't think it was really too much different. BYU had a
larger lead than Xavier did, and I mean, we just didn't impose our will today.
Like Coach always talked about our three keys, energy, toughness and focus,
and we didn't come with none of those today.  
  
JARVIS SUMMERS: I feel the same way. In the locker room we really wasn't
active and just got our heads up and things like that, and it's like we were
just moping around. I kind of put that on me because I'm the senior leader and
I didn't get my guys ready, and we just lost.  
  
Q. Did it seem like every time you guys made a run, tried to get back
in, that they had an answer whether it was a basket or a big three-pointer?
Did it seem that way?  
M.J. RHETT: Yeah, it was like that. Every time we tried to get a little spark,
any spark, they had an answer for it the whole game.  
  
Q. Not only Xavier's play down low, but they also had the three-point
ball going, specifically Dee Davis. How big was that to have the presence down
low and then have to defend the perimeter, as well?  
JARVIS SUMMERS: Well, it's difficult because they was getting a lot of scoring
in the low post from the big guy, and then whenever we tried to double-team
him -- he's got a good IQ for the game, and he was just passing out to the
guards, and they was making shots.  
  
Q. M.J., with that 17-point comeback to BYU last week, when did you
really think that this one was over and wasn't going to happen because you did
pull within ten?  
M.J. RHETT: I mean, I don't want to say it was -- it wasn't out of reach, we
just had to fight, and we didn't come with that fight today. We just didn't
come prepared today, none of us. It wasn't -- like, my awareness, I shouldn't
have got two fouls early in the first half. It affected the team, and we just
didn't bring it today.  
  
Q. The quick turnaround, was there any fatigue or did that play any role
into this?  
JARVIS SUMMERS: We can't use that as an excuse. We put ourselves in this
situation, and we just had to bounce back, and we didn't make it happen.  
  
M.J. RHETT: I feel the same way Jarvis did. Everybody in the NCAA Tournament
is doing the same thing as us. All of us have played 30-some games this year,
we've all been through the grind. We just had to bring it, and we didn't bring
it tonight.  
  
Q. Can you talk about your plan for Matt Stainbrook? You talked
yesterday about how you didn't have anyone size-wise to match up with him, so
what was your intent coming into the game?  
COACH ANDY KENNEDY: Our first goal was to try to do our work early and try to
make him catch it off the block, and then we were going to try to dig, but not
double, just dig so that he couldn't get into a rhythm. The frustration I had
is I think myself and however many people in the building knew he was going to
shoot it with his left hand to his right shoulder, and we continued let him
get to his strength. He's a good player; he's and excellent passer. We were
trying to play under him at times, and never could really get him out of
rhythm.  
  
Q. I think M.J. was asked about it earlier about him picking up those
three fouls. How much did that play into tonight?  
COACH ANDY KENNEDY: You know, M.J. was coming off a career night where he had
20 points against BYU, was making shots. I really thought the entire flow of
the game changed. Based on statistics, BYU plays that one-three-one zone which
is vastly different than ours but still very effective in what they're trying
to do. They play it about 10 percent of the time. We were so bad against it
early by being tentative, forcing shots. We were shooting when we should pass;
we were passing when we should shoot. M.J. would have really helped us in that
regard because he's out best, high-post decision maker, so when he was out of
the game, we had a couple other guys that weren't as comfortable in that role,
and as a result, I bet he went man-to-man one possession in the second half
and we got Moody on a pin-down and he hit a three. They stayed in that one-
three-one the entire game which through us completely out of rhythm. It's hard
to believe -- you saw it, but for the rest of you, it's hard to believe that
same team that you just saw struggling to dribble, pass and shoot, scored 62
points in a half, scored 94 points against a real NCAA Tournament team. It's
hard to believe when you see that, but we got really tentative, and we had
guys that were -- it wasn't for lack of effort. It was just we never got in
any rhythm. Basketball is a game of rhythm. Establish yours, disrupt theirs.
That's what Xavier did to us. They established theirs; they disrupted ours.  
  
Q. You mentioned 62 points in the second half. Was there that mindset
that we could do it again type of thing or did it seem like the energy wasn't
there?  
COACH ANDY KENNEDY: You know, I've got a good group of guys. They pay
attention, they're on time, they're doing what they're supposed to be doing as
representatives of the University. They're not as externally fiery, so it
doesn't mean that they're not engaged. You've seen Jarvis. That's how Jarvis
is all the time. It doesn't mean that he's not engaged in the action, he's
just not very demonstrative. It's hard to be demonstrative. It's hard to
really get going when you struggle as we did tonight offensively. We had that
thing just based off trying to spread it out, press it a little bit, getting
some loose balls. We had it to 10. For whatever reason we throw ahead to
Coleby, and he throws it away an ends up being a three-point play. That was
probably our last hurrah. I think it was problem right around the four-minute
time-out. Get a basket there, it's eight, it's seven, maybe a little game
pressure, maybe we could -- one last stand. But I thought that took the wind
out of our sails.  
  
Q. For someone who's been as supportive of the program as Jarvis, what's
it like to see his career come to an end like that?  
COACH ANDY KENNEDY: I hate it for Jarvis. He's had a tremendous career for us.
He's been a leader, he's been steady. He's had a tough year all year shooting
the basketball, and I guess it's somewhat fitting that he would end with his
struggles offensively. But without Jarvis and without Snoop and without A.J.
and without M.J. and without Terence, the five seniors who the journey ends
tonight, you know, we're not here. We're not in the NCAA and we're certainly
not in the position that we were to have the chance to advance. I'm proud of
those guys and what they were able to accomplish.  
  
Q. I think it was five or so minutes left late in the stretch, Newby
tried that alley-oop. Do you see that as a microcosm?  
COACH ANDY KENNEDY: I think it's a very astute observation, awareness. What in
the world are you doing? That's what I was thinking, but I see it every day.
You guys just see it every once in a while.  
  
Q. Sorry if you've already been asked this, but Stainbrook in the
middle, just the skill set that he had, what was the challenge?  
COACH ANDY KENNEDY: No, we haven't seen anybody like him, and as I was saying
earlier, our goal initially was to try to not allow him deep touches because
if he gets it deep, then he doesn't have to move you, he can just score over
the top. And I thought at times we did a decent job of that. My frustration
was, again, just scouting report. Allowing him to get to his strong hand every
single time. It's frustrating, and it's easier said than done. He's good at
it. And then he's obviously a very good passer. We were going to try to play
under him in that press some. We stat -- 50/50 balls at half, it was 6-1. I
think they ended up being like 9-2 on 50/50 balls. That's not the way we can
be successful. We have to come up with those loose ones. We never got an
opportunity to get out on the open floor and then they packed back in that
zone and we go 6 for 27 from three, it's going to be a long night.

_JACKSONVILLE, FLORIDA_  
  

GEORGIA STATE - 57  
BAYLOR - 56

COACH RON HUNTER: I'm going to start off by saying this: First of all, it was
a great game. But I'm not going to be coach, I'm going to be dad right now.
Proud as hell of this guy. This is my son. Proud of him, so I wanted to say
that. I haven't been able to do that for three years so I wanted to say I'm
proud of him. Now to the game. These kids are so resilient, really resilient.
It's been like this all year. We kind of laugh because nothing has been given
to us. It's been hard everything we've done this year. We played without 20
points in our lineup of course with Ryan Harrow, and this is like the tenth
time we've played without Ryan and we've won all of them. This group is just
unbelievable. We never gave up. I think we got down five and were in a time-
out and just can you it was kind of unsettled, and we just talked out hang in
there, believe. I said yesterday if you got to the five-minute mark and we
were within a couple possessions, we would win the game. We would win the
game. And so the kids believed, and my offspring here hit an unbelievable
shot. I thought the way he finished the game was terrific.  
  
 Q. R.J., the opposing coach from Baylor said that he felt like the
three you hit with about a minute half to go kind of got you going. Were you
not as assertive as you wanted to be earlier because you only had about seven
shot attempts up until the last three minutes.  
R.J. HUNTER: Yeah, I was as assertive as possible, I just wasn't trying to
force anything. I thought they did a good job of finding me and I wasn't
making shots early, but this guy stepped up huge and you should be asking him
the questions about the shots because he knocked down some huge shots. We just
fought until the end, and that's what we wanted to do, and thank God for that
50-footer I threw in.  
  
 Q. Kevin or Ryann, can you talk about the way you guys were able to
hang in there and wait for R.J. to get going?  
KEVIN WARE: Second half we were really just trying to pick R.J. up as much as
possible. A lot of the shots he usually makes weren't falling. A lot of shots
that I make weren't falling, either, so we just tried to get it done
defensively. Like R.J. said, Ryann really carried us this game. Him and Isaiah
Dennis should really get a lot of credit.  
  
 Q. So in the huddle with about a minute 40 to go, you guys were down
ten. What did you tell your team in the huddle there?  
COACH RON HUNTER: We talked about keep believing. Don't worry about the score.
Sometimes you get so consumed by the score, and I felt we had a chance because
we were turning them over in the press. I said, keep pressing, press pressing,
don't foul. I thought they did a great job of that and really listened. And
what I thought was more important is earlier in the year when we got in those
situations, then we would try to shoot threes to come back. We were driving
the ball, using our timeouts, and getting to the free-throw line. We've been
in that situation before, and again, it worked perfectly, and it had to for us
to get the win. But these guys believed in what we were doing.  
  
 Q. Drew mentioned in his press conference that they hadn't turned the
ball over that much all season and didn't really scout the press that well or
didn't expect to turn the ball over that much. Did you see something
specifically on film this week that led you to that?  
COACH RON HUNTER: Well, it wasn't about them. I had to convince my guys that
we could beat them. And the only way I could convince them is, I said we had
to throw the first punch and the last punch, and the only way to do it was by
pressing. I wanted Baylor to know we weren't afraid to play them. We weren't
going to sit back in our normal match-up, that we were going to go out and
throw punches against them, and we do that by pressing. In the last month of
the season, our press has been unbelievable.  
  
 Q. R.J., did you see your dad fall off the chair after you hit the
three-pointer, and what do you remember about the 9-0 run that you had in the
final two minutes?  
R.J. HUNTER: First question, yeah, I saw him cannonball off his chair. I told
him, they've got to get him a chair with a back or something, because that
wasn't going to work. What was the second question?  
  
 Q. What do you remember about the 9-0 run that you had in the final two
minutes?  
R.J. HUNTER: I was just trying to make a play, man. At that point I was just
trying to do anything I possibly could. I think that first three got me going.
As a shooter you've got to see -- I mean, all you've got to do is see one go
in, so once I saw that, I got a little bit of confidence and that's the
confidence I needed?  
  
 Q. Kevin, Coach was telling us yesterday about the speech you gave the
team on Sunday when you guys knew you were going into the NCAA Tournament and
how you spoke to your teammates. I noticed today out on the floor, you were
sort of a calming presence. You were directing your guys, you were advising
people out there. When you guys were down by ten, what sorts of things were
you saying to your teammates?  
KEVIN WARE: Just don't give up. That's what Coach Hunter kept telling us, so
that's what I had to put in my head. I saw Ryann crying like a little punk
over there, and I really didn't want this to be his last game. We've got some
seniors that fought hard all year, and we just wanted to fight and win this
game. We're just happy to be going to the Elite 32.  
  
 Q. Do you guys believe in miracles?  
R.J. HUNTER: Yeah, now we do.  
  
KEVIN WARE: Definitely.  
  
 Q. Ron, this is not a loaded question. When is the last time in your
life you ever got picked up by a woman off the floor?  
COACH RON HUNTER: Wow. Is my wife around here? You know, I had her back there,
and she's been great. Since Sunday she's been a life saver. Before the game,
they had to saw off the top part of the cast because my knee started swelling
up. So I couldn't move this morning and her and the doctor were great. They
sawed it off and they had pliers and everything in there. I was like, you've
got to be kidding me. This has been unbelievable. As I told the guys, we
haven't slept a whole lot, we played Sunday, we turned around, played today,
and we've been traveling. I told them at the beginning, and this isn't a knock
on the NCAA or any of that, I said, guys, at the end of the day, think about
this, they put Baylor up in the Hyatt, the flew in here on a nice charter
flight. They put us on a bus and put us in the Holiday Inn, and guess what, we
get to stay another day, so we're really excited about that.  
  
 Q. She's normally at the end of the bench?  
COACH RON HUNTER: Yeah, she never sits behind me. Yeah, she'll be there this
time on Saturday.  
  
 Q. Do you have a message for the people back in Atlanta who supported
you this whole season? You had about 500 to 1,000 fans there. They were going
ballistic. Do you have a message for them and the people of Atlanta?  
COACH RON HUNTER: Yeah, first of all, I have a message to the people at
Georgia State. I am so happy for our alumni, faculty, students and staff. They
really deserve it. We're right in downtown Atlanta. We are in the heart of
Atlanta being downtown, so I'm so excited for Georgia State and what we're
doing in that regard. But also we represent the city of Atlanta, and we're the
only team in Atlanta playing in the NCAA Tournament. I saw Kasim's texts and
those things and I appreciate that. But what we need is we need some people to
drive down here, man. Come down on Saturday, drive down. You have nothing else
to do. If you want a bus, I'll pay for a bus. I'll ask my president to pay for
a bus -- I'm sorry. But come on down. We need that. But I love the support and
what the arena gave us today.  
  
 Q. You've played in the tournament, you've coached in the tournament.
But today you've won in the tournament. All your life this is what basketball
guys like yourself try to get to. Now you're there. How long do you figure
it'll be until you digest this, when you're coming out of anæsthesia
finally?  
COACH RON HUNTER: Yeah, off the pain pills they gave me this morning. I think
what it means more importantly to me, and I think I said it yesterday, I get
to do it with this guy, man. There are a lot of coaches that get to get to the
Elite 32 or the Final Four, but when you get to do it with your son, you can
watch your son hit a half court shot, I can't tell you how I feel inside.
That's unbelievable. I wish every dad in America could have that opportunity,
what I just experienced with my son.  
  
 Q. Ryann, you've been sitting there quietly. You let your shooting do
the talking today. What was the most memorable part of the game when it looked
like Baylor, the Bears were on their heels, and it looked like you guys were
finding your rhythm? Give us a sense of what that was like on the floor?  
RYANN GREEN: Well, it was just a matter of time. We knew if we just
persevered, did our run, we knew we had another run in us, and we wasn't just
going to go away easily. We knew -- I knew out of the -- when we hit R.J. on
the slip and he hit the bank shot after he hit the three, I knew we was here
to stay. That was it for me.  
  
 Q. Ron and R.J., how gratifying is this, almost 365 days after
dominating the Sun Belt, getting so close to making the NCAA Tournament and
then letting that lead slip against Lafayette? How gratifying is this moment,
given what had happened just one year ago when you were so close to having
this moment, and having it slip away in the conference tournament final?  
R.J. HUNTER: Well, I think with 2:54 left, I said that. I said at this time
last year, we gave up this 10-point lead, so anything can happen. And right
after that, we went on that run. Just going through that and going through all
types of basketball situations, you see everything, so I don't think we were
rattled, and we just made plays when we had to.  
  
 Q. R.J., we've heard your dad talk about what it meant to him to be
able to share this moment with you, but how about you to be able to kind of
share this experience in that game with your dad? What does that mean to
you?  
R.J. HUNTER: It's unbelievable and a dream come true. Growing up in your dad's
profession is trying to get to the NCAA Tournament. We've had so many
downfalls trying to be in second place, and for us to be here now, I hugged my
sister and said, we're going to be in One Shining Moment because we always
watched that as a family. That's what we watch when your dad is a coach. It's
unbelievable, man. It's a little surreal right now. It's a little hard to
digest, and God looked out for me today.

_JACKSONVILLE, FLORIDA_  
  

GEORGIA STATE - 57  
BAYLOR - 56

COACH SCOTT DREW: Well, I think I've been a part of one of the best moments in
college basketball in the NCAA Tournament with my brother hitting that shot
and I think I've been part of one of the worst that I'll remember, R.J.
hitting that shot. The thing I've been disappointed with is all year long
we've executed down the stretch. We've been a tough team and I feel bad the
way that the last five minutes went from the standpoint, 21 turnovers for us
all game. That's not who we are, and yet I know that's what will be dwelt upon
and talked about is how we didn't finish the game, and that's on me as a
coach.  
  
Q. Taurean, you guys have handled the press really well all year. What
happened today?  
TAUREAN PRINCE: Made some mental errors as far as trying to get the ball to
our ball handlers and making sure they get to the free-throw line, but it
happens to the best of them, and we're just going to move on from it.  
  
Q. Kenny and Royce, your view of the R.J. shot there? It looked like he
was a good 30 feet out. Were you expecting him to take the shot at that
point?  
ROYCE O'NEALE: We knew he was going to shoot it, he just made a good shot.  
  
KENNY CHERY: He just made a contested three. There was nothing we could do
about it. We did our job, and he just made it.  
  
Q. Royce, when you see a shot like that that goes down and your season
and you've worked so hard, how difficult is it to see that happen?  
ROYCE O'NEALE: We've been preparing all season for moments like those. He hit
a good shot. I mean...  
  
Q. Kenny, you guys had a 12-point lead, just under three minutes left.
What were you thinking at that point and did y'all feel like you got a little
too tentative, or how would you describe it?  
KENNY CHERY: We probably did, but they executed.  
  
Q. Coach, the press was something you guys did very well all year. What
were they doing differently or was it just execution on your part?  
COACH SCOTT DREW: I think that's March Madness from the standpoint it's a big
moment, and we didn't embrace it. We didn't handle -- that 21, I can't
remember having 21 turnovers. The last two times we played West Virginia, I
think we were ten or under, around that area. Momentum is a big thing, and
once you make one turnover, now all of a sudden, things get sped up, and I
think that's what happened to us. Their defense is good, and they've got to
get a lot of the credit for causing us to turn it over because Kenny, Lester,
and Royce have been very good all year long at handling pressure.  
  
Q. Scott, did you feel like -- I think John asked Kenny, did you feel
like you got a little tentative or passive because y'all didn't score a field
goal in the last five and a half minutes.  
COACH SCOTT DREW: Yeah, that's my fault. You've got a 12-point lead with three
to go, so even though we weren't scoring, we were taking time off the clock.
We had some good looks when we went late clock with one of our sets and then
twice we didn't get a good look. In hindsight definitely would have preferred
to start the clock earlier on those two plays. But I think the biggest thing
would have been if you take out the turnovers in the last three minutes, I
mean, that would be the difference. Even when we're coming down on the fast
break, if you finish that, you're good. You get the rebound. If you hold it,
you're good. If you make your two free throws, you're good. I mean, there's a
plethora of things that went wrong in the last three minutes. It wasn't one
play. I mean, Kenny is the all time best free throw shooter in our history, no
one you trust more on the line. I know that was the big thing in the locker
room, just making sure they know that no player, no one play, led to this
loss. I mean, we had 21 turnovers. We had a lot of other opportunities.  
  
Q. You'd actually done a really good job on R.J. for about the first 35
minutes. Was it just a case of him finally getting loose or were they doing
some things to get him loose?  
COACH SCOTT DREW: Well, he wasn't shooting from 30 feet earlier in the game. I
mean, those two deep threes he made -- I thought the first one, if we could
have kept a guard up high, there was no reason to not be up there with him.
And that got him going, I think, when he -- at the 1:34 mark when he hit that
three. If we could have taken that one out, then I don't know if -- down the
stretch, he showed his versatility in different ways he could score, but I
thought that was the three that got him going.  
  
Q. Y'all have done such a great job against the press all year. Was it
something about their press that was different or how did you see it?  
COACH SCOTT DREW: I think that's just about the tournament. It's a bigger
moment, more pressure. I mean, unfortunately, we made mistakes that we haven't
made during the year, and it was probably the last thing I was worried about
coming into the game was their press from the standpoint we've been so good
against it.

_JACKSONVILLE, FLORIDA_  
  

ARKANSAS - 56  
WOFFORD - 53 COACH MIKE ANDERSON: First of all, Mike Young and Wofford, what a
gutsy performance. It was a game played at their pace, and we were fortunate
to be on the winning side. As I was telling our guys back there, they just ran
out of time. Thank goodness, they ran out of time. A game that went back and
forth. The largest lead was probably three points, but we executed when we had
to. Hats off to our guys. I thought the nerves were going early just being in
the tournament. They got real tired early on, but Wofford, I'll tell you what,
they've got some guys that can really shoot the basketball. They're good at
what they do, and for our guys to have played against them playing the way
they played and find a way to win, that speaks volumes of these guys, and I
couldn't be no more prouder than these guys.  
  
 Q. Could you describe what turned out to be the winning three-point
play?  
ALANDISE HARRIS: I just ran the floor hard and called for it and Kyle found me
and I just went up strong and finished.  
  
 Q. Michael and Alandise, seemed like you weren't able to get in the
groove that you normally get in. Did you feel like you had to pick up the
scoring, with how good they were playing defense, on Bobby particularly?  
MICHAEL QUALLS: You know, no. We just take the shots we usually take. It was
more of a next share defense, so it was kind of tough on Bobby and us to get
those entry passes in there. Bobby is a big target, so we just kept cutting
and kept moving, and we just happened to have the open shot at the time.  
  
ALANDISE HARRIS: You've got to throw it in there and let him see what he can
do and cut him off and just play basketball and live with the results.  
  
 Q. Bobby, just talk about the tempo of this game. I'm sure internally
you thought you were going to make a run and pull away, but it was hard to
pull away, wasn't it?  
BOBBY PORTIS: Oh, yes, sir, because they just kept coming at us and coming at
us, just getting easy baskets off their assists, off their orange set that
they was running. That was pretty much it just because you know they were just
running sets on us and making good shots.  
  
 Q. Mike and Bobby, what did you think of those last two threes? They
were pretty decent looks that Wofford had. What was going through your mind
there?  
BOBBY PORTIS: What went through my mind was I didn't want to go to another
overtime because our team went through two or three overtimes during the
season this year. So I didn't want to go to overtime just because you know in
overtime crazy things happen.  
  
MICHAEL QUALLS: You know, I was actually just trying to run to the open man.
It was crazy. It was crazy out there. When the first shot went up, he had a
very good look at it, so they had another good look, so I almost had a heart
attack out there. But it is what it is. The worst case scenario we would have
went to overtime, would have had to handle business.  
  
 Q. Obviously this game feels good to survive and advance to the next
round. Now you've got a big tall task against the North Carolina Tar Heels, a
very historic program. How do you feel about having an opportunity to go
against a big time team like the North Carolina Tar Heels?  
ALANDISE HARRIS: I feel like it's a great opportunity for us to be able to
showcase the way we play again on a national stage and in the NCAA Tournament
against a good basketball program. It's just another challenge, and we'll be
ready for the challenge.  
  
BOBBY PORTIS: I think it's big for us to come out just ready to play Saturday.
Like our team can come out like we did today, it could get ugly, but hopefully
our team comes out ready to play Saturday and can live with the results.  
  
MICHAEL QUALLS: Arkansas is a big time program, too. I look forward to it. I'm
not sure but I think Harvard put up a good fight against them. You know the
dance is the dance. You never know. It's just the best team that game. We're
going to come out, we're going to bring our hardhats and just be prepared for
North Carolina.  
  
 Q. Coach, how do you think your team adjusted to playing a game not at
their ideal tempo?  
COACH MIKE ANDERSON: I said that in the opening statement. I think it's kudos
to our guys. We can win a lot of different ways, and I think we showed that
tonight. We've been in a lot of games that have been close where it comes down
to a possession, where teams have slowed us down. And the thing -- I have the
utmost confidence and faith in these guys that they're going to carry out
their assignments, and they did, and you talk about the shot there at the end,
fatigue was a big part of that. It seemed like the shot stayed in the air for
quite a while. But our guys have done a good job. We've got some guys that
bring good leadership to our basketball team. They don't get rattled. They
don't panic. So the experiences of playing in so many close games, and people
call us the Cardiac Kids. So I'm sure Razorback Nation back home, they're
saying it right now, what are they trying to do to us? But we're trying to
find a way to win the game.  
  
 Q. I just added it up real quick, you guys are 10-2 in games decided by
six points or less. How much does that experience -- going through that so
many times, does that help keep pressure off you in late game situations like
this?  
MICHAEL QUALLS: Yeah, we don't get rattled, and it's almost a carryover over
two years. Last year our team, they had nothing to do with this year, but
there was a couple close games that we let go just because of inexperience and
just crunch time. We weren't ready yet. But this year we've grown. We're
better players. We have a better team. With that being said, there's no reason
to get nervous. We've got a good team. If they made that bucket, like I said,
we know we was going to handle business in overtime.  
  
 Q. Coach Anderson, what was the challenge with getting the game to be
at the pace where you wanted it to be at with what they were doing, to keep
that from happening?  
COACH MIKE ANDERSON: It's funny you say that because I thought -- going in at
halftime, I kind of vented a little bit, and as I vented, I did it pretty
early and gave them probably one or two minutes to just talk amongst
themselves. And I was in a little secluded room, but I kind of heard what was
going on, and it's amazing how sometimes they know when they're not playing
the way they're capable of playing. And I just heard some of these guys that
are up here right now, hey, we've got to go pick it up, guys, ratchet our
defense up, get after these guys. They're a good team, but we're much better.
Once they started doing that, all of a sudden they understand, they're taking
some ownership, and we saw in the second half. We played with a little bit
more passion, a little bit more urgency. Our defense was making it difficult
on Wofford. My hats off to those guys.  
  
 Q. Coach said earlier that he thought you guys started the game with a
little bit of nerves. Did you feel the nerves coming into the game, or what
was the slower start for you guys?  
MICHAEL QUALLS: You know, it's a big stage. No one has ever played in the NCAA
Tournament on our team, so it was just a big -- it was big for us. We wanted
to come out. I felt like everybody was so overeager and overzealous that we
just had to calm down and settle our nerves. But that just shows you the
leadership that we have on this team. We didn't get rattled. We talked to the
younger guys on the team, telling them, hey, we've done this before, we're
going to do what we do. And I feel like in the second half, after we did come
together and had a conversation as brothers, that's what made us take off in
the second half.  
  
 Q. You're a perfect guy to ask this question. Why has the gap narrowed
between the big boys and the mid-majors? We had two big upsets today. Every
year now, four, five, six upsets where the double digit seeds beat a higher
seed from a power conference. Is it the fact that we've got the one-and-done
rule, 351 schools playing this sport? Why is it that the little guys have been
able to beat up on the power conference teams in the NCAA Tournament?  
COACH MIKE ANDERSON: I think number one is you've got 13 scholarships so
everybody has got players now. When you get to this stage right here, it's
about the best team. You can go talent for talent on each of these teams, and
you're like, man, there's no way they can hang with those guys. But that's
coaching. So I think coaches recruit to their system, their style, and they
stay with it, and that's -- when I look at Mike Young's team, they're a very
talented basketball team. So it ain't the little guy versus the big guys
anymore. We've seen Wichita State, we've seen VCU. I always tell our guys,
don't look at nobody's jersey. Everybody has got players now. I think that's a
big part of it, as well. Everybody has got players now, and so you look at
some of the players that are -- the Faried kid. You just think about it. You
look at the Cochran kid, he's a dynamite player. Everybody has got good
players, and that's called parity.

NORTH CAROLINA - 67  
HARVARD - 65

COACH TOMMY AMAKER: Congratulations to UNC. What a tremendous basketball team
they are. As we knew coming into the basketball game how challenging it was
going to be with their transition game and then their offensive rebounding.
Certainly those two areas were assets for their ballclub as they've been all
year. Can't say enough about the effort that our kids put forth, the battle to
get back in it. I thought we played with great poise and Wesley Saunders and
Siyani, these guys are the two main guys that do everything for our ballclub,
carried us to put us in a position to have a chance. I'm very proud of our
team. I thought we did exactly what we tried to do from a game plan
standpoint, but they're certainly talented and worthy of victory.  
  
Q. Wes, just take me through the last few moments, the last shot when
you put it up, and then obviously when you see it doesn't go in, the emotions
running through your head?  
WESLEY SAUNDERS: Yeah, the play was actually set up for Corbin to get the
ball, try to get him open off a screen. So me and Siyani -- Siyani exchanged
it with me, I looked for Corbin, but they obviously knew he was a great
shooter, so they were kind of cheating towards him. So I realized the clock
was running down so I had to get up a shot. It felt kind of good, and it just
went off the backboard, and it was just demoralizing, but we came out and
battled and we fought against a great team, and that's all you can really ask
for.  
  
Q. Siyani, after Corbin made that three-point shot, how did it start
snowballing for you guys?  
SIYANI CHAMBERS: Coach just told us to keep fighting, eventually our shots
would go down. We had some good looks in the first half, they didn't go down.
Coach just really emphasized at halftime to keep getting stops and having
offensive possessions, and when Corbin hit it, it really gave us a shot in the
arm because when Corbin makes threes, it gives us a shot in the arm. When he
made that, it got us on a nice run that we kept riding till the end, and we
weren't able to capitalize at the end of the game. But give UNC a lot of
credit, they played a great game. I'm really proud of the senior class. They
left a great legacy. I learned so much from them, and I can't thank them
enough.  
  
Q. Siyani, on that note, you're kind of going to be inheriting this team
from these guys. Did you learn enough from them to carry that legacy
forward?  
SIYANI CHAMBERS: Definitely. Definitely. I've learned a lot from Wes Saunders,
and especially Alex Nesbitt who doesn't really play a lot. But over my three
years he's really taught me a lot, and I have a lot of faith in the coaching
staff and the rest of the teammates that are coming back next year, and we'll
continue to do what this senior class started for us, and hopefully can just
follow in their footsteps.  
  
Q. Siyani, just the four-point play, that happened because Wes was able
to tip an offensive rebound out to you. How hard was it just battling on the
boards? You guys knew it would be tough, and then how much of a shift was that
play as far as an injection going into the final minute?  
SIYANI CHAMBERS: Right. You know, rebounding, keeping them off the glass, and
even attacking it ourselves was a very big emphasis that we had going into
this game. We didn't do very well in the first half. Coach mentioned it at
halftime, and I think we did a great job in the second half, our bigs battled,
Jonah Travis, Kenyatta Smith, Steve Moundou-Missi. And even our wings and
Wesley, like you said, when the tip went in, and -- when the shot went in, I
think it gave us a lot of energy. Thanks to Wes for making the play, but it
was close. We thought we'd be able to pull it out and they made a great play,
and we just weren't able to execute enough at the end, but it was a good
momentum play.  
  
Q. Obviously you end up getting asked these questions about perspective
like five minutes after when you can't really have perspective, but if you
look at what you were able to do with this program, what does it make you
feel?  
WESLEY SAUNDERS: Yeah, I mean, it's great. I mean, I wouldn't rather go out
there and battle with any other group of guys. I mean, our coaching staff, I
love them. Everybody is like family. We've been through good times, bad times,
and I mean, it's just been a blessing that I've been able to be a part of
this. This obviously isn't the finish that I wanted to have, but we knew it
was going to end eventually, so it's just been great. It's been a great four
years, and I'm just so thankful that I've been able to be a part of this
program.  
  
Q. I was just wondering, on the last play it looked like y'all were
playing to win. Was there any consideration to trying to get kind of a closer
shot, go for the tie?  
COACH TOMMY AMAKER: You know, we certainly have situations that we go over
when we're down one possession and things that we're looking for. We wanted it
in Wesley's hands. As he mentioned earlier, we were trying to see if we could
steal something from Corbin, but Wesley is our play maker, and certainly it
wasn't there to get the three, and we wanted obviously for Wesley to make a
decision. The way he's been playing, he played tonight, he was outstanding. I
thought he was as good as anybody that played in our game here this evening.
So if he was going to get a three, get a drive, get a two, we were going to
live with his decision there, but we certainly had something called when we
were down one possession.  
  
Q. Before the game, we were talking about just how much Wesley does, but
there was a point where he either scored or assisted on all of the first half
buckets. How much does he do to keep you guys in it?  
COACH TOMMY AMAKER: Well, it was obvious that Wesley is an outstanding
basketball player. He's a terrific all-around player. He's been playing great
coming into this game and certainly played exceptionally well tonight. We need
him to do so much for our team. As I've said before, it's not always the
points he scores, it's the points he's responsible for, and I can't imagine --
obviously we didn't sub for him. He played 40 minutes, and he was responsible
for a heck of a lot of production for our team this evening.  
  
Q. Was there ever a question that he wasn't going to play 40 minutes?  
COACH TOMMY AMAKER: No, not unless he was in foul trouble.  
  
Q. You talked a little bit about just the rebound control in the game.
There was a stretch in the first half, five minutes go by, you miss five
shots, they turn all of them into buckets. How hard was that?  
COACH TOMMY AMAKER: Yeah, it's really deflating. We thought we had some pretty
good looks early in the game in the first half, and we weren't able to get
them to fall. We didn't finish around the rim, we left one free throw there on
the foul line. Wesley, actually his only miss at the foul line. Against a team
like North Carolina you have to cash in when you get opportunities, and I
thought early that really hurt us and put us in the deficit that we had going
into the half. But we certainly gave everything we had in the second half and
how we battled and showed a lot of poise, and I thought a lot of toughness to
make this a nail-biter right down to the stretch.  
  
Q. Two of the things you talked about Wednesday were rebounding and
keeping the pace under control. How would you grade yourself in those two
categories?  
COACH TOMMY AMAKER: I'm looking at the numbers for rebounding, and I wouldn't
have thought that we would have had the same number of offensive rebounds that
they had, assuming this is correct. I'm shocked at that. But certainly they're
really, really big and long and athletic on the front line and deep. I thought
the transition points -- points in the paint and transition points, not only
did they get it off the glass at times, but they can throw it in there and
post us, and they were certainly doing that a lot.  
  
Q. Siyani is already a captain. Just talk about going forward with him
in an expanded leadership role.  
COACH TOMMY AMAKER: Yeah, he's been front and center for us since the day he
walked on campus. I anticipate that he's going to continue to show his
leadership and all the things that he knows how to do in terms of being a
winner. That's what he knows, that's what he's done his whole life, that's
what he's been able to contribute to our program, and I anticipate that he's
going to do that and then some for his senior year with the returning guys and
incoming guys. I have all the confidence in the world having our team and our
program in Siyani Chambers' hands.

_JACKSONVILLE, FLORIDA_  
  

ARKANSAS - 56  
WOFFORD - 53

COACH MIKE YOUNG: A great college basketball game. Hats off to Coach Anderson
and his team. I'm so disappointed that we didn't win, but you know, Arkansas
is Arkansas. They are very, very good, and Michael Qualls is terrific, and
they chased us off some things, as I thought they would. But again, I'm just
so darned disappointed that we don't have the opportunity to come back over
here on Saturday and play again with this team. We knew we had a great team
coming in. Arkansas is just a little bit better.  
  
Q. How close do you think those two threes were to going in, and what
was going through y'all's mind in the final seconds?  
SPENCER COLLINS: I thought the threes were going to go in, but unfortunately
they rimmed out. That's part of the game sometimes. Shots go in, shots don't
go in. We had a couple of good looks at it. They were wide open. But like I
said earlier, unfortunately they just didn't go in for us at the right time.  
  
Q. Looking at the tempo that Arkansas plays and also just with
turnovers, how do you feel like Wofford was able to play and slow down the
tempo today and play at our pace?  
JAYLEN ALLEN: We just came out and did what we always do. We rebounded and
played good defense, and we don't take bad shots and we try to limit our
turnovers. We feel like if we do that, we control the tempo of the game. If it
falls in our favor -- it kind of fell in our favor tonight, we just couldn't
get some shots to go down at the end. Just bad luck.  
  
Q. What did both of you guys think of Michael Qualls because he seemed
to be about the only thing Arkansas had going offensively?  
SPENCER COLLINS: Well, the dude is athletic. He's really, really great. He has
a great shot. He's really athletic. He can get to the rim. But I felt like our
team limited him in a way, keeping him off the offensive boards, just trying
to contain him. But like I say, he's a really great player, and he was really
a key part for their victory tonight. Our team tried to do our best to contain
him.  
  
Q. You guys seemed to do a really good job of keeping Bobby Portis under
control. I know he's going to get his points, but what was the key to keeping
him from going crazy on you?  
COACH MIKE YOUNG: One, we've got a really good defensive team. We aren't as
big as Arkansas, so we can't guard him with one. We have to guard him with our
team, and we have to move in the direction of the ball when it's in Bobby's
hands down there and give him some things to think about, put him in a beehive
for lack of a better expression. When he floors it, he's got somebody, another
player digging at the ball, trying to grab it out of there. Now, he made a
great play in the first half and he stuck it back up to 14 for a made three.
One of their only made threes for the game. But the only big, the only big
post guy that really roughed us up was Okafor. I thought we did a really nice
job on Portis, and he's obviously a very, very fine basketball player.  
  
Q. I was just wondering if you thought there was anything they did
specifically defensively on Cochran or whether he just kind of had a bad
night.  
COACH MIKE YOUNG: You know, length and athleticism is a tricky thing, and
they've got a lot of that. And I thought Coach Anderson at some point would
put Qualls on him, so athletic and so aggressive. I mean, they did a nice job
of extending his cut with a person guarding the screener. He's been a
tremendous, tremendous player for us. He'd be the first to tell you he missed
some that he typically gets down, but we're not here without that guy. I
admire him greatly.  
  
Q. Coach, speaking to that length that Arkansas has, you guys were able
to offensive rebound very well today and your second chance points were huge.
How were you able to do that against such a big team like Arkansas? What was
the communication like?  
COACH MIKE YOUNG: As good as Arkansas is, we thought we would have some
opportunities on the glass. They don't -- they're size rebounders. We don't
have size rebounders. We've got guys that have a nose for the ball. I thought
Justin and Skinner and C.J. Newman had a big stick back there in the second
half. Scores in the 50s, we've got nine more shots than Arkansas, we had eight
turnovers. I would bet my last dollar we won that game. But we didn't,
obviously. We'll go back to Spartanburg.  
  
Q. Talk to us about the last possession --  
COACH MIKE YOUNG: Not good. Yes, sir.  
  
Q. Were you surprised that they did not foul?  
COACH MIKE YOUNG: No, no. You think about Portis and Qualls, their ability to
rebound the ball, wasn't surprised they didn't foul. And I didn't handle that
last one very well. We had something we wanted to go to, and I don't know --
we just did not handle it very well. We've been in that situation any number
of times, and you know, have bounced right to it. For whatever reason, we
didn't handle it well, and that will bother me for quite some time.

_JACKSONVILLE, FLORIDA_  
  

XAVIER - 76  
OLE MISS - 57

COACH CHRIS MACK: I'm really proud of our group. I thought, to be completely
honest, I thought the one-three-one zone really neutralized Ole Miss. The fact
that they played a game, seems like yesterday, I'm sure didn't help their
cause. A lot of their shots were flat, short, and I thought our guys did a
really good job in both halves of really playing a defense that is a secondary
defense for us. And then offensively, I thought our guys did a really good job
of adjusting to changing defenses, handling Ole Miss's zone looks without
turning it over. We turned it over a few times down the stretch, but you know,
held on enough to be able to seal the game. When you play a team like Ole
Miss, you've got to do a great job on the glass. Going zone probably hurt us
in that sense, but we just felt like it was the most effective defense.  
  
 Q. Matt, you talked after the last game about how you felt a lot of
pressure as a senior to play well in the NCAA Tournament. Talk about today how
you were able to exploit their defense and score 20 points.  
MATT STAINBROOK: Yeah, I think we did a good job sort of pounding the ball
inside to begin with, and when we can do that and establish inside, then it
really opens up the outside, and Dee and a couple other guys, J.P. were
hitting some big shots outside to keep the floor stretched. They did look a
little tired and they had to play that game, but over all they were a really
tough team. They never stopped playing they're very handsy, and I'm just glad
we came out with a win.  
  
 Q. Matt, could you share with us the conversation you had before the
technical, what kind of transpired there?  
MATT STAINBROOK: It was something like, hey, I like your shoes, and he's like,
oh, I also like your shoes, and that's just pretty much what happened.  
  
 Q. That was one of those situations where they made four points out of
it. You got your third foul, that was a point where things could have
collapsed, but --  
MATT STAINBROOK: Yeah, it was a mistake by me. He dunked the ball on me and
had a couple words for me and then I knew to come back was stupid. The second
guy always gets noticed, so it was dumb on my part and disappointing. But
yeah, it's something where once they made those two free throws and got the
ball, I knew I couldn't let my team down like that. I tried to talk to my
guys, don't let that be a turning point for them. We saw that in Georgetown
when we got a technical and they rallied from that. I'm just -- that won't
happen again. There won't be any other technicals from me.  
  
 Q. Chris, you've talked all year in these big games about guys stepping
up who maybe don't usually have big games. How key was that tonight to have
some of those guys do that?  
COACH CHRIS MACK: I thought our bench played really well. J.P. hit a ton of --
a couple shots that I thought gave us some momentum. He also took a couple
shots that I felt like strangled him. But sometimes -- the good with the bad
with J.P., he's a freshman, he hasn't been in that situation before, but I
thought all of our bench guys did a good job. Jalen didn't shoot very well
from the field, I thought he was rushed, but Jalen is a much better player
than that. Myles hit that three at the end. James who hasn't been a starter
are year for us, to go 13 rebounds against that front line of Ole Miss, says
something about the type of rebounder he is. He's made the most of his
opportunity, and just fortunate to advance.  
  
 Q. I think it might have been when Remy got the and-one, at some point
you kind of pumped your fist. Is it more of a sense of a relief for you at
this point of the year to advance? Do you celebrate it?  
COACH CHRIS MACK: Sure, these guys celebrate it. We're excited. This is the
best time of the year. This is what you work for the entire off-season. We've
gotten better as the year has gone on, especially on the defensive end. They
shoot 32 percent from the field, 22 percent from the three, they only shoot
five free throws. Our guys have gotten a lot better defensively as the year
has gone on. I've told them that the teams that advance in tournament play are
the ones that can get stops and defend, and I think this team is finally
starting to realize that. Defensively we've been here over the last three or
four weeks as good as we've been all year.  
  
 Q. Dee, you tied a season high with 17 points today and were able to
get some three-pointers off. Did you have good looks today, or did you feel
like they were maybe emphasizing other parts of their scouting report and
giving you options to do that?  
DEE DAVIS: Yeah, I thought I had a couple pretty wide open shots. I was just
being ready to shoot when Matt would pass me the ball, and I just took
advantage of the opportunity.  
  
 Q. Remy and James, Mississippi had a lot of emotion from that victory
and came with a little momentum. Going to get the same thing maybe out of
Georgia State. They're going to come in with a lot of emotion, a lot of
momentum. You guys were very, very businesslike out there. In situations like
this, do you just worry about yourself, worry about what you do, and kind of
put aside what the other team may or may not have done in the previous game?  
REMY ABELL: I mean, Coach does a great job of preparing us for the games, and
we do a good job of locking in and scouting the other team, so we do a great
job of applying that out on the court. But at the end of the day, we worry
about what we need to do, and we feel like if we take care of what we have to
do on the offensive end and defensive end, then everything will take care of
itself.  
  
 Q. James, can you talk about your three-pointer with about 13 minutes
left? I think Matt was out of the game, you're open there beyond the arc. Did
you think that one was going in and did you have any doubts at that point?  
JAMES FARR: No, I didn't have any doubts. I would say I just shot it with
confidence. I haven't shot well from the three-point this year, so I mean, I
just stepped up and shot it with confidence. I've been working on it every day
in practice. I would have regretted it if I didn't take that shot and we
didn't get the outcome that we wanted to get, so I just stepped up and took
it.  
  
 Q. Were you able to watch the end of the Georgia State game as you were
waiting in the tunnel or anything and did you have any impressions of them in
that win?  
DEE DAVIS: Me personally, I didn't see the shot. I mean, I kind of heard the
crowd go crazy. R.J. Hunter is a good friend of mine. I was telling my
teammates through the whole game that he was going to make a shot because he
wasn't shooting well through the game. Me personally, yeah, I mean, I don't
know if anybody else saw the end of the game.  
  
JAMES FARR: I saw it in the locker room. He was pretty far out when he hit it.
I mean, he's known as a shooter, seems like he's a pretty good shooter. We
have more scouting to do on him, but we'll see him this weekend.  
  
 Q. Chris, could you address that thing also where Mississippi had some
emotion and some momentum, same thing with Georgia State? What do you do to
get these kids to concentrate on what they've got to do as opposed to what the
team you're playing might have done?  
COACH CHRIS MACK: Yeah, with all due respect to any opponent we're playing, we
cannot worry nor do we about the mindset of the other team. Whether they're
coming off -- Ole Miss before the BYU game had lost four of the last five, but
it's irrelevant when we tip it off against them. Georgia State's outcome
against Baylor, great game, terrific shot at the end by an NBA prospect in
R.J. Hunter, but at the end of the day, we just have to prepare our guys, and
we will as best we can and take the floor ready to play. I think our guys have
done a great job, like Remy said, of locking in on the details, understanding
the scouting report, being excited to play and playing for one another, and
that's really all we can control.  
  
 Q. Remy, they cut the deficit to ten points down the stretch and then
had the turnover that led to Jalen passing the ball to you for the run-out.
Can you talk about that play and how it changed the complexion for you guys
down the stretch?  
REMY ABELL: Yeah, we got the steal and Jalen did a good job of looking up, and
I just wanted to finish with my teammates, and that was really about it. They
made a run, but we did a great job of staying together. Like Coach said,
they're going to make runs, stay together through the good and the bad. We did
a great job of sticking together as a team, and that's what we have to do.
