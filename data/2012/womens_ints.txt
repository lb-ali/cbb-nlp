# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE WOMEN'S MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 25, 2012

  

### [Gary Patterson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19444)

  
_DALLAS, TEXAS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach your thoughts about the upcoming season?  
COACH PATTERSON: Entering the 2012 Big 12 conference season, I think the
number one thing on my mind is that we have the opportunity to bring to the
floor one of the league's premier guards in Brittany Chambers. I think in the
history of Kansas State, we have not had the pleasure of coaching the young
lady that has a sophomore and junior was the first team all Big 12 in a long
time.  
I'm hopeful that we can put her in position through the course of this
competitive season in this great league to continue to achieve at that level.
I think she's the next level player and certainly will be the showcase of what
we bring to the floor in the 2012‑2013 season.  
  
Q. There's been a lot of conversation all day long today about moving the
tournament, and separating it from the men's tournament and coming to Dallas.
I wondered what your thoughts, first of all, about separating the tournament
from the men's, and also bringing it to a new area?  
COACH PATTERSON: I'm always excited about Big 12 Tournament basketball
regardless of where we're playing. I think Kansas City was a great host city
and we certainly enjoyed our time there. I know we'll feel the same way here
in Dallas.  
I know whatever the Big 12 does as a conference, it is first class all the
way. I think we have a lot of outstanding cities and communities to work with
in our league. And I know Dallas is an extremely exciting city and an
extremely exciting venue for us to have the opportunity to compete in. So I'm
looking forward to that, just as I did each year in Kansas City.  
As it relates to separating the tournament from the men, I might be in the
minority, but I really appreciate the opportunity that we've had to compete
with the men's tournament side by side, strictly because in communities and
fan bases like those at Kansas State, I think it creates an opportunity for
our followers to spend a week somewhere and to watch great basketball from two
teams. So that's always been a positive for us at Kansas State.  
But as always, I'm in support of whatever it is that the Big 12 or women's
basketball may feel like grows our game. So I'm not extremely in favor of
separating the two. But I'm sure whatever it is that we do will bring great
success too.  
  
Q. We've all watched Brittney Griner grow up. Talk about the difference
you've seen in Brittney in her four years. With what Baylor has around her,
coming off a 40 ‑0 season in the National Championship and everybody back, it
seems they're the team to beat, obviously, not only for this league but for
the nation.   
COACH PATTERSON: I think when you talk about Brittney Griner it has been very
easy for people to just assume that she was dominant early and therefore she
is dominant late just because she's Brittney. But it goes without saying that
she has improved each year she's taken the floor. Her shot repertoire has
improved. Her toughness, her physicality, her strength, her decision making,
and I think any time you have someone that is literally a phenomenon, it's
easy to miss the subtleties and the greatness in the developing attributes of
her game.  
Brittney, in my mind, has improved greatly as a player every year she's
competed in this league and each season. I look for her to have something
special and unique that she brings this year too. You can tell she loves the
game. She's hungry, and she works at it.  
Certainly Brittney Griner and the great supporting cast around her and the
great coaching, the great tradition of success that Baylor brings to the floor
in my mind makes them one of the favorites to win a National Championship. I
think we should be extremely proud and extremely motivated by that in this
league, because we have other great coaches and great programs that are just
second to none in this league.  
And it's not easy to win a championship when you come out of the Big 12
conference. If you win a Big 12 Championship, it's not because you played
around one player. It's because you brought a great team to the equation, and
they competed hard and well through the conference and a schedule that is
tougher than I think any you'll find in the country.  
  
Q. I wonder if you could give us your take on adding TCU and West Virginia?
Is it possible the conference got tougher with those two schools coming in?  
COACH PATTERSON: I think the conference did get tougher, honestly. In adding
West Virginia, you've added an athletic, strong, physical basketball team that
knows how to win and is extremely well‑coached. From a league that has
seasoned that program over the years. They have lined up against the likes of
Notre Dame and Connecticut year‑in and year‑out and have competed toe‑to‑toe
with those programs.  
Short of having advanced to a Final Four, I think that has been a program that
all of us that coach look at and go oh, my gosh. That's an Elite Eight, or if
things roll the right way, a potential Final Four caliber team. As we all
know, in the NCAA Tournament, you need a little luck, you need some great
pairings.  
But this is one of America's finest programs, and with TCU, you bring a great
tradition of success. Coach Mittie has done so much over the years in that
program in qualifying that team for the NCAA Tournament, and putting them into
experiences and readying that team that's built, by and large around Texas
student‑athletes. We all understand they're among the best players in the
country coming out of high school.  
So we know we have a formidable addition to our league with both of those
programs, and really haven't necessarily skipped a beat. It's not that in
changing one team in and one team out that I think we've become weaker. I
think we've sustained the great level of excellence that the Big 12 has always
been known for.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE WOMEN'S MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 25, 2012

  

### [Kim Mulkey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13704)

  
_DALLAS, TEXAS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Mulkey.  
  
Q. Sounds like the commissioner has put a little pressure on you guys as far
as being one of the great teams. I wonder if you can just talk about the
challenge of bringing such a loaded nucleus back and trying to go back for one
more championship?  
COACH MULKEY: Well, Bob spoke at our luncheon yesterday at Baylor, and I need
to let you guys know I'm already sold on him, because I was a little
intimidated with his background coming from Stanford and the midwest, but he
said y'all in his speech, so he now has another fan in Kim Mulkey. The
challenge is I think there are only four teams in women's basketball, and you
are certainly welcome to correct me if I'm wrong.  
But from the research that I've done, four teams that have ever repeated and
that being Louisiana Tech, USC, Connecticut, and Tennessee. And we'd like to
possibly have that kind of goal. Going undefeated is not a goal. It wasn't a
goal last year. The goal for our basketball team is to win championships. We'd
like to win another Big 12 Championship, and we'd like to win a National
Championship.  
  
Q. Talk about some of the challenges of motivation with this team. You guys
won which an average of 26 points last year. Is it difficult to keep the
morale up when the wins are that much? How much have you seen from the
girls?  
COACH MULKEY: Well, you have to talk about complacency. You have to talk about
hunger. You have to talk about all of those things. Because I think when you
have a group of seniors who did go 40‑0, you don't want them to become bored
in practice. I think what helps them is the fact that they want to be an elite
group, as I mentioned earlier, of those other four teams that repeated.  
But we also have a group of freshmen that requires a lot of teaching. I think
that our seniors probably are the best teachers on the floor more so than any
of the coaches because they were freshmen at one time.  
So it makes for interesting practices.  
  
Q. You've been in this position before, not with the entire nucleus coming
back, but being the defending national champion. Is there any takeaway that
you have from a coaching standpoint when you have players who have been to the
top in terms of getting them ready for that next season?  
COACH MULKEY: No, because that's like comparing your children. The team we had
coming back after '05 was certainly not the same team. We have the same
players, but we're not the same team today that we hope to be. And I don't
know that we'll be the same team this year that we were last year because I
feel like we have even more depth than we had last year.  
  
Q. You mentioned the freshmen coming in, you have all the starters back.
Knowing that that's kind of the future, do you try to blend them in maybe more
than you normally would with freshmen?  
COACH MULKEY: Yes, we have to rely on our freshmen to play this year. We lose
so much after this year that they're going to have to play. You don't want to
wait until next year to play them. You've got to mix them in in practice. We
have to use our dream team which are our guides a lot so I can look at
combinations.  
We have a couple that are out with stress reactions right now, so I haven't
even had them on the floor yet. Those freshmen have to play for us this year.  
  
Q. You faced West Virginia in the tournament, but what do you expect them to
bring this year in contrast to Baylor or in comparison to Baylor?  
COACH MULKEY: First of all, two great coaches. Their reputations speak for
themselves. We played TCU probably in the playoffs. I don't know. We were in
Seattle together. I remember that the year we won in '05. (No Microphone)
Baylor in the playoffs they're a great addition to our league in women's
basketball. I'm excited because in women's basketball those two programs bring
credibility, and they bring great coaches and great players.  
  
Q. I want to ask you about the team around Brittney, and how we know
Brittney is a dominant player, but how the team around her and everybody plays
together and how that works for you guys.  
COACH MULKEY: Brittney Griner is such a hard worker. When she comes to
practice, I can think of very few days that she's just had bad days.  
When a great player like that comes to the floor every day and plays hard,
it's kind of inexcusable for you to come and not play hard. I think when you
look at Brittney Griner in the face of women's basketball right now, and if
you look around her, there are probably three or four more draft picks. Maybe
even one coming off the bench. So she's surrounded by great players.  
Odyssey Sims in my opinion is the best point guard in the country because she
plays both ends of the floor. But Brittney understands she doesn't win
championships by herself.  
  
Q. Can you talk about last year's performance, all the stuff that went on,
and also coming back from her injury as far as that?  
COACH MULKEY: I don't know all of the stuff that went on, but her injury is
fine. She does her longboards, I think she can tell you better than I can. She
was trying to maneuver a turn or twist or whatever they do, and she saw that
she was not going to make it. She didn't actually fall to the ground. She
jumped off. When she jumped off, she caught herself on the wall and broke a
bone in her wrist or forearm, radius, somewhere in there. But she's fine.  
  
Q. Geno made a couple comments about lowering the rim. What is your opinion
on that?  
COACH MULKEY: I really don't have an opinion on that. We changed the women's
game. We've got a smaller ball than the men. Changed the distance from the
three‑point line. (No Microphone).  
  
Q. The Commissioner talked about you moving the tournament away from Kansas
City where it's been with the men. It's going to be here by itself. How do you
feel about that? How do you feel about marketing the women's game? Is that a
good thing, bad thing, wait and see thing from your standpoint?  
COACH MULKEY: I've always believed that women's basketball, the market for
great attendance, whether we like it or not, is just in certain areas of the
country that are more well attended than others.  
Our tournament, I thought Kansas City did a good job, but our tournament was
not attended as well as the men's tournament was. Maybe in the future if we
get back together and we're at the same time, it will be in a place where both
men's and women's tournament is attended well. Where that would be, maybe it
could be here in Dallas, I don't know. But it sure is convenient for us to be
in Dallas.  
  
Q. There's been a movement as you've referenced to the change in the women's
game, once again there has been an emphasis to monitor the game as far as ‑‑ I
guess what they want to do is speed the game up a lot faster than what it is
right now even though you all do have a shot clock. The reason I'm asking is
there was a notice given out ask sent out by a press release by the NCAA that
they wanted the officials in the women's game to start monitoring back court
and front court shot clocks.   
COACH MULKEY: We're always changing something. I'm of the belief sometimes
that if it's not broken, don't fix it. I like our game. I think it's at a pace
where I don't know what you need to change. But I'm good for whatever is good
in women's basketball. Right now I don't have an opinion on lowering the
goals. I don't have an opinion on the back court. Just tell me what the rules
are and let's go play.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE WOMEN'S MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 25, 2012

  

### [Jeff Mittie](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13840)

  
_DALLAS, TEXAS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Welcome Coach Mittie.  
COACH MITTIE: Thanks. Good to be in a league. We're excited about it. This
league is a tremendous women's basketball league, and that is exciting for us
at TCU. It's exciting for my program having been there and been through‑‑
well, this isn't as they say in Texas, my first rodeo to a league change. But
obviously, the Big 12 is a very exciting league to be in, and we're excited to
get going into the non‑conference part of that.  
  
Q. Jeff, like you mentioned, this isn't your first rodeo. What do you feel
like the familiarity that you guys have had as far as making conference
changes will help you in this one?  
COACH MITTIE: Well, one thing, we've obviously played a lot of the Big 12
schools over the years. I think you've got to go through it. Any time it's a
round robin format, which I think is the best way to play basketball. It's a
grueling grind though, 18 games with the basketball season, and particularly
the talent from top to bottom in the league.  
But we have some familiarity with the schools. We've played them over the
years, and hopefully we'll benefit from that knowledge.  
  
Q. Obviously, you've had a lot of success at TCU. With that and the moving
up in the league, talk about how you've been accepted now more with recruiting
and how the perception made the change and this program just making this
move?  
COACH MITTIE: Accepted by the coaches recruiting?  
  
Q. Players recruiting, yeah.  
COACH MITTIE: Yeah, well you know this. You've been around our campus, and
obviously players want to play in the best leagues in the country. When you
look at what the Big 12 has been able to do across the board with winning
National Championships, being in Final Fours, multiple teams doing those
things. Then you look at the attendance and the interest that this league
draws, and to be sitting in a venue here that's going to host our tournament,
recruits want to play in those environments.  
It's been nice. People are taking my calls more. I always enjoy that. But
you've got to get the signature at the end of the day, but, yeah, I'm getting
a few more answers on the telephone.  
  
Q. Do you guys feel like you need more depth to play in a league like the
Big 12? Do you feel you have that depth?  
COACH MITTIE: We'll have to develop that depth. The league is very physical.
The front line across the league has gotten huge. Any time the question got
asked earlier about the league thing, different leagues have different things.
With Griner being in the league, the rest of the league got bigger over the
last four years as well.  
So it wasn't just Baylor that got bigger. But we'll have to develop that depth
this year. 9 of our 13 are freshmen and sophomores. So every day is a new
challenge for them right now, learning to play at a level that's higher. But
we'll know a little bit more as we get further into this season how much depth
I'm going to be able to develop with this particular team.  
  
Q. You guys are going to have the tournament played in Dallas this year.
What's it mean for you guys? I guess you'll have the closest thing to the home
court advantage in something like that.  
COACH MITTIE: Well, I love the fact that it's in the Metroplex for a lot of
reasons. Texas is great for women's basketball. The state of Texas, the
Metroplex, all of the young girls that play are going to be able to watch top
basketball here. It helps us recruiting. It helps our fans get to see all of
the teams again. We've got some obvious work to do, but it's great to have the
tournament here in Dallas.  
  
Q. Interested in what your reaction was to Geno Auriemma possibly lowering
the rims and doing other things to maybe promote more scoring and such?  
COACH MITTIE: I actually like the idea. I tell you why. We need to make some
bold choices in women's basketball, and I think we need to do bold things.
That is outside‑the‑box thinking, and I think that those type of discussions
need to be had, because it is a different game than the men's game.  
I think Geno pointed out some things for volleyball nets and all those things
were different. The obvious things are you would have more plays around the
rim. You'd have more players across the country being able to dunk it and dunk
it in a variety of ways.  
I think it's a worthy discussion, but I think there is some merit to it.  
  
Q. Along the same lines of having the conference championship here, just the
travel is a lot closer in the Big 12 than it was in the Mountain West. What
kind of advantage does it give you being able to take bus trips instead of
plane trips?  
COACH MITTIE: I don't have to get frisked in TSA. I mean, the advantage
geographically‑‑ well, time zone. I can wake up and not have to change my
watch every two trips. But those advantages don't last very long when you get
into the competition here.  
It's an advantage for your fans. It's an advantage for a lot of the families
we recruit to be able to see their young ladies play not just at home games.
Those type of things are advantages.  
I'm creeping up there. The bus hurts me as bad as the planes do anymore. I
guess I can stand and stretch without the stewardess yelling at me on the bus.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE WOMEN'S MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 25, 2012

  

### [Jim Littell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23326)

  
_DALLAS, TEXAS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined with coach Jim Littell. Your opening thoughts?  
COACH LITTELL: The Cowgirls are very excited to start the new season. We feel
like we ended the season last year on a very positive note by winning nine out
of the last ten games and winning six games at home in the WNIT.  
We returned five starters and feel like we have a lot of pieces to the puzzle
that are going to allow us to take a step and be more competitive in the Big
12.  
  
Q. You've tried to elaborate a little bit on it, but winning the six games
in the WNIT like you did, and having the cast of characters back for this
season, what do you think that's going to do in order to catapult yourself
into maybe contention this year in the Big 12?  
COACH LITTELL: I think playing in the WNIT, we've seen past experiences. Coach
Patterson had her group in at K‑State one year, and they won the WNIT, and
they came back and won the conference the next year.  
I'm not going to say that we're going to do that, but I think success breeds
success. Any time you have an opportunity I think it's going to be beneficial
to you. I equate it to Bowl games for football teams where they have that
extra month of practice.  
We were able to practice another month, let our young players gain some
experience. We really feel that it's going to help build our fan base as well.
We saw our young team grow in confidence by leaps and bounds.  
  
Q. You have some people inside, Lindsey and Kendra. Talk about having two
post players this year?  
COACH LITTELL: We feel like we have four. Toni Young is coming off a season
where she ended up being the MVP of the WNIT Tournament, And Lindsey Keller
brings dimension to our team where she's very physical and strong.  
Last year Gary Blair from Texas A&M called her the linebacker of the league.
So we feel very good that she's returning. Kendra Suttles will be coming back
for her junior year, and then we've got a 6'3" young lady inside named LaShawn
Jones that we feel has gotten a lot better in the off‑season. So with those
four people in place, we're really excited about our postgame.  
  
Q. With the addition of TCU and the addition of West Virginia, two quality
programs here to a conference that already was really, really tough top to
bottom, what's that mean for the Big 12?  
COACH LITTELL: It just got stronger. I think with West Virginia, you're
bringing a team in that is very similar in style of play to Texas A&M, and we
know what Texas A&M has been to this conference for a long time. It's a very
physical team that is going to bring a style of play to the conference much
like Texas A&M did. TCU, Coach Mittie has done a phenomenal job down there. I
believe they've been in the NCAA Tournament nine or ten times in the last 12
years, and just having the experience of coaching and knowing what to do and
getting a team in the tournament, it just continues to get better each year. I
don't have any doubts it will continue to be the number one RPI conference in
America.  
  
Q. Last year was your first in the Big 12. I wonder what your thoughts were
after you finished up and what you feel that will do as you go around for your
second year this year?  
COACH LITTELL: It was a learning process for me as well. I think I gained some
valuable experience in the journey through last year. I know a lot more what
to expect about the coaches. But I've been in the league for seven years prior
to that. So I feel very comfortable coaching at this level and look forward to
it and really enjoyed playing in the Big 12 each night because it's a
challenge every night.  
  
Q. The commissioner stood up here and thought that Baylor had the
opportunity to be one of the great teams in this sport if they continue their
development. I just wonder if you could talk about the job that's gone on
there and Brittney Griner and what she's been able to do during the course of
her career there?  
COACH LITTELL: You talk about great talent and teams that you've got to know
how to coach and handle players like Brittney Griner and how to develop them
you have a Phil Jackson that has to handle Kobe and those kind of players.  
In my opinion, Brittney is the greatest player the women's game has ever seen.
Until somebody comes on, I'm not going to change that opinion. But Coach
Patterson was up here talking a few minutes ago about how she continues to get
better each year which is a scary thought for the rest of us in the
conference. She's added a lot of dimension to her game. She's able to step
outside now. She's a great free‑throw shooter. She's become more physical. I
think the biggest way that she's changed the game is the lane disappears when
she's in the game. You just don't get anything free at the rim. The
opportunity for easy baskets goes away. And it's going to take somebody to
have the ability to shoot 60‑plus percent from the perimeter to up end them.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE WOMEN'S MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 25, 2012

  

### [Bonnie Henrickson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13895)

  
_DALLAS, TEXAS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, your opening thoughts?  
COACH HENRICKSON: Great to be here. Good to see everyone. It's that time of
year for all of us. It's hard to believe it's here, but I'm excited it's here.
We have an opportunity for an exhibition game on Sunday, and we'll be as game
ready as we can be here in the next couple of days.  
But I'm really excited about the group we have. Returning Carolyn Davis from
the ACL injury in the middle of February. An opportunity to coach a special
point guard like Angel Goodrich for another year into her fifth year, her
senior year.  
Monica Engelman is back to the old Monica, struggled a little bit her junior
year, and has really bounced back, back to sophomore form, which was really
important for us. I think at that point she led the league in field goal
percentage and had a really, really good sophomore campaign, and back to her
old self. That will be important for us with Sutherland able to pick up some
of the offensive numbers that Aishah was able to put up for us as a power
forward last year and a senior.  
Now we have a sophomore class that is bound to experience as freshmen. When
Carolyn went down, Chelsea Gardner who is from DeSoto High School here, and
Bunny Williams from Duncanville High School here. Both of those two posts came
in and played critical minutes, and critical in that run for us in the NCAA
Tournament.  
Natalie Knight who is so consistent for us as a freshman from Kansas City,
arguably the best freshman campaign of any kid I've had from a consistency
standpoint, reliability standpoint.  
And Asia Boyd being with Bunny Williams, probably two of our most improved
players in the season last year. Both of those two kids, Asia's from Detroit,
Michigan, and both of those two much improved. To have an opportunity to get
on the floor and stay on the floor for us early.  
  
Q. When Carolyn went down last year, it seemed like the rest of your team
circled the wagon as they made the run toward the tournament and won in the
NCAA. Just talk about what that experience did getting her back to that
nucleus that did so well down the stretch?  
COACH HENRICKSON: I think with the sheer number of players‑‑ Angel to me did
the lion's share of the work and grabbed Aishah Sutherland and said, you and I
need to play at another level and hope these young kids will try to catch us.
But that freshman class from last year that are sophomores now, invaluable for
them from a confidence standpoint, from an understanding expectations
standpoint, and a want‑to to get back to that and play at that level and play
more consistently at that level throughout the year.  
I can tell we're more competitive in practice. They demand more from
themselves and each other. And that started, quite honestly, when the
tournament was over. Within 24 hours, we had a bunch of those guys back in the
gym. There hadn't been much dust that had settled, and that work has continued
until we started.  
  
Q. I know you have a little history with West Virginia from your days at
Tech. I'm just curious about your thoughts. You've coached against Mike before
and them coming into the conference?  
COACH HENRICKSON: Of course I was giving him a hard time. The first time I
watched him on film his first year, and my staff said would you stop watching
him? And I said he's kind of animated. He's fun to watch. He promised me he's
toned down a little bit.  
But I've been on the West Virginia Turnpike up to Morgantown a few teams being
from Blacksburg. But when you look at his team and I've watched them in the
NCAA Tournament and Big East games, long, athletic and physical. A lot like
for us in the league who Texas A&M was at half court. Probably big and long,
really, 1 through 5 as we have in the conference. Played at a high level and
played in a great league. Talking to him and being able to compare some of the
teams in our league to some of the teams he had in the Big East was fair for
his mindset and for his kids to get them ready for it. Mike does a great job,
and they've done nothing but win under his leadership.  
I'm here to tell everybody they shoot the gun too. I've tried to warn our
volleyball team. They do. They got me the first time.  
  
Q. Your team was one of five other teams in the Big 12 that won at least 20
games last year. That's only half as much as Baylor. When you look at what
Baylor has returning, is it fair to say it's almost a race for second place
this year?  
COACH HENRICKSON: The good thing about the Big 12, the last I checked, they're
going to let us play them. They're going to let us play. So I don't think it's
a give and give and give. The likelihood of what they have returning and how
good they are, certainly I'm joking with you there.  
But I think all of us will make the most of our opportunity to step on the
floor and tip it up and play against arguably the best team in America.
There's no doubt about that. But there are a handful of us that it will be a
dog fight to finish either right around them in second, third or fourth.  
But that's the quality of competition like it has been in every year I've been
in this league, certainly night‑in, night‑out. There are just no days off. Our
kids understand that and all the players in this league understand that.  
  
Q. You talk about West Virginia, what do you think TCU brings to the
league?  
COACH HENRICKSON: I think we had an opportunity. We saw them a few years ago
in the Bahamas, and the personnel has changed, but Jeff has done a great job
offensively. He's creative. I've got great respect for what he does. He
doesn't have to be the same thing every year. He tweaks it enough to who he
has in his program, and to give them a chance to be successful.  
He's got a couple of transfers. A couple from our league, honestly, that will
help them get better. He's got size and length and athleticism. I think trying
to space the floor, spread it, shoot the three. Defensively they've always
been a team that doesn't beat themselves. They stay in games, and don't make
mistakes offensively.  
Having had the opportunity a few years ago in the Bahamas, but having been
able to watch him from afar and being in this area has paid attention to them.
But he does a great job. Being in the league will really help them.  
  
Q. You talked about Carolyn's injury and what she went through. Obviously
ACL can be a little problematic. She's such an athletic player as well. I was
curious what have you seen from her so far, how is the rehab coming along, and
what do you expect from her this season?  
COACH HENRICKSON: She's not a hundred percent right now. If she was up here,
she'd tell you the same thing. She's maybe on the North side of 80, in the
middle of 80. When she got into the workouts in August with us where she's
cleared to get on the floor and go through drills. I just smiled and shook my
head at her. Nothing's wrong. You just make it look so easy, and she makes
every shot she takes and still does that. And she's in practice. We scrimmaged
yesterday. She played 15 minutes strong. She's not as explosive and all of
that coming back. She's not in game shape, but that will come. That will be
part of her process for her.  
But she's confident. She's excited. Her teammates couldn't be more excited.
When she scored, the place went nuts. So it was good to see her back again.  
But when you think about what Carolyn does really well, she rim runs as well
as anybody in the country. There is nothing about her injury that will change
either one of those two things. Once she gets in shape. She's not running like
she will yet because she's not in game shape, but she catches everything they
throw at her. She finishes around the rim and makes it look simple.  
  
Q. You beat Delaware with this great player. How do you take that momentum
into this season being a player that was heralded so much?  
COACH HENRICKSON: Right. A guy that plays in here in Dirk Nowitzki, is a
little bit what she's like and a chance to be on the floor with her. I think
from a confidence standpoint and an expectation of the level our kids want to
play in night‑in and night‑out, and you have to play at that level in this
league. But keep in mind how much the Big 12 Conference and the
competitiveness in our league helped us make that run. Because we could turn
every team we played ‑‑ we turned Nebraska into certain teams in our league.
We turned Delaware into certain teams in our league. We turned Tennessee into
certain teams in our league. That our players had tremendous confidence right
away. Being able to get on the floor and say we're in a little mini Big 12
Tournament right here in terms of the competition.  
As I said earlier, Angel did the lion's share of that work. She made plays and
got people in contested shots and made great decisions. But she got those
young players to play at another level, and that's what she continues to do
today. But from a confidence standpoint, I think that is the most important
thing we're able to take with us from last spring.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE WOMEN'S MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 25, 2012

  

### [Bill Fennelly](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13850)

  
_DALLAS, TEXAS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, welcome. Glad to have you here. Your thoughts?  
COACH FENNELLY: First of all, I certainly want to thank everyone for coming.
To be a part of this league is sincerely something special for our university.
The coverage you all gave us, we appreciate very much.  
Like everyone else, we understand we're part of the best league in the
country. The way we do things administratively on down, our fan base, the
success of our teams. We're excited to get the season started and certainly
hope that we can be a part of another great year in the Big 12.  
  
Q. You've seen her for a long time. I wonder how glad you'll be to see
Brittney Griner finally leave school?  
COACH FENNELLY: Very glad, obviously. I've already got the graduation card
printed up and ready to send her. It's been something that has been‑‑ I've
been doing this a long time. No disrespect to other players before, but I've
never seen anyone impact a game like that. Everything we've tried to do,
everything that we've tried to figure out to do something against her hasn't
worked. We're not the only ones, I guess. But I think the other thing though
is she's gone from a tall athlete to a tall athletic, tremendous basketball
player. She works hard. She's been very well‑coached, and obviously is someone
that's impacted our game dramatically, impacted our league. But everyone in
Ames is excited they get to see her one more time. I'll be glad when that one
more time is over, to be honest with you.  
  
Q. You've traditionally had really strong support in Kansas City for the Big
12 Tournament and your fans. Do you have any mixed emotions seeing the
tournament separate for the men and come down here to Dallas?  
COACH FENNELLY: Nothing personal against Dallas. I was always probably the one
that never wanted to separate them. And I know that's probably not the
politically correct statement. Our fans loved it. I think the Iowa State fan
base is unique in the sense that they support both teams. They love going to
both events. I had no idea what had happened with how many fans will travel
down here.  
Obviously, it's a great city, a great venue. But personally speaking, I liked
it the way it was. But just like at home with my wife I don't get my choice on
some things.  
I'm sure it will be a great event. We want to be a part of it, and hopefully
we'll get to stay a few days and enjoy all the great things that Dallas has to
offer.  
  
Q. I know you played West Virginia a couple years ago in the tournament.
What are your thoughts on Mike and his program and what they bring?  
COACH FENNELLY: Yeah, we played West Virginia in the Virgin Islands. Actually,
we played TCU and West Virginia in the same tournament which is a little
ironic. My teams are maybe, what I told our players and our fans back home is
they're kind of half court versions of them. Physical, defensive minded, we
kind of grind it out and make every possession hard. I know they had an injury
that's unfortunate for them as they entered the league.  
When you go beat Notre Dame at Notre Dame, and they beat Texas in the NCAA
Tournament. It's an outstanding team, and one that I think has had a long run
of success. I don't see why that will change when they come to our league.  
I think the travel will be unique for them and for us. But it's a great team.
A physical team. A team that defends the right way, and a team that's going to
be very, very well‑coached.  
  
Q. Curious to know what your thoughts are on Geno's comment about lowering
the rim?  
COACH FENNELLY: That's way above my pay grade. When you're Geno and you've got
one name, you can kind of do and say what you want to say. I haven't thought
much about it. I think that there are things that our game can do better, and
I think Geno, in my talking to him, it's always about we missed too many
lay‑ups, and we need to be better at that.  
I don't personally think it's going to change how people are interested in the
women's game. I think there are practical applications to how would you do it?
Do you change high school gyms that have baskets attached to the walls and
things like that? I haven't had the time to study it like he has.  
The thing about Geno is he's always thinking outside the box. Sometimes in our
sport you have to do that kind of thing. But when we're not as good as them,
so I'm more worried about not turning the ball over than I am with how tall
the baskets are.  
  
Q. You're rebuilding your back court with two new starters. Talk about the
challenge of trying to grow up in that area?  
COACH FENNELLY: I think the biggest thing for our team, and I said it media
day at our place, if our guards can just know what color jersey to throw it
to, defend a little bit, they can play with Chelsea and Anna and Hallie
Christofferson.  
We have some inside kids that are experienced. But it's one thing to have
really good players. But when you have good players that are post players,
someone's got to give them the ball.  
Nikki made the all-freshman team, and what I told Nikki Moody, if the
highlight of your career is to make the all-freshman team, you didn't do your
job, and I didn't do my job. We'll have two freshmen guards that will play
some, from Houston, and then Brynn Williamson who played as a sophomore has
had a really good start at practice.  
So we've played Hallie at the three and the four, and we've tried to mix it up
a little bit. But you'll see a lot of times where we'll have a sophomore and
two freshmen in the back court, and that's not an easy remedy for success in
this league, but that's part of who we are, and whether you're a freshman or
not, you've got to do the things to be successful.  
They're talented enough. They're working hard at it. But they'll be shocked
when they have to go out there against Odyssey, and Whitney Hand, and Angel
Goodriches of the world, and Tiffany Bias, they'll learn quickly, so we'll
learn with them.  
  
Q. Anna's had a really nice career and some big games during that time. But
is she ready to take the next step towards becoming a game ‑in, and game force
for you?   
COACH FENNELLY: I think with Anna, it's about staying healthy. That sounds
really simplistic. She's missed over 150 days of workouts, practices in her
time. Like you said, she's had some games where she's changed games. I mean,
Brittney's freshman year at our place, the reason we beat Baylor was Anna made
five three‑point shots.  
When you have a 6'7" kid that can shoot the three, and offensively skilled,
that changes your team. But when she can't practice, and she's a kid that when
she doesn't practice, it really sets her back. Some kids can miss a day and
come right back at it, that's not Anna.  
So you hope as a senior, she can do the things that we know she can do. And if
she does, that gives us the flexibility and gives us another offensive punt,
gives us some length. She's not a shot blocker by any means like Brittney.
Well, no one is, but Anna's not a shot blocker. But still you have some
length. You can rebound the ball. But for us, her number's got to go up
offensively for us to have a chance to be a solid team.  
  
Q. West Virginia's coach talked about the great crowds that the Big 12 has.
Of course we talked about this before, about Iowa State and its great crowds.
Can you talk about how you continue to year after year keep that level of fan
craziness up to come to games wherever you are?  
COACH FENNELLY: We have a very loyal fan base. They're emotionally attached to
our team. I think we're a small Mid-Western part of the world. We don't have
professional sports, so they're really attracted to what we do.  
Basketball has been huge at our school. It's been built over time. I think
being in this league has allowed it to grow. Certainly a level of success has
helped. The first game we coached, we have 310 people, I have the box score
framed in my office.  
We try to remember every day how hard it is. It's about everyone. It's a
collaborative effort between what we, do our players, all of you folks, you
know, people want to read and see what you say about us, and anything we can
do‑‑ I tell people, marketing and recruiting is like breathing. You do it all
the time or you die. We've tried to do that with our fan base.  
Our administration has been ultra, ultra supportive of what we've tried to do
and be creative in that mindset. So it's become a fun place to go. Hilton
Magic started with men's basketball has hopefully trickled down to our side of
the locker room as well.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE WOMEN'S MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 25, 2012

  

### [Kristy Curry](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14069)

  
_DALLAS, TEXAS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by coach Kristy Curry. Your opening thoughts?  
COACH CURRY: Thank you. Really looking forward to the year. I've had the
comparison of an NIT, and an NCAA, and know what it takes and know the
difference. Between Monique Smalls and Chynna Brown and Christine Hyde and
Casey Morris, tremendous people, tremendous leaders. We've talked about our
season with those kids leading the way, really like a couple of our newcomers.  
Really pleased with a couple of our players coming back, Kelsi Baker, looked
like the player that we recruited in the preseason, Jackie Patterson, a
newcomer, Minta Spears. We're just thrilled about this group of kids and the
commitment they've made in the off‑season to be better and to take that next
step.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about what it's going to take from your guard
play to get back to the NCAA Tournament?  
COACH CURRY: When you look at our team a year ago, obviously a lot of little
things. I think you look at the point differential, and it was 3.7 in
conference play for our team. So everything starts up top. We have to play
every single possession, and take pride in each possession. It might be a
missed free throw here or there. Obviously, that's an area of improvement.
Shot selection, our field goal percentage has to get better.  
So a lot of things, especially on the perimeter, decision‑making that we can
control. 3.7 is pretty slim, so a possession here or there is really going to
make a difference.  
  
Q. If you can imagine, a lot of talk about Baylor coming here as defending
national champions. But you guys played them as hard as anybody did the last
year. Two games right down to the wire under ten points. What is the secret to
staying with Baylor and possibly beating Baylor this year, do you think?  
COACH CURRY: Yeah, I'm not sure there is a secret. If there was, I certainly
would like to know it. But I think the thing is just obviously Brittney just
changes the way you defend, she changes the opposite end for you, and you have
to make adjustments. You just about have to play near perfect from that.
Obviously, this year when you look at their team and their roster, it seems
they have more depth than they've ever had, so that's a scary thing.  
They bring great things for this league, and how much love and respective for
Kim, and having worked with her. I'm always pulling for her except when we
play them.  
  
Q. The tournament has always been linked with the men's tournament over the
course of the history of the league. You guys have been breaking off and
you're going to be down in the Dallas area. What do you think this could do to
the growth of women's basketball by having to come down and play here?  
COACH CURRY: Yeah, I think it's tremendous. The state of Texas can embrace it.
Tremendous high school basketball in the state. Was in school a week ago, and
the coach was excited about having the opportunity to get her team here. I
think it's going to be great. Having played in the Big Ten, and saw that the
men's and women's tournaments can both be successful and stand on their own
was a great experience and a great comparison for us as a league that we can
do the same.  
The way you look at this part of the country and how they support women's
basketball at Baylor and Texas and Texas Tech and Oklahoma and TCU coming into
the league, I think it's going to be great for women's basketball in the state
of Texas, and especially in the Metroplex. I think a lot of folks will get
behind it and support it.  
  
Q. I know your goal like always has been to win a National Championship.
It's been 20 years, I guess this is the 20th anniversary of the season that
the Red Raiders have had. Is there anything special about that? Is there
anything about that season that you look at them and go, hey, we were there
once, we can get back there or anything like that?  
COACH CURRY: No question. I think that when you look across our league and
Texas having done that, and Texas Tech having done that, and Texas A&M, and in
the state of Texas and Baylor, it's phenomenal to look across the state and
the fact that we've won that many National Championships in the state. The
simple fact that Texas Tech did that 20 years ago, we are so excited for
February 17th when we host Texas. The entire team will be back. It's $93
season tickets. Sheryl Swoopes came in about a month ago and spoke to our
team. We're thrilled to have her back in town, and a part of what we're doing
and trying to get her back with our program some.  
So our players take a tremendous amount of pride. Actually, that day we were
going to wear throwback uniforms that represent that team. So we're thrilled
about representing Texas Tech and continuing to work toward that goal of doing
that again.  
  
Q. I saw that Jackie was named Big 12 in the voting there. Can you talk
about her? Obviously playing high level junior competition up in Kansas. But
how do you see her fitting in with your team?  
COACH CURRY: I think we expect her to make a major impact, And she expects
that. She's a tremendous young lady. The thing that I've been most impressed
with is how coachable she is. She just wants to get better every day. She's
left‑handed. She's hard to defend. She can jump out of the gym, and she's got
to learn to play every single possession. When she gets the pace down, she can
be special.  
So we're thrilled about the impact she's going to make. She's very versatile,
been working hard to stepping out and hitting the three. She's going to bring
a lot to our team, and really to avoid losing Kierra Mallard and Jordan
Barncastle. Hopefully we won't miss a beat. We'll be better.  
  
Q. Your reaction was priceless there. I have to hear what you're thinking
about Geno's suggestion about the rim?  
COACH CURRY: I really don't have that much of an opinion on it. I think I
focus so much every day on how I can put the people around me in a position to
be successful. So I try not to focus on all that other stuff that can take
your time. So it's an honest answer.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE WOMEN'S MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 25, 2012

  

### [Sherri Coale](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13897)

  
_DALLAS, TEXAS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Coale, welcome, and your opening thoughts?  
COACH COALE: Thank you so much. Great to be back. Great to be in Dallas. Very
excited about Dallas being the host city for the conference championship
tournament this year. Looking forward to a unique year in the Big 12,
welcoming two new members who I think will add a different twist and a special
flavor to the competition this season. I really like my team, and I can't wait
to get started.  
  
Q. Based on the coach's vote and what we saw in the national tournament last
year, Baylor is the big favorite. But you've had teams in the past that were
preseason big favorites going into conference play. As you look at it, is
Baylor vulnerable? Is there a way to take them down? You have everybody coming
back on your team, for example.  
COACH COALE: I think obviously they're the favorites. Obviously, Griner makes
them special and unique. They come off an undefeated season last year, and
certainly they're the team to beat in our league. But they're human. We all
put on our jerseys every game, and we play the game. If we had to play five
out of seven, it might not go our way.  
But you have to be better for 40 minutes one night, so, yeah, yeah, it's
possible.  
  
Q. You talk about TCU coming into the league. A couple years ago Gary Blair
said that TCU was the best team in Texas, not in the Big 12. Now they're in
the Big 12. Do you have any specific thoughts on what TCU and West Virginia
will bring to the Big 12?  
COACH COALE: Yeah, I think it's awesome that you can pull out one thing that
Gary Blair said because he says so many things. I don't know how you separated
it all. We miss him, don't we? Less lively today with Gary being in the SEC.  
We've had a nice rivalry with TCU, just because we've tried to play home at
home with them in our preconference schedule, because we love playing in the
Dallas‑Fort Worth area. Jeff does a tremendous job with his kids, and they
always find a way to find themselves in the NCAA Tournament at the end of the
year.  
West Virginia, Mike Carey does an incredible job with them, very tough Big
East conference, and have a great reputation as a very tenacious basketball
team. They have talented kids, and that will be a tough place to play. I just
think there will be a different flavor and different twist to league play this
year.  
  
Q. You talk about different twists. One of the things this year is the
tournament being separated from the men. How much do you like the idea that
the women will get the highlight and get their own separate venue?  
COACH COALE: Well, I think it's a positive move. I think if you factor in all
the things our league has done for the past 16 seasons, we've led in RPI, we
lead in attendance. 9 out of 10 teams last year in the NCAA Tournament, and
the other one in the NIT tournament.  
You just think about where we stand on the global landscape of women's
basketball, and we can stand on our own. I think it will be a period of growth
as the media and the public gets accustomed to having those two tournaments
separated.  
But at the end of the day, I think it makes a lot of sense. I think we'll be
able to build some equity in what we do as a group and a specific brand being
the women's basketball portion of the Big 12 conference.  
  
Q. Coach, were there any facets in the off ‑season that you guys identified
as maybe we have to get better here?   
COACH COALE: Yeah, there were about 20. I'm not sure you have time for me to
list them all. We were young last year. Sometimes the best thing that can
happen to youth is it just gets a little bit older, and that will solve a lot
of your problems.  
I think we'll take better care of the basketball. I think we'll have a
stronger inside game. I think our interior guys have probably improved the
most, and maybe it's because they have the furthest to go. It's hard to see
great leaps of improvement in a kid like Whitney Hand or a kid like Aaryn
Ellenberg, but those guys have gotten better as well. I think the big jumps
most quickly perceived by the public will be production from the inside, and
just our sense of sureness with the basketball because we're older, more
confident, more experienced, more relaxed, all those things that happened when
you play aid few games in Division 1.  
  
Q. You've got all your perimeter players back, led by Whitney. Talk about
the confidence that gives you by having three scorers that come back with a
chance to play again?  
COACH COALE: Yeah, I'd put my guards against anybody in America. I really
would. They're talented, they're earnest, and they're conscientious. I think
our groups always have strong chemistry, and this group has an extraordinary
vibe about them. They understand one anothers strengths and weaknesses and
how to play off of those. Any time you have a kid with the intestinal
fortitude of Whitney saying, "I'm coming back as a fifth‑year senior and
leading the team," you have to feel pretty good about things.  
  
Q. What do you think of Geno's suggestion that the rim should be lowered?  
COACH COALE: Oh, my heavens. I really do think his team must be so good that
he didn't have anything to rant about, so he just started talking about
lowering the stinkin' rim. Here's what I think about it. I think a basketball
goal is a basketball goal is a basketball goal. One of the unique and fabulous
things about our sport is you just need a ball and a goal and nobody else, and
you can get better. You can walk out to any neighborhood park and take that
ball and shoot on that goal and get better. You can go to the rec center, and
can you go to an elementary gym, a high school gym, you can go to an arena
like American Airlines and the goals are ten‑foot‑tall, and you can shoot on
them and get better.  
I don't think we want to put ourselves in a situation where we have to find a
women's goal so we can get better as players.  
  
Q. You touched on Whitney Hand and what she's done. Obviously, it's been a
long Odyssey for Whitney since coming there. She's had to overcome a lot of
things. Can you just expand on what you've seen from Whitney, and what it's
been like five years with her?  
COACH COALE: It's been a blessing to be able to coach her for five years now,
as you say. She came in as such a high‑achieving freshman that I think
sometimes it's difficult to see maybe from an outside perspective how much
she's grown.  
But from inside, which is the view I get all the time, her growth and
maturation has been remarkable. It is her attention, her diligence, if you
will. I think that's a word we don't count as a virtue quite as often as we
ought to, but that diligence to daily get better at everything. Whether it's
going left, or a defensive dig step, or a blockout, or leading her team, or
holding people accountable, whatever it is. She just has and continues to have
an intense diligence about her, and I think that makes her special. I think it
separates her in ways that words are difficult to describe.  
  
Q. Following up on that, is she any different since she's married that
quarterback up there?  
COACH COALE: Yes, she's changed so much. No, fantastic as always.  
  
Q. Most people thought this conference was the toughest in basketball last
year. With the addition of TCU and West Virginia added to it, will this make
it even more of a gauntlet?  
COACH COALE: You might have rivaled him right there with gauntlet. There is a
race. I think it's just a different kind of race, if that's possible. There is
a nuisance there because we're very unfamiliar with West Virginia
particularly.  
But as I've said before, West Virginia will play a style of basketball that is
a little like A&M, so it's not going to be that much of a culture shock for
anyone. Though going there to play in Morgantown might be.  
But I just think again, we're going to be sitting here next year talking about
9 out of 10 teams were in the NCAA Tournament. That is the story for this
league. Every night, you better show up.

## October 25, 2012

  

### [Mike Carey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20552)

  
_DALLAS, TEXAS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, your opening thoughts about the season?  
COACH CAREY: First of all, this is going to be a learning year for us, for
myself and our coaching staff, plus our players. I know we're coming into a
great conference. We know it's the highest RPI conference. We understand they
won the national championship the last two years. We understand that 70% of
the team's in the conference went postseason. Those things we do understand.
But it's still going to be a learning year for us.  
I'm always asked, "What do you think about going to the Big 12?" And I always
tell them let me tell you this time next year what I think about going to it.
It's just going to be a learning process between the travel and the teams
you're playing, the new arenas and those types of things. But we're very
excited. We're very excited about being in the Big 12. I know our players are,
and it will be a new challenge for our program.  
  
Q. You got a sense of what it's like at Baylor a couple years ago. But you
were supposed to get an easier conference. You leave the Big East with UCONN
and Notre Dame, and now you're in this one. Is there any comparison between
the two? What is your experience like at Baylor?  
COACH CAREY: I'm really trying to forget the experience, to be honest with you
at Baylor. Great team, great atmosphere. That is the other thing. To me, when
I compare, you play everybody twice, home and away. I think that's unlike what
we did in the Big East. The crowds in that part of the country and crowd
attendance, that's going to be big. You all play in the same arenas like the
men and women play in the same arenas, so that's going to be different for us.
Where in the Big East, sometimes we played on arenas on campus. Sometimes the
crowds were not that big. When you got to Connecticut, Notre Dame, Louisville,
and those teams, but not all the teams. Where in the Big 12, we're going to
face that night‑in, and night‑out on the road.  
But we understand that. You're exactly right. We get away from Connecticut,
and now we're going to play Baylor and Oklahoma, and Texas, and all of these
schools. It's just a great league. From top to bottom, like I said earlier,
it's the number one RPI league in the country.  
  
Q. You're familiar with the tournament being split between men and women. I
guess in the Big East it was played in Connecticut, correct?  
COACH CAREY: Yeah.  
  
Q. Just talk about your thoughts about what that did for the women's game by
having it separate? This is the first time it's going to be done down here
where men and women are apart.  
COACH CAREY: Well, I thought it was great. I really did. We played at
Hartford, and Connecticut plays half their games at Hartford but it was a
great crowd because of Connecticut. But I thought the crowds were great in
postseason at the tournament play. Mostly because of Connecticut fans.  
But, yeah, it was a great atmosphere. It was a great tournament, and I
understand it's going to be a great tournament. It's just there are a lot of
surprises always at tournament play, and I expect this will be the thing.  
I don't think anybody plays half their games here on this court, so I think,
yeah, it will be a little more neutral.  
  
Q. How have the players responded in practice the last few weeks, especially
after Asya went down, more of Yaya this year. How's all of that coming
together this year in the season?  
COACH CAREY: It's never a good time to have a player go down. Asya Bussie was
our leading shot blocker, second leading rebounder, gave us size. But she went
down in the second day of practice, and it's never good for that to happen.
But at least it happened early, and the players have been able to respond and
learn new roles. Where a lot of times we counted on Asya to do a lot of things
and now somebody else has to pick that up. Since it was early, we are starting
to learn roles. Our guards are being more aggressive. Yaya Dunning, like you
said, has to pick up some of the slack, and other players on the team.  
  
Q. In that same vein though, Asya gave you a lot of size. This is a
conference where there is an awful lot of size because teams have tried to
recruit size to match ‑up with Brittney Griner. What kind of challenge is it
going forward in a league where you have so many talented post players?   
COACH CAREY: Well, it is. We felt good about coming in this year with our size
and veterans in the post. But things like that happen. We have to move
forward. We're very positive. We think players have picked up the slack.
Compared between the Big East and the Big 12 personnelwise, I think the Big 12
is a lot bigger, where you had two or three big post players in the Big East
where here you have two or three on each team.  
But we have to do what we do. We're going to get out and run, we're going to
use our quickness. We're going to defend. We've just got to keep people off
the board.  
We're not going to be as big as some of these teams. I always look at it both
ways. If we're not as big, they have to guard us on the other end also, and
hopefully we can pull some of the big players out from the paint and we can be
effective at times also.  
  
Q. We talked a little with Bob last week up in Kansas City. But I wondered
if you could describe how difficult this league is in a travel basis for you
guys as far as having to bounce back and forth from West Virginia on the round
robin schedule?  
COACH CAREY: First of all, the best thing is our administration provides
charters for us. That is big for us not to have to go commercial, because
you're going to spend a lot of time in the airport. It is going to be farther.
It's going to be longer, but that's part of adjusting to the Big 12. We have
to be smart about it. We have to be sure. We'll bring our academic people with
us. We'll get back a little later. Sometimes that will be an hour later than
we normally would. But we traveled in the Big East also.  
We're not going to use that for a reason not to be ready to play. We're
looking forward to a league where everything's positive. Nothing is negative.
It's going to be a learning experience for us this first year.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE WOMEN'S MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 25, 2012

  

### [Karen Aston](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24311)

  
_DALLAS, TEXAS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, welcome and your opening thoughts about the season?  
COACH ASTON: Thank you very much. As I start most days, it's a great day to be
a Longhorn, and I appreciate you all being here today.  
I just want to say, first of all, it's been a process as far as the hiring
when we came aboard. I feel like I've gone through stages already in the
season and stages in my career because we started out with the hiring process.
I thought the staff was really, really important in the process.  
When I took the job, I thought hiring a staff that would fit in at Texas and
help all of us become more successful. I thought it was really, really
important. I spent a lot of time with that. After that occurred, obviously,
you go through the stages of needing to hit the ground running in recruiting.  
We did all of that. Felt like we reached out to the appropriate people. Then
you get to your team, which is where we are today. We've gone through a few
weeks of practice. It's obvious to me that the players, as always when you
take over a program, because I have had the experience of doing that a couple
of times, you realize how tough it is on the players. It's a new system. It's
a new way of doing things. They're uncomfortable.  
I can almost liken this to coaching 14 freshmen right now. That's what
coaching my team is like because when we go out to the practice floor every
day, everybody is uncomfortable. None of the players know exactly what to
expect. So it's difficult for them to help the freshmen, which we have five
newcomers.  
So it's difficult for the older players to even help them because they're
unsure. Right now we're in the process of helping them get their feet on the
ground. I feel like, again, through this journey, we'll go through phases. I
think it will be more enjoyable when we get to the second phase of this which
is where we feel comfortable.  
  
Q. What do you feel like the experience that you've had by coaching at
Baylor and Texas will help you hit the ground running in your first season in
the Big 12?  
COACH ASTON: I think you just understand the nature of the conference.
Obviously the eight years that I spent under Coach Conradt at Texas were the
most valuable part of my career so far other than the part of being a head
coach, which, that is the greatest experience of all.  
But the eight years that I was under Jody absolutely prepared me for the
difficulty in the league. At least I'm familiar with each venue. I'm familiar
a little bit with the coaching styles, because a lot of the coaches are still
here, and most importantly I'm familiar with the competition and how
competitive this league is, how competitive the environments are that you play
in.  
The year I spent at Baylor was just another valuable experience for me. You
can't say enough about how Jody and Kim both have impacted our game. Having
that opportunity to coach under either one of those two people would be very
valuable and has been.  
  
Q. What was a priority when you arrived on campus as far as what the program
was at the time?  
COACH ASTON: Well, obviously, the staff. I felt really a sense of urgency in
hiring people that I felt like understood Texas and understood the nature of
being at Texas, what the expectations are. It's a different place. There are
extremely high expectations as there are everywhere in this league.  
But Texas is unique. The academic environment at Texas is unique, so I think
that just getting people that understood that was very important for me.  
The second piece of that was once we got on board, was just to evaluate our
team. There were some specific needs that we were short in some areas, so we
actually had to, when I say hit the ground running in recruiting, we really
had to hit it quick, because we had to add some people to our team just to add
some depth. So that was really the first two things that I had to address
immediately.  
  
Q. Kind of just elaborating on that, Gail had obviously a solid run there,
but seemed to have kind of hit a wall, especially in the NCAA Tournament the
first and second rounds. You talked about the high expectations at Texas. What
does Texas have to do to get back to that level that it was under Jody, where
it was that sort of perennial contender in the NCAA?  
COACH ASTON: I think we have to change our mindset with our current team. I
think it would be unfair to our players right now for me to jump ahead and say
I've got to get better players and we have to recruit better. I think
recruiting is a given. Recruiting has to be terrific for you to be great in
the game of basketball.  
So I think the most important thing is what we do between the lines. I think
we need to get between the lines. Get a different mindset. I don't know what
happened in the different regime before. I just know what I'm looking at now,
and I think this league is incredibly competitive. You have to learn how to
get between the lines. Every single thing you do has to matter. I think that
really is where we have to start. The other things will take care of
themselves.  
  
Q. Since you've left the conference to add two teams to the state of Texas
win National Championships. Just talk about how recruiting has been ratcheted
up even more after what's happened in the last few years?  
COACH ASTON: Well, honestly, I think I got a glimpse of that my final years at
Texas. I thought that the whole league changed. Oklahoma started recruiting in
Texas. Obviously that had been going on in football for years.  
But I think Gary got into the mix. There were days I want to say back in the
day‑‑ I think we all remember back in the day‑‑ but Texas, Texas Tech were the
names that you heard a lot about in the Southwest Conference days. I actually
had some experience in the Southwest Conference at Baylor my first go around.
So I understood that.  
As the years went on, a lot more people came into play, and I think that's the
addition of the coaches in the Big 12. I think when you talk about how
terrific of a job Sherri has done, the late Kurt Budke, the job he did at
Oklahoma State. They started taking Texas kids, and all of a sudden Gary Blair
and Kim Mulkey showed up, and the recruiting became as competitive as the play
was.  
So it's why the Big 12 is so great. You have to want those expectations. It's
competitive, and you have to work at it. I don't think anything just happens.
Those people work at what they did. Gary and Kim deserve everything that's
happened with them. They work hard. They're hard‑working people. I know them
both.  
So I think it's just a matter of, like I said, us getting between the lines
and going to work. It's just work. It's going to be competitive. But the fun
thing about it is that Texas basketball is the best in the country, Texas high
school basketball. So our challenge is to try to keep those people home and
keep them comfortable in the Big 12, comfortable in staying in the state of
Texas. So I think when you talk about our biggest challenge, I think that is
it.  
  
Q. You talked about addressing specific concerns when you came in, and
obviously you've got one of the top recruits coming in. You've got Empress
Davenport coming in. You've also kind of gotten Gigi Mazionyte, the Lithuanian
forward that you got from junior college, and you even have a former softball
player in Nadia Taylor who is playing with you. Talk about the newcomers who
might have an impact. I am curious if Nadia might see some minutes or not, and
how things shake out?  
COACH ASTON: Let me say this much about Nadia Taylor. That is a player and a
young lady that has gained an enormous amount of respect from myself, my staff
and her teammates. To have been away from the game for that long of amount of
time and played a sport that is dramatically different from a conditioning
standpoint and just throw yourself in there and do the best you can do, you
have to admire that as far as her amount of minutes. I think there is a
learning curve with having been away from the game.  
Once we start getting into game mode and into more team activities, team
defense, running offenses, that's where you can see she's been away from the
game, not from a lack of effort. Just being away from it. I think it's going
to take some time. But her effort would make me believe that she might figure
this out before the year's over just from her attitude and her effort.  
Starting with the newcomers, I think they're all going to play a considerable
amount. We're still dealing with some issues with injuries, and I think it's
going to force these young players into action quickly. Some will be ready.
Some are going to learn by experience and getting thrown into the fire. In
particular, our young guards.  
Celina Rodrigo from Atlanta, Georgia, will be thrown into the point position,
as will Ashley Roberts. These are two players that have never been on the
floor in the Big 12. So Ashley is a Duncanville product also by way of South
Plains.  
So they're young. They're inexperienced, but they'll learn. They'll learn.
They're competitive players, and I have appreciated their efforts in practice.  
Empress Davenport will actually see some time at the combo position. Empress
is incredibly competitive and comes from, again, a Duncanville product where
the environment has been very competitive. So she understands how to compete.
So it has put her at an advantage in practice every day, and I expect her to
play a lot.  
The other newcomer, the Lithuanian kid from Weatherford, her work ethic is
amazing. So, again, I sort of look at her in the same place that I do Nadia in
the sense that everything is so new to them, the terminology, all of that.
When that light comes on for them, their work ethic will allow us to give them
some minutes that will be very valuable.  
The last newcomer, Imani McGhee‑Stafford, I think has tremendous potential.
She's a 6'7" lady from California. She has a competitive edge that she's been
involved in USA basketball, so she understands competition. She came to Texas
with a lot of pride in being a Longhorn. She was very excited about coming to
Texas. Imani, I think has some really, really special quality that's you're
going to see very quickly.

## March 10, 2012

  

### [Brittney Griner](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20672)

### [Kim Mulkey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13704)

### [Odyssey Sims](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21920)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Baylor  73  
Texas A&M  50

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, would you like to make an opening comment?  
COACH MULKEY: No, no.  
THE MODERATOR: Let's go to questions for our student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Odyssey and Brittney, if you both could answer this question. Odyssey,
this is I think the fourth one of these celebrations you've had since you've
been at Baylor. I think Brittney's had five. The hats the shirts the nets the
confetti, what's the best part of it all?  
ODYSSEY SIMS: Well, it's exciting to win. We've been winning all season. We've
been successful. But this is great. But now we're focused on six games. That's
what we're striving for, and I'm saying we're having fun, but six games is the
most important.  
BRITTNEY GRINER: Couldn't have said it any better. These next six games. We
enjoyed the celebration. We love the hats and everything. But six more games.  
  
Q. Love the hats. Tell me about the shoes and socks you're wearing today.  
BRITTNEY GRINER: We love it. I love this uniform. I love the socks,
everything. We love playing in them.  
ODYSSEY SIMS: Give credit to Nike. They did a very good job with the uniforms,
the designs, the socks and all the colors. Put it together and made it look
good. And we wore it and it looked good on us.  
  
Q. Continue to wear them or special occasions?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: Special occasion.  
  
Q. Brittney, you said the other day you want this to be not Brittney Griner
and Baylor but Baylor. I thought it was a great example when your teammates,
so many people stepped forward, Odyssey, Jordan, Hayden. Everybody
contributed. Obviously Destiny Williams. Could you just talk about that aspect
of today's championship game?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: Definitely. Like I said yesterday, it's not Brittney Griner
and Baylor. This is Baylor. We're a team. Everybody pulls together and
contributes.  
I mean, I love games like this, watching my teammates score, and if I catch
it, get double‑teamed, kick it to them. And I love it. This is a special team
and I love my team.  
  
Q. Odyssey, is this your birthday?  
ODYSSEY SIMS: No.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the way you took it to the basket on a day when so
much defensive attention was on Brittney?  
ODYSSEY SIMS: Coach just told me to attack. We ran our play. It was the high
screen. Made it come off, made something happen. I had to either go to the rim
or kick it out. And I just kept going until they tried to stop me.  
And I was just‑‑ more than anything, just wanted my team to win. I scored a
lot of points today, but I'm happy my team won. B.G., when she sat on the
bench, I thought Jordan and NaeNae did an awesome job rebounding, Destiny, she
always is great. And that's what we need when B.G. is‑‑ six games, you never
know. She might get into foul trouble. And I thought everybody stepped up.
Even our bench play. It was very productive.  
  
Q. Odyssey, first half you took a tumble to the floor. Were down there for a
while. What happened there?  
COACH MULKEY: I'll answer that for her. She didn't want to see me, so she
pretended she was really, really hurt. She turned it over, missed a pass to
Griner, and then she fouled, boom, boom, boom. Right, O?  
ODYSSEY SIMS: Right.  
BRITTNEY GRINER: Gave us a breather.  
COACH MULKEY: You didn't see me run out there, did you? I know my point guard.
She's not hurt if that's your question. She got a little bruise on her
shoulder.  
  
Q. Secondly, about 11minutes to go, there's a play where you throw a pass,
it gets intercepted. Kelsey Bone gets the ball. You run down there, steal it
from her. Run back down, hit a little spinning layup thing. I know Coach says
don't give up a play. Was that your mindset there?  
ODYSSEY SIMS: I know I turned it over. I had to get back. I was the only one
back. And in my mind I was thinking that she was going to body me and score. I
knew as soon as she put it on the floor. This is the opportunity to go steal
it and I did. And everything just happened so fast. I don't even remember what
happened about the spin move. It just went in. That's pretty much it.  
  
Q. Brittney, you were in this position last year where you guys won the Big
12 Championship, and then you didn't play ‑‑ you've talked about you
personally didn't feel like you played as well as you wanted to in that game
against A&M and that's kind of driven you all this season. Can you talk about
what the different mindset maybe is this season going into the NCAA
Tournament?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: Just doing whatever I can to help my team out. If I'm not
have a good scoring game, don't let that get me bummed out where I hurt my
team and I'm feeling sorry for myself. Get on the defensive end and block
shots, alter shots, rebound. Because defense wins games. I guess that's just
my mindset going into the tournament this year.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Kim, I hope you're happy that Destiny made the All ‑Tournament Team
after‑‑  
COACH MULKEY: Thank you, Lord. Took me two years to get y'all to vote her on
there. Didn't you all vote on that? I mean, look again. Just look at the stat
sheet. She's 6‑for‑8\. Plays the most minutes on the team. She has a
double‑double again. That kid‑‑ and then look at who she guarded on the other
team.  
I'm so happy for her, because this is the second time her mother's gotten to
see her play in a Baylor uniform. First time I've ever met her brother and her
nephews, and it was just a special moment for Destiny.  
  
Q. Gary said at the 4 position she kicked butt today, basically. How much of
an advantage did that help particularly with Brittney not being that effective
offensively?  
COACH MULKEY: Well, first of all, I don't agree that Brittney wasn't effective
offensively.  
  
Q. Destiny ‑‑  
COACH MULKEY: If you look at what Destiny does around Brittney and through
Brittney, she never stops what's she's been asked to do: rebound the ball,
score, put back, shoot the jumper at the foul line. Destiny has done that
consistently whether Griner gets 4 today or 10 today.  
It's really good for our basketball team. And really good for fans of women's
basketball to see Griner was guarded one‑on‑one yesterday, why not throw it to
her every time. Today it was a little bit different and you see the effect she
has about everything, when she touches it and can't get to the rim, she just
dumps it off to people. People cutting.  
I think that's where we've really grown as a basketball team, is that we've
read and heard too many times that we're a very average team without Brittney
Griner. Well, I took her off the floor at the 13‑minute mark today. I took her
off the floor‑‑ was it 11 something the other day.  
These kids can play. The Destinies of the world, the Odysseys of the world,
this isn't just a one‑man team.  
You must remember, Brittney Griner and Odyssey Sims have never won a
championship until they got to Baylor and won the Big 12 regular season and
the tournament. They never won a state championship. And they are surrounded
by players who have won numerous state championships.  
So those kids are winners in that locker room. And they know how to win. And
I'm just blessed that my coaches have recruited some outstanding talent.  
  
Q. You were in this position it seemed like there was so much forward
momentum and it was an obvious unfortunate matchup that it was A &M you had to
play, was the mindset different this year?  
COACH MULKEY: I think without question. I think our mindset was the same when
we left here, but when you looked up on that board at the pairings, it just
deflated everybody that you just played these people three times. This is not
what the NCAA Tournament is supposed to be about.  
And it deflated all of us. And I think I probably didn't handle it as well
with my team when those pairings were announced.  
They weren't mature enough yet for them to understand my remarksweren't
because we didn't think we could beat them again, but yet maybe they took it
the wrong way that the odds are you can't beat somebody that many times in a
row.  
And this year they would be more apt to say send us to College Station. They
host a first and second round, send us to College Station.  
That won't happen. Okay. Because we will have to play a 16 seed and see an 8
and 9; is that right? Well, A&M is not going to be an 8 or a 9 or a 16. But
the difference is a year's experience, a year's maturity, and they're on a
mission. We're on a mission.  
I love the business‑like approach after the game. Celebrate, don't go overdo
it. Now, that wasn't something I had to preach to them. It was we've been
here, we've done this before, but this is just a little step along the way.  
We have worked so hard to try to win six basketball games. And now those six
basketball games are right here before you.  
  
Q. Odyssey's floaters and stuff, is that a knack for scoring or is that ‑‑  
COACH MULKEY: Yes, it is. You'll watch it a lot on the men's side. Even at
Baylor, Tweety Carter, he could get a shot off at his size against the bigs in
there. And it's just instincts of the game for when you need to get rid of it,
how long you need to keep it in your hands. Odyssey has done it throughout her
career in high school. Summer basketball.  
She pretty much can get to the rim. What she's done a really remarkable job of
and improved her game when she was young, seventh and eighth grade when we
started following Odyssey, she did that nonstop and never shot the perimeter
shot. And now she has developed the perimeter game, and she's just a tough
matchup.  
  
Q. You won it last year, won it this year, last go around for Kansas City,
are you going to miss this place or glad ‑‑  
COACH MULKEY: Trace Adkins sang that last night, "You're going to miss this."
Kansas City, I love the Power & Light District. I wish the support you see
three blocks from our hotel for the men's game would shift more to the women's
side, but it doesn't affect our team on enjoying it here.  
We do enjoy it. And when you win, you enjoy wherever you are. And we've been
very successful in Kansas City. But, honestly, I'm going to be glad to keep it
in Texas next year and be back in Dallas.  
  
Q. You've talked about the fans not taking these championships for granted.
It's a special thing. What's the message to the players in terms of realizing
how special this is?  
COACH MULKEY: Well, I told them after the game just a minute ago in the locker
room how proud I was of them and that I understand the mission that we're on.
But this is special. There are many teams, many players, many coaches that
never get to cut a net down, whether it's a Big 12 Championship, whether it's
a district championship in high school, state championship.  
And don't take it for granted. But I've really loved their mindset. They're
not in that locker room high‑fiving, ooing and awing, going crazy in there.
It's more like a businesslike approach.  
We took care of our business here. Let's go to the men's game tonight, cheer
hard, get on the plane, rest tomorrow, go to the pairings Monday, and let's
get ready for what you ultimately want, and that's the national championship.  
  
Q. You talked about Odyssey. But I thought NaeNae as well in the open court
was pretty special today. Did you like what you saw from your guards?  
COACH MULKEY: I actually thought‑‑ and you've heard me say this‑‑ in order for
us to win a national championship, NaeNae Hayden and Jordan Madden have to win
it for us.  
They've each accepted the roles that are asked of them each game. Their roles
change a little bit each game. Jordan Madden has been asked to guard the best
perimeter player all year. I thought Jordan Madden was aggressive. She got
boards for us today.  
I just saw an intensity about Jordan Madden that wasn't silly. Jordan is the
team not clown, she just has fun. Jordan enjoys life. But I'm watching her
develop the mentality on that floor: I'm going to do my part, Coach. I'm not
going to let you down. I'm not going to let my teammates down. NaeNae, she
never knows when I'm going to have to ask her to play point guard. But she
just does it. And I just think those two players are the key to our basketball
team.  
They've been told that. They know it. It's not pressure. It's just‑‑ we know
Griner. We know Odyssey. We know Destiny, but those two kids have to go there
and win it for us. Not that they have to go score a lot of points. Not that
they have to do something they're not capable of doing.  
But what they've done for our basketball team goes unnoticed by most people.
It doesn't go unnoticed in that locker room.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Baylor  73  
Texas A&M  50

  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by the Aggies from Texas A&M.  
Coach your thoughts on this afternoon's game.  
COACH BLAIR: Before I talk about the game, I'd like to speak to Kansas City
for what they've done with this tournament over the years.  
And Kansas City has been good to us. They've done a great job of rolling out
the red carpet. We've been at the Courtyard Marriott forever. We love it. And
I thought Kansas City put on a good show.  
I thought our crowd today, considering two Big 12 South teams were in it, I
thought there was a good attendance. So the committee must have done pretty
good getting out.  
But I'd like to thank Kansas City for putting on a great show. And we would
also like to thank the Big 12 for giving Texas A&M the opportunity to show
what we're all about.  
We're a great university with very proud traditions, and we have a damn good
basketball team. But we played the best team in the country today, and if they
get the opportunity to win a national championship, we congratulate them and
we'll pat them on the back.  
Hopefully it will be like next year and we get a chance to play them for the
fourth time.  
They make us better. I'm not sure if we made them better today. But they make
us better because we see the weakness on certain areas that we have to improve
on.  
But the game tonight was very similar to College Station. It was 14‑2 there.
We took their best shot, came right back into the ballgame, and we attacked.  
Today we didn't attack as much a little bit. They were doing a lot better job
on handling ball out front, and we couldn't get to the rim. When it got to
17‑2, we played them 18‑18 the rest of the first half, I thought we had a
chance.  
If we would have hit our bunnies and got it down to a 9‑ or 10‑point game I
think our confidence‑‑ the first five minutes of the second half was all
Baylor. And you just give them credit. They're a great basketball team. Baylor
University has had a great year.  
But Texas A&M is starting off on Monday wherever the Selection Show, whatever
seed they give us, but we will be there and we will defend that national
champion and we will work hard at trying to fill butts in the seat when we get
to College Station.  
But give Odyssey Sims a whole lot of credit, give Kelsey Bone a whole lot of
credit for good post defense on Griner. And we talked about it before the game
started. We wanted Karla to go ahead and start, chew up a couple of fouls, let
the referees get used to what they were going to call and what they were not
going to call, because we needed Bone scoring in the first half to make sure
that there was a second half to be played.  
So that's all we did it for. And it relaxed Kelsey, and Kelsey said: That's
what I want to do, is come off the bench. And that's why we did it.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Sydney, could you talk a little bit about Odyssey Sims, her progression,
what makes her so tough and why was she able to dominate today, really?  
SYDNEY CARTER: I just think she's a good player. She's very calm, and I think
she's a true point guard. She's very aggressive. She attacks aggression with
aggression.  
And she does a good job of getting into the paint and using her body to hit
those shots. And she even follows her shots. And you don't find that in a lot
of point guard that will actually go in there get a rebound after they miss.  
So I just think that she's learned a lot and she's a sophomore. So she's
playing on a good team. So she's getting more and more seasoned as the years
go.  
And I think she'll definitely keep getting better.  
  
Q. Kelsey, if we had told you before the game that you guys would hold
Brittney Griner to 11points, especially after she went to 45 yesterday, would
you think, hey, we're going to win that game?  
KELSEY BONE: Most definitely. But the good thing about it is Baylor's a great
team. I mean, that's what elite‑level teams do. After seeing Brittney go for
45 yesterday, we made it up in our minds we can't let her get 45 on us if we
want a shot at winning.  
So somebody else stepped up. And it just so happened to be that three people
on their team stepped up. Everybody's going to talk about Odyssey, but you
have to give Destiny Williams credit. She's a player I've known since high
school. And she's a double‑double machine. Tonight she got another
double‑double. Jordan Madden came up and she scored in double figures as well.  
So I think while most people think that the focus is on Brittney, I said it
yesterday, whatever five steps up, it's going to be about the supporting cast,
and today that was the tale of two stories.  
  
Q. Both of you, I know this stings now, but you've played the team that was
ranked No.1 for most of the season. You played them three times. Can you talk
about how that's going to help? You know you're not going to face anybody
better than them in the NCAA Tournament.  
SYDNEY CARTER: It's definitely a learning experience every single time. The
first time we lost by 23. We just knew‑‑ we weren't all there. The second time
we play them we take them down to the wire until we have to foul at the end.  
So every single game we're learning and we're growing as a team, and we're
seeing our weaknesses and we're seeing that they're playing at this level so
we've got to take it up a couple more levels when we're playing a team like
Baylor. And I think it shows how tough we are.  
We're going to have to get that toughness and you're going to have to
literally come ready to fight instead of play a basketball game when you're
playing a team like Baylor, and it's all about how physical you're going to be
and the thinking part of it. It's definitely a mentality. And you have to go
into that game with that mentality that you're going to be aggressive with
them and you're going to try and play with them the best you can.  
KELSEY BONE: You're right. We probably won't play a team better than Baylor.
We played them three times. We've also played against Connecticut at
Connecticut. So I think it's up to us to take these games and use them.  
At this point, it's win or go home. There is no next week we'll play again.
Monday we find out where we're going. We're going to practice Monday. And it's
up to us as a team to get better and to use these things. Coach Blair in his
postgame talk with us, he wrote it on the board: Now it's time to get better.  
We have to use these things. There's some good things that happened in this
game today, but we shot 27percent.  
We shot ourselves in the foot a little bit. And so using these three‑‑ three
of our losses this year are to the No.1 team in the land. And I think we just
have to build on that and use it to our advantage.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. You know what I'm going to ask. You had Tyra dressed and warmed up. She
must have felt better but not quite good enough?  
COACH BLAIR: We tried it this morning after breakfast. Tried it with a shank
in the shoe. And just jogged and she said it was a lot of pain. When she came
out here, I said well at least put the tennis shoe on and go through
stretching, because it would be like coming off of a sprained ankle or
something, it's going to hurt if you've been in a boot forever. So let's try
it.  
But then she went back to the trainer afterward. It's too much pain. And then
when the game got out of hand, there's no sense risking who we consider one of
the best players to play at Texas A&M when she wouldn't have made that much
difference.  
The first time we played at Waco she was our only offensive player that
ballgame as she could shoot over their taller wings or create her own shot.  
Our little 1s and 2s, it's hard for them to get their shots off because of
Madden and Hayden.  
  
Q. Gary, does a team almost have to play perfect to beat Baylor?  
COACH BLAIR: I think you've got to come up with the right zone. I do not
believe you can play them man for man. You can spot in and out. But I think
you've got to find a way.  
And then Griner was not hitting her shots today. We were doing a pretty good
job of pushing her out, making her work, where at Kansas State it was a layup
drill yesterday. And, I mean, what an exhibition.  
They can be beat because of Notre Dame and Connecticut and Stanford and
whoever. And Tennessee or Duke. Whoever gets hot during the playoffs. It's
hard to be the best all year and then maintain it. That's why we have
playoffs. Can you do it every night? Can you not have a bad night?  
All right. I thought my Texas Rangers were going to win the World Series and
that didn't happen. They had the better team, but they didn't win the World
Series.  
So for the Big 12, if we can't win it, let's keep it at home in the Big 12.
And hopefully we'll be able to get as many Big 12 teams in the tournament as
we can. So hopefully they're doing their work up in Indianapolis trying to get
some other teams into the league.  
But Baylor is that good, and, yes, she's the best player I've ever played
against, and I've played against every single one of them except Carol
Blazejowski. And I've played against them, coached against them or seen them,
and that's the best.  
  
Q. Griner, like everybody said, you guys held her down pretty much. First of
all, you've got to stop almost everybody, right, and then you guys had a
couple of layups in the second half with break ‑aways. You have to convert
every possession almost. You can't have empty possessions, right?  
COACH BLAIR: You talk about it. Guys dump the ball on layups. Girls, it's
50/50 at the best. On a driving layup. Don't go up and foul them because most
of the time they're scared to death they'll get their shot blocked and they
miss layups.  
So I'm coaching the ones behind them to hurry up and get down and make the
layup. I've given up on the girl that's shooting the ball. I've seen it for
30years now.  
It's hard to make a driving layup when you see that fear instead of taking it
right to them. Make them make a train collision at the top. You rarely see it.  
Odyssey is smart enough to run under people. We've missed those layups all
year. Not just tonight. But it was pretty embarrassing tonight that we
couldn't hit the layups. But we've missed them against other teams as well. So
it's not just Odyssey Sims. That's something that we need to work on. We're
not good at it.  
  
Q. We're all going to miss you a lot in this league. I do want to say that.
I think I speak for every media person who has covered this league. And good
luck in the SEC. But I wish you weren't leaving. My question is: What about
the depth of your team? I know today you're kind of disappointed. But I
thought I saw more depth in this tournament, and will that come into play
during the NCAA Tournament?  
COACH BLAIR: We hope so. Sometimes it's hard to recruit depth when you're
national champions. Because a lot of times, that's when you look on
Connecticut and Tennessee's team, they usually only have 10 or 11 players
because they're All‑McDonald's All‑Americans, so who wants to come be that
third wheel.  
We have kids that‑‑ we do not recruit bench warmers. We recruit kids to be
starters. If they do not become starters during their career, then I've made a
recruiting mistake. But due to injuries, normally we fill our allotment. I
think our depth is good. I put that little Scott kid in, the freshman. I think
she's going to be good. If I could‑‑ when we go to Europe this summer, she'll
get a lot of experience. A love my recruiting class that's coming in.  
We played a lot of different people. The bench played well all tournament long
until today. But, hey, at halftime, never in the history of basketball has
your starting lineup had one basket at halftime. Your starting lineup had one
basket at halftime. So there's your little thought for the day. I see you
scurrying around writing that note down. That's true. When I looked at it, it
was pretty scary.  
  
Q. Didn't have two starters really, Bone and Tyra?  
COACH BLAIR: That's good, Randy. I'm going to go with my thought because my
thought sounds a little bit better. And we missed some good shots. Carter
missed some very wide‑open, makeable shots. And it wasn't her best game.
Yesterday was her best game.  
  
Q. Remember that segment talking about the missed layups the start of the
second half there, when you talk about the Griner effect, but Collins misses
the wide ‑open layup going in, Carter misses the follow, then Griner goes down
and hits it, and then Odyssey steals the ball and hits the 3. And I looked
over on the bench. You guys never really looked like you recovered from that.
Looked like that stretch was the final one that put Baylor over to end the
game?  
COACH BLAIR: That's just how smart Odyssey is. They will win a national
championship if Odyssey Sims can play at that level consistently, because
she's so doggone smart. She didn't last year at the Elite Eight. And it cost
them. But if she can play that way, I do not believe there's a better point
guard in the country that can play both ends of the court and play it up here.
Because certain zones will shut down Griner. But when you've got a point guard
that is as good as she is and is as unselfish as she is, a lot of people don't
want to come to Baylor and watch Griner do all the work.  
They want to go where the ball's in their hands. Well, they've got some
unselfish players that are about winning championships, and that's what makes
Baylor so good is they've got some kids that will share the spotlight while
Griner does her thing.  
But that role in the second half was huge. The missed layups, you feel for
kids, then you feel for the follow‑up because you see somebody's coming.
Little Carter's 5'6" in there and shooting an Annie overshot. And it's
frustrating. And then you see Odyssey go down the lane about four straight
times and score on everybody that we had just because her body control is so
good.  
Destiny Williams kicked us at the 4 position like she's kicked every 4 player
all year. Elonu didn't show up physically. She's been great for us all year,
but did not show up physically. That's why I kept pulling her in and out.  
You got a 12 and 11 versus a 0 and a 6. That's why I put Assarian in there so
much because, by God, if I'm going down, they're going to go down with some
body blocks or at least we're going to play hard in there, and hopefully this
will wake up Elonu to realize you cannot be a finesse player when you're
playing for championships.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the technical there, what they came over and said?  
COACH BLAIR: Williams pulled the hair of Kelsey Bone. And you know Assarian,
as tough as she is, she cries on a foul. But she's just such an emotional
player. She came to the bench and she said: Coach, they pulled my hair. The
referee saw it. He said dead ball, technical.  
And it's just, hey, girls do that all the time. When I was in high school‑‑
don't ever do this. I was on lunchroom duty and I had to break up a fight
between two girls in the girls' bathroom, and they turned on me and I got the
fool beat out of me. You do not do that. Okay?  
And that is serious and the horns are blowing and he's got his pencil going.
If you need me for anything else, that's it. But that technical had nothing to
do with the game.  
That's all. She pulled the hair, dead ball, technical. Foul.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Baylor  86  
Kansas State  65

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, opening comments?  
COACH MULKEY: I don't have any.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Brittney, you're not one for individual record, really. But they kept
feeding you it to get you that record down at the end of the game. Is it
special for you?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: I mean, yeah. I'm happy I got it. It would have been sweeter
if it was 45blocks.  
  
Q. I was watching in the pregame shoot ‑around, you were a little short from
your shots from the free‑throw line and stuff, but that didn't seem to be the
case in the game. Is there any correlation between shootaround in the game at
all?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: You caught that, huh? We tried to make it like it's the game,
and I kept hitting them short. It was like I hope this isn't a sign. And it
wasn't. I was definitely happy.  
  
Q. Brittney, looked like you got a little tired there late in the game. Do
you have a sub sign, tapping your head or anything?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: No, I don't have a sub sign or anything.  
  
Q. Were you getting tired?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: A little bit, I guess. I mean, even if I'm tired I'll stay
out there, no matter what.  
  
Q. Brittney, this is the third time you've played K ‑State this year and
third time you've won pretty handily, is there something about them
matchup‑wise that helped you guys be so successful?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: It's our defense. And we play hard. And that's just how it
turns out. It's not anything in particular. We play hard and we defend. It
works.  
  
Q. One thing I notice, every time you get the ball you keep it up high.
Where a lot of big players on both men and women, they bring it down low,
somebody gets after it. When did you really start working on that and how
important is that to keep being able to score just catching it and keeping it
up high?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: When I got here, the coaches were working with me on it, just
keep it up high, keep it up high. And I'd say about this year, really, I'm
keeping it up high like the whole time. And it's helping me out. Gotta keep it
up high.  
  
Q. Destiny, I guess you had a pretty view of what Brittney was doing today.
What did you see out there? Was she in the zone as far as shooting the ball?  
DESTINY WILLIAMS: The kid had a phenomenal start. She made all the shots. The
guards did a great job of passing her the ball, and she did a great job
finishing. So as long as B.G. finish, the guards should be satisfied with the
assists. And they play a one‑on‑one, and she take advantage of it as much as
possible because you don't see that as much. She did a great job finishing at
the rim.  
  
Q. Destiny, we're used to watching Brittney. You're used to seeing what she
can do. And it wasn't obviously just the scoring today. The assists, the
rebounds, blocked shots. Is there anything that she does that surprises you at
all?  
DESTINY WILLIAMS: Nope. Not even when she dribbled the ball up the floor, it
don't surprise me either. The kid do pretty much what anybody can do on the
floor. She can pass. She has great eyes. She blocked shots from behind, from
the front. She can finish. She can rebound. She does it all. So she's a
complete player.  
  
Q. I guess I'll ask about the missed dunk. Were you going for it? Looked
like there were even people in front of you.  
BRITTNEY GRINER: I thought I was Blake Griffin (laughter). I was trying to
throw it in there. Like I said, I tried to throw it in, it hit rim, came out.
But definitely, I don't know, something just sparked, I'm going up no matter
what, and I went up.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Was the game plan with the defense that K ‑State is playing to kind of
keep going to Brittney? I know that's sort of your philosophy all the time.   
COACH MULKEY: We took what they gave us. They went one‑on‑one coverage with
Griner early in the game, go in there and we did. Then they went to the zone
and didn't get as easy looks or passes in there to her, but that's what they
chose to do and throw it in there.  
  
Q. How good has she gotten as a passer? Inbounds plays where she either has
the option to throw it or find ‑‑  
COACH MULKEY: Well, Brittney, her freshman year, was not very good. She
couldn't really pass out of double teams well.  
She would make decisions. They'd be the wrong decisions because she held on to
the ball too long. Now she catches the ball, she turns, she looks and she sees
the options she has. She keeps it above her head and she makes sure when she
can't score it, I'm going to find a teammate.  
It's not just on the inbounds, it's on the offense we run, and we work it
every day. And she's just so much better. Turnovers bother her. She is just
like a sponge. Every time you teach Brittney something or you tell her
something, she really takes it to heart. And I'm not surprised that her
assist‑to‑turnover ratio is much better now than when we got her.  
  
Q. I wanted to ask you about the approach player, keeping the ball up as
high as she does. How key is that for her success, the fact that she just
keeps it there and shoots it from that spot?  
COACH MULKEY: I think all coaches will tell you you teach your post players to
keep it high. When you bring it down low, you usually get a jump ball, tie
situation or a turnover. In fact, she brought it down low one time today on
the other end. And she knew the minute she came to the bench what she had
done.  
But Brittney naturally does that, but yet we still work with all post players
to do that, because post players tend to have a tendency to bring it down
before they make a power move to the basket and they do it on offensive
rebound and a put‑back. They want to bring it down, gather themselves and go
back up.  
And Brittney, just being 6'8", she has really done that on her own. I'm not
sure that we had to correct a whole lot.  
  
Q. When did you find out about the Big 12 record?  
COACH MULKEY: The coaches. I was getting ready to take her out, and they said,
Coach, she's five points away. We know you're not about records, but why not?
So, again, I left her out there to make sure she got it. She would have been
10, 12, 15, I wouldn't have done it. But five points, you may never get that
close again.  
  
Q. Obviously Brittney's going to get a lot of attention every night, but
Destiny has become a double ‑double machine night in and night out. How
important is it to have a player like her to shoulder the rebounding low so
Brittany doesn't have to go up every time there's a shot?  
COACH MULKEY: Destiny should have been First‑Team All‑Conference. How do you
average a double‑double in this league and you play with the greatest player
in the country and not be rewarded.  
Does that tell you how I feel about her? What's our record? 33‑0\. And you
can't have three on the All‑Conference First‑Team? Destiny Williams is
valuable.  
  
Q. I know you guys are going to the concert tonight. But will you watch this
next game and scout A &M and Oklahoma?  
COACH MULKEY: I don't know what we're going to watch that we haven't seen for
how many games now. I mean, nobody changes anything. Yes, we will scout it.
How much of it I watch will depend on if my feet start hurting and these shoes
are killing me and I need to get back into my tennis shoes. But the concert is
not until 8:00 tonight.  
But the concert, we will enjoy it. We'll take care of business. We'll get in
the film room and we'll talk about our game plan and what we may see. But we
can't do that until we see who wins. So they've got a few hours here to watch
it and go back to the hotel. Some of them will not go to the concert.  
Some of them want to go watch our men play.  
  
Q. I think Destiny was also on JuliAnne Chisholm a little bit. Could you
talk about her defense there, and something like JuliAnne had like 31 the
other night?  
COACH MULKEY: Destiny started out on her and she hit some buckets early. And
then we moved Brittney on her. And I thought‑‑ I'm not positive, but I want to
say she had seven at the half and she only ended up with 11 for the game, if
I'm correct. So I just thought that maybe Destiny was a little motivated.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Texas A&M  79  
Oklahoma  66

  
THE MODERATOR: Oklahoma has joined us. Coach, your thoughts about this
afternoon's game.  
COACH COALE: We didn't shoot it as well as obviously we would have liked or as
we would have expected to.  
Give A&M credit. They made shots. Their supporting cast Bellock and Collins
came in and both made significant contributions to the game. And then in the
second half we had it. We had it to 5, I believe, and had four attempts, good
looks at the basket and couldn't convert. And it kind of took a little bit of
juice away from us.  
Then down the stretch we would have loved to be able to go back to a zone
because Bone was just killing us in one‑on‑one coverage, but we were too far
behind. Didn't have the luxury of doing that.  
So it sort of got away from us after that stretch in the second half where we
cut it to five and had some options. We missed some shots from the perimeter.
I think it comes down to not getting any second‑chance shots. We went through
that stretch and just didn't get any offensive rebounds. And it's just so
disheartening and takes away your momentum, when you're not getting any second
chances at the basket.  
And while that was happening they were getting lots of second chances. So
their rebounding played a huge factor as well.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Whitney, you guys have played one of your better halves last night in the
second half. But this team's been on a roller coaster ride. As you go on to
the NCAA tournament, just talk about where you think this team is right now?  
WHITNEY HAND: I feel like this is the question that we've been trying to
answer all season, just where we are and where we are is trying to find
consistency, is trying to win games in a row. For the last month I feel we've
been win/loss, win/loss.  
So where we are is trying to string wins together and string good halves
together and that's our goal for the tournament. And that's all you gotta do,
as Coach says, catch lightning in a bottle. It's there and it's possible. We
have it. It's just stringing those things together, I think.  
  
Q. Whitney, I think A &M has eliminated you guys from the Big 12 tournament
four straight years. You've been here for all four of those. Why do you think
that keeps happening? Was this game any different, or was this just typical
A&M when you meet them in the Big 12 tournament?  
WHITNEY HAND: I didn't realize it was all four years that I've been here. It
just stinks. You don't want to admit that they're good in the tournament and
we lose to them every year. But it's the facts. It's what the stats show.  
It's kind of heartbreaking for us as a team, but at the same time they're
really tough in the tournament. They're a tough team. They battle you. They
fight you. And we gotta be tougher.  
We gotta figure out how to be tougher. I guess I remember lots of memories
playing them in tournament and they just fight. They fight hard and they're
bullies and they make you fight for it.  
  
Q. Aaryn and Whitney, what needs to change for you guys to string some wins
together finally, next week ‑‑ and beyond, perhaps?  
AARYN ELLENBERG: I think just playing an entire game, not just playing one
half. We've gotta do what we do as well and we've got to guard. Basically
that's one of the things we've been focusing on, really just guarding, putting
two halves together.  
WHITNEY HAND: Yeah, I would say consistency, all the way around.  
  
Q. Aaryn, you appeared to get banged up pretty good at the beginning of the
game. How did that affect you today?  
AARYN ELLENBERG: Well, I mean, it was a bit of a stinger. Probably took me‑‑
kept me from shooting a couple of shots I probably normally would.  
But other than that, I didn't really focus on it. We were out there trying to
win a game. So I kind of just put it out, aside.  
  
Q. Just elaborate on that a little bit. Was it your wrist, looked like
diving for the loose ball?  
AARYN ELLENBERG: It was my hand.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.  
Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Sherri, K.K. got two fouls there in about 30seconds. Was it a case you
just couldn't get her out in time, or were you hoping to let her play a while
with three, or what was going on there?  
COACH COALE: No. K.K.'s fouls came boom, boom, I think they both were in
transition, which is quite odd. And we just had situations everywhere. We had
foul situations everywhere and just felt like we needed her in the game to
rebound and defend.  
  
Q. Question about A &M. Are you going to miss'em?  
COACH COALE: I wish them well in the SEC.  
  
Q. Same question about changing some things to string some wins together and
to play a few weeks in the NCAA. What comes to mind? What needs to happen?  
COACH COALE: Well, first of all, after the grind of the Big 12 conference
season there's a breath of fresh air that comes in for the conference
tournament. And you go, oh, wait, we're playing all those same people with you
just rolled around with for two months.  
And I think now is when you really get the breath of fresh air, just play
someone different, anyone, just someone different. And I think that helps as
much as anything.  
What has to happen for us to string two wins together, consistency from the
guard spot. Our big three‑‑ when our big three‑‑ that's Morgan, Aaryn and
Whitney, when they've played really well we have won.  
And obviously we need some post production. But we'll get what we can get
there. Those three have to be on top of their game for us to be able to win
consecutively in the tournament.  
  
Q. I know sometimes we in the media maybe overanalyze compared to you guys,
on rare occasions. Have you thought much about the seeding because of your
roller coaster season, what may be fair, who they may bring with you to
Norman, an 8, 9? Some people say; is that too high, too low?  
COACH COALE: Oh, that's too low. Look at our RPI. Goodness gracious. I haven't
looked in several days, but last week we were at a 15 RPI and a 6 strength of
schedule. And we finished second place in this league. Come on, that's worth
more than an 8 or a 9.  
I don't know where they'll put us or who they'll send to Norman to play us.
And I wouldn't want to be a committee member in that room. They have a tough
job.  
And there's been a lot of upsets across the country that will, I think, affect
things. I think that actually in a crazy sort of way may help our seeding in
that there will be some teams who came through won their conference
tournament, some teams in leagues that nobody expected that to happen. So
you're going to have some of those guys that might actually boost the position
that we're in.  
  
Q. Elaborate a little bit on Bone and the foul trouble and K.K., especially
the 2. I mean, it seems like once she left the game Bone really had a huge
impact on the game. How much did it impact, do you think, her getting those
two and getting four?  
COACH COALE: We didn't have an answer for Kelsey Bone. She's just physical and
goes and buries you and goes, and she catches the ball and puts it on the
floor and buries you two foot and three foot further. What else are you
supposed to do? You're there and she just physically moves you two feet
further and scores. I don't know what you do about that.  
We had all kinds of foul trouble across the board with our posts. Nic was in
trouble. Jelena had three and K.K. was in trouble. We were really at a
disadvantage there. And like I said, we fell behind and we couldn't go back to
a zone and risk that. We had to try to put a little bit of pressure on them,
make something happen. We did not have an answer for her.  
Where I feel like we failed to maybe exploit her a little bit is she got some
early foul trouble, too. And we weren't able to go at her and get her in foul
trouble the way my bigs were in foul trouble in the second half.  
  
Q. A couple of schools in the Big 12 have been pretty public that they're
not going to play A &M in the future. Looks like no one is immediately. Do you
think that will eventually thaw? Do you think you'd eventually play A&M?  
COACH COALE: It's hard to say. Scheduling is such a big part of what you do
for your season.  
When you play in a league like we do, and depending on how many teams there
are in the Big 12, I don't know if it's set right now or‑‑ I wake up every day
and try and find out. But we play two more games this year than we typically
do in league, and that was really tough. When you balance it with what you're
trying to do in your preconference schedule.  
And we schedule three and four years out and have had historically some very,
very tough nonconference opponents, Tennessee, Connecticut. We've got Duke
coming in there. We have several things on the horizon. So it all has to fit
with that.  
You can't go play five top 10 teams outside of this league schedule. That
would be absolutely crazy. So you never say never. Once you have children,
don't you decide that, you never say never?  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Baylor  86  
Kansas State  65

  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by the Kansas State Wildcats.  
Coach, your thoughts on this afternoon's game.  
COACH PATTERSON: Well, we lined up against a dominant basketball team and I
thought we had segments of the game where we played well against Baylor.
Obviously it was a tremendous night for Brittney Griner.  
But I'm proud of what we brought to the floor by and large. We made some
mistakes and had some individual lulls. But I think the second half we
completely competed extraordinarily hard and gave up some rebounding numbers
when we went to the zone, which is what happened in our first two contests
against them.  
But I'm proud of our basketball team and wish Baylor the very best as they
move through NCAA Tournament play.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Jalana, can you talk about after scoring 31points yesterday, the
defensive effort for Baylor against you today? They seemed to really key on
you after you scored the first seven points for K ‑State.   
JALANA CHILDS: Yeah, I kind of talked about this yesterday. When someone's
scoring, you know the defense is going to change a little bit. And they didn't
really have to change that much because my game was changing with Brittney
Griner being in the post.  
I can't make the moves that I want to make. I gotta pivot extra times, exert
as much energy as I can just to get a shot off.  
Defense did a great job. Not just guarding me but my entire team. They really
make it hard for teams to get what they want. Just that Griner factor in the
game, it's really difficult.  
But we fought harder than I thought. And I'm proud of my team and I'm ready to
move forward.  
  
Q. Brittany, what's it like to watch a player have the performance that
Griner had tonight?  
BRITTANY CHAMBERS: She's an unbelievable player. And I think that with each
game she's even evolving her game more and more. I mean, we tried to push her
out, but when you push her out, her mid game has improved so much from last
year.  
She really just is an unbelievable player. It's fun to be on the court with
her, I guess now saying it, not when it's happening. But, yeah, she's
unbelievable.  
And she definitely has proven to be the best player in the country.  
  
Q. Did you feel like you were doing all you could do to stop Griner? Is she
so dominant that no matter how or what kind of approach you take to her she's
still going to get those points. Analyze a little bit how you were defending
her.  
BRITTANY CHAMBERS: We don't really have the height that some other teams have.
We have ‑‑ 6'2" is our tallest. When she's stepping back making shots over all
of us like she is, there's not much you can do. The most you can do is keep
pushing her farther and farther away from the basket. But she wasn't missing
tonight, jump shot around anything.  
I think with a little bit more height maybe you can pressure her a little bit
more. But with the night she had tonight, it's pretty tough to stop, if she's
making those kind of shots.  
  
Q. Jalana, you had those seven early points and Destiny Williams was on you
after a timeout they made the move and they put Griner on you. When that
timeout came, were you anticipating that move given the hot start that you had
had?  
JALANA CHILDS: Like I said, the defense is going to change according to what
you do. I wasn't really thinking about it at the time. I was really thinking
about me, personally. And the ways I could get us points on the board.  
I was going to guard Branshea Brown myself, it didn't matter. We had to find
ways to get away from the basket, and I think that's the smartest thing you
can do. I was just trying to be smart.  
I wasn't going to try to do my regular hook shot on her. She'll see it in the
stands. But gotta play smart, and their coach did a great job of adjusting.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, how much of Baylor's offense did you feel like was specifically
designed for Griner today? Was she just in the right spot at the right time,
or how many of those sets are set up exactly so that she can get the shot she
wants to get?  
COACH PATTERSON: I've watched Baylor play a lot this year, and I know in the
recent contests I've watched, I've seen Coach Mulkey over there on the
sidelines admonishing her players with this message "42." And she understands
that's the best player in the country. And they get her the ball.  
And today, in particular, with the size mismatch that they have against Kansas
State, it's just a given that they're going to go to Griner. And they did. Go
to the well. She's hitting shots at the rate she is. You can send two to her,
but she's still going to score over, and then you run into all kinds of issues
with your rebounding, which is what you saw as we began to give up rebounds
once we went to the zone.  
So I think they've got a lot of answers. I don't think that their system is so
simple that it's just run up the floor and get it to Griner. But at times it's
keep it simple and give Brittney the ball. They do that when it's time to do
that. When it's not time to do that, somebody's going to step up and penetrate
hard to the basket or make a mid‑range jump shot or shoot an open 3.  
So they're very smart. They play around her extremely well. There's not a lot
of possessions where you see Baylor play mindless basketball. They can make it
look easy, but they're making great basketball decisions.  
  
Q. Today maybe didn't go exactly the way you wanted, but was it a successful
trip here? Did you think you got good things out of it?  
COACH PATTERSON: Yeah, I'm really proud of what our team brought to the floor.
I wish late in the first half we'd gotten Jalana more touches. I think we lost
a little bit of focus there. But I think we learned at this tournament the
value of‑‑ and really have the last four games of the season, post touches and
involving our posts a lot.  
I think Brittany Chambers played terrific for us during the course of this
tournament, when the three was taken away she found ways to distribute the
ball and to get to the rim some. Jalana was tremendous. I thought we competed
extremely hard and back at that competitive level you have to compete at to be
successful.  
So it's a tough matchup for us against Baylor. But I was very, very pleased
with my basketball team the last‑‑ our basketball team the last two days. And
I know we'll continue to get better and we're looking forward to a real strong
competitive showing in the NCAA Tournament.  
  
Q. Coach Mulkey indicated maybe it was a little bit unusual for Griner to
see as much one ‑on‑one defense as she saw early. Is rebounding part of the
thinking how you defended her?  
COACH PATTERSON: The last two games we've played them we tried to jump, tried
zone. Tried to show two at them the last two games. And just got our lunch
handed to us, and didn't board the ball at all. And Griner ends up with 28,
but everyone else ends up with deep double figures, and our thought was, well,
let's do the best we can to push her out. Let's be accountable on our rebound
numbers.  
And I thought the first half we did a really good job of that. I thought the
first half swung not so much somebody's going to score for Baylor.  
I thought the first half swung with Baylor's defense. It wasn't really about
them scoring the ball as much as it was us not scoring the ball.  
So I guess it's all in how you watch and look at the game. The simple thing to
see is Griner scoring points. And I know it's simple to say K‑State had
another empty trip. But the reality is if we're matching trip for trip, if
we're shooting better than 27percent from the floor in the first half, then
maybe things look a whole lot different than they might have.  
So I thought the first half was more about our lack of aggressiveness and we
kind of got away from distributing the ball inside. Probably the last 10 or
12minutes of the first half.  
  
Q. This is the end of a long run for you. You have 18 regular season games
against the Big 12. You have two here in the tournament. So 20 games against
the best conference in America. Do you like where your team is at as far as
preparation for the NCAA Tournament, or do you think they're playing kind of
their best basketball right now as you prepare for the tournament?  
COACH PATTERSON: I love where our team is at right now. If you had asked me
that about ten days ago I would have really been in a panic mode. But I love
how they rose up and competed so well and so hard and so true too. I think
what's made them successful all season long.  
This team has been very tough minded. We've had a couple of lulls along the
route late in the season. But I think that's a reflection of the challenge of
competing in this league when you're a relatively‑‑ we're not extremely deep.
We are what we are. And that double roundrobin in America's toughest league,
where two of your losses are going to be against No.1 in the country, and
where you're lining up against the defending national champions, it's brutal.  
So I was really pleased with how hard we fought, with the new freshness in our
disposition and our approach to the postseason, and I really am looking
forward to us playing extremely well in the NCAA Tournament. I feel good about
where our team is at.  
  
Q. What are your expectations for Monday? Have you spent any time looking
into the seedings, where you might be?  
COACH PATTERSON: No, I'm so odd that way. I just don't even remotely look at
that. I think about it in terms of getting into the tournament. But I don't
take it any further than that. And I know what we get we'll get. And I'm
hopeful that after playing the RPI and the strength of schedule that we did,
which was astronomical, that we'll get a good seed.  
I think we're very deserving of it and have completed the kind of season that
the NCAA committee says secures you a bid and a strong quality seed.  
If there's anything else we could have done, I don't know what it could be. I
know wins are big but we competed our tail off all season long. So I'm hopeful
for a real good quality seed and then you gotta line up and play it the seed
isn't going to matter once the 40minutes starts. It's about how you play. So
let's hope for good things on Monday.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Texas A&M  79  
Oklahoma  66

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined now by Texas A&M.  
Coach your opening thoughts.  
COACH BLAIR: First another big ballgame for Big 12 and for the nation to watch
it. You saw some very, very good guard play on both teams early in the
ballgame.  
Whitney Hand is just a load. She's such a good player and such a smart player.
And she's got the whole game. But we're so proud of my team. Again, we were
without Tyra White, and we used that 12th man thing; who is going to step up
and be the 12th man for us this time.  
Tonight it was a little bit of everything. Collins had to go in. She had the
hard task the majority of the time guarding Hand. But Hand had the task of
guarding her, too.  
And that was a career high for Skylar. She did a heck of a job hitting those
big 3s in that left corner. But she's been waiting her turn patiently.  
A lot of times seniors, when they never become starters, their lip hits the
ground and they're never able to do it.  
Skylar, what was the statement above the dressing room door that I had you
read out?  
SKYLAR COLLINS: It was a quote by Serena Williams and it said: Luck has
nothing to do with it.  
Because of the many, many hours, the countless hours that I've put in to get
to this moment.  
COACH BLAIR: To be able to seize the moment and get the moment. It was right
above our board there, Serena Williams' comment.  
And she's waited patiently. Graduated three years, been working on her
master's. It was her time. Tomorrow it might be somebody else. Look at what
Bellock did on the offensive boards in the second half. Every time they had a
chance to come back, she cleaned them up. Look at what Bone did in the second
half after‑‑ she's got teammates to thank and to rest her. Karla played very
well in there and Cierra did as well.  
But, again, I'm getting good point guard play. When you get good point guard
play and she plays with a confidence, they were not leaving her as many open
looks, because we shot them out of the zone early that they were in and, I
think, we executed 4 out of 5 possessions against a zone and they had to go
back to man, and I thought we were very patient.  
Really didn't turn the ball over until the end. But I don't know what we have
left for tomorrow. But we're going to leave this Big 12 conference as
champions, whether we're defending champions or whether we're competing for a
championship, and that's the message I'm going to give to my kids tomorrow to
play, because I believe we are champions.  
And I'm pleased with the effort and how hard we played. I was pleased with how
hard Oklahoma played. We always have great games. But, hey, it's yours.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Skylar, comment on your start and how hard it was to get the team rolling
early.  
SKYLAR COLLINS: I wouldn't say my start was too hot. Coach Blair wasn't happy
with me the first couple of minutes in the game, made some stupid mistakes.
Pulled me out pretty quick. When he put me back in, that's when I settled down
and got into the flow of the offense and played hard on the defensive end and
just did whatever the team needed me to do at that point.  
  
Q. Kelsey, can you talk about what was working for you in the second half?  
KELSEY BONE: I just knew that Coach Blair at halftime told me to just attack.
He told me whoever was in front of me, it didn't matter, just attack.  
Maryann was on the bench and she kept staying in my ear, telling me, hey, you
can score. At any time you want, when choose to, you can score.  
So I think I was a lot more aggressive than I've been the past few games. So I
think that aggression just kind of carried over. And if a shot went up and it
didn't go in, I had a teammate to pick it up and get the rebound and put it
back in, and I think that's when we really got rolling.  
  
Q. Kelsey, let's talk about tomorrow. You played against her a lot of times.
Talk about tomorrow, what it would mean to give them an L.  
KELSEY BONE: You know, it's a great rivalry. So anytime we can go up against
them, we're going to have fun with it. It's our last game in the Big 12. It's
our seniors' last game in the Big 12. It's everybody's last game in the Big
12.  
So I think tomorrow's going to be a battle. They're a great team. It would
mean a lot to us to beat them, but we're going to come out and we're going to
have our game plan ready that our coaches are going to give us, and we're
going to execute it to the best of our ability.  
  
Q. Alexia, your role obviously changed today. Could you talk a little bit
about what it was today and what you felt you were able to accomplish?  
ALEXIA STANDISH: I think yesterday the shots were open, and so I got to take
the shots today. The shots weren't really there for me. So I had to play the
point guard role of just being a leader and telling my team what to do and
where to be and just encouraging and being motivating and just getting‑‑ so
that was more my role today in the game.  
  
Q. Skylar, Coach mentioned the corner shots. Looked like you pulled the
trigger really fast. Was that the game plan for you to take that shot, if it
was there, drive, if not, what exactly was it?  
SKYLAR COLLINS: I'm pretty sure that wasn't the game plan at all. I'm pretty
sure when I took that first shot Coach Blair was probably about to lose his
mind until it went through the net, and then he calmed down. So I was feeling
it. I shot it and prayed for the best.  
  
Q. This program is now in its fifth consecutive Big 12 final, which says a
lot about the consistency. Can you just talk about having been part of that,
what has made this program able to reach that height so often?  
SKYLAR COLLINS: Well, Coach Schaefer always preaches to us it's not what we do
but it's how we do it. And this program is built around an aggressive defense
that's going to get out and pressure the ball and deny the wings.  
And I think that makes a lot of teams uncomfortable. And I think that's where
our success has been. And it's always started on the defensive end for us. And
I think that's why we've been able to compete at the levels that we're
competing at.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Tyra for tomorrow, status for tomorrow, was it better today?  
COACH BLAIR: Randy, your story in the paper was great the other day. I
appreciate the time. It was well written. It had some pretty good quotes.  
And she's meant a whole lot to Kansas City basketball, along with Tanisha and
Danielle. But what Tyra White has done has been very special. She's going to
be a winner whether she plays or not.  
We'll have to see once we put it‑‑ put the tennis shoe on. This morning it was
hurting too bad. It was still too much pain. And why risk an NCAA
championship?  
And our bench is stepping up. Opportunity comes. And I'm just proud of my
team. I'm proud of my coaching staff. I'd love for her to play, but unless she
looks better, we will not use our shootaround in the morning since we're
playing breakfast at Wimbledon or whatever we're doing here tomorrow.  
But it's going to be a late night for coaches and early morning for our team,
because when you have to do pregame at seven in the morning, that's not great
right there.  
So I don't know. Tell you the truth, I do not know.  
  
Q. Gary, what you were able to do on defense, at halftime you had an 11 ‑2
edge on points off turnovers. Could you talk a little bit about what you were
able to do in defense to slow everything down.   
COACH BLAIR: I think Coach Schaefer got into them about the responsibility
that they had. When we switched to zone for a few possessions, they missed
about three 3s that they normally hit. That gave us confidence. And then we
converted on the other end, and sometimes that's what happens, but they hit 3,
White open 3s that all three of them missed.  
And we tried to mix and match, because my lineup, we were going in and out. We
were just trying to play who was hot. But other than that, when you play a
tournament like this, you cannot press. We wouldn't have anything left for
whatever.  
I think we pressed in about three possessions totally ineffective. But Coach
Schaefer, Just do your job, and that's what he preaches to the kids.  
Skylar, quit being beat by Hand as much as she was in the first half. We place
a great help in defense. But when they penetrate and drive, they're not
looking to score, they're looking to throw the 3 ball. And that's what they
were so good at in the first half. And I think they still 6 out of 17. I'd
love to get to the Final Four by giving up the most 3s in the history of
basketball. And we've given them up this year.  
  
Q. Could you talk about what your thoughts were after the first seven
seconds of the game?  
COACH BLAIR: Here it comes again. Somebody got beat on penetration. I'm not
sure who it was. I thought it was Carter. But she's not admitting to it.  
So somebody got beat. Bone tried to take the charge. And she's not Meesha
(phonetic) in there that took a lot of charges. But that's how we operate. We
protect the basket.  
And I do not mind that foul as much as I allow the penetration. The second
foul, by offensive foul, I thought it was a flop. But D thought it was a
different way.  
And she sold it very well, and give her credit. We had a Final
Four‑officiating crew. Probably between the three of them, I know Scott said
15, D said about 15, and Lisa's had about 12. So think of how many Final Fours
they've had.  
That was probably the best crew you could possibly have. So I didn't have a
problem at all really with the second foul except that I thought she flopped
it a little.  
  
Q. I think you've eliminated the Sooners four straight years in the
tournament. Why do you think you have such success? Two of those teams went on
to the Final Four. Why do you think you had such success against them?  
COACH BLAIR: The respect I have for Oklahoma, the respect I have for Sherri,
the athletes she recruits. I get up for playing Sherri and Oklahoma. That's
going to be one of the rivalries that I'll miss more than anything in the Big
12 is going against Sherri.  
I mean, my God, she outdresses me every time. She looks better than I ever
have, and she's got Whitney Hand over there. Everything about Oklahoma I like.
And I'm tired of them coming down taking all our football players away, okay?
They need to stay across that border.  
No, Oklahoma plays a wide‑open offensive game. Okay? They're known for their
offense. They're known for their 3s in transition. They're known for their
quick hitters that they do. Their double screens. I thought we did a decent
job on Ellenberg tonight. She hit 5 out of 11. But sometimes that kid can go
off for 30 in a minute.  
But Karla was on her. So whatever she earns, Carter is always going to be on
the other team's best player.  
  
Q. You had some struggles for most of the year shooting the outside jumper,
and even free throw issues throughout the season. What's it been ‑‑ what's
been the difference in postseason play for this group?  
COACH BLAIR: More confidence. We're starting to execute better. We're starting
to get more wide‑open looks instead of contesting. It's taken a while for our
post players to become better screeners.  
We're still not perfect in that. But if we have a screening offense‑‑ we won a
national championship with that same offense. And it's taken my point guards a
little bit longer to get into the timing, to be able to pocket pass, to be
able to‑‑ when we run that 2‑3 play, for Carter to come screaming off of there
and have the dump‑in to Jelena or something, it just takes time.  
We've now shot five straight games, correct me if I'm wrong, 46percent or
better, I think in five straight ballgames. And that's how we finished the
last year shooting the ball that good, because you know defensively we're not
as good as what we were last year, but offensively we're not as good as we
were last year, but we're pretty damn good with what we do have.  
  
Q. How much fun is it that it's Baylor again? And I'm sure you have a plan
now to stop Brittney Griner, right?  
COACH BLAIR: I remember Jody Conradt's best compliment that she gave us when
she had to go against our defense. Her last year she said she'd rather go to
the dentist and have a root canal. And I thought that was a great compliment
to what we did defensively.  
She was as good today as I've ever seen her. The 15‑footers were just money in
the bank. It was just like Hakeem or Wilt shooting over everybody, because you
cannot get up there with her. But do you see how hard she moves without the
ball? I've never seen a kid that can play 40minutes and not sweat.  
And she doesn't sweat. She just plays hard. She's good for our game. What are
we going to do? The last time we played her pretty good. It depends on how
long our post players can stay in there, and it also depends on how the game
is going to be called.  
Are they going to let us bump and grind a little bit, because it's a
championship game, are they going to call the nitty‑picky things. But what
we've got to do, we've got to earn our fouls. You have to earn them.  
Don't help them out by making any cheap fouls. You cannot forget about
Odyssey, and Destiny Williams is probably the best offensive rebounder in this
game, because all she has to do is go to the boards every time Brittney
shoots. And usually she takes it out of the net.  
But she's a great offensive rebounder. We've got to free our shooters up.
Hayden and Madden do not get the credit that they should get, because they're
taller wings. They're 5'11'', 6', and it's hard for us to get Carter and
Standish open against them.  
I'm more worried about us scoring against Baylor right now. Okay? I'm more
worried about us scoring. We've gotta do a good job like we did at our place
about a week ago.  
So let's think about Oklahoma right now, that it's going to be a long night.
Breakfast with us tomorrow. Y'all come. Randy? This is the way it should end.
The two top teams should be playing each other, and this is the way it should
end.  
And I think the committee will finally agree that these two teams should not
have to be in the same region.  
Last year it worked to our advantage. This year I would rather go see Colson
in Poland than go to Baylor's region again.  
But tomorrow we're looking forward to the opportunity. We're on house money
now; let's just play relaxed and go and see who can come off my bench and be
the next star.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Baylor 72  
Texas Tech 48

  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by the Baylor Bears, who have arranged
everything up here. Coach, your thoughts, and then we'll take questions for
the student‑athletes.  
COACH MULKEY: I don't have any.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll go straight to the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. After that very first media time ‑out of the game, you guys came out, got
like a shot clock violation on defense, came down, scored real quick. You were
kind of off and running after that. Talk about how your defense creates
offense for you.   
ODYSSEY SIMS: Just from the finish, we were going into the game knowing that
they were going to be physical. I think coach did a very good job of not
preparing us for it. We didn't take any team lightly. Can't second guess
ourselves. Thought that we did a great job. We knew that they were going to
drive and take the hit. So we did our best to stop that and get on the
shooters.  
  
Q. Brittney and Odyssey, did you sneak a little peek at K ‑State and Iowa
State today? You handled K‑State pretty well the first two meetings. Jalana
Childs had quite a game. Could you talk about either playing them before or
what you look forward to tomorrow?   
BRITTNEY GRINER: I caught the last eight seconds of the game, but K‑State,
they've got great players, and they're well‑coached. It will be a good game.
It's always tough playing a team three times, but we'll do it. We'll get in
film, see what we did wrong in the film and just try to correct it and go out
and play hard.  
  
Q. Odyssey, what do you know about Kansas State?  
ODYSSEY SIMS: They're a very well‑coached team. Got to get on the shooters.
Can't have too much help side and keep them in front.  
  
Q. Brittney, you mentioned how tough it is playing a team three times. Texas
played you guys so close the first two times. The third time obviously wasn't
a problem for you guys. Why was this time easier than the other two?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: I don't know how many threes they shot, but I know it wasn't
too many. I just felt like we were really able to come out and play today. I'm
just glad we got the win. My team is very special.  
  
Q. Odyssey, it seemed like your shot has struggled a little bit lately. You
had a rough night. Talk about what was different tonight and had you been in
the gym taking extra shots?  
ODYSSEY SIMS: I guess I was just coming back slowly. I've been in a little
shooting slump lately. I've been in the gym shooting before and after
practice. Just you never know when you'll be in a position to hit the game
winner, or I just shot the ball well. That's all I can do.  
  
Q. Brittney, you had 15 points and then took a seat with about 10 minutes to
go.  
COACH MULKEY: 11:18.  
  
Q. I apologize.  
COACH MULKEY: That minute matters.  
  
Q. Everybody who checked into the game for Baylor had a bucket. How nice was
it to get an early breather and then watch everybody get out on the floor?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: It was great. This program is way more than me. They always
say Brittney Griner and Baylor, but I can't do it myself. On nights when I'm
not shooting that well or my team, we still have everybody that can attack and
score. So you can stop me, but you got to stop everybody else on our team too.
I love being able to sit on the bench and just watch my team play and execute
and keep playing.  
  
Q. Brittney, kind of continuing that theme late in the first half, Makenzie
gets a three, and then Ashley banks one in at the buzzer. How nice was that to
see those two have a big moment like that?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: It was great. Makenzie shot, and then Ashley's shot‑‑ after
Ashley's shot, everybody running on the court, it was like a buzzer beater. It
was good. It was just really‑‑ it was really nice being there, watching our
team, and everybody on the bench jumping up and celebrating.  
THE MODERATOR: Any more questions for our student‑athletes before we turn them
loose? Okay, ladies. We'll let you go back to the locker room. Thank you very
much. Congratulations on your win. We'll take questions for coach now.  
  
Q. Kim, did you feel like your defense was pretty special today?  
COACH MULKEY: I did. I thought that we were very aggressive. I thought we
picked up too many fouls, had to sit players. At the same time, those players
going to the bench gave other players opportunities. With me not playing
Brooklyn today, it gave Ashley an opportunity, and you like to see seniors do
well, and you like to see your own kid do well. So I was a happy momma at
halftime.  
  
Q. You mentioned not playing Brooklyn. Is she injured?  
COACH MULKEY: No, she's not injured.  
  
Q. Coach, did Tech do anything different offensively?  
COACH MULKEY: They tried to do the same stuff they'd done the previous two
games we played, but the difference is they didn't make threes. When you
spread the floor and go to a nontraditional type of offense to attack Griner
or to keep Griner from being effective on the defensive end, you have to get
away and deviate from what you normally do. Well, that's good if you're
successful at making threes.  
But I thought we were out there and didn't give them many open looks for
threes. 3 for 14, it was pretty good. And to hold somebody at 18 percent, or
18.5 percent shooting in the first half, you're guarding people.  
  
Q. Kim, even if it's not three ‑pointers, how important is it for Odyssey to
shoot like that and give you an outside presence?   
COACH MULKEY: It is. Odyssey can shoot. Odyssey is really trying to be too
generous, I guess, in passing the ball around, and she's passed up a lot of
good shots. Odyssey can shoot the ball. She just‑‑ any time she wants to, she
can light it up. But I think she's trying to develop more of her game on
passing the ball and finding the open player.  
  
Q. I know you sneaked a peek at the first game.  
COACH MULKEY: No, I really didn't except for about the last three minutes. So
if it was something in the last three minutes, I may can answer.  
  
Q. You beat Kansas State twice by 30 points. They snapped their losing
streak today. Just in those three minutes, what did you see? How do you see
tomorrow?  
COACH MULKEY: Well, those last three minutes, I really was trying to pay
attention to both teams because I wasn't sure who was going to win.  
I noticed Childs was very, very good those last three minutes. And Chambers
getting to the foul line. You want the ball in her hands when the game's on
the line. But details, other than what I already know from having played them
twice, I probably couldn't talk much about the game because I didn't get‑‑  
  
Q. Tell me what you know about them.  
COACH MULKEY: I know that you'd better defend them on the perimeter. Don't
leave them open. I know that their post players don't shoot threes. So to me,
that's to our advantage defensively in allowing Griner to roam and help
teammates.  
But I also know they have two people on the all conference team, and we did
too. So they're pretty darn good.  
  
Q. Did you think B.G. was going to dunk one there?  
COACH MULKEY: Yes, I did. I sure did. I thought she was going up to lay it
down. I think everybody in the stands did. Her mannerisms let you know that
she meant business right there.  
  
Q. Brittney almost led you in assists. I think at one point she was leading
you. Is that a part of her game maybe that's developed more than maybe even
some of the other parts?  
COACH MULKEY: Well, it is. She used to have way too many turnovers when she
was a freshman, and really about half of her sophomore year because she was
seeing a different level of play. She's probably seen double and triple‑teams
in high school but not at this level. And I think that Brittney Griner makes
everybody better.  
What you saw happen today, Tech did a very good job defensively of eliminating
or kind of keeping her from having as many touches as she normally would. Now,
four of those were turnovers by her. So credit Tech a little bit, but what
Brittney did, because Brittney Griner has to touch the ball, she makes
everybody else score.  
And that's the X‑factor or whatever you get with Griner. Just the other night
she breaks her scoring record because they guarded her one on one. Take what
the defense gives you. If the defense is not going to let Griner get many
touches, then the rest of you should lick your chops because you're going to
score tonight. If the defense is going to guard Griner one on one, then we're
going to keep throwing it in there to her.  
We've learned to take what we're being given.  
  
Q. Kim, the previous two meetings Tech kept these games close against you
guys. Other than the three ‑point shooting, what else contributed to you guys
blowing them out today?   
COACH MULKEY: I think we kept them from gaining momentum. They were 6 for 8 at
our place on threes. I tend to think we played pretty good defense. Sometimes
you need to just give them credit. I thought they shot the ball from the three
extremely well the last two games, and I didn't think they did so today. I'd
like to take credit for that and say our defense was better, but I don't think
our defense was all that bad in the last two games. I think they just made
shots, and today they didn't.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much. We'll see you tomorrow afternoon.
Congratulations.

## March 8, 2012

  

### [Angel Goodrich](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21852)

### [Bonnie Henrickson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13895)

### [Aishah Sutherland](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23376)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Texas A&M 78  
Kansas 63

  
THE MODERATOR: The Kansas Jayhawks have now joined us. Coach, your thoughts on
this evening's game.  
COACH HENRICKSON: I thought in the first half, we both battled and both made
runs and both trying to limit runs and answer runs of our own. They make the
run coming out of the locker room, start in the zone and go to the man and
just rip and drive and get to the rim and trying to change up defenses.  
Standish got good looks off all those makes are uncontested. That's a
breakdown in our part. Three of those against man and three of those against
zone.  
I thought our kids came out and battled, and I thought the two right here
played with great energy and great pace. Just disappointed we didn't get it
done.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for our student‑athletes first, and we'll send them
back to the locker room.  
  
Q. Angel, I just wondered what it was like at halftime kind of down two and
what happened when they went on that run to put it away.  
ANGEL GOODRICH: Our mindset is always go in and attack first. When they
attacked us, we didn't answer back. In this league, you have to get an answer.  
  
Q. Aishah, how frustrating is it for you guys now that they're leaving the
conference? Is that a frustration for you at all because you've faced a lot of
good teams with A &M and stuff like that?   
AISHAH SUTHERLAND: It is frustrating, but we have to just pick it up and beat
the next team.  
  
Q. Angel, you and Sydney Carter have had really great matchups this year in
the three games. What makes that matchup so good?  
ANGEL GOODRICH: Well, we're both quick, and she's got a really quick shot.
She's balanced on defense, and she gets into like the game. I mean, it's a
great challenge between the both of us. It's just who answers back. Once
someone answers, how are you going to respond?  
  
Q. What were your thoughts when you saw that Tyra White wasn't going to
play? I mean, you're without somebody pretty good too. Did you think, well,
that evens the score? What were your thoughts knowing she wasn't going to be
in?  
ANGEL GOODRICH: At first, I didn't see her until when we were shooting free
throws, and I was a little bit surprised. She's a great player. I don't know
what's wrong with her, but I hope she gets better.  
  
Q. Angel, you've been here for quite a few times when you've watched the
selection show. What do you think Sunday will be like?  
ANGEL GOODRICH: I'm not sure what it will be like, but I feel like we deserve
to go to the tournament. We're in one of the toughest leagues in the country.
We went 8‑10\. I feel like we built our resume pretty strong. I feel like we
deserved it, though.  
  
Q. When Coach Blair was in here, he made a comment how he wants to lobby to
get you guys in the tournament. What is that recognition for you guys?
Especially after a hard ‑fought game like this.   
ANGEL GOODRICH: I mean, it just shows that other people see how great we are.
It's good. It's good that he can do that for us.  
AISHAH SUTHERLAND: Just like she said. He's a great coach, and he's been in
this for a while.  
  
Q. Both you guys, can you just talk about how hard it might be to wait until
Monday night to find out? That's got to be the hardest part right now, I'm
sure.  
ANGEL GOODRICH: It's going to be hard, but we're going to wait and cross our
fingers.  
AISHAH SUTHERLAND: It's going to be a long three, four days to wait.  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, good luck. Hope the selection comes through. Now we'll
take questions for coach.  
  
Q. Bonnie, can you just talk about the difference in the second half?
Obviously, you showed you can compete with these guys, and then they got
away.  
COACH HENRICKSON: Right. We talked about it at halftime, and we call a
time‑out at the beginning of the second half but it wasn't‑‑ we said at the
half. It wasn't what we're running. It's how aggressive we run, what we're
running. I thought we got sloppy the last two or three minutes of the first
half. We wasted possession, give them good looks, turn the ball over and don't
capitalize on some opportunities on offensive end.  
Coming out of the locker room, we talked about it again. We went zone, they
score. We went back to man. As soon as we got to man, they ripped and drove it
and got to the rim. We didn't contain. I said on the time‑out, that's what we
talked about in the locker room. I was talking about this. If it's a busted
play, get in and be aggressive. Our ball screen offense has been pretty good
for us down the stretch.  
Now we're looking at them. It's not how they're running, it's how aggressive
they're running what they're running. We wanted to force twos and layups
coming out of the locker room. And while they're growing the lead, we're
struggling to score and getting in low clock situations and missed
opportunities on the other end. It's every other possession by them. And throw
in an uncontested three by Standish, and we break down defensively.  
  
Q. Bonnie, Angel had a lot of big plays today. We've gotten used to that all
year. How much is she the heart of this team?  
COACH HENRICKSON: She does for us what Carter does for them and did for them
and certainly on both ends of the floor. She carries us defensively on that
end of the ball and a great communicator on the offensive end. We ask a lot of
her, make shots, make plays. If you look at the percentage of plays and the
offense they're involved in, it's either her or the guy that's scored probably
has just gotten it from her.  
We do ask a great deal from her, but she has stepped up and answered over and
over and over again. We said, you know, you lead, we'll follow. We just
weren't aggressive enough around her.  
I thought Aishah was really, really good in the first half. We got her good
looks. They disrupted in the second half, disrupted us. She didn't get to the
rim as much, didn't get her enough touches in the second half.  
We need some other people to step up and be as aggressive off the dribble and
make plays when the ball got out of Angel's hands, and we didn't do that
enough, obviously.  
  
Q. Bonnie, you said a couple days ago that this was a chance to maybe take
away some of the doubt of where you guys were. I guess where's that level of
doubt now?  
COACH HENRICKSON: Angel said, we're 8‑10, earned a sixth seed and finished
sixth. It wasn't a coin flip. In the tiebreaker, we won the pool. We were 3‑1
in the pool with Texas and Oklahoma State. It wasn't a coin flip we got sixth,
we earned sixth. We finished sixth in the best league in America. Got four top
50 RPI wins and two of those on the road.  
You look at some of the bracketologists that are doing this, and they're
sniffing around at Wake Forest. We beat Wake Forest at Wake Forest. As far as
people they're considering, if we played them, that's only when you look at it
that's in consideration, we beat them on the road.  
It's about have we proven that we can win on the road? Other than Baylor, we
have the best road record in the league. We have the best road record in the
league, and you talk about in the postseason that matters. And a win at
Oklahoma down the stretch. A team that‑‑ two teams beat Oklahoma at Oklahoma
this year, Baylor and us. That should matter down the stretch.  
  
Q. When the committee looks at you, are they going to say you lost Carolyn,
so are you as good a team now as you were earlier?  
COACH HENRICKSON: But we lost to Oklahoma at home with Carolyn. I understand
what you're saying but‑‑  
  
Q. But what about a team that doesn't have a Carolyn Davis?  
COACH HENRICKSON: Absolutely. Take the team who we are right now. Take the
team‑‑ I mean, it's your full body of work. It's not like we haven't done
anything. You know, we beat Texas Tech at home, and she has 35. We go beat
Texas Tech without her, and other kids have stepped up and performed and
performed at a high, high level. I think it's irresponsible to say, well,
could they have won with‑‑ can they win without her? Well, you can do that.
That's not how that should go down the stretch.  
It's their full body of work, and we have won, we have won without her, and we
have been in one‑possession games without her.  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for coach?  
  
Q. Bonnie, you guys have been through a lot this year with everything like
that. How do you think the next couple of days are going to go for you
personally and how you're going to be feeling?  
COACH HENRICKSON: Oh, it will be a lot of fun. Can't wait. We'll take a couple
days off. We'll get back together. We'll probably get in the gym on Sunday and
just get some shots up and get back together and huddle up. Give them a couple
days to catch their breath.  
We all kind of like to be around each other. Seriously. Not that they don't
deserve a day off. Sometimes we'll say, hey, let's get together and watch film
and shoot some free throws. We don't do much. Like stay in their ears and get
a feel for them.  
We'll go Sunday a little bit and practice Monday and watch it together on
Monday. You know, it is what it is. They'll figure out how to occupy
themselves and stay busy. I watch film. That's all I do. I'll watch film.
Thank you.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, hope the bid comes through.  
COACH HENRICKSON: Thank you.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Kansas State 67  
Iowa State 63

  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by Coach Bill Fennelly and his
student‑athletes. Coach, your thoughts on last night's game.  
COACH FENNELLY: First I want to thank the great people of Kansas City for not
just this event but all the years they've hosted this tournament. It's been a
great thing, and they've done a great job of giving our student‑athletes a
tremendous experience. We'll miss coming here.  
We certainly want to thank the Big 12 for running a great event. The
tournament is an end‑of‑the‑year celebration of great basketball.  
As far as the game today goes, it's pretty simple. We got our butts kicked in
the post. And that's the game. We can analyze it all we want, but at the end
of the day, their inside game just had their way with us. When Chelsea Poppens
got in foul trouble, the game completely changed for us. K‑State played great.
They're very well coached, do a super job.  
Jalana Childs was a First Team All Conference player for a reason, and we
congratulate them. We move on maybe.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you. Questions for our student‑athletes.  
  
Q. You guys got up early, like 12 ‑2, making shots. What do you think
changed at that point a little bit?   
THE MODERATOR: Who do you want to answer that?  
  
Q. Lauren.  
LAUREN MANSFIELD: I felt we came out really hot and ready to go. We were
really pushing it and hitting shots. I think they just didn't back down. They
fought back and got themselves back into the game.  
  
Q. For Nikki, when you guys put that mini run on them, go up 54 ‑50,
everyone's pumped. Did you guys feel that, okay, now we're taking control and
this is the point that we're going to kind of beat this and peel it off?   
NIKKI MOODY: Whenever we got going, the crowd got into it. We started getting
energy and getting more like pumped up to win, and they just kept fighting
back.  
  
Q. Lauren, did you come into this game thinking you're a senior and that you
had to step up, or was it more of a deal where shots just started to fall and
before you know it, you had double points?  
LAUREN MANSFIELD: I think I definitely feel like time is running out to me. So
I'm going to be more aggressive. I mean, I know any game could be my last, so
I'm just trying to take that and play with it. And definitely when shots are
falling, I was feeling good as well.  
  
Q. For Lauren, I believe it was you, I was kind of blocked out, but did you
take that shot in the corner, that free corner that was banked off the left
board and rimmed in? What was your thought? Did you think that thing was in?
It was an off ‑balance shot.   
LAUREN MANSFIELD: To be honest, I didn't because it was kind of just a shot
that I had to take and just throw up there. So, yeah, I was off balance. I
didn't really think it was going in.  
  
Q. This is for Lauren. What do you think was the key in being able to come
back every time that they were ‑‑ they'd go up, you guys would go up. Lastly,
what was the main thing on why you guys weren't able to close it out at the
end there?   
LAUREN MANSFIELD: I think for us the whole game the key was kind of open. So
we had to attack off the dribble. I know Nikki was doing that, and that kind
of helped us bring it back there.  
And then just credit to them. They made big plays and made big shots and
rebounds, and they fought for it.  
  
Q. Nikki, Lauren kind of alluded to it, but you were attacking off the
dribble, going to the basket, and the posts were obviously struggling a little
bit. Is that a product ‑‑ did you want to do that coming into today? Or is
that a product as the game went on to start attacking the basket?   
NIKKI MOODY: We knew they were going to front our post. We knew we couldn't
get help‑side defense that quick. So we knew attacking would be the best way
to try to get points.  
THE MODERATOR: Any further questions for our student‑athletes? Okay, ladies.
Thank you very much. We'll let your coach stay for a few more minutes.  
  
Q. Bill, two ‑parter. One, Childs has had some pretty good games against you
before. So it wasn't a shock. Just kind of talk about the way she took it to
you both offensively and defensively. And then secondly, I won't say how do
you like the chances? You think they can give Baylor a run tomorrow, assuming
it's Baylor?   
COACH FENNELLY: As far as Childs goes, she's a First Team All‑Conference
player. Last time we played them‑‑ the last two times we guarded her much
better. She didn't play nearly as well as she played today. That's why she's
an all conference senior. She played a great game.  
As far as tomorrow, I don't know. I don't know what will happen. Whoever wins,
obviously, Texas Tech is a team that plays Baylor very well. That's Coach
Patterson's problem now, not mine.  
  
Q. Considering how things went between K ‑State and Iowa State in the game
in Hilton about a week ago, did you feel like perhaps overconfidence was a
factor today, or was your team not as prepared as what you normally expect
them to be for a game like this?   
COACH FENNELLY: Absolutely not.  
  
Q. Coach, not to look too far ahead, it was talked about on Monday just how
anxious you are this time of year, and now you're looking forward to all this
time between now and selection Monday. Can you put into words, A, how you feel
about these two teams that just played today and also how it's going to be
like for you in that intervening period?  
COACH FENNELLY: As far as the teams today, I don't think there's any question
that Kansas State is a team that deserves to be in the NCAA Tournament.
They're a very good team. All the numbers are good. To finish fifth in this
league says a lot.  
As far as our team, I don't know. Yeah, you want to think that you've done
enough, and I'm not trying to avoid the question. I just‑‑ I don't feel
comfortable. The committee does a phenomenal job. If we've done the things
that I think we've done with our schedule in our league, then they'll put us
in. If not, they won't. We'll live with that judgment, and I will be‑‑ I will
tell you, I'll be by myself a lot till Monday night because no one will want
to be around me. Wait until 6:00 on Monday night.  
I don't know. I hope it happens. I think‑‑ again, I hope it happens. We'll see
what happens. Sorry. Not a very good answer to a very simple question.  
  
Q. Coach, Chelsea Poppens got in foul trouble. Do you think that's a product
of how she's been playing, or is this an off night for her? I know she's been
consistent for you.  
COACH FENNELLY: When she got in foul trouble, the game changed. The two fouls
she got were‑‑ she ran a kid over that stepped in front of her, and she
reached in on a rebound. You can't do that. You can't make those plays. Our
first team all conference player sits a lot on the bench. And their first team
all conference player changed the game. When we went to the bench, we got
nothing.  
We're not a very deep team anyway. So when your best player sits a lot, it's
very hard. So that was a big part of the game, no question.  
  
Q. Coach, talk a little bit about how Nikki and Lauren were able to keep you
guys in the game. 42 points combined. There hasn't been a game this season
where they've both been that effective.  
COACH FENNELLY: I thought our guard play was maybe the best it's been
collectively all year. Anna had to chase Brittany Chambers all over the
building. Lauren and Nikki got us shots. We could not have asked for a whole
lot more from those three. They did everything that we talked about. Nikki was
aggressive with the ball. Lauren was‑‑ we asked Lauren to hunt her shot a
little bit. She did. I thought they played very, very well, all three of them.  
  
Q. Go back to the beginning of the season, Bill, 0 ‑5 to now. Just
capitalize a few areas where you guys made the greatest improvement.   
COACH FENNELLY: Randy, number one, for any team in this league to be 0‑5 and
then be where they are today says a lot about the kids on our team and then my
staff. I told our players, when we were 0‑5, we had a meeting, no big
clubhouse meeting or anything like that. I just said, we're going to finish
things the right way no matter what. That's the way we do things.  
I asked them to understand that. I think we evolved and got better
offensively. We've always been solid on defense. Offensively, we were a lot
better. To be honest with you, the schedule turned a little. We had a monster
first five games. We competed in most of them.  
But to end up the fourth seeded team in this league after that was quite an
accomplishment for them, and I think it's something that down the road
they'll‑‑ if we're fortunate enough to make the tournament, we'd be the first
0‑5 team to ever do it. When it happens, most people don't recover. But most
people don't wear an Iowa State uniform either. Very proud of that fact.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Oklahoma 70  
Missouri 59

  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by the Missouri Tigers. Coach, your thoughts
about tonight's game.  
COACH PINGETON: I think the last game of the season is always tough. Your
heart just hurts for your seniors. But I thought, you know, we competed hard.
Certainly had our fair share of breakdowns. But I don't know that now is the
time to focus on that.  
Just really proud of our seniors. I'm proud of our team, the resiliency
they've continued to show all year long, the fight, the energy, the
togetherness. And I'm really proud of them. We're certainly going to miss our
seniors, though.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student‑athletes and then let them
go back to the locker room, and we'll keep Coach.  
  
Q. For Christine and Morgan, what did you guys kind of think was the
difference in the second half? Do you think it was running out of gas and
playing back ‑to‑back days or maybe tightening up from having a lead, playing
not to lose, a combination of both? What do you think kind of changed for you
guys?   
CHRISTINE FLORES: I think it was a combination between us letting up a little
bit and not going straight at them like we needed to. And on top of‑‑ I mean,
their shots were going down. We weren't guarding them as hard as we needed to.
We know they're good outside shooter. They're a great team. When we have a
lead like that, we've got to keep pushing, and we didn't. We let up for a
little while, and that's what really hurt us.  
MORGAN EYE: Oklahoma's a really good team, and they're really good when they
get on a run, and it's hard to stop that. They went on a little bit of a run,
and it's hard to get some momentum.  
  
Q. Christine and Morgan, did you guys not want that first half to end? If
you could have just played 40 straight, would it be different?  
CHRISTINE FLORES: Basically. I mean, we were playing together. We were
rebounding. We were boxing out. Everything was just going the right way. It
felt like we were all in the same group the first half. So I certainly would
have rather had it that way with the first half just kept going. We just had
that spark to us, that spark.  
MORGAN EYE: I absolutely agree. Sometimes I wish we wouldn't have to have
halftime, just go ahead and play through it.  
COACH PINGETON: I hope that means you don't like my halftime talks.  
MORGAN EYE: No, they're great.  
  
Q. Christine, Coach was talking about how she hurt for the seniors and that
she's going to miss you. Could you just talk about what it's been like for you
these four years being part of this program and what's going to be the most to
you?  
CHRISTINE FLORES: These four years, I wouldn't trade them for the world.
They've been amazing. When Coach P came in the coaching transition, it fit
perfectly. She came in and kind of just whipped me into shape. She turned
around my whole entire life. It wasn't just basketball she turned around. I
couldn't have asked for more. She's only made me a better player and person.  
But the thing that I think I'm going to miss the most is just being around
this tight‑knit family that we have. Mizzou, when she came in, she grabbed us,
she told us we're going to be one family, we're going to do things the right
way, and we're going to go out there, and we're going to do the things that we
need to do the right way.  
Just having that family that you can turn to at any moment at any time, the
coaching staff along with the players, that's something that you can't
replace. That's something that stays with you for the rest of your life.  
  
Q. I want to follow up on that conversation with Morgan. I've done this for
a while. I've seen a whole lot of coaching changes. Every single one of them
says we're going to come in and make this team a family, and we're going to be
all close knit, and sometimes it works out, sometimes it doesn't work out. How
key to how well this process did work were your seniors this year? Because I
know how hard Robin talked about this and tried to get it going, but that's
got to come from within, doesn't it?  
MORGAN EYE: Oh, yeah, it's so important for us to be a close team. That comes
on and off the floor. When we're able to be so close together and hang out,
even when it's away from basketball, we get to show each other so much better.
You can see that carry over onto the court. Our team is really close. I think
people see that in how we play and everything. When we're able to just kind of
get to know each other even more, we're able to read each other better. So
it's absolutely so important for us to be a close‑knit family.  
THE MODERATOR: Anything further for our student‑athletes? We're going to let
you go back to the locker room and keep Coach for a few more minutes. Take the
first question.  
  
Q. Robin, in looking at stats, one of the real differences is just the
number of free throws that were taken, and you guys seemed to be looking for
threes. Obviously, when threes are falling, you want to keep shooting those.
There seemed to be less of an aggressiveness on offense, and it looked to me
like it dropped to a degree after BreAnna got her third and a whole bunch more
after she got her fourth. Can you talk a bit about how much the offense and
the aggressiveness of it dropped off when you lost her?  
COACH PINGETON: I just think Bree has done such a tremendous job being a
presence on the inside. She's a strong, athletic kid and just had the ability
to really spread out in there. Christine, on the other hand, is more of a
finesse player, and she has that ability to, but she floats a little bit on
the perimeter.  
When we lost that with Bree, the aggressiveness, because of foul trouble, I
agree with you. I think it did‑‑ we weren't nearly as aggressive. I didn't
think our perimeter kids attacked the zone the way that, you know, we have
seen them attack it before in practice.  
I thought we were a little hesitant. We weren't getting to the gaps. But the
bottom line is for us to have a chance, we're not good enough that we can have
two or three players having good nights. We've got to be 100 percent engaged
from top to bottom, 1 through 12.  
I just sensed a little bit different tonight than I did yesterday. And, again,
I thought our kids played hard. We just didn't maybe maintain that edge that
we had last night. And, again, give Oklahoma a ton of credit. They've got some
tremendous players. I think Mo hit the nail on the head when she talked about
their runs, their momentum.  
So certainly some things on our end. Way too many turnovers, way too many
second shot opportunities. We had a couple of breakdowns defensively. So a lot
of things on us, but I think at some point you've just got to give credit to
the other team too.  
Sherri does a tremendous job. They've got a great program, and they've got
some very talented players.  
  
Q. Last night Christine and Bree had talked about the team getting a little
bit lackadaisical after you got that big lead against Oklahoma State. Did you
sense any of that happen tonight, or did you feel like the girls stayed
focused most of the way?  
COACH PINGETON: I didn't really‑‑ I don't think it was the same situation it
was last night. I certainly‑‑ I didn't sense it. They might tell you
differently, but I did not sense that at all.  
I just felt like it was a combination of things. We had some careless
turnovers. We started the second half, BreAnna Brock had a nice strong take,
and we had a turnover in transition, actually, two turnovers in transition. We
sub in, and we've got just a no look, errant pass. We just didn't value the
ball at the level that we needed to.  
And part of it, yes, it was Oklahoma's defense, but some of those turnovers
were self‑inflicted a little bit. Those are against a team like Oklahoma
that's got so much fire power. It's going to come back to bite you a little
bit.  
So I think it was a combination of a lot of things, but I really don't think
it was looking ahead or losing our focus. I think it was a combination of some
other things, just breakdowns on our end, and Oklahoma upped the ante after
halftime.  
  
Q. Robin, this is a very broad question, but just kind of the emotions in
the locker room afterward, and how will you kind of remember this team this
season?  
COACH PINGETON: I think I'll remember them for their resiliency. Again, I
think we've talked so many times and just so proud of them for just staying
the course. Again, we've had‑‑ our fans have been great. Coaches in this
league have been great. Just the kind e‑mails, text messages, notes, just
complimenting how hard our kids continued to play despite the fact that we
weren't getting the wins on the scoreboard.  
That's a hard, hard thing to do. When you're not coming up with those wins on
the scoreboard, it's hard not to feel sorry for yourself or start to point
fingers or maybe even quit, disengage, and they didn't do that. They didn't do
it all year long. We had some hiccups here and there, but as the season went
on, I thought we got stronger. That's a tough thing to do.  
So I'm really proud of them for that. I think those things that they learned
this year, that's going to carry with them for a long time. Those are life
lessons. They're going to be more successful because of it. Emotions in the
locker room, I think you've got a wide range of emotions. Your seniors are
obviously extremely emotional. You've got your freshmen that are a little
wide‑eyed. It's a long season for freshmen compared to high school. I think
they're just eager.  
I think they're going to miss our seniors, but I think they're also pretty
confident about some positive things to come in the future. They're just so‑‑
they're tireless workers. I'm sure we'll be getting phone calls within the
next day or two, how soon can we start individuals? That's just kind of the
way they are.  
We're absolutely‑‑ our focus right now is making sure our seniors understand
how much we appreciate them and just want to be there for them. And then when
the time is right, we'll exhale a little bit, we'll embrace the opportunities
that we have in front of us for the next season.  
  
Q. Let's talk about futures. You lose so much in play and in leadership with
the three that are going here, and you're going to have Liz and L.P., your
community college transfers, in as seniors next year. But of the people you're
really going to get leadership from, they kind of have been built up through
the program. Talk a bit about how important Sydney's role is going to be on
this team next year and kind of what you're expecting from her. What do you
think needs to change between now and next year for her to be where you need
her to be for this team next year?  
COACH PINGETON: I think there's a lot of question marks and some questions
that need to be answered individually. We're going to continue to make giant
strides with this program. Kyley Simmons will be our leader next year. She'll
be our leader we're really going to lean heavily on for vocal leadership.  
I really like‑‑ I think Mo‑‑ I think this year is a hard year for our
youngsters to really step up in that leadership role, although I think they
did an outstanding job. You're coming in as a freshman and you've got seniors
that are starters for you, you just tread lightly maybe at times. But they
still did a heck of a job.  
Sydney Crafton, I thought typical. We saw some great things yesterday. I
thought maybe that was the best basketball game she'd had all season.
Consistency is the question mark. How much are you going to invest into it?
Emotionally, mentally, physically‑‑ she's got a lot of potential, but there's
a lot of people out there that have got a lot of potential. I guess the big
question mark is how much are you going to invest?  
But I can tell you this, I'm really excited about our returning kids. I'm
excited about our kids coming in. I don't know who it's going to be or how
we're going to replace certain players, but we'll find a way. I think we'll
make some giant strides again next year.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much. Good luck for the rest of the year.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Baylor 72  
Texas Tech 48

  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by Texas Tech Lady Raiders. Coach, your
thoughts about this afternoon's game.  
COACH CURRY: Just credit Baylor. They had an outstanding effort today, in all
facets, were able to get great bench play. On a day like today, you have to
give them credit and take your hat off to them and move forward.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for our student‑athletes first and let
them go back to the locker room.  
  
Q. What was so tough with their defense? What made them so tough to score on
today?  
CASEY MORRIS: It was us not making shots. Credit to Baylor, but we're going to
keep working forward and get in the gym and shoot and get ready in the
off‑season for the next season to come.  
  
Q. What's it going to take, Casey ‑‑ or Monique. Whoever wants to answer.
What's it going to take to beat this? Somebody beat them in the next three
weeks.   
CASEY MORRIS: We should have beat them. We were going to be the ones to beat
them. I don't think they can. It's possible. Like Coach Curry said, they're a
good team. I don't think we doubt ourselves when it comes to beating Baylor.
We had not the best shooting game, but like I said, we're just going to build
off of it, and I think it's possible to beat them as a team.  
MONIQUE SMALLS: That's like the only way you can do it. You need
aggressiveness and pride. Just got to come out thinking you're going to win.
You can't come out there thinking you're just going to lose.  
And I mean you also need to have a good shooting game, good rebounding game,
and this team is beatable. Everybody is beatable.  
  
Q. Mo, can you talk about the season as a whole here? You guys had the two
wins in the last week here. A little momentum. You guys are going to have a
postseason. What's the takeaway of the season? What do you guys want to see
over the next few weeks?  
MONIQUE SMALLS: We took away. We're going to learn, see what we did wrong.
Work on things we need to work on during the week or whatever. And for
postseason, it's the championship. It's not the championship that we wanted,
but it's the championship that right now we're put in, and we're going to try
to get it.  
THE MODERATOR: Anything more for our student‑athletes before we let them
return to the locker room?  
  
Q. Mo, you guys did a pretty good job on Griner overall tonight, it seemed
like, and held her in the first half pretty well. With so many other weapons
that they have, how tough is this team to defend?  
MONIQUE SMALLS: I wouldn't say they're tough to defend. I really feel like we
didn't come out playing as good as we know we should have. But credit to
Baylor. They had a good game. We had a bad shooting half. It happens.  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, thank you very much. Congratulations on a great season.
Best of luck in the postseason. Question for Coach.  
  
Q. Kristy, if you'd talk about that too, what you guys did with Brittney
this game, and how tough it is when Odyssey plays the game she does.  
COACH CURRY: I think it's their supporting cast that makes them the number one
team in the country and a 6'8" anchor inside. They've got a great balance
across the board, and their supporting cast is playing really well.  
We've been fortunate enough to have them miss some shots and do a better job
with making sure that, once she's caught, we didn't allow them to get shots in
the paint, to get shots over the top. Today their supporting cast did a great
job of getting in the heart of the defense.  
I'm sure that's something that they've worked on. You've kind of got to pick
and choose. I don't think you can let her be your entire focal point. You've
got to have great balance not only on the offensive end, but the defensive
end. We just today weren't able to do a good job and find enough spots to pick
and choose where they missed some shots.  
  
Q. You guys were hanging around, 27 ‑16, 3:53 to go in the half, and they go
13‑0, and all of a sudden, it's 40‑16\. Let's just talk about what's going on.
Did they turn it up defensively, or did you guys not execute the way they
wanted?   
COACH CURRY: You've got to come out and make shots and be aggressive. I felt
like we were going east and west and not rim to rim or north to south. Once
again, you have someone bank it in from left court. There's a little luck
involved too.  
Not only were they good today, but they were lucky in some spots, and that's
hard to defend right there.  
  
Q. Kristy, what for you is sort of ‑‑ how do you approach sort of the end of
the season? What's the takeaway for you? Obviously, not where you guys wanted
to be.   
COACH CURRY: Win the next one. As Mo said it, I think she said it best when
you're talking about what to learn in the game, I think she understood it very
clearly.  
We have a chance to win a championship and turn the situation into the most
positive outcome we can, and that's what it's about right now and continue to
grow and improve and have the moment in 2012/'13 and get better.  
  
Q. Kierra played one minute in the second half, Kierra had two good games
coming into this. What did you see from her tonight?  
COACH CURRY: I'm sorry. What was that?  
  
Q. Kierra played one minute in the second half. She had two good games going
into this. What did you see from her tonight?  
COACH CURRY: We just went with a different lineup. Coach's decision.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, Coach. Best of luck postseason. Nice to see you, Kristy.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Kansas State 67  
Iowa State 63

  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by Kansas State Wildcats Coach Deb Patterson
and her student‑athletes. Coach, your thoughts, and ‑‑ congratulations, first
of all, and your thoughts about this afternoon's game.  
COACH PATTERSON: It was a classic Kansas State‑Iowa State matchup and game.
Just possession by possession took great toughness by both teams, as one would
make an itty‑bitty run, and another would come back and make a mini run. By
runs, I mean two possessions, two baskets in a game like this.  
So it really took a great deal of intense focus and toughness in this game.
Obviously, the difference maker in the biggest respect was Jalana Childs,
stepped up and set a new Kansas State record. Her teammates did a tremendous
job of making sure she got the touches she needed. She had the hot hand, and
we kept going to her, which is something that's been a process of learning.  
And at the same time, I felt like our perimeters played very, very well around
her, taking open shots when we did get the opportunity. Tasha Dickey, our
other senior here, was just tremendous today. Kept her focus very, very
narrow. Made quality decisions, mixed up the inside‑outside game, and defended
at an extremely high level against a team that is just a threat to the final
buzzer.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. We'll take questions for our student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Jalana, just talk about your day. Both offensively and defensively. I
know you've had some success against Iowa State, but just talk about what it
was like getting that record.  
JALANA CHILDS: Well, they didn't have French toast, so I had to just eat
fruit. Mariah White made me a breakfast sandwich. It was delicious.  
Last time we played them, we weren't there as a team at all, and I really
wasn't there. My teammates are always looking at me. So I really wanted to
bang it in there, as I usually do. I had to get a feel for the game the first
half, and I think I did. It just kept rolling.  
My teammates kept feeding me the ball, did a great job tonight, Brittany
Chambers with six assists. I like seeing those numbers on her stat sheet.  
You know, we just played off each other tonight. It was really fun. We don't
have a lot of those games where it's this competitive, and it's fun for us
because we're mentally in it the whole time. Usually, we have lapses and
something goes wrong for us and we're down. But we stayed together, and I
really felt good with my teammates on the court today.  
  
Q. Last year you were hurt coming into this tournament. You really hobbled
through it and were not a happy camper this time last year. Can you just talk
about ‑‑ was that at all in your mind preparing for this tournament?   
JALANA CHILDS: Not really. I mean, when I played last year against Iowa State,
I was hurt. I felt pain. I wasn't at my full potential, but I think I was‑‑ I
did well enough for my team. And being healthy, I mean, it felt good, but I've
been healthy all season, and I've had terrible games. So I didn't want to come
in here today healthy, end of my season, and have a terrible one.  
I wanted to be there for my team, and I'm going to continue to be there until
my last game.  
  
Q. Jalana, in a game like this, did you get a sense pretty early that maybe
they were going to have a hard time stopping you or that you were going to be
able to have your way in this one?  
JALANA CHILDS: Early‑‑ I mean, first half, I really had that sense that I
could score at will. No disrespect to their defense. But when I'm feeling
good, I'm feeling good. But I always know in the back of my mind that the
defense is going to change. They're going to throw something at me. They're
going to double‑team me. They're going to do something to just take me out of
my game.  
And I use my basketball IQ and I get a feel for it once the second half
starts. If the double‑team is coming and I make a bad play, I'll change it,
and I'll adjust. They really are some big post players; hard to score over,
but I always have to find a way. That's what my coach prepared me to do.  
  
Q. Jalana, are you happier with your defense or your offense?  
JALANA CHILDS: Probably defense because I know that, if my defense wasn't
there and my offense was there, I would still have something that my coaches
would be liking me for. I mean, I rebounded the ball, which I'm very happy
with, eight defensive rebounds because I haven't been rebounding that well
this season. I feel really good about that.  
Their post players, like I said, Poppens is a great player. She killed us. She
burned us at home, at our home, and we didn't want that to happen again. I
don't want it to happen ever again, and it won't because I'm done.  
But I really wanted to prove myself, prove myself to my team and to K‑State.  
  
Q. Obviously, it was a little bit different circumstance when you faced Iowa
State in Hilton here about a week ago. What was ‑‑ I ask both Jalana and
Tasha, what was the biggest difference from a mentality standpoint for K‑State
today of considering how poorly things went in Hilton a week ago.   
JALANA CHILDS: Well, that game was very weird in Hilton. We came out there. We
told ourselves, we told each other that we were going to be this great team,
and we came out, and we were not. So I feel like we really had something to
prove, that we didn't need to lose. We shouldn't have lost at Hilton. We
shouldn't have lost at home, and we really wanted to prove ourselves to our
coaches and to ourselves.  
Today this game really meant a lot. We lost three in a row, and that's a
terrible feeling. I said it last week in media, I said, right now we're
losers. And I hate that I have to say it, but it's true. Getting this win was
very important to us. It was really good for our hearts. It was really good
for our mindset. We need to keep going at it.  
TASHA DICKEY: And going off what Jalana said, we're in the Big 12 tournament.
The only way you survive is if you win. Tomorrow is not promised to anyone.
You've got to go out and grind it out. That's what our focus was. We wanted to
survive and make it to tomorrow.  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, we're going to let you all go back to your locker room.
Coach, we'll take questions for you.  
  
Q. You mentioned a team record. That was a record.  
COACH PATTERSON: Yeah, that was a record that's been held at Kansas State
since 1996 by Andrea Jones for most points scored in a Big 12 tournament by a
Kansas State player.  
  
Q. I wanted to ask about that.  
COACH PATTERSON: They wouldn't have known.  
  
Q. No, something else. Tasha mentioned tomorrow.  
COACH PATTERSON: Tomorrow. Any time you line up against the No.1 team in the
country and you have the opportunity to take the floor in a Big 12 tournament,
it's game's on. It's just‑‑ we're thrilled to have the opportunity to take the
floor. We understand the magnitude of the opponent, but at the same time, it's
a chance to play another 40 minutes, and that's our focus.  
I hope we can take the floor and we'll compete with this kind of toughness and
passion, and if we do, we'll walk off the floor extremely proud and knowing
we've done the best we can against No.1 in the country.  
  
Q. Deb, I've never been any good at math, so I probably got this number
wrong. I think Jalana and Brittany got the last 20 points or so to kind of
close out the game. Is this the time of year when the players kind of have to
step up and do that?  
COACH PATTERSON: Well, if that's the case, that is tremendous because, as
we've gone through this last stretch here where we struggled some, we made a
point, a great deal about how your best players have to step up and make
plays. That's what puts you in position to be the best team it can be.  
And I thought both of those two with major, major minutes played tremendous
tonight. Brittany had to play through some spurts where she had a couple of
mistakes and not let that get her down and not stay the course relative to a
poor decision or a turnover. When you look at her stat line and see she's
double figures and six assists on the game in 38 minutes, that's a quality
stat line when you're being chased the entire game.  
So I'm really pleased with both of them because those are our two first team
all Big 12 players, and they came and led the team to victory, and it's a
tremendous feeling for us right now to be advancing.  
  
Q. Coach, I continue to look at the difference between this and your last
meeting with Iowa State. Did you feel like you had to convince your team that
it would be possible to make this drastic of a turnaround in that short span
of time?  
COACH PATTERSON: Definitely. I thought we would have a better bounceback after
we lost at Hilton. And the fact that we lost the next game was extremely
disappointing to us and to me. So we really tried to get back to the bare
bones basics. We changed some things relative to how we wanted to approach
this game offensively because we were so inept the last time we played Iowa
State.  
I thought our players adjusted really well to that in a short period of time
because we really made those changes after Texas Tech, and that's a very short
window, quite frankly. But the mentality was one in which you do go into a
game wondering does the team really have the mind of your team? And we'll find
out. You work extremely hard to re‑prepare, but we'll find out today.  
I was pleased. Whether the last shot had gone in for us or not, whether they
come in here with a win or not, I would have walked off the floor extremely
proud of how we competed this game. We made some mistakes, but at least we
competed. You couldn't say that our last 20 minutes up at Hilton.  
  
Q. You talked a little bit about how Jalana has the hot hand and you
continue to look for her, and that's something that's been something that you
do. I was wondering if you could expand on that a little bit and what made you
guys go to her.  
COACH PATTERSON: Again, we've sort of evolved offensively, and there have been
some games where we got real perimeter oriented. There's been some games in
our‑‑ as Jalana said, our posts haven't necessarily demanded the ball. We
haven't created isos or on catches our post would not make a quality
basketball decision if there was a double‑team.  
I thought today we put all those things together. We gave the post a chance.
Our post worked hard for touches, and once they got touches, I thought the
decisions they made were real high‑quality basketball IQ reads.  
Jalana, after a couple of her isos started to get a double‑team, particularly
over the left shoulder, and she adjusted to it. We moved her around a little
bit. She drove from the high post. She stepped out as the game evolved.  
She had such a good feel for how to exploit the defense, and her teammates
responded to play calls and put her in position to be the great player she is.
So she was the finisher, but they did a tremendous job with the distribution.  
Today was one of those moments when you feel like, okay, they're making good
decisions and they're finishing plays the way we would hope they should
finish. Might not have been a make, but the decisions were better.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, congratulations on your win. We'll see you tomorrow.
Thank you.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Oklahoma 70  
Missouri 59

  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by the Oklahoma Sooners, Sherri Coale and her
student‑athletes. Reminder to, when you ask questions of the student‑athletes,
please address them by name so that our people taking the quotes on the
telephone will know who's answering the question.  
Coach, congratulations. Your comments on tonight's game.  
COACH COALE: Thank you. As I said all year, Missouri is not an easy team to
play against. They may have finished at the bottom of the league, but they're
a lot better than their record. It shows that they are, and we knew we were in
for a fight.  
They were so hot. Continued that hot shooting touch in the first half tonight.
Credit our guys' commitment to covering three‑point shooters in the zone. Made
them use a lot of clock in the second half.  
You know, Missouri just fought. They just fought, and I thought they ran out
of gas a little bit. It was pretty obvious that they played a tough game
yesterday. They just ran out of gas down the stretch. Robin's done a fantastic
job with that team.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for our student‑athletes first, and then
we'll go to Coach. First question, please.  
  
Q. There's a theory out there a lot of times freshmen hit a wall at some
point in their season longer than high school and stuff. Do you think you went
through this and this was a little more the person you were a few weeks ago?  
SHARANE CAMPBELL: Most definitely. I don't want to say that I just lost
myself, but I didn't. It was more of a getting my confidence back, I would
say. It's hard to explain.  
  
Q. Whitney, what was the halftime speech like? After you guys struggled?  
WHITNEY HAND: You know, I was just being really timid. I kind of got
challenged at halftime that a freshman was kicking my butt. That's kind of
hard to swallow for all I've been through.  
For me personally, it was just let's go. Goodness. But our team really, really
weren't‑‑ I didn't think we were playing that bad. We just needed to get out
quicker to shooters and knock down some shots.  
We got lost in the second half just in playing and not worrying about losing,
not being tight. I think that really opened us all up and allowed us to play
with a little bit more energy.  
  
Q. Sharane, it looked to me like Sherri had some words for you before she
put you in to start the second half. It was pretty early in the half when you
guys were still a little bit back on your heels. Was the message we've got to
get you to get something going? It looked like it might have been the case.
What do you remember about that?  
SHARANE CAMPBELL: To be honest, I don't remember at all.  
COACH COALE: Obviously, it was incredibly impactful.  
  
Q. That goes without saying.  
THE MODERATOR: Got a question.  
  
Q. Whitney, did it just feel like they were just playing loose because they
had nothing to lose and this could be their last game or they were playing to
keep their season going? You know what I'm saying. Did it look like they were
just having fun out there that first half?  
WHITNEY HAND: Yeah, it definitely did. If you watched their game yesterday,
they were hitting on all cylinders. They were pulling it when I was not
expecting it. They are playing really well.  
It kind of put us on our heels the first half. I felt they were controlling
the speed of the game. They were directing and we were responding. I felt it
changed in the second half that they were attacking, and they were turning on
their heels and having to respond back to us.  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, you did such a good job. You don't have many questions.
Thank you very much. We'll see you guys tomorrow. We'll take questions for
Coach now.  
  
Q. Sherri, as freshmen sometimes do, the season gets so long compared to
what they went through in high school. Do you think she went through a little
bit of that and now is finding her second wind, so to speak?  
COACH COALE: Probably a little bit. I think the other thing that happens is,
when you're a freshman, people don't know you and don't know your tendencies,
and you get to shock them a little bit. Then you get in the middle of Big 12
conference and you play them once, and the second time they play you, they
take away your strengths.  
We play in a fantastic league. Coaches do a great job of scouting. They never
had to have a counter. Her go‑to was always good enough. That's the case for a
lot of freshmen. She had to figure out how to counter, how she was being
defended both with the ball and without the ball.  
I think she's responded very well. It's funny. You watch kids, and you think
sometimes these postseason awards don't mean very much, but you tell a kid
you're the sixth man of the year in the Big 12 conference, and suddenly they
go, oh, here we go. It's kind of a countenance thing.  
Sharane is often her own worst enemy. She's very hard on herself, very much a
perfectionist. I think the validation helped her see that she's done a lot of
really, really good things. Her ceiling is really high.  
  
Q. How do you feel like your bigs matched up against their bigs, especially
Christine Flores?  
COACH COALE: We have had a problem guarding Flores for four years. She's been
a conundrum for us because she can step out and shoot it, and she's so crafty
inside. She draws a lot of fouls. Always shoots a ton of free throws against
us.  
And I didn't think we were very good at all the first half. As a matter of
fact, we were a black hole at the post spot in the first half. But I thought
KK really got us going in the second. We were able to attack a little bit and
get them on their heels. Probably for the duration of the game, I would say
their post guys won the battle.  
  
Q. Sherri, looking at stats and talking about your post players, obviously,
a big difference in the number of free throws that were taken ‑‑ and I know
there will be people that will talk about officiating. I think mostly, more
than anything, that's just kind of a style difference. Talk a bit about what
you guys were doing as far as attacking the basket, getting to the line, and
maybe what you were doing defensively that was keeping Missouri from doing the
same.   
COACH COALE: Well, I think Missouri was wanting to ride the three‑point wave,
and I don't blame them because they were going in. When you take a lot of
threes‑‑ this happened to us repeatedly. When you take a lot of threes, you
don't get to the free‑throw line as often as those guys who were throwing it
to the block. We felt like we were needing to attack. We weren't shooting it
very well in the first half at all, really from anywhere, inside or outside.  
We felt our best opportunity to get points on the board early was to go
inside, had some success with that.  
  
Q. I'll take a shot. Do you remember what you said to Sharane?  
COACH COALE: Just challenged her about impacting the game. I always tell her,
you can change the flavor of the game. You get to sit and watch for a little
bit. I think the mismatch was a problem for them. She was guarding a post guy
and trying to get around in front and made them work really, really hard to
catch the ball, which I think took its toll after a while.  
And I told her to put the ball on the floor. We didn't feel like anybody could
stay in front of her. You just, when you say those kinds of things to Sharane,
it's kind of like dollar signs roll through her eyes. She just gets really
excited. I felt like she was focused and ready to impact, and she did.  
  
Q. What did you have to do to kind of calm Williams down after the way her
game kind of started?  
COACH COALE: You know, KK is an interesting freshman. She has, again, such a
high ceiling. I think both of those kids really have a chance to be great
players. KK has no earthly idea how good she can be, absolutely no earthly
idea. She tends to alibi.  
I simply told her, I have no problem with you shooting. I have a problem with
you hoping. And every shot you took in the first half was a hope. If you want
to shoot, then go shoot. If you don't, then sit down, and I got plenty of
other people that can play. KK is the kind of kid that says, okay, and goes
and makes shots.  
  
Q. You said all year long this is a young team which describes the roller
coaster. But when your two freshmen tonight account for half your scoring, is
this part of the ceiling you talk about and what you hope to be here going
forward tomorrow and in the NCAA Tournament if those two really step up?  
COACH COALE: Yeah, I think that's what we have to have. You look at our team,
and you have to be really careful how you look at that. The reason those guys
can do that‑‑ and I don't want to take anything away from what they did. But
people are not going to leave Whitney Hand. People are going to put their best
player on her and chase her all over the floor. I would do the same thing.  
People are not going to leave Aaryn Ellenberg. They're going to follow her all
over the floor. Other guys are going to get lots of opportunity with
one‑on‑one coverage with maybe not the second or third best defender on the
team but maybe the fourth or fifth, and you have to take advantage of that.  
Those guys getting all those minutes through the middle of Big 12 play has
really put them in the position to be able to contribute the way they did
today.  
  
Q. I was going to ask you about a sequence right at the end of the first
half. They missed a three at the end of their shot clock and the rebound was
loose in the corner, and it looked like they were the only ones that pursued
it. And they got a time ‑out called after that, and you were, to say the
least, upset. Right after that, I think Whitney won a 50‑50 ball near midcourt
on the steal and took it the other way, and you guys score. It looked from
that point on the aggression really changed. I'm not sure if you remember the
sequence.   
COACH COALE: Oh, I remember the sequence clearly. I think I went to the huddle
and said, would you guys please go get loose balls. I think that's pretty much
how it went.  
Whitney Hand, I'm telling you right now, she is worth her weight in gold. I
don't care what a stat line says. I don't care what any percentages look like.
None of that matters to me. From that point forward, Whitney Hand got every
loose ball. And it wasn't even her that didn't chase it in the corner. She got
every loose ball. She got every long rebound. She made just about every shot
she took from that point forward. She just carried herself like, you know
what, I will show you.  
We said all year it's Whitt and the kids. She just said, come on, get on my
back; I will show you. It's funny how that‑‑ not funny ha ha, but funny odd‑‑
how that happens that everybody is kind of going along, and they're trying.
They're great kids. They're trying, but they just don't realize they're not
doing what they're capable of doing.  
I remember clearly last‑‑ yeah, when Amanda Thompson was here, and we were at
Kansas State, and we were just mucking around, and we couldn't get anything
going. We were down 14, I think. All of a sudden, she comes in and makes this
just heroic warrior‑like rebound, and everybody kind of looked at her and
said, oh, okay. And then we began to play, and we take the lead, and we win.  
I thought that happened tonight with Whitt. She ran and got a long loose ball
and came up with it and was nice and tight, and everybody looked at her and
said, okay, I can do that too. That's what it looks like. From there on out,
it was joy and abandon and all those things that our team is known for.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much for your comments. We'll see you
tomorrow.

Texas A&M 78

Q. You come up with 25 tonight. Talk about your approach tonight, and,
Sydney, just talk about, when you hear Tyra is not going to play, what goes
through everyone's mind?  
SYDNEY CARTER: I guess my role is just to be a point guard. If I'm open, shoot
the three. Tonight I was open. I just took what I had to take, and I guess I
helped out our team since we're missing our leading scorer.  
KELSEY BONE: I think everybody is just like, oh, my gosh, Tyra's not playing.
What are we going to do?  
SYDNEY CARTER: I think it shows a lot the way our team responded. I think
Coach Schaefer said before the game, everybody has got to step up tonight
without our leading scorer.  
I think the main focus tonight was our defense. If we could get our defense
going like it usually is, we could get our offense going. She was hitting
shots. Any time you have somebody hot, you keep giving it to them.  
  
Q. Alexia, can you talk about when did you feel you were in the zone. Is
there any particular play? Talk about how you felt. When did you say, man, I
can't miss? Seemed that way.  
ALEXIA STANDISH: For me, it wasn't really my shooting. It was watching the
team get motivated and excited after we'd make a good play or make a good
defensive stop. Seeing that got me really confident in my team knowing that,
hey, if I missed that shot, Bone's got the rebound, Karla's got the rebound.
For me, it was a confidence thing, seeing how motivated my team was playing.  
  
Q. Kelsey, talk about the guards because they had been struggling from
outside for most of this year. You've been taking some criticism. But tonight,
postseason, you got to step your game up, and they certainly did.  
KELSEY BONE: You know, it would have been easy for us after last Sunday to
just fold. I mean, Monday in the film room was like torture, and Tuesday was
death. So for us, we knew we had to step up. The season started over now.
Everyone coming in tonight was 0‑0\. We knew this was a team again for the
second time in a row, they were fighting for their NCAA life.  
To ourselves, we put ourselves in a situation where we're fighting for our
seeding life. We knew we had to step up. If two or three people stand on me
and they want to leave Standish open, that's fine by me. Leave her open. She's
finally getting into a rhythm and put it all behind and just playing
basketball.  
I think it had a lot to do with maybe we needed to kind of depend on one
another and help chemistry because now some people are in a groove, and when
Tyra comes back in, she's just going to fit right back into the puzzle.  
  
Q. This is for Sydney. You have some pretty good memories in this building,
winning a title here. Even though last year you didn't, you know how well last
year ended. Can you sort of talk about what this season has been like and the
feelings you have coming into here? Like Kelsey said, it all starts over
again. And also how you sort of helped Alexia get to the place she is right
now as the younger player.  
KELSEY BONE: I think this season has definitely been a roller coaster. It's
kind of like I'm the leader this year, and everybody is looking to me, and
I've always had that backseat to Sydney Colson, so we kind of just
complemented each other.  
So we always had that team where everybody knew we're going to get to the
championship or we should get there. I think the Big 12 is so just balanced
this year. So night in and night out, we're going to have to prove we're still
the same Texas A&M, even though we don't have the players that we had the
previous years, that we're the stars. We're more balanced this year. And
everybody can kind of bring their own thing to the table.  
So I definitely got some good memories in here. It's nice to say that I do
have a championship. I think that this team is just working today. We're
trying to make our own name.  
As far as Lex goes, I was just trying to get the ball to her because she did
have the hot hand. We had the emotion today. We were high‑fiving each other
and screaming and having fun. I think that's what we've been missing this
entire year, when we're out running in transition and when we're getting
rebounds and people are missing shots, that's when the game is fun for us. So
we need to get back to that and keep chest bumping and high‑fiving like people
are used to seeing us do, and I think that will help us.  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, we're going to let you go back to the locker room.  
  
Q. Coach, what is Tyra's injury, and when do you expect her back?  
COACH BLAIR: After the Texas game, her foot had been bothering her for a week,
she said, and we didn't know anything about it. After the Texas game, it's a
hot spot on the fifth metatarsal. The X‑rays were negative. She's been in a
lot of pain and has been in the boot ever since, was on crutches for two days.  
It's day by day, and we'll just have to see what goes. I know Radar would like
to hold her out to Saturday. First he told me he wanted to hold her out to
Sunday, and I said, there's no game on Sunday. But that was Radar. I said, you
may be looking for a game job on Sunday.  
But precaution. The role‑playing that stepped up with Assarian and Collins
filling a role. They didn't have to step up because Lexi filled the role.
We'll have to see how it goes. It's very doubtful she'll play tomorrow. If
somehow we can get by Oklahoma, she's at her hometown here. We'll see.  
But we don't want to do anything that could snap that thing and turn it into a
fracture and we won't have her for a tournament. But we have other kids on the
scholarship, and they stood up today.  
  
Q. Kind of a followup to that. Since that 87th Street start, how strange was
that not having her available?  
COACH BLAIR: It killed me. I was in a horrible mood. I was snapping at the
trainers, snapping at my team during the shootaround. It's a good thing my
wife didn't get here until about 4:00 because she would have kicked me out of
the room. She was driving in from Fayetteville. I was in a horrible mood. Woe
is me, woe is me, I don't have all my toys to go out there.  
Somehow I believed in our kids. We had great guard play today. How's this for
a line? Carter's had a tough year. She goes 8 out of 13, 2 out of 4 from the
three. Missed her only free throw, and that's where she's the best. Seven
boards, I think they were all in the second half. 8 assists, zero turnovers,
and guarded Goodrich. Folks, that's 40 minutes, and that's how you play it,
and that's how she is on the all Big 12 defensive team.  
But she gave us the offense that we've been missing all year, but we ran some
good stuff for her at the right time. I think it's very important.  
  
Q. You touched on it briefly, but Carter and Goodrich have been pretty well
matched up off the bench. What makes that matchup so good?  
COACH BLAIR: They both got out of high school the same year because Goodrich
had a redshirt year. We looked at Goodrich also. But we couldn't be greedy, we
already had Colson and other point guards. We wanted Carolyn Davis too, used
to come to our camp.  
I think those are two of the premiere guards in the league. They don't need
rest. They can go 40 minutes a game. Goodrich is so good with the ball. She's
always diving into the paint. She's finding somebody open or whatever. We're
just lucky Carolyn Davis wasn't in there because, when you have those two
posts together, they're two very, very good offensive posts. But Goodrich can
find you.  
Bonnie runs more sets than I do, and I thought I had the most sets in the
world, but she runs a lot of different things. Angel Goodrich is probably the
best scorer and point guard in this league. That doesn't say a thing about
Odyssey Sims now, I'm not saying a thing there, but Odyssey doesn't have to do
for her team what Angel has to do for her team, and that makes a difference.  
But don't worry. Odyssey can do it the year that Griner leaves.  
You know, I want to lobby for the University of Kansas to get in. Last weekend
the No.6, the No.7, the No.8 and 9th place team beat the No.2, 3, 4, and 5 in
our league. That shows you how balanced we are. 18 games is too much. And all
of a sudden, those coaches just play so hard. She went into Oklahoma. Nobody
goes into Oklahoma and dominates the game like they did.  
I think it woke up Oklahoma, and that's why they played so well in the second
half. They remembered what Kansas did to them. But Kansas deserves to be in
that NCAA Tournament.  
Now, we've already had three wrong winners out there, and that's going to hurt
an 8‑10 team. Hopefully, with their RPI and how hard their kids play and also
playing without Carolyn Davis and not using that as an excuse, that's why that
team deserves to go to the dance.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you for your comments. We're going to let you go.
We'll see you tomorrow.  
COACH BLAIR: Peter, if you come to the Cheesecake Factory, I'll buy you a
cheesecake. I didn't say dinner. I'll buy you one piece of cheesecake.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Texas Tech 81  
Texas 58

  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by the Texas Longhorns. We'll get started
here. Coach, your opening comments and your thoughts about tonight's game.  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: Just really disappointed with our play. I give a lot of
credit to Texas Tech. They played with a tremendous focus and sense of
urgency, really that we've been playing with the last three games in
particular. I thought we saw that against them. Unfortunately tonight, we
didn't see it.  
So just overall very, very disappointed.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll now take questions for our student‑athletes and for
Coach. We'll start on the right.  
  
Q. Gail, have you ever experienced or watched the first half like that
one?  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: Not that I recall.  
  
Q. The shots and turnovers.  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: I don't recall seeing a half quite like that. We've had some
disappointing halves before, where we haven't shot the ball well or where
we've turned it over too much or where we've fouled too much. Unfortunately,
in this game we saw all three of those things at the same time.  
  
Q. Looked like it came down to Yvonne and Chassidy not having their usual
games coming after maybe their best game for the Longhorns. Any explanation
there?  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: We talked after the game. She said I can't explain what
happened out there. I thought, A.G., she played one of her best games of the
year. I thought A.G. played like a warrior, especially in the second half.  
Yvonne wasn't herself tonight. She was coming off such a great game, maybe her
best game against A&M.  
Chas has been overall really consistent for us. So to have both of them off on
the same night.  
And then Chelsea Bass has been very consistent for us off the bench. I think
she was 1 for 8. To have three guards not play well, that's not healthy for us
scoring‑wise.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Ashleigh, I was wondering if you had any explanation now that the regular
season is over or just relaxed now that the season is over.  
ASHLEIGH FONTENETTE: I'm not sure what happened. I think we came out, and we
were just a step late on everything. I'm not sure what happened. I think we
were very focused before the game. There's no excuse for the way we played out
there tonight.  
THE MODERATOR: Before we go any further, that was Ashleigh Fontenette because
we're doing this by telephone.  
  
Q. What did you say at halftime? You're obviously a leader. What did you try
to do?  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: I said we've got to let that go. The first half's over. We
can't do anything about it. We've just got to focus on the second half and
play with the same focus, intensity, desire that we've been playing with in
previous games. Just try to put that behind us. Thought we just needed to
relax a little bit. We seemed tight.  
I thought we came out. We made a little bit of a run. Tech played well. I want
to give them credit as well. They played with that sense of urgency. And when
we cut it, they got to the basket and got to the free‑throw line.  
  
Q. Gail, did they do something differently on Chassidy that they hadn't done
or other teams hadn't done as far as defense?  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: They trapped her with the ball screen. They ran a little
one‑three with the chaser part of the time, but we did that as well. We've had
other teams do that too. We've always handled it pretty well. Tonight we
didn't.  
  
Q. Gail, as far as the timing of the loss, it could be a whole lot worse.
Are you afraid of what message that sends to the selection committee?  
GAIL GOESTENKORS: Yeah, I'm just hopeful they don't base our body of work on
this one game. The fact that we were able to beat A&M twice shows a
consistently excellent team, and the way we beat OU as well.  
We finished strong. This was a tough way to lose, but I'm hoping they consider
our body of work, and that includes all of our preconference games where we
beat people that are either in the tournament or on the bubble as well.  
  
Q. Ashleigh, it looked like in the second half you really put the team on
your back. You were doing everything you could to take the game over. No one
else around you was really able to step up for you guys. How tough was that
for you?  
ASHLEIGH FONTENETTE: I think we couldn't find a way to put it all together. We
were playing great defense. We just couldn't get rebounds. But I think overall
we kind of came together, just couldn't quite get over the hump when we cut
the lead to 12.  
I give my team credit. We kept fighting till the end of the game.  
  
Q. Ashleigh Fontenette, when you fall behind like that, everybody's missing,
you get to the point where people start maybe forcing things, trying to catch
up fast.  
ASHLEIGH FONTENETTE: I definitely think everybody was just‑‑ we had a sense of
urgency, but we kind of forced some shots that we didn't really need to take.
But I mean, everybody had the right thing in mind. Everybody was just trying
to help. Nothing was falling for us tonight.  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for our student‑athletes?  
  
Q. Ashley, for the seniors, was this a scary kind of game, kind of being
made a bubble team to have that kind of performance? Maybe thinking that could
be the last game you played?  
ASHLEY GAYLE: I think this is a rough way to go out in the Big 12. We didn't
expect this at all. Coming off a big win against A&M. This is not what we
planned. It's really rough for us to go through this.  
I can't be mad at my team. They played hard this whole season. We just
happened to play our worst on the wrong night.  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else? Ladies, thank you very much. Thanks for a great
run this season. Best of luck in the NCAA.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2012

  

### [Kristy Curry](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14069)

### [Casey Morris](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21871)

### [Monique Smalls](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21843)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Texas Tech 81  
Texas 58

  
THE MODERATOR: I believe our student‑athletes and coach are here. So we'll get
them up here and get started.  
We will start off, Coach. Congratulations on the win. Your comments after the
game.  
KRISTY CURRY: Just proud of our team effort. I thought we didn't stand around
and wait for somebody else to make a play. Our kids were aggressive on the
glass. Any time we can have four in double figures, we're very successful, and
any time we can shoot 80 percent from the line.  
I thought we played with a sense of energy and purpose today and a tremendous
amount of pride. I'm really proud of their effort.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for our student‑athletes and for Coach
Curry.  
  
Q. Kristy, can you talk about just sort of the way the momentum, it seemed
like, from that win at Kansas State just sort of carried right into this game,
and you guys went on that big tear in the first half.  
KRISTY CURRY: I think it's a sense of urgency. We obviously needed something
good to happen to us. We've lost a lot of close ones and self‑induced a few
errors along the way. Just their character and how we stuck together. That was
definitely a positive for us to end the conference season that way.  
Gave us momentum into today, and we certainly build on it. We have a choice,
you can build on it or be satisfied with it. And we decided to build on it. So
proud of the kids representing the Double T today.  
  
Q. Kristy, denying the Texas post players, it looked a lot like the first
game you guys played against them the way you guys handled them.  
KRISTY CURRY: I wouldn't say we handled them. To a certain degree too, they
missed a lot of shots today. It was cold. They're so physical and big in size.
It's definitely a match‑up problem for us at the four spot.  
Again, I thought the combination of Shauntal and Kierra was a big boost for
us. I thought Barncastle tried to hold her on. We were just concerned about
the offensive glass the second half and did a decent enough job to give
ourselves a chance down the stretch.  
Tried to match their physicality.  
  
Q. Kristy, were you surprised how easy it was considering what was on the
line for Texas?  
KRISTY CURRY: I don't think it was easy. I think that Texas is still an NCAA
Tournament team. I think their RPI is 20 and strength of schedule is 45. You
should look at the body of work. I think they're an NCAA Tournament team.  
One loss shouldn't define your season. In tournament time, anything can
happen. It's happening across the country. That's what we feel good about our
opportunity.  
Again, their strength of schedule, their RPI, their body of work should be
enough to get them in the NCAA Tournament.  
  
Q. Could you sort of go into detail a little bit about the overall defensive
strategy today and Fussell and Fontenette and Anderson, particularly Anderson
and Fussell, what you guys did against them.  
KRISTY CURRY: You can't in transition, number one. We had to do a better job
in Austin. We're up for 31 minutes until we have transition defense
breakdowns. So transition defense was critical.  
Thought that Mo and Casey and Mary and Chynna and Amber and all those
perimeter players did a great job of buying into the plan today and did a
better job. Pretty much was the same plan. We executed it better and learned
from our mistakes.  
Secondly, we threw a little junk there for a little bit as far as the diamond
and one on Fussell. We wanted to make sure we didn't give her a lot of looks.
I thought that affected them a bit and kept them out of sync whether after a
time‑out or a dead ball for whatever reason.  
Our transition defense and the fact we limited her touches and made things
very difficult for her. I think, when she starts hitting shots, gives Texas a
tremendous amount of confidence, and it should, just as Casey Morris hitting
shots for us does for us as well.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for our student‑athletes?  
  
Q. Monique, could you sense the frustration of Texas? Do you feel they
overlooked you all coming? They were too relaxed or uptight? How did you
interpret it?  
MONIQUE SMALLS: I think we came out really hard. We saw each other before we
came out. We have to play hard. We don't want to go home. We found out, if we
lose, we go home tonight. We do not want to go home tonight. We want to keep
playing.  
Just having everybody in their head and their momentum up and making sure
everyone is aggressive and attacking, kept going on and going on and
continued.  
  
Q. Mo, how much did you think like Coach Curry said about making shots and
Casey coming out and making those shots, talk about what that did for you
guys.  
MONIQUE SMALLS: It boosted our energy. Seeing Casey create a shot, and she
makes it two threes in a row and Kierra rebounding. It all leads to good
things. Just seeing the energy on everybody's face helps put energy in
everybody else.  
  
Q. Monique, you guys have played Baylor very well. You're going to be
playing them again. Can you maybe talk about does that help having that
confidence back to having played them really better than any other Big 12 team
has?  
MONIQUE SMALLS: I'm sorry. Facing Baylor, I mean, we're just going to keep our
same momentum as we did today. Same thing, aggressive. Everybody's got to
attack.  
When everybody attacks and are aggressive, good things happen for us, and
everybody needs to make plays. We can't wait for somebody else to make the
plays.  
  
Q. Kristy, can you address that too? You guys, some of the schemes you've
used have been effective. I know it's sort of a constant battle against them
to come up with new stuff. But you guys have been very good in both the
matchups against Baylor.  
KRISTY CURRY: There are definitely a few adjustments we need to make in the
game plan that we feel like we can bottle those two up and do some things
better.  
The most important thing that you have to do against those guys is you can't
go get a stop and not go down and score. You've got to make sure that you find
ways to score and make plays. You've got to shoot 50 percent to give yourself
a chance. You've got to shoot 80 percent from the line.  
It's just about finding offense tomorrow, and we believe in what we're doing
and how we're trying to do it. We've missed some shots that just one here or
there that would have made a difference. So I think these kids have a lot of
confidence, and at this point, it doesn't really matter to us who we play
because we're just thankful for another day. We're playing to stay alive at
this point.  
  
Q. Casey, do you remember playing against a team that had as poor of an
offense in the first half as Texas had today?  
CASEY MORRIS: I think every team eventually might have a bad shooting night.
You just have to overcome it with hustle plays like we did. I think‑‑ I give
credit to us. Kierra had 15 rebounds, and Shaunie had 10. Our hustle effort
was so good. Free throws, we've been working on that, and we executed well
tonight. That was all to us.  
I think Texas did well and played well, but everybody has a bad shooting night
at times.  
  
Q. Casey, can you also talk just about when Texas started mounting a little
comeback in the second half. You guys didn't lose your cool. Can you talk
about the way you guys took a little run of your own after that and sort of
took the game away?  
CASEY MORRIS: I think we've been in situations all year, and it's good we can
grow off those situations. I feel like we did tonight and kept our composure.
When they did get their run, we kept pushing hard on the defensive and
offensive end, and it worked to our advantage tonight.  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for our student‑athletes or coach?  
  
Q. Kristy, Texas looked at you so little in the second half. Do you think
they kind of quit looking for it? Took her out of their game plan?  
KRISTY CURRY: I think it's difficult. We were doing a great job of face
guarding from half‑court on and switching on some screens. We made it very
difficult. Again, whether they quit looking for it, credit our defense. I'd
have to go back and watch.  
That was behind transition defense was to limit her touches and make sure we
didn't let Yvonne have a big day off the ball on the high screen. Those things
were really successful today.  
Whether it was our defense, I don't think it was lack of energy or lack of
effort. Everybody has cold days, and they just didn't shoot the ball well
today. We were fortunate to find a way.  
It's been three really great basketball games with our two programs this year.
We're just excited we came out on the good end today. We were fortunate.  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else? Okay, guys. We'll see you tomorrow.
Congratulations. Have a good evening.

## March 7, 2012

  

### [BreAnna Brock](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23325)

### [Christine Flores](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23324)

### [Robin Pingeton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21391)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Missouri 72  
Oklahoma State 68

  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by Missouri. We're delighted to have you here,
Coach. Congratulations. Your opening comments, please.  
ROBIN PINGETON: I'm just really happy for our players. We just obviously got a
big lead there with about 14 minutes to go. It's been a long time since we've
been in a position to have such a big lead. I think they started celebrating a
little bit early. It was unchartered territory for us in this conference play.  
Happens all the time. It's March Madness. You see 20‑point comebacks all the
time. I thought at the end made some big plays, hit some big free throws. I
think Oklahoma State is a tremendous team. Coach Littell has done a tremendous
job for them. But I'm really proud of our girls, and I'm happy for them.  
They continued to stay the course all year long. We said in March records go
out the window. It's a new opportunity. They're just such a together team, and
they continued to stay very positive. That's a hard thing to do when you
haven't had a lot of success throughout conference play. Very proud of them.
Very happy for them.  
THE MODERATOR: Without further ado, ask the first question.  
  
Q. BreAnna, let me start by asking you about the physical nature,
particularly in the second half. Getting the ball inbound after the Cowgirls
score, it looked like it was particularly a problem. Really at both ends it
looked to be particularly physical. How hard is it to get in a game situation
like that and still keep your cool when you're getting shoved around a little
bit?  
CHRISTINE FLORES: Honestly, we don't have a choice but to keep it cool. It
doesn't benefit us to keep going back and forth.  
We have to play hard and do what we need to do in order to avoid getting open
or stop them from getting the ball in.  
  
Q. First for Christine and then for BreAnna. Coach was talking about
celebrating a little early. Was it difficult to keep the emotions in check and
be able to finish it out as the lead progressively shrank?  
CHRISTINE FLORES: I think, when you get ahead, you get a little physical.
That's something we have to keep our composure and keep the momentum going. I
think the energy and the fight that we had, it was always there. It kind of
lacked a little bit for one or two minutes. That's something we can't afford
to do. They're a very good team. Obviously, they're going to take advantage of
those one or two minutes that we take time off.  
BREANNA BROCK: My thoughts on that, we have to expect to be there. Obviously,
that was an awesome position for us to be in. Like Christine said, we did get
a little lackadaisical. At the same time, we picked it up and did what we had
to do. Oklahoma State is a very good team. We just have to take it for what it
is.  
  
Q. For Christine and then BreAnna. Obviously, you guys are running off a lot
of emotion. For all the ups and downs you guys have been through in your
careers, what did this mean for you guys?  
CHRISTINE FLORES: It means so much. It's something that we know that we can
do. I mean, day in, day out, we've gone into practice, and we have had that
same energy every day. And it's something that we see all the time. So the
fact that we finally produced and brought it to the floor come game time, it
meant the world. I mean, as a senior, that's something that you want.  
Of course you want it every game, but I'll take it right now.  
BREANNA BROCK: This is just the position we worked for all season. As
Christine said, we worked for this the whole season. We've had our ups and
downs. But at the same time, at the end of the day, we go back to practice and
just work our tails off and watch film and do what we have to do.  
This is an awesome position to be in. I mean, especially as seniors, as me and
Christine have been here, we haven't won our first game in the conference
tournament. This is an awesome position. This is just the beginning of it. We
just have to keep going up.  
  
Q. BreAnna, I want a follow ‑up on something that you said and maybe have
you stand on it a little bit. I wrote it down. We just have to expect to be
there. I was here five years ago the last time this team won in this
tournament. You were not. This team won a couple of games in Big 12 all
season. Now, I've seen you practice, and I've seen you play, but I want you to
maybe explain a little bit more for people maybe that haven't how this team
could expect‑‑ you used that word. How could this team expect to win this
game?   
BREANNA BROCK: We have to expect success from the start. That's something the
coaching staff has implemented throughout the whole season. We have to go game
by game, practice by practice, and we just have to expect.  
I mean, if we don't expect to be at the top, we're not going to get there. We
have to know that we're going to win. We have to know that we're going to make
that play. We have to know that we're going to go out there and handle our
business and do what we've practiced so hard for the whole season.  
THE MODERATOR: Anything more for Coach or the student‑athletes? Ladies, go get
some rest. We'll see you tomorrow. Congratulations.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2012

  

### [Tiffany Bias](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22720)

### [Jim Littell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23326)

### [Toni Young](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21844)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Missouri 72  
Oklahoma State 68

  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by the Oklahoma State Cowgirls. Jim Littell,
the coach and our two student‑athletes. Again, we ask out of respect we
maintain our questions to basketball. Coach, your opening thoughts.  
COACH LITTELL: First, give credit to Missouri. I thought they played very
inspired and very confident basketball tonight. They had some seniors that
stepped up. They attacked us at the post area, and their two post players, I
think, ended up having 39 points and 23 rebounds. That was probably the
difference in the game.  
I was worried about this, having a quick turnaround after a game in Stillwater
on Saturday, on the maturity we would show and realizing it was a different
setting and it was a tournament game. We didn't guard‑‑ give them credit
again, but we didn't guard like we have guarded the last four or five games.
Really don't understand that when we get in this setting.  
They shot it extremely well, shot 45 percent. For most of the year, we've held
people in the 30 percent. And we're not going to win when we allow somebody to
score that many points. We just don't have the ability to match that
offensively.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach. We'll now take questions from the floor. If
you would, please, give your name and affiliation.  
  
Q. Tiffany and Toni, can you talk about the comeback? You looked dead there
in the middle of the second half. Then you got it back to a three ‑point game
by the game's end. What happened down the stretch that you were able to get
back in the game?   
TIFFANY BIAS: We really didn't play tough defense for the whole game until
maybe the last ten minutes. We got some fire under our belt, and we decided to
play and relax.  
I think the whole game we were kind of just playing timid and not really
playing our game. We weren't defending and weren't executing on the offense. I
think we kind of got a beat off each other and started playing and started
hitting shots actually.  
  
Q. Toni, Jim talked about this, about how they really hurt you inside early.
When they moved their offense out after that. Why were they so successful
early, do you think? And then at points in the game they were able to really
hurt you in the paint.  
TONI YOUNG: We were letting them establish their spot too deep inside the
paint, and that kind of dug us a hole there. We should have had them pushed
out about 15 feet and made them play like they were guards instead of their
comfortable spot on the block.  
  
Q. To either one of you girls, do you worry that this game cost you a chance
at the NCAA Tournament?  
TIFFANY BIAS: I mean, we are worried about that. We really needed to get this
win. But I think we just pray and hope that we get a bid in. I mean, we can't
really do anything about it now. I mean, we just pray for it.  
  
Q. Toni, it looked like to start the second half you guys were trying to
pressure, full ‑court pressure and speed up the tempo. Didn't work at first.
They really got on a run. But it seemed later that the tempo and the pressure
really worked in your favor. Is that an accurate assessment? What did you
think in terms of the pressure you applied and tried to speed up Missouri?   
TONI YOUNG: We went from a press to a four‑man front, and I think it got them
out of their comfort zone and caused a few turnovers and got us back in the
game.  
  
Q. Regarding your concern for this game costing a chance to get into the
tournament.  
COACH LITTELL: It was definitely a big game, and there were some other
circumstances that occurred too on Sunday when Oklahoma lost to KU, and it
gave them their eighth win. And then when Texas beat Texas A&M, and it gave
them their eighth win. If some of those things don't happen, we may be
finishing sixth alone.  
You've got to learn to control your own destiny and take care of your own
business and make sure that we get a win. I'm not sure what's going to happen
in the selection committee. I know we would have enhanced our opportunities a
lot with the win and then going on and playing Oklahoma and seeing what
happened there.  
But we finished with eight wins in the No.1 RPI conference in America. It's
got a lot of great teams in it, and you see a lot of teams within this
conference that just beat up on each other all year long. Baylor is obviously
head and shoulders above everybody in this league, but when your second place
team finishes with, I believe, seven losses, it tells you how competitive this
league is. And 2 through 10 on a given night, they're very good.  
You follow Missouri, and prior to us playing them on Saturday, they had the
six games before, they had won two of those games. They took Iowa State to
overtime in Ames. They led Texas A&M by five with about 2:30 to go. So this is
a good team. I mean, they battled everybody off. And it was a team that really
didn't have a whole lot to lose tonight. Played loose, played confident, and
hit big shots.  
So I guess I'm not answering the question very well, but I'm not very sure on
how it's going to be viewed. I just know we played in a great conference, and
2 through 10, it was very, very competitive and very even.  
  
Q. Jim, why do you think you got back in the game? 12 minutes left after
you're down 25. And in the last minute, you're down six, then five, then four,
then three.  
COACH LITTELL: We just defended better. We just defended better and played
with more of a sense of urgency that every possession was crucial. You know,
the first six, seven minutes of the game, I don't think they made a shot that
wasn't a two‑footer.  
So we dug ourselves too big a hole. I'm proud of what we did the last six or
seven minutes, but you can't fall that far behind a team that's capable of
making shots and making free throws and expect to win. We just dug ourselves a
big grave on it, and it was too much to overcome.  
To answer your question, we played with just more of a sense of urgency, and
we played a lot harder the last eight to ten minutes of the game than we did
the first 30. You can't do that in a game that has this magnitude to it.  
  
Q. Tiffany, can you just talk about ‑‑ this is a young team obviously. Talk
about the progress and the perseverance the team showed. If this is the end of
the season, either way, the kind of fight this team showed this year.   
TIFFANY BIAS: I mean, we fought well. It sucks that we had to wait until now
to find this game. I think it shows a lot for our team. It shows a lot of
heart and a lot of desire and a lot of passion for this game. Our team is
still growing and we're still young. I don't want to have that as an excuse or
use it as an excuse, but every game you can see us progress.  
It wasn't really the first 32 or anything like that, but throughout this whole
season, we have progressed and grown as a team. So I'm proud of them.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you all very much for joining us. Best of luck to you.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

### [Kayla McBride](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23276)

### [Natalie Novosel](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22174)

  
_HARTFORD, CONNECTICUT_  
  

Connecticut  63  
Notre Dame  54

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach an opening statement, please?  
COACH McGRAW: I thought Connecticut played really well. They outplayed us
today. Particularly Lewis and Hartley really, really played extremely well. I
thought it was a hard fought battle and a really good game.  
I thought in the first half we were only down one without having Natalie
Novosel in the game for a big chunk in the half. I thought we'd be better in
the second half, and we just didn't shoot it well. For us to shoot better from
the three‑point line than two‑point, and couldn't even make a free throw.  
I think we really did some things that didn't help us, but they came out and
really won the game. It was a great game. They just played better.  
  
Q. Skylar, can you talk about that run at the end of the first half that cut
UCONN's lead and just what was working there for you?  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: I thought Kayla came in and did a good job and gave us some
good minutes. (No microphone) the rebound was pushing more. We just knocked
some shots down and got locked out on defense.  
  
Q. Can you talk about that second half? What did UCONN do defensively that
hurt your shooting?  
KAYLA McBRIDE: I think they knew our offense, and they were just kind of
keeping us out of it instead of attacking it. I think we kind of got
complacent a little bit, and just weren't in our attack mode that we're
usually in. They're just boxing out and rebounding.  
  
Q. Natalie, can you talk about what the next week and a half is going to be
like for you guys? The resolve you're going to have to have to put this behind
you and move forward?  
NATALIE NOVOSEL: Yeah, it's going to be really important to forget this game
and move on from it. And you know, taking it one game at a time now. I think
we're just going to get back in the gym and just prepare ask get back to
fundamentals and play our own basketball and forget this game.  
  
Q. Natalie, how much does this loss take away from the great things that
you've done this season? Does it diminish it at all in your eyes? How would
you put it in perspective?  
NATALIE NOVOSEL: It's definitely one of our goals and we wanted to achieve it.
But at the same time, we still have the biggest one of them all ahead of us.
We got knocked down, but we're going to get back up. We're going to look
forward and try to get the big one.  
  
Q. Skylar, would you now say that you look at UCONN as a rival?  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: I think it's always been that. We meet them so many times and
they're such a good team. They always have a good program. As many times as we
meet them, I would call it that.  
  
Q. This year is a little different than last year following the championship
game because you were the No. 1 seed this year. Can you talk about what this
next week is going to be like for you, how you recover from this one and the
mindset you have to have going into the tournament?  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: This team's not a team that hangs their head. I'm sure they'll
be talking tomorrow and being in the gym and watching film and seeing what we
can learn from things like that. We'll be back in the gym tomorrow, right back
at it like Natalie said. The biggest goal of them all is ahead of us. We're
only guaranteed one game. This is a great game going into the tournament.  
This is a Final Four team, championship caliber team. It's great for us to
play in the Big East and play these competitive games going into the
tournament. We'll learn from it when we get in the gym tomorrow and throughout
the week, and we have to practice hard and get ready for that first tournament
game.  
  
Q. Natalie, what did you see as the biggest difference for Hartley and
Mosqueda ‑Lewis tonight as opposed to a week or a day ago, the difference in
the game?   
NATALIE NOVOSEL: We allowed them to get some looks early on and gave them
confidence. They were able to get in a flow offensively, and we did a poor job
of communicating on screens. The girls were able to knock down some shots and
get their confidence. That's what enabled their momentum.  
  
Q. As you analyze this game, what was the problem offensively? Was it
something Connecticut did or was it just the passing just wasn't there for you
tonight?  
COACH McGRAW: I think Connecticut's a great defensive team, and they
definitely really affected some of our shots. But I thought we were down 5.
Skylar missed a short jumper in the lane, maybe a five‑footer. Natalie
followed it up with an eight‑footer, wide open in the lane. Missed it. We had
some wide open looks late. I thought that we just couldn't make, and I think
that defeated us a little bit.  
We had a chance to really cut the lead to 1, and we couldn't get a rebound. I
think we got defeated after that.  
  
Q. Kelly Faris had a couple of big threes. Just talk about the lift she
gives them when she's coming out and stepping out and the two threes she
made?  
COACH McGRAW: Yeah, I thought the one after the travel was critical. That was
critical. It was a big swing in the game. It could have been our ball, and
instead they missed it, and she made the shot. So I thought that was a
critical point in the game. Also the other one I thought was a dagger, the
other one she made. So that was poor defense on our part.  
  
Q. What's your first read on this team following this loss, and how you
think they're going to handle this next week and a half?  
COACH McGRAW: I think we'll respond well. I think we have responded well after
losses. We haven't had a lot of practice, but I think they don't like to lose.
So they'll be ready to go. It could be a good thing.  
  
Q. Talk about UCONN in the last five minutes of this game compared to the
last five minutes in the two previous match ‑ups?   
COACH McGRAW: Well, they're on the floor the whole time. I think the
difference is the confidence level. They got a lead, which was key. Then they
used the shot clock very well. Even when they weren't scoring, they were
getting rebounds and getting it back. We had the ball for two minutes, it
seemed, and until we eventually fouled them. They managed the game better,
they managed the clock better. Of Course when you have the lead it's a little
easier to do that.  
  
Q. Do you sense this rivalry and this match ‑up becoming huge for women's
basketball? It's been an intense three years and so many really great games
between the two teams.   
COACH McGRAW: It's a great rivalry. We look forward to it. It's great having
two great teams like this in the league that can really prepare each other for
the NCAA Tournament. So I like playing them every year.  
  
Q. Coming out of this tournament, what is your biggest concern as far as
what you need to work on to get ready for the NCAAs?  
COACH McGRAW: I don't have a lot of concerns coming out of this game. I'm
looking at the shooting and saying we missed a whole bunch of shots that we
normally make, and they did play great defensively, but they didn't guard us
at the free‑throw line. I think we can shoot the ball better and then the
rebounding. That was key. We really need to do a better job rebounding. They
really beat us up on the boards.  
  
Q. You played them six times in the finals now and lost all six. What's it
going to take for you guys to get over the hump of beating them in this
championship game, do you think?  
COACH McGRAW: Well, I think this is probably maybe the only time we've been a
No. 1 seed. It's tough to beat a good team three times. I don't know. I mean,
we won here Monday, so I don't really think that we have to do anything
different. I don't think there is more pressure on us. I don't think we did
anything different. I just think they outplayed us.  
  
Q. Coach, you talked about the way UCONN was playing with confidence down
the stretch. But for those of us who have seen them a lot this season, they
have played confidently in this tournament. When you watched them last night
against St. John's, did you sense a different UCONN team than the one that was
in South Bend than the one you beat last Monday?  
COACH McGRAW: Absolutely. I think they came out with a lot more fire. I
thought the game was over pretty quickly last night. I think when you come in
and play a team and avenge a loss like that, it's going to be more. It was
similar to our game against West Virginia.  
So I definitely think they were riding on a high and came into this game with
a lot more confidence than they started the tournament.  
  
Q. Can emotion impact the game? Auriemma's going for his 800th there.
They've lost to you twice, home court, is there a wave of emotion that you
have to battle in this kind of situation?  
COACH McGRAW: I think we have to battle our own emotion. I think we got
frustrated early with some things that weren't working, and now we get into
foul trouble. I don't think we handled it as well as we have. All year we've
been a poised, constant team all year long, and I didn't feel that as much
today.  
I think our emotion was not as good, I think, as it's been.

_HARTFORD, CONNECTICUT_  
  

Connecticut  63  
Notre Dame  54

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, an opening statement?  
COACH AURIEMMA: You know, when you play in these kind of games and you go
through what it takes first to get to this point of the season, knowing what
you have to go through for the last five months and then you find yourself in
this situation, as did Notre Dame and two teams that know each other so well,
you just hope that it's a great game. You hope that both teams play their
hearts out.  
I know my players are exhausted, and they should be. I think they're a little
bit more grown up now than they were a week ago, and they've come a long way.
It seems like they've come a long way in a short period of time since last
week, but really they've been building on this since September. It just wasn't
apparent what it was going to be like, and now they found out what it can be
like.  
I'm thrilled for them. The championship, I know they're exhausted about it,
but if you were in our locker room, you would know that the championship is
important, but I think the other stuff, the intangible stuff that I think came
out of this weekend, is maybe even more important. So I want to congratulate
them, the players, Notre Dame for an unbelievable year.  
I told Muffet to do what they did in our league this year was pretty amazing.
To do what they did with their schedule is pretty amazing. I think we've got
two of the best teams in America coming out of our conference. I'll put our
conference up against any other conference in America, and I don't think we
take a back seat to anybody, ever. And I think tonight, you saw why.  
  
Q. Kaleena, can you just address the way you guys were able to fight tonight
and make the little things work well and come out and get this win?  
KALEENA MOSQUEDA‑LEWIS: I think we just really wanted it, you know. We've been
working towards this, like Coach said, since the beginning of the season. We
felt like with the losses that we had, it all had to do with the mindset that
we had. So tonight we came out tough, we came out aggressive, and I think we
just wanted it enough and we played our hearts out tonight.  
  
Q. Bria, the fire you played with tonight, does that kind of go back to
Monday night when the starters went off the court with about 3:00 left in that
game? Was there a message that was received and implemented tonight?  
BRIA HARTLEY: I think it proves that we had some fight in. Every time we step
on the court we want to go out and prove that we play hard. We're going to
fight, and we're going to fight to the end no matter what happens. I think us
sitting out that last three minutes, didn't seem like we had that much fight.  
So tonight, no matter what we did, no matter if Notre Dame went on a run or
anything, we made sure we came back and made plays.  
  
Q. Tiffany, how important was it to win like you did? You had the least, you
lost it, then Notre Dame took the lead and you came back and kind of took the
game away. How important was it to win like that?  
TIFFANY HAYES: I think it was big. Like Bria just said, we gave up in a couple
of games before, and we just wanted to show everybody that we did have fight
in us. For us to come back, even though they went on their run, we went on
ours and kept pushing it at them. We ended up getting the win because of it.  
  
Q. Stefanie, a big part of this game was the rebounding tonight. Can you
talk about the difference that you guys made in the lane and were you guys
able to handle that?  
STEFANIE DOLSON: Well, we knew coming out into this game that like you said it
was going to be a huge emphasis for us. I think we did a great job of just
making sure all the guards were boxed out, making sure Devereaux was boxed
out. We just went after the ball. We had the mindset tonight of being so
aggressive. We went after every, every ball. We had so many hustle plays. It
wasn't just rebounds. It was everything.  
  
Q. Tiffany, for a player who didn't lose a game in her first two years here,
how much did losing three straight to Notre Dame prey on you and weigh on your
mind? How does it affect your teammates too?  
TIFFANY HAYES: It's hard to lose any game, and to lose to one team three
straight times doesn't sit well. I don't think it would sit well with anyone.
But with this team, we just knew we were better than we had played in those
last couple games. So we just wanted to come out tonight, and like we already
said, we wanted to fight until the end.  
  
Q. Tiffany, last week we heard how important it was for Notre Dame to win
that first championship for Coach McGraw. How important was it to you guys to
get number 800 here and win the championship for Coach Auriemma?  
TIFFANY HAYES: It was very important. To be honest, I think he's one of the
best coaches, and he definitely deserved it. I think we owe him that much.
We've been through a lot this year as a team, and it was just nice to get the
win at home in front of a big crowd. Yeah, we got the championship.  
  
Q. Bria, last time out you and the other guards were outplayed. What did
you, Kelly and Tiffany do different this time?  
BRIA HARTLEY: I think we took care of the ball, one thing they force a lot of
turnovers the first two times we played them. We worked on handling pressure
and making good passes. We did that, and tonight we came out and played hard
defense and got steals and just took it to them the entire game.  
  
Q. Geno, how much is this team finding its way this time of year can you
hope to control, and how much is it out of your hands?  
COACH AURIEMMA: You know, I think so much of what we do is out of our control,
really. Doug and I were talking last night about the kind of kids you recruit.
Because so much is out of your control, you have to recruit the kind of kid
that's kind of believe in what you're doing and they buy into what you're
doing. Because ultimately they're going to have to make the plays that are
going to determine the game. I don't think I was any smarter tonight than I
was a week ago Monday. I don't think, other than setting an agenda for a team,
I don't think coaches can control as much as they think they can.  
The one thing we wanted to control tonight was how and what our approach was.
Whether we won the game or not, that wasn't necessarily within our control,
but our approach to the game was definitely within our control. How difficult
it would be for them to rebound the ball was certainly within our control.  
Going forward though. Today's Tuesday. I wish the NCAA Tournament started
Saturday. This is the time when you really want to just keep going. So for us
to have to wait two weeks almost, it's difficult. So we'll have to work really
hard to try to hold on to this thing that we have right now.  
  
Q. Reading some of your comments yesterday, you mentioned about the UCONN
mentality and how it had kind of gotten lost a little bit. Do you think it was
maybe found a little bit tonight?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I think last night and tonight, for sure. Those of you that
follow our team and watched us play throughout the season, it was a little
different approach last night and tonight. You could see that something had
been missing when you compare that to our St. John's game, our last Notre Dame
game, our Marquette game. There are just a lot of games that just didn't play
out the way we had hoped.  
With these young players, if you're not careful, they think that winning is
Connecticut basketball. So we would look at them and say, Coach, we're like
25‑4, whatever we are, 25‑3\. Why do I get the sense you're not happy, Coach?
Because in their minds, we're winning. We're good.  
Then the Notre Dame game comes up and reminds them, no, that's not how you
measure whether you're good or not. You measure whether you're good whether
you're playing Connecticut basketball other ways, not just by whether you won
or lost.  
So, yeah, we got it back last night. We got it back a little more tonight, and
hopefully now we can, as Graham said, we can hold on to it for three weekends,
right? It's three weekends now. Amazing. Amazing. Good. Three weeks from now
I'll be done. I hope it goes three weeks. Could be done next weekend.  
  
Q. Geno, you talked last night about the underdog mentality a little bit and
how you didn't want to be the underdog. You hate underdogs and all that other
stuff. You won five straight now in the conference tournament. What's been
through this year coming together in this last few ‑‑ you mentioned you were
not the favorite coming in maybe, and to win this one with this group versus
two weeks ago to this weekend?   
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah, this is one thing we talked about. We've been talking
about this a lot this year, and it's kind of hit home now for them. We have a
couple players that have won two National Championships. Caroline was part of
one; Tiffany was part of two; and Kelly was part of two. But in those two
National Championships, they were kind of like the shortstop and second
baseman whose job was don't hurt the team.  
Play good defense, turn the double‑play when you can, and move the runner
along. But the number two, three, and four five hitters are going to carry us.  
So all of a sudden, you look up and there is no Tina; there is no Renee; there
is no Maya, and you start to figure things out for yourself. Like our team is
going to have to win it. Sometimes that's a scary feeling because you don't
know whether you can do it or not. You don't know whether can you do it or
not.  
Tonight and last night they weren't looking for Maya Moore. They weren't
looking for Tina. They weren't looking for Renee. They kind of looked over and
looked at each other and said this is what we've got. This one feels really
good for them, I think, because it's theirs. They own this one. The other
ones, I'm sure there is a feeling like, yeah.  
But this one, they own it. Those guys really, really own this one, and I think
it feels way better than the other ones that they've won.  
  
Q. You had a ten ‑point lead in the first half‑‑  
COACH AURIEMMA: Why do you have to go back there?  
  
Q. They obviously cut it to one without Natalie and without Devereaux. What
was their message and demeanor at the half?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Actually it wasn't bad. I've learned my lesson with this
group. There are not a lot of tough guys in this group. I can't go in there
like when we had Diana, and Sveta, and Tina and those guys when they were
older. I can't go in there and rant and rave and start throwing things around.
Because back then they'd throw it back at me. I'd have to duck because it
would be flying back at me. These guys, you have to be really careful how you
deal with them.  
So what was disappointing was that we worked so hard to get that 27‑17 lead.
It was so taxing. I mean, we just played our butts off. Then all of a sudden,
we just took the foot off the gas pedal, and we just stopped. They're not
going to go away. This isn't like any team you're playing. This is Notre Dame.  
So when they came at us, we started doing the same thing that cost us last
Monday. Everybody becoming tentative. Afraid to make the next pass. Wondering
where our next score was going to come from. And the last three was my fault.
That was my fault. That was totally my fault, and we went in at halftime and
talked about, you know what, I think we're better than them tonight.  
They've been better than us a lot the last couple months, but I just said I
think we're better than them tonight. They're not going to lose. Notre Dame's
not going to lose this game. We have to beat them. So let's not go out there
and play like we played the last seven minutes like, oh, my God, who is going
to make a shot? We need a couple heroes tonight because they're not going to
lose.  
They're like we used to be a couple years ago. We're not going to lose to
anybody. You have to beat us. I think that's the one thing that feels really
good is I don't think Notre Dame‑‑ I mean, I'm sure they feel a certain way
about it. I don't know, but we beat them. I don't think they lost to us. I
think we beat them. They might feel like they lost to us, but we feel like we
beat them.  
  
Q. You talked about how they have to look to each other and all, but they're
still looking and seeing number 23. Is this like the old Michael Jordan? It's
got to be the shoe commercial. It's the jersey.  
COACH AURIEMMA: I don't know. She just makes it look so effortless. She makes
it look so easy that when the shot doesn't go in, you almost look appalled
like, "What happened?" She came out and missed that wide open shot on the wing
right in front of me. We had a time out, and I looked at her and said, "Do you
need to come out? Are you all right?"  
And she was taken back. Like, yeah, why. I said, "You're not supposed to miss
that." Like every shot she takes was supposed to go in.  
She's done that. She's done that to me. She's done that to our team. She's
made us feel that way. She's just one of those special kids. She's unique. Not
many people are wired like that. She is. God bless her. She took that first
half and made it what it was.  
Then Bria took the second half parts of it and made it what it was. She took
apart the second half and what it what it was. Kelly Faris made some shots
that no one in the building thought she could make and made it what it was,
and Stefanie.  
So it was the kind of game where all five players, and Caroline might have
played one of her best games and she didn't score. It's been a real struggle
to get her to do that because she feels left out. Everybody else is making
shots. Everybody else is having fun, and I'm not. Now we're trying to get her
to understand that tonight was fun, and she understands it.  
I think Kaleena, in some of our other big games did the same thing she did
tonight. But then everybody started look to go her to do it the whole game,
and when she didn't, we lost. Tonight they helped her a little bit. They
helped her a little bit, and it was incredibly rewarding. I'm really thrilled
for them.

_HARTFORD, CONNECTICUT_  
  

Notre Dame -73  
West Virginia  45

  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us is Coach Muffet McGraw along with Skylar Diggins,
Natalie Novosel, and sophomore guard Kayla McBride. Coach, an opening
statement, please?  
COACH McGRAW: We were happy to avenge our loss. I thought we played well right
from the start. We got out of the ball and shot the ball really well.
Defensively did a much better job on their guards in particularly and thought
we did a good job. We had really good balance today which we didn't have last
time. So overall really pleased with the win.  
  
Q. Kayla, can you talk about your game today? You are 17 of 30 shooting in
your last three games hire in Hartford on this court. Can you talk a little
bit about your shooting performance in this stretch?  
KAYLA McBRIDE: I think it's just taking advantage of my opportunities. My
teammates gave me the ball, so I think I just like the atmosphere, and I was
just letting it go.  
  
Q. Natalie, we sat here last Monday night and you guys said how winning the
Big East outright was something you guys wanted to do for Coach. You're now
one game away from a similar position trying to take your first tournament
championship for Notre Dame. The same sort of feeling?  
NATALIE NOVOSEL: Absolutely. We are right in the position where we want to be.
Tomorrow's game, there is no doubt in our mind that's we want to go in and win
that for Coach.  
  
Q. Skylar, can you talk about Kayla's game and how she's stepping it up at
the right time of the year?  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: I think Kayla is a player who can score, who can rebound, who
can guard a big, guard a guard. She can do it all. She's really taken
advantage of her opportunities when she gets the ball. She said we're giving
it to her where she's comfortable and she knows where to go.  
She makes herself very available to the high post area. I mean, you can give
it to her when she has a mismatch. She has a great handle. She can create her
own shot. She's a player that's really shown what she has and she's a great
shooter, but she also can bang in there with the bigs. I think she's doing her
job and playing her role to a T.  
  
Q. Natalie, can you talk about the way you guys started this game? Did you
come out here with attitude?  
NATALIE NOVOSEL: I think we came out here with a little fire in us. We were
excited when we saw we were playing West Virginia, and it gave us a chance to
avenge our home loss. We came out and started out really well. We shared the
basketball tonight, and I think that was huge to balance the scoring.  
  
Q. Skylar, can you talk a little about the opportunity to play in the Big
East tournament championship game?  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: I think it's great for our school, particularly in the season
that we've been having. This is great for us being able to avenge. We're
excited for the opportunity to compete for a Big East championship. We
mentioned, all of us have, what that would mean to us, as a program and to
Coach McGraw. So it's a great opportunity to show we have an atmosphere like
this in a tough conference like the Big East.  
  
Q. You just looked like you were really emphatic in that pregame huddle just
before the game started. Can you talk about the tone you tried to set before
the beginning of the game?  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: Just the intensity. I wasn't pleased with the start. Wanted to
make sure we didn't come out with that start against a team like this who had
beat us. I didn't need to light much of a fire underneath us. We were up for
this game already.  
But just making sure and reiterating some things that we needed to make sure
we needed to do. One of them in particular was making sure that we start off
with a lot of energy.  
  
Q. Kayla, are you doing anything different in terms of looking for your
shots? Are you reading defenses better? How are you getting more space to get
that shot that you want?  
KAYLA McBRIDE: I think it's just being more comfortable playing with my
teammates. After sitting out last year it took me a little long tore get back
in rhythm. But I think right now in this stretch I really need to step it up
for my teammates and just do what I do best, and that's get the ball in the
basket, I guess.  
  
Q. You guys made I think eight of your first ten shots or nine of your first
ten shots, something like that. It looked like every one of them was open, and
you guys ran through your stuff. Offensively, was that as well as you guys
could execute that first four, five, six minutes of the game?  
COACH McGRAW: Yeah, it really was. We came out with fire. We were ready to go,
and we were open. I think we took advantage of the opportunities and converted
early. I think that set the tone for the game.  
  
Q. What was your plan with Bussie and Dunning, the two West Virginia posts?
I know they got some points tonight, but you pretty much shut down everyone
else. Is that pretty much what you were looking for?  
COACH McGRAW: Initially our plan was we were going to guard everybody
individually. We weren't going to double down until they started to beat us in
the posts. Devereaux was in the front as opposed to being behind. When she got
in foul trouble, we were going to double down off the other post.  
So we didn't do that quite as effectively. Brittany did a good job of leaving
her man in the second half. I think she was able to get out and really see it
coming. She's a really smart defensive player, so we relied on her to get the
double team for us. That was really the plan. Everybody guard their own man
and see if we could take them one‑on‑one in the block.  
  
Q. Can you talk about what it means when Kayla's getting her shots and how
it helps your offense?  
COACH McGRAW: She hasn't missed much tonight. We were trying to go to her as
much as we could. She had a big guy on her, and I didn't think they could
guard her on the perimeter, and they couldn't. So we were trying to work the
flair screen, and the ball screen with her in it. She was able to get free. I
think that was a difficult assignment for their post to guard her on the
perimeter, so we took advantage of it.  
  
Q. Off topic, but this is West Virginia's last game in the Big East. Lots of
people have made comments about team's leaving and the whole mix up of stuff.
But they've been a Big East school for the last long while, and they've been a
favorable school. Everyone seems to enjoy them. What's it mean what they've
brought to the Big East in their time here?  
COACH McGRAW: I think West Virginia's always been a tough place to play. He's
done a really great job, especially this year, losing four starters and coming
back. When you play their teams, you know that they're going to be well
coached. They're going to be great defensive teams. They're one of the best
defensive teams in the country.  
Mike does a really good job. This year he could have been "Coach of the Year".
He really got that team going. I think they're a team that's always in the
hunt. It's always a difficult game for us. So we wish them well as they leave
the conference.  
  
Q. Devereaux only played 20 minutes tonight. Was that a preventative thing
to stretch her out a little bit?  
COACH McGRAW: Well, we're just resting her up for tomorrow. I would have
played her more if she didn't have four fouls. But once she got into foul
trouble and we didn't need her at the end, she was able to get a lot of rest.
So I think that was probably a good thing?

_HARTFORD, CONNECTICUT_  
  

Notre Dame -73  
West Virginia  45

  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us is Coach Mike Carey. Coach, an opening statement,
please?  
COACH CAREY: Unlike a lot of coaches, they just kick our butt. I'm not going
to make executions for our team. They just beat us. They did exactly what they
need to do. They have more energy. They played harder and they just beat us.  
I told the girls there for the game we're not going to use an excuse we're
tired, something happened, whatever. We didn't come out ready to play, and
they did, and that's what happens when you play good teams.  
We go to the NCAA, and we're going to play all good teams. We're going to make
a decision that we're going to come out and play, or we're going to stand
around and watch the other team play. If we do, that's going to be a short
tournament for us.  
  
Q. Ayana, did you get the sense that they had more motivation because of the
time you guys beat them in South Bend? They wanted to come out and show they
were ready to play tonight?  
AYANA DUNNING: I think we knew they were going to come out with a chip on
their shoulder. The coach told us the first eight minutes they were going to
try to just get the lead on us, and unfortunately we didn't come out ready to
play. That's what they did. We got ourselves down so much at the beginning of
the game, it was hard. We were just trying to fight back the entire time.  
  
Q. Asya, you guys have been so good defensively, how frustrating was it
early in the game when it seemed they were able to score every single time
they wanted to? It's got to be frustrating for a team like you that prides
themselves on defense?  
ASYA BUSSIE: It was frustrating. We do pride ourselves on defense and we
didn't defend. They got whatever they wanted offensively. Like Ayana said, we
were trying to dig ourselves out of a hole the entire game. We just didn't
defend.  
  
Q. Ayana, did you have a good feeling coming into the game? I know it's your
third game in three days. Did you feel like everybody was energized and ready
to go? Were you sensing that something was just not there tonight?  
AYANA DUNNING: It's tournament time. I don't think anybody can come out with
any excuse that they're tired or we played three game that's row. This is
Notre Dame's second game. So excuses go out the door at tournament time. It's
against the No. 1 seed. I think everybody should have been prepared for and
should have been excited to play. We came out flat. We should have come out
like we were excited to play.  
  
Q. Akilah, I noticed in the second half especially in maybe the last 15
minutes you seemed to be really hitting the boards and trying desperately to
get some rebounds and put backs. Can you talk about what energy you were
trying to bring to maybe turn things around?  
AKILAH BETHEL: (No microphone) I was just trying to pump everybody up because
I didn't want to lose, and I know my teammates didn't want to lose. We just
needed a spark to spark things off. Unfortunately we had such a big hole to
dig ourselves out of it was kind of hard.  
But I didn't want to let go, and I didn't want to give up. We still had time.
So until the buzzer was done, I wasn't going to stop.  
  
Q. Coach, it sounded like from what Ayana said you called the game perfectly
the first eight minutes with energy. They turned it up. They were up eight and
a half minutes in. Is there anything you could have done differently to
prepare for that run?  
COACH CAREY: Well, exactly. We knew they were going to. There was a lot of
talk and all that stuff. So we knew they were going to come out that first
eight minutes and try to bury it. I told them for two halves of the game last
night exactly that. They're going to come out and try to bury us. Told them
today again.  
We defended them the same way we defended them at Notre Dame. They ran their
same offense, we ran our same defense. They were like two steps quicker and we
stood around and why, I don't know. I don't know how we were not excited about
playing this game.  
You know, if you look at it teams are going to try to take away even Yaya, and
if you look at their shooting percentage, we've got to do a better job on the
perimeter. We turned it over trying to feed the post and they're sagging in on
the post we've got to move the ball and make their defense move, and we just
stood around on both ends, and it really showed.  
  
Q. Coach, Devereaux Peters three jumpers from that 12 to 10 range. She
usually doesn't do that. Can you talk about those shots and how that opens up
her game for her?  
COACH CAREY: You're exactly right. She usually keeps her back to the rim and
they run all those cuts and that's why we were sagging off. She hit three.
Again with six points, she's not going to beat us from that position right
there. Her strength is getting on the boards and defensively.  
We just didn't do a good job. We weren't up the lanes making them go back
door. There is no use sagging our post player like we were doing and staying
off Peters and letting them catch the ball on the perimeter. It was just
defeating the whole purpose.  
I thought we had a good plan. We just didn't execute it for whatever reason,
and give Notre Dame credit. They came out to play. I'm not like some of these
others that make excuses and don't give credit to the other team that beat
you. They beat us. They deserve to win. They were the better team today, and
give them all the credit.  
  
Q. I know coming down here you talked about the importance of winning some
games here to help your seed, if nothing else, do you think you've done that
with two wins?  
COACH CAREY: I don't see‑‑ I don't know. I don't really want to call that. We
felt coming in here we felt we could improve our seed, but how much. I'm
really not crazy about an 8, 9, because you turn around and play the No. 1 to
win the first round. But we have nobody to blame but ourselves.  
I told the players after the game don't think I'm not proud of these players,
because I am. I really am. I'm disappointed. Today I never thought we'd come
out and play flat like we did. But for the whole season, I'm very proud of the
players, and they deserve a lot of credit, especially Yaya and Asya and Jess
Hartley, what great leadership they provide. We've just got to get smarter and
that type of stuff.  
But with all that being said, we got beat today. Notre Dame was the better
team, still proud of what our girls have been able to accomplish today. I'm
not disappointed in them and our seed. And wherever we fall, there is no doubt
we'll be able to play and compete.  
  
Q. You talked a little about it yesterday, but now this is the last game in
the Big East. Talk about what it means to play in this conference as long as
you did.  
COACH CAREY: I mentioned that to the players after the game. I said for you
upperclassmen, this is not the way you want to go out. For younger classmen,
you really don't realize it. You had an opportunity to play on the big stage
in the semifinals against the number three team in the country, and we need to
come out ready to play.  
Me personally, I've said this yesterday, I love coaching in the Big East. I
love coaching against the great coaches and the friendships I've made in the
Big East. The teams are great. It's a great league. But we're moving to the
Big 12. That's a big challenge also. It's a great league and another challenge
for us. Everybody will move forward.  
Also, I said yesterday, fans of Connecticut have been tremendous. The people
of Hartford have been tremendous. I've really enjoyed playing Connecticut here
or at their gym, but I've enjoyed being here in front of the fans of
Connecticut, because I believe they're very educated in basketball, and they
support more their own team. They appreciate good play.  
I have mixed feelings. I have mixed feelings. But I'm going to miss the Big
East and miss a lot of the friends and everybody. But I'm sure I'll make new
friends, hopefully. I don't make friends easy, that's the problem. So
hopefully I'll make a couple friends in the Big 12.

_HARTFORD, CONNECTICUT_  
  

Connecticut  74  
St. Johns  43

  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us from Connecticut is head coach Geno Auriemma with
sophomore guard Bria Hartley, freshman forward Kaleena Mosqueda‑Lewis, and
sophomore center Stefanie Dolson. Coach, an opening statement, please?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Thank you. We just talked about it with the players in the
locker room that it's been a while since we've had an opportunity to kind of
be the team that we think we are. I don't know where we kind of lost it, but
we kind of became very walk‑it‑up, stagnant kind of a team.  
We tried really hard tonight to make sure that we were more of what we were
accustomed to being in December and late November. I thought the kids
responded great. We really asked them and challenged them to set a tempo and
set a tone for the game those first five minutes, and then being able to
sustain it for the entire game, and they were great. They were absolutely
fantastic.  
It's one of the better games and more complete games that we've played in a
long time. I'm glad to see it. I'm happy for them, and I know they feel
really, really good about it. When you beat a really good team like St.
John's, it feels good. We feel good about the way we played almost as good as
the win itself.  
  
Q. Kaleena, you said last night that you were certain that St. John's was
going to see a different team than the one they saw in February when you guys
lost. What gave you so much confidence that you would turn the corner?  
KALEENA MOSQUEDA‑LEWIS: I just know how my team is. I know they're strong, and
I know we're looking to head in a new direction. We're looking to be a more
confident team. And I knew coming out today we weren't going to let anything
stop us today.  
  
Q. In your first two games of your career against St. John's, I think you
had a combined six points and today you were up for 23. Talk about your effort
and what spurred you to go off like that today?  
STEFANIE DOLSON: Me personally, I think I came out with the right mindset
tonight. But I give most of the credit to my teammates. They were able to
really pass me the ball today perfectly. I don't think there were many passes
that they threw into me that weren't on point. So I give most of the credit to
them. I think we did a great job of screening for each other, and with that
came splits. It was just able to get me wide open and I finished.  
  
Q. For Bria and Stefanie, how much fun do you guys have when you're out
playing with rhythm like that and everyone's touching the ball, everyone's
moving and everyone's making their shots?  
BRIA HARTLEY: I think it's great. You could tell we were out there having a
lot of fun when everyone's in sync and we're getting the shots we want. And
yes, Stef's scoring and Kaleena's scoring. It's great for our team. We get a
lot of assists and we love sharing the ball. When we play like that, you can
tell that's Connecticut basketball.  
STUDENT‑ATHLETE: Pretty much what she said. We all get excited when everyone's
scoring and everyone's playing so well. So to go out there, and like she said,
to play UCONN basketball it feels great. I don't know, yeah.  
  
Q. Stefanie, we sat here a week ago tonight after the Notre Dame loss,
despondent may not be the word, but at a loss to what went wrong in that game.
What's changed from last week when you put together two really good games back
‑to‑back in the tournament? What's changed for you?   
STEFANIE DOLSON: I think we just come out with the right mindset. We've come
out and really executed on offense and played great defense. I think with our
team, the most important thing is defense, and that's really what sparks our
offense, which we did a great job tonight of getting steals and pushing the
ball up the court.  
I think we've come out with the right mindset of really being aggressive. And
like Kaleena said, confident with ourselves and our shots. I think we've been
doing a great job of it, and hopefully we can keep it up.  
  
Q. Bria, tonight you guys only had 12 turnovers. Can you talk about how
important that was to limit them after the game in Stores where you obviously
turned over more?  
BRIA HARTLEY: Every time we're playing we want to have not that many turnovers
and make sure we're getting good passes and getting the ball to the right
spot. So we took pride in taking care of the ball today. Even when they
pressured us, we made sure we were strong and got the passes where we needed
to be. So we just need to make sure we go out and play like that all the time.  
  
Q. Geno, a week ago tonight you guys sat here and you just lost. We don't
know what's wrong. We took a punch and didn't respond to it. The last two
games since then you've played 40 good minutes last night. Defensively tonight
I think 40 more good minutes. What's changed in this team the last week that's
got them the confidence and swagger back from the team we've been missing a
week ago tonight?  
COACH AURIEMMA: You know, we'll know more after tomorrow night. We're playing
one of the top two teams in the country, I think, tomorrow night. I think the
challenge ahead of us is much greater than it was last night or tonight, not
to minimize the two wins.  
But it's not easy playing at Connecticut when you're not good enough. It's not
easy when you don't have what it takes to win the way other teams have won,
because then you start to get down on yourself, and you start to feel like
you're inadequate. Then when Notre Dame does to you what they did to us last
Monday night, it just reinforces that maybe we're not good enough. You know,
maybe we play Baylor at Baylor, we had a chance to win, and we did. We played
at Notre Dame. We had a chance to win, and we did.  
So if you're not careful, you start to doubt. You start to think maybe we're
not good. So I think this past week was more about when I said it didn't
matter if you win the Big East tournament or not, I don't know that I feel any
different right now. I think it's more about getting back that Connecticut
mentality that you're talking about. That's what last night and tonight and
tomorrow night hopefully will be about getting back to who we were. Getting
back to what we think makes us good. We had lost that.  
So to me, that's a lot more important than losing the Big East regular season
championship. Losing our identity, losing who we are and what we do and how we
do things. That to me is much more of a loss than losing a regular season
championship. Tomorrow gaining back our identity, gaining back who we are is
way more important than winning another trophy.  
  
Q. That said, do you enjoy the fact that you're probably not the favorite?  
COACH AURIEMMA: No.  
  
Q. Why?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Pisses me off when we're not the favorite, because, you know,
that's where we're supposed to be. We always are. Why would you not want to
be? I'm not one of these guys that‑‑ don't you love when coaches and players
say all the pressure's on them? There is no pressure on us. We can just go out
and play. There is no pressure on us. Every time I read that, I can't wait to
beat that team by 30.  
We've got nothing to lose. Really? Then why are you coming out here and
playing if you've got nothing to lose? So I don't like that underdog stuff.
When you're a real underdog, that's great, and we might be. But for that game
tomorrow night, we are. We are on the other bench. We're wearing the wrong
uniform. We're in the wrong locker room.  
So, yeah, everybody expects Notre Dame to win. They're talented. They're
experienced. They're really good. They play well together. They're tough,
physically and mentally. They're exceptionally well coached. We've got nothing
to lose. I just want to show up and make sure that we play hard (laughing).  
  
Q. Coach, you've had so many good young players that have stepped in as
freshmen and sophomores that have played key roles in this program, yet there
have been ups ‑and‑downs. I think of a young Tina Charles and that sort of
thing that's probably driven you nuts. Where does Stefanie rank on that nuts
meter, if you will, and talk about how she played tonight.   
COACH AURIEMMA: The one thing that we're always looking to identify in kids
and the sooner you identify it the better, is whether or not they have a
certain competitive spirit. Tina had so much ability that even with a
non‑competitive spirit her freshman year, she could still get 15‑10 every
night.  
Stefanie doesn't have that kind of ability. She doesn't have Tina Charles'
ability. She's not the same kind of athlete like Tina. She doesn't have Tina's
size and quickness and all that other good stuff. So she has to rely more on
basic skills and a competitiveness that's going to make her better.  
For long stretches at a time this year, Stefanie's competitive spirit went
away. I think last year she kind of used Maya as her competitiveness, and this
year she had to find it within herself. A lot of times she couldn't find it
and got frustrated. And in the Notre Dame game last Monday, it was there.
Tonight it was there. Last night it was there. So that's important to me, to
her, to our team.  
Because when she has that and she's playing with that kind of confidence and
that kind of competitiveness, then we're a whole different team. We're a much
different team it takes much pressure off our players when she's playing like
that.  
  
Q. It seems tonight was going like redemption tonight. It seems the games
were very similar, both you and Notre Dame got off to quick starts and they
made a little run, and you run the game open like Notre Dame did. Was that
just the natural course of thing that's the two better teams took care of
business as they needed to?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, winning the regular season championship isn't as hard as
it used to be in a lot of ways. It used to be really hard going into the
regular season because you have to play everybody twice home and away, and it
was a bitch. So you could identify back in the day who was the best team in
the league, because they proved it over a period of time.  
Now with the schedules being what they are, you have schedules of all the top
20 teams on the road, sometimes you have them all at home, it kind of clouds
what that means. But having said that, the best team in our league is Notre
Dame. They've proven it. They've proven it since day one. They're the best
team in our league.  
We're the next best team in the league. I would think that we're the two team
that's should be playing in a championship game tomorrow. What happened in the
regular season where West Virginia won and Notre Dame and St. John's won at
Connecticut, that's supposed to happen. That should happen more often
throughout the league, and I think it did this year, more so than before.  
But when it comes to the Big East tournament and the two best teams that
should be playing tomorrow night, the two best teams are playing tomorrow
night. Sometimes in a tournament it doesn't work that way and there are
upsets, but in this case tomorrow night the number one and number two teams in
the Big East are playing and as it should be. They deserve it and so do we.

_HARTFORD, CONNECTICUT_  
  

Connecticut  74  
St. Johns  43

  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us is head coach Kim Barnes Arico along with senior
forward Da'Shena Stevens and junior guard Nadirah McKenith. Coach, an opening
statement, please?  
COACH BARNES ARICO: I thought Connecticut played really well tonight. I knew
it was going to be a difficult task for us, but I thought we would have played
a little bit better. I don't think we played very well. Connecticut did a
great job. Part of that reason was because of their pressure, but we turned
the ball over way too much.  
But we faced, I think, a really great team tonight. A Final Four team. So it
was a tough game for us, but we've got to regroup and get ready for the
tournament.  
  
Q. I know this loss is fresh in your minds, but can you put in perspective
what you went through this Big East season? It was a breakthrough year and
finishing second in the conference, what it's meant for you guys?  
COACH BARNES ARICO: It's kind of so hard because you end on a note like this
and you really want to appreciate what the kids have been able to do all
season. I just tried to talk to them a little bit there in the hallway and
say, and I think they felt embarrassed because they weren't playing well, and
they played so well leading up to this that they were disappointed and
frustrated and embarrassed. But tomorrow's a new day and what they've been
able to accomplish this year has been incredible.  
To beat UCONN at UCONN and break that streak and do all that, we knew that
coming here tonight and playing them in Hartford in the Big East tournament
was going to be a tall task. We knew that they were going to be prepared. They
probably wanted to play us more than anyone, except maybe Notre Dame, but
they'll have a shot at that tomorrow.  
It was a tough game for us, but our year has been tremendous, and I think
we've really accomplished things that we've never been able to accomplish
before, and our kids have really played tremendous all year. Like I said, I
wish we could erase tonight. And I'm sure at some point when I look back on
the year and maybe a couple days, I'll get back to how good of a year it was.  
  
Q. Da'Shena, Stefanie Dolson had struggled against you guys in the previous
two meetings in her career. She scored six points total. Tonight she goes off
with 23. What was it about the inside game tonight that worked for them?  
DA'SHENA STEVENS: I think she just wants to come in the game and get the ball
inside. Just try to throw us off. I think that sometimes we forgot to rotate
or rotate down and help off sometimes. I think she's really determined to
score tonight and get good position. Sometimes we got caught behind. When you
get that far behind, there is really nothing you can do.  
  
Q. Why was it so hard for you guys to get into a rhythm? Was it specifically
something Notre Dame did? Was it fatigue playing in an overtime game? Can you
pinpoint why it was so tough?  
NADIRAH McKENITH: I think tonight we didn't come out and play aggressive as we
normally do. We just give credit to UCONN. They came out and fought hard. They
wanted this game more than anything. In the beginning of the game, we kind of
struggled and never recuperated and regained from the struggle. I think we'll
just get better in practice and preparing for the tournament.  
  
Q. If you could talk about the progress over the past four years, three
years and finally having a No. 2 seed in this tournament and how it feels to
have progressed in your time at St. John's?  
DA'SHENA STEVENS: It's been great. Besides this loss, I think we have been
improving and just showing progress. I think we probably won eight straight to
close the season off. But to be a part of something like that and to keep
showing progress every year, and this year we got the second seed.  
We beat teams that we probably weren't supposed to beat. I just think it shows
where the program's going and just how we keep improving with each year.  
  
Q. Kim, two games tonight were very similar in a sense, redemption for Notre
Dame and then for UCONN. Mike said that he figured going in that the first
eight minutes were going to be key to them. That Notre Dame's going to try to
throw the knockout punch, and they did. Did you have the same feeling going in
that had you to get to ‑‑ I know you played four minutes at a time, but to get
through the first two stretches to get in the spot you want to be in?   
COACH BARNES ARICO: Yeah, I felt exactly the same way. When we played up at
Connecticut, they came out 11‑3\. We took a timeout, and that's how a lot of
games go with them. If you can keep it close, maybe you can hang around. But
if they take off on you, it's hard to recover.  
Up at Connecticut, they went up 11‑3 called a timeout, and then went on a 12‑0
run after that. So I was hoping today it was stuck at 19‑8 for a couple
possessions, and we had two bad turnovers. I just thought they did a better
job, Connecticut did a better job tonight of forcing us into turnovers. We
didn't handle their pressure well. Normally we don't turn the ball over nearly
as much as we did tonight and I thought we got tight. Instead of bouncing
back, we might have broken it a couple of times, made a couple chippies and
that took the wind out of our sails. That's what happened with them, and they
continued, continued, continued, and we didn't recover. I don't think after
that we were ever able to get back in the game.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 5, 2012

  

### [Barnes Arico](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20546)

### [Nadirah McKenith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23273)

### [Da'Shena Stevens](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20545)

  
_HARTFORD, CONNECTICUT_  
  

Connecticut  74  
St. Johns  43

  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us is head coach Kim Barnes Arico along with senior
forward Da'Shena Stevens and junior guard Nadirah McKenith. Coach, an opening
statement, please?  
COACH BARNES ARICO: I thought Connecticut played really well tonight. I knew
it was going to be a difficult task for us, but I thought we would have played
a little bit better. I don't think we played very well. Connecticut did a
great job. Part of that reason was because of their pressure, but we turned
the ball over way too much.  
But we faced, I think, a really great team tonight. A Final Four team. So it
was a tough game for us, but we've got to regroup and get ready for the
tournament.  
  
Q. I know this loss is fresh in your minds, but can you put in perspective
what you went through this Big East season? It was a breakthrough year and
finishing second in the conference, what it's meant for you guys?  
COACH BARNES ARICO: It's kind of so hard because you end on a note like this
and you really want to appreciate what the kids have been able to do all
season. I just tried to talk to them a little bit there in the hallway and
say, and I think they felt embarrassed because they weren't playing well, and
they played so well leading up to this that they were disappointed and
frustrated and embarrassed. But tomorrow's a new day and what they've been
able to accomplish this year has been incredible.  
To beat UCONN at UCONN and break that streak and do all that, we knew that
coming here tonight and playing them in Hartford in the Big East tournament
was going to be a tall task. We knew that they were going to be prepared. They
probably wanted to play us more than anyone, except maybe Notre Dame, but
they'll have a shot at that tomorrow.  
It was a tough game for us, but our year has been tremendous, and I think
we've really accomplished things that we've never been able to accomplish
before, and our kids have really played tremendous all year. Like I said, I
wish we could erase tonight. And I'm sure at some point when I look back on
the year and maybe a couple days, I'll get back to how good of a year it was.  
  
Q. Da'Shena, Stefanie Dolson had struggled against you guys in the previous
two meetings in her career. She scored six points total. Tonight she goes off
with 23. What was it about the inside game tonight that worked for them?  
DA'SHENA STEVENS: I think she just wants to come in the game and get the ball
inside. Just try to throw us off. I think that sometimes we forgot to rotate
or rotate down and help off sometimes. I think she's really determined to
score tonight and get good position. Sometimes we got caught behind. When you
get that far behind, there is really nothing you can do.  
  
Q. Why was it so hard for you guys to get into a rhythm? Was it specifically
something Notre Dame did? Was it fatigue playing in an overtime game? Can you
pinpoint why it was so tough?  
NADIRAH McKENITH: I think tonight we didn't come out and play aggressive as we
normally do. We just give credit to UCONN. They came out and fought hard. They
wanted this game more than anything. In the beginning of the game, we kind of
struggled and never recuperated and regained from the struggle. I think we'll
just get better in practice and preparing for the tournament.  
  
Q. If you could talk about the progress over the past four years, three
years and finally having a No. 2 seed in this tournament and how it feels to
have progressed in your time at St. John's?  
DA'SHENA STEVENS: It's been great. Besides this loss, I think we have been
improving and just showing progress. I think we probably won eight straight to
close the season off. But to be a part of something like that and to keep
showing progress every year, and this year we got the second seed.  
We beat teams that we probably weren't supposed to beat. I just think it shows
where the program's going and just how we keep improving with each year.

Dame and then for UCONN. Mike said that he figured going in that the first

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S

## March 4, 2012

  

### [Shoni Schimmel](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21814)

### [Bria Smith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23274)

### [Jeff Walz](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19715)

  
_HARTFORD, CONNECTICUT_  
  

St. Johns  68  
Louisville  61

  
THE MODERATOR: Please welcome Coach Walz.  
COACH WALZ: I was really happy how hard our kids competed. I told them in the
locker room after the game I was pleased with their efforts. I thought we
battled. We fought and just really competed.  
St. John's played a very good game. Kim does a great job. Unfortunately we
both had to deal with three out there that really made it a very interesting
game.  
I'm really proud of our kids. You know, like I said, St. John's played
extremely hard. We've rebounded the ball very, very well. Just we struggled
putting the ball in the basket on some put-backs, and then we missed some free
throws that we normally make.  
  
Q. Let's go with Bria, they were able to turn you guys over a little bit
more. Can you talk a little bit about what the message was at halftime and
about you guys, so you lost it?  
BRIA SMITH: Well, they pressured the ball a lot. I think that at halftime we
were just trying to just get into our on offense more ask just execute things
more, and it kind of helped. But I think that we just turned over the ball a
bit too much.  
  
Q. Shoni, you came out and got off to a great start in the first half. Then
it seemed like Shenneika Smith really took it as a real challenge and stepped
up and played phenomenal defense in addition to hitting her shots. Can you
talk about the type of game she had and the extra pressure she put on you and
how difficult it was with the defense she was playing?  
SHONI SCHIMMEL: I felt like in our second half we definitely tried to get more
people involved. So she played a good game. She ended up getting 24 points. It
was a great game for her. We just couldn't execute as well as we wanted to.  
  
Q. You made a little reference to it. How hard was it to get into an
offensive flow today?  
COACH WALZ: You were at the game, right? Did you watch it? It was an absolute
debacle. But you've just got to deal with it. Both teams competed. I mean,
both teams played really, really well. The fact that the effort they gave, I
thought St. John's and Kim has done a great job with her team. They came out
focused and prepared to play.  
I thought we did a great job of rebounding the basketball. There was just a
lot of‑‑ I mean, you know ‑‑ that's all I can say. I'll get in trouble if I
say more. Believe me, I'd love to say a lot more.  
  
Q. Over the course of the season there's been so many ups and downs, highs
and lows with this team between the injuries. After this type of game where,
yes, it was hard to get into a flow and it was hard to watch at some points.
We couldn't believe some of the things ourselves.  
COACH WALZ: Really? So it wasn't just me?  
  
Q. No, it really wasn't.  
COACH WALZ: It's really interesting when they can't figure out whose ball it
is to start the second half and they screw that up. I wasn't sure if we were
at a YMCAAAU event or this is actually the Big East tournament, because I
don't know how you screw that up. But we figured out a way.  
  
Q. Getting to the point. You now have to get to the NCAA Tournament. After
having a game like that, what do you as a coach? You go back home, and how do
you get them prepared starting all over again for the next one?  
COACH WALZ: Yeah, that's not hard. They're excited. Like I told them when I
talked to them after the game, I was really, really excited for them. It's
just of how hard we competed. They got us down nine in the second half, and we
continued to defend. We just couldn't buy a basket there for a while. We kept
going at them hard. When we would get fouled, we'd go 7 of 17 from the
free‑throw line. Then to give St. John's credit, Kim's done a great job with
that team.  
We get two stop that's row when it's a four‑point game, and get back‑to‑back
offensive rebounds which leads to five points, and you can't do that with a
team like them. We had them. We were defending them extremely well. They
weren't scoring a whole bunch either. But when you give them second chance
opportunities, it's just a killer.  
  
Q. Coach, it seemed from Connecticut media, at least, that you guys had the
crowd support behind you. Did you feel that? Did you feel that it pushed you
when you did get down nine to fall back into the game a little bit?  
COACH WALZ: I think it's a little love‑hate. The UCONN crowd my first few
years absolutely hated me. What I've learned is the emails that I'd get, I'd
always reply to them. Then we'd go back and forth.  
I've got three or four UCONN fans right now that are my best friends, and
they're great. I had one email me today. I kill them with kindness. I'll email
them back and they're shocked to get something back from me.  
I think the first few years when I complained about the tournament being held
here, boy, that was like a no‑no. Nobody should ever do that, but I did. After
that, it's been great. Their fans have been great to us. I think they know
that Geno and I have a pretty good relationship.  
I wanted to win this game so bad because I was going to tell everybody to say
it would be nice to play them tomorrow if he wouldn't foul every time we try
to run our offense, because that's all he did at our place was foul us, but,
unfortunately, we're not.  
But it's great. Their fans are great. I think they're very knowledgeable of
the game, and that helps out from a basketball standpoint to know you've got
fans that are there cheering.  
I wouldn't say it's just for us. I think they cheered for the game in general.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 4, 2012

  

### [Sugar Rodgers](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23269)

### [Terri Williams-
Flournoy](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20559)

  
_HARTFORD, CONNECTICUT_  
  

West Virginia  39  
Georgetown  32

  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us from Georgetown is head coach. Coach, an opening
statement, please?  
COACH WILLIAMS‑FLOURNOY: Yes, I thought it was a very good defensive game all
around, both on Georgetown's side as well as West Virginia's side. Definitely
an offensive struggle even with the score being at 15‑12 at halftime.  
I thought my team still played extremely hard. I thought we'd continue to do
exactly what we do. I never thought we'd lose the game. I knew eventually once
we hit some shots we'd be in the game and we'd win.  
  
Q. Coach, looking at the first half, I think Sugar hit four of the shots.
But you went in the locker room only down three. I'm thinking it couldn't have
been a lot worse in your mind. You had a chance and shots would fall
eventually. What was the mindset coming out of the half? How frustrating was
it that shots just never seemed to get down?  
COACH WILLIAMS‑FLOURNOY: It was the same mindset I went into what I just said
I knew once we hit some shots. So we went into halftime, gave them confidence,
told them shoot the ball with confidence. The shots were there, that they
would fall, and we'd be in the game. There was just no doubt. I never thought
that the shots would not fall.  
  
Q. Sugar, can you talk about the defense they played on you? Once the shots
weren't falling for Georgetown, it seemed they got even tighter on you and
made it that much more difficult?  
SUGAR RODGERS: We got open shots. I just felt, like Coach said, we just
couldn't put the ball in the basket.  
  
Q. Coach, you've coached a lot of games so far in your career. If you look
at the stat sheet and saw West Virginia 39 points, shot 25%, with 9 of 24 from
the free ‑throw line. Missed 7 in a row in the last minute. Was it
mind‑boggling that you guys didn't come out on top?   
COACH WILLIAMS‑FLOURNOY: It's mind‑boggling that we didn't hit shots. Because,
like I just said, I knew we'd win the game with them shooting like that. If we
would just finally hit some shots. If a basket would just fall, it would give
them the confidence that they needed to continue to shoot.  
We played defense. We forced them into 22 turnovers. We rebounded with them.
We did everything defensively that we needed to do.  
Dunning and Bussie didn't hurt us inside even with us being undersized. You
look at the stat sheets from the top up to West Virginia, if you see
Georgetown scores, it's totally different.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 4, 2012

  

### [Monique Oliver](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20564)

### [C. Vivian Stringer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16227)

  
_HARTFORD, CONNECTICUT_  
  

Connecticut  49  
Rutgers  34

  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us from Rutgers is head coach Vivian Stringer along
with Monique Oliver.  
  
Q. Coach, do you almost walk out of here tonight feeling like you missed an
opportunity to hold Connecticut to 50 points and have your defense play as
well as it did? Does it almost feel like you guys ‑‑ you lost by 15, but you
missed an opportunity?   
COACH STRINGER: You always feel like you've lost an opportunity. But I was
extremely proud of my team. They played in the image and tradition of the
Scarlet Knights. They played hard, and I can't say that they should have
played harder. It was really, really proud of them the way the team played. It
makes me feel good as we begin to go into the postseason.  
When you play Connecticut, the Connecticut team has done so well over the
years. They've set a gold standard. And there is no question would we have
liked to take a few possessions back? Of course. But the game is one of
mistakes, and whoever makes the fewest mistakes in the managing properly is
probably going to win. We're not down. We're encouraged.  
  
Q. What is Khadijah's status? I know she's with the trainer. And second, how
different were you tonight than a month ago having her on the court and what
she's brought to you guys?  
COACH STRINGER: She's amazing. She just brings a level of confidence to
everyone who is out there. Of Course, we had Nikki playing the point more
today and did a great job. But so much of that was because of the versatility
of Khadijah. She makes all the difference in the world. You saw a big
difference in the scoring and our confidence in the five games she was out. So
hopefully she'll be okay and we'll go on.  
Of course you know that Erica was hurt too so, we'll see. But they showed a
real toughness that makes me feel really proud to see the team come together
as we did.  
  
Q. What was Erica's injury and is she okay? What is her status?  
COACH STRINGER: I don't know. Erica seems like she may be dehydrated. I think
a couple years ago Kia Vaughn played so hard to the point where her body
curled up and she had all kinds of issues. They had to give her an IV and
that. I think all of them played extremely hard. When that happens, your body
can't take anymore, and what else can you say other than you've given it all.
When you talk about leaving it on the floor, they left it on the floor
tonight. I don't know.  
  
Q. How frustrating has it been going against UCONN here? I think this is
your ninth straight loss to them. Could you just comment on your level of
frustration against them?  
COACH STRINGER: You know how the CNN reporters ask people after some tragedy,
how do you feel about that? So, no. How I feel about it‑‑ because every time
we play, I really do believe that we're capable of winning any contest.
Sometimes the odds against us are stacked a bit high. But it's that level of
hope and that level of expectation that we have within ourselves. I have been
encouraged the last few days with the way we've been come ago long. We hit a
spot there where we were without Khadijah as well as Erica, and we've got a
lot of young people. I thought it was important that the freshmen in
particular had an opportunity to see what it takes to be a Scarlet Knight.  
So am I frustrated? Yeah, but not frustrated to give up. I'll come back next
year and I'll go at it again, and I'll go at it again, and I'll go at it
again.  
Any time I come in and it becomes routine, then I will quit. So it will never
be something that I ever accept with anybody or any team.  
  
Q. Could you talk about the challenges that Kaleena from their team presents
and being that she's six ‑foot, can go inside and shoot threes? I guess when
she was making all those threes in succession and you guys were struggling to
score, how deflating was that for you guys?   
MONIQUE OLIVER: It was hard. We were just in the wrong position to be able to
contest their shots. She just kept hitting them. But we needed to answer it,
and I think we played better defense during the second half to contest their
shots.  
  
Q. Having Khadijah back on the floor against these guys, you lost by 30 the
first time, but having her back, how much more confidence did it give you
having your senior leader there?  
MONIQUE OLIVER: She works hard. Just to see her battling and her just get back
up, it just makes me want to battle and work hard too. So she just keeps
everybody going.  
  
Q. Heading into the tournament, what do you want to see out of the bench's
production?  
COACH STRINGER: The bench was ready to produce work today. It wasn't their
fault. I just think that if we had a shot and we were able to stay close, it
wasn't too much to expect our bench‑‑ that much to expect our bench to be able
to control the possession. I thought they were totally in tune with this.  
But believe me, they'll be playing in the NCAA's. They definitely will be
playing in the NCAAs. But they're ready. You know that I've started them
against Notre Dame, Connecticut, St. John's, and the likes. They have no fear,
quite honestly. I was trying to see if we were going to be in the attack mode.
But the veteran group, they read each other extremely well.  
So I would rather allow the veterans to win it, and I was willing to do that
as long as they gave a great effort, and that was kind of because no one as a
freshman or anything else was going to have more experience or the potential
to produce. It doesn't matter what a veteran did or didn't do. It is that they
have the potential to do that, because we've seen it.  
So that's what you always risk and hope is going to happen. But I have no
doubt that they will regroup when we go in to get a couple of day's rest, and
get ready to start the NCAA's.  
I've played them as a group a whole lot longer than I would normally do, but
that is in preparation for helping this team as well as next year.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 4, 2012

  

### [Skylar Diggins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20547)

### [Muffet McGraw](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14071)

### [Devereaux Peters](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20548)

  
_HARTFORD, CONNECTICUT_  
  

Notre Dame 69  
DePaul 54

  
COACH MCGRAW: I think historically when a team plays a game, they're a little
bit more game ready. I think we kind of were trying to get back into game
mode, so I thought we played much better in the second half, and really to end
the first half, as well. I thought we did a really nice job.  
I was pleased with the defense on Martin. She had a phenomenal year, just a
great player. So I was really happy with the way we were able to guard her and
did a much better job on the post than we did at our place. Overall pleased
with the defense, and offensively I thought we did some good things, as well.  
  
Q. Devereaux, can you talk a little bit about the rebounding tonight? You
guys had quite an advantage, especially on the offensive boards.  
DEVEREAUX PETERS: A lot of focus lately has been on me crashing the boards and
they're sending two, three people at me to try to box me out. The guards have
been crashing a lot more and it's giving us a lot of second chance
opportunities, so they've been doing a good job of getting in there, as well.  
  
Q. Devereaux, can you just address the defense in general, six blocked
shots. Do you think that was the key to this game?  
COACH MCGRAW: Last time we played them, they got 70 points and we were really
upset about the way we played and defended them that game. They're a great
three‑point shooting team so we knew we had to try to guard them on the
three‑point line for sure and keep them off the boards as much as possible.
They have a great rebounder in Harry, so we really wanted to step up our D and
show them how much we've improved since then.  
  
Q. Skylar, is it nice you guys get another shot at West Virginia?  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: I think it's good to have the advantage in a tournament where
there's so many good teams, any team can beat you. But definitely we'll come
out with a chip on our shoulder. I think we play better with a chip on our
shoulder. And it's good to have a second chance because they beat us at home
and it gives us another opportunity to advance into the championship.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the beginning of the second half, that 10 ‑0 run that
you guys had?   
SKYLAR DIGGINS: Just trying to get off to a better start in the second half
than we did in the first. Coach talked to us at halftime and I think we came
out and executed better in the second half.  
  
Q. Skylar, can you talk a little bit about the defense that perhaps Novosel
and Mallory played on Anna Martin and exactly what was the game plan going
in?  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: When you have a good guard such as Anna Martin who's a great
shooter who you can put on the floor and who has a nice pull‑up, as well, you
have to be ready for her to come off a lot of screens, and she moves. She's
constantly moving without the ball, and I thought Brittany and Allie did a
great job of tag teaming, chasing her off the screens and tag teaming and
talking. I thought the team did a good job of trying to figure out where she
was every possession because when you have a player like that you have to find
her first.  
Brittany and Allie have been great defensive players, but I think they do a
great job giving each other breaks and being able to play good defense on
anybody's best player.  
  
Q. Devereaux, can you elaborate a little bit more about the shot blocking
and just about how you're able to do it and not get into foul trouble?  
DEVEREAUX PETERS: I know a few of them I let my teammates get between me and
the person on offense. I knew for sure they weren't going to call a foul. I
think I'm being smarter about which ones is a block and which ones to go
straight up and make them shoot over me.  
  
Q. Devereaux and Skylar, what are your lasting memories of the loss to West
Virginia, and sometimes match ‑ups are the case, but what did you come out of
that game thinking about?  
DEVEREAUX PETERS: They had a bunch of lay‑ups, and Dunning and Bussie were
getting a lot of points on me, and I was fouling a lot. It was reminiscent of
last year or the year before that. They were scoring a lot of points in the
post and we weren't doing our job, so that definitely has to change for
tomorrow.  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: I think we didn't do a good job of playing team defense like
we've been doing. We've got to get down there and help. I missed a lot of free
throws that game, crucial shots and crucial missed lay‑ups. We lost by two,
and when you lose by two, any mistake is the reason why you lost. But it's a
good opportunity for us tomorrow to come in and get some revenge. It's going
to be a good game. They're a physical team, and we have to come out with a
better start than we did tonight.  
  
Q. Muffet, what does separate Brittany Mallory as a one ‑on‑one defender?
What is it about her that gives her those assignments?   
MUFFET McGRAW: Well, she's got an incredible attitude of determination and
pride. She really, really takes a lot of pride. She wants to guard the other
team's best player. She's got great feet. She really has very quick feet and
really good hands, so I think that you look at her, and we hear it all the
time on the TV game. You look at her and she doesn't look athletic, but she
has so much of the internal fight in her, and she just is kind of fearless and
relentless. She's going to get through the screen. She's just not going to
quit on it and that's her biggest contribution, to defend the other team's
best player, and really she did a good job of everybody she guarded this year.  
  
Q. How much more of a fire is Devereaux playing with the second half of the
season?  
MUFFET McGRAW: I think that she's always played with a lot of passion. I think
that she suddenly had success, and when she had the first game when she got to
15 or 16 rebounds I think she decided that she could do that again. It gave
her the confidence to do it again, and now she's seeing her scoring
opportunities, which she didn't see as much last year. She stood around a
little bit last year and now she's going to the glass, and we're seeing the
numbers she's putting up on the stat sheet.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the opening minutes of the second half, just what
adjustments specifically you guys made to get that run?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Well, you know, we actually kind of reiterated the game plan.
We really wanted to keep them off the three‑point line. They started the game
3 for 3 I think from the three‑point line. We really were not matching up as
well in transition. I thought we did a pretty good job with a little bit of
pressure with Dev up on the ball. We talked about us kind of settling in a
little bit offensively and how we were going to help a little bit more
defensively and switch a little bit more on the screens.  
  
Q. Brittany played good defense on Anna, but it seemed you threw everyone
but the kitchen sink at her. Everyone took a turn. How important was it to
limit her opportunities after the last time?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Yeah, that was the key to the game. We obviously had to find
her all the time. We didn't really switch the match‑ups as much as it happened
in transition. I think we did a really good job of finding her, and if Brit
wasn't the first one there, somebody else found her, and then we were able to
rest Brit a little bit, and when she was out we were able to use Natalie
Novosel and Kaila Turner. I think everybody did guard her a little, and to get
a fresher defender on her was a little bit more effective.  
  
Q. Muffet, did the last loss to West Virginia give you an opportunity to
reinforce or teach some things that maybe you might not have had if you had
won every game in the conference?  
MUFFET McGRAW: You know, I think you can learn some lessons when you win. I
like those a little better. But you heard their response when asked about the
game. They immediately looked at themselves, and I think that accountability
is something that we really like, and that's why we've been successful,
because they can look at themselves and say if I would have done this, we
could have won the game. So I think it was a good time for us to kind of
reflect and look at how important each possession is that you have to play
each possession as if it's the last. We did a really good job of that all year
long. I think that we never looked at the score, we just played the game, and
in that game we didn't.  
So I think it was a good‑‑ if you can have a good loss, because we did learn
quite a bit from it, so in that way, if it propels us on, then it was a good
thing.  
  
Q. Can you talk for one second for the team, what was the psychological
effect of walking in there and putting on the white uniforms for the first
time in the Big East tournament as the No.1 seed?  
MUFFET McGRAW: You know, we didn't really think about it because we would have
been the higher seed today anyway. Maybe it'll mean more if we get to the
final.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the rebounding and that 23 ‑4 edge in second chance
points?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Yeah, Dev was always over the boards. She did a really good
job. I thought we could have done a little better job rebounding from the
guard spot. Brittany Mallory and Natalie Novosel and the guards could have
chipped in a little bit more. But overall I think they just really rely on
Devereaux, and when she's not in the game we've got to be able to find out
who's going to rebound for us.

_HARTFORD, CONNECTICUT_  
  

NOTRE DAME  69  
DePAUL - 54

  
DOUG BRUNO: Working from the back of our postgame conversation we just had
with our team, I just really talked to them about how proud we are that they
put themselves in position to play in the NCAA tournament. Not that we're
taking anything for granted, but we think that we've put ourselves in position
to have earned that, and there's only 33 teams that do that if you don't win
your league outright. So I just really want them to understand that that's not
something easy to do because our program has gone to 17 of these and they're
going to 10 straight, and it's not something that should ever be taken for
granted. It's hard to earn your way into the NCAA tournament.  
So I'm really proud of these two juniors. Deanna Ortiz is a senior, and the
two sophomores that haven't been playing, Kelsey Reynolds and Jasmine Penny,
and our two freshmen, Megan Rogoski and Brittany Hyrnko, for earning their way
into the NCAA tournament again. I don't want to be presumptuous by talking
this way, but I think that we have earned it with a 20 RPI and a 16 strength
of schedule and all the good teams that these guys have beaten. That's at the
end of the day.  
That's at the end of the conversation, and at the beginning of the
conversation was just a coach's irritation with a facet of sports that has to
be overcome by this group, and we're getting better at it, but when anything
happens to keep your wits about you. You have to stay strong.  
I just thought at the beginning of the second half we were cowarded up. I
don't want to say they're cowards. I thought when the score got against us,
it's psychologically something you just do. You feel sorry for yourself, and
there's people watching you, you don't like to be embarrassed, you don't want
to be down. That happens in sports. You know what, we've got to fight. Batters
strike out and the Kobes of the world get blown out, and you've got to fight
through that. That's the part of the second half that was irritating, that we
just didn't fight harder right after the halftime situation.  
And really those are the two subjects. Notre Dame is a great team. Let's get
back to Notre Dame and talk about how great they are. We talk about how great
they are all the time. They really are a great basketball team and they're one
of the two best teams in the country and they're great for a reason. They've
got a Hall of Fame coach and they've got very, very talented basketball
players at every position that are hard to guard, and they're hard to guard
and they guard you and make it hard to score when they're guarding you. It's a
very, very good basketball team that we played against and we knew that we
were going to have to‑‑ I don't like that stuff where you have to play a
perfect game to win. I really don't kind of believe that. I really think
you've got to do all the things you can control, though. You have to do all
the controllables to put yourself in position at the end of a game to steal
it, and that's what we were trying to do, and we didn't quite get that done.  
Again, these two young women sitting next to me have been great, great young
women to coach, Anna and Katherine, and we're blessed to have them at DePaul.
Again, hopefully the rest of the Big East here shows very, very well in the
rest of the tournament and in the NCAA tournament.  
  
Q. Anna, it seemed that they put seven different defenders on you. What did
they do defensively that caused you so much trouble?  
ANNA MARTIN: Well, Brittany Mallory was guarding me most of the game and she's
just a great defender. I felt like anything I did she was right there. Being a
junior and being a leader I think I needed to notice that sooner, how she
really took me out and Notre Dame really took me out and set up my teammates
better.  
  
Q. Harry, can you talk a little bit about the match ‑up problems that
Devereaux presents and what was it like in the lane today?   
KATHERINE HARRY: Well, Devereaux is a great defender. She got defensive Player
of the Year in our league, so she's a great defensive player for a reason.
She's really long and she uses her length and she's got great timing on
blocking shots and she can alter a lot of shots and gets her hands on a lot of
balls, a lot of steals and a lot of defensive rebounds. So it was tough going
against that length, just trying to‑‑ I think not go at her early, but try and
establish myself against her early. I had success with that, and then I kind
of shied away and took myself out of the paint and was settling for more jump
shots than I thought. I should have just gone back inside and sat back in the
post and played more in the post. But give respect where respect is due;
Devereaux is a great player, and she got herself some easy buckets on the
offensive end by getting offensive rebounds and that's on me not blocking her
out.  
I'm not very happy with the way I rebounded today because I didn't, and props
to her for going and getting those boards and creating problems on the
defensive end.  
DOUG BRUNO: In game 1 when they did a great job of taking Anna out, the post
players really had a good game. I think that was very different today. The
post players, it was not nearly as easy for our post players today as it was
in game 1.  
  
Q. The team had zero foul shots today in the game. Is that something as you
go forward, I know you like to shoot the three, but do you have to go to the
basket a little bit stronger, a little bit more and try and draw some fouls?  
DOUG BRUNO: I think really it's always a great question. Of course we have to
get to the free‑throw line much more, and this is a team that's not gotten to
the line very much as a team all year. We've gotten to the line about 14 times
a game, which isn't what you're trying to do. The game, though, was a game in
which I don't think‑‑ I don't think anybody got to the line for a real long
time if I'm not mistaken. So it was one of those games where that's the way
it's being called, so some reference of mine to my players on the bench is
it's your job to make them call fouls. I'm up here talking to them and I'm
tired of talking to them, you've got to make them call fouls. You've got to be
tough enough to make them call fouls.  
I think we drove the ball‑‑ again, I can't say that you're wrong. I agree with
you. We've got to get to the free‑throw line. Everybody has got to get to the
free‑throw line. But I'm not sure that we didn't maybe earn a little bit more
right to go to the free‑throw line than was happening.  
  
Q. Notre Dame had 18 offensive boards. They've done the same thing basically
all year. What makes them hard to box out?  
DOUG BRUNO: Rebounding everybody thinks you just box out. Boxing out is a
function of triple penetration. It's easy to box out when you're just standing
next to a player and you have inside position. But when you're rotating to
help a driver that's penetrating, then the block‑out is not ever, ever just
straightforward, and that's really‑‑ they have the ability to penetrate the
basketball with the Player of the Year in Skylar, Novosel beats you off the
bounce, McBride is really, really good off the bounce. So they're beating you
off the bounce an awful lot. They also beat you with pass penetration.  
So if you're beaten and rotation has to happen, that's where the block‑outs
get skewed. We all know we're supposed to block out, but it's a lot easier
said than done when the ball is not penetrating, and that's where they make it
so tough to block them out and keep them off the glass.  
  
Q. Do you know what your plan is for the team going into ‑‑ there's going to
be about a week and a half, two weeks of rest before the tournament game,
assuming you get selected.   
DOUG BRUNO: Yeah, I have a pretty good idea. We don't ever plan to go home, so
I haven't talked to Kathryn Statz and Jeannie Ponsetto, our athletic director
and associate athletic director, about what the plan is, but I'm sure we're
going to get home sometime tomorrow probably in time with this group to make
all their classes tomorrow. We are at crunch time of our quarter. And then
they're definitely going to be totally off tomorrow. They'll be totally off on
Tuesday, probably practice Wednesday, Thursday with another day off on Friday,
maybe practice Saturday, Sunday with a day off, and then the opportunity to
play in Chicago.  
Again, I want to thank our administration for taking on the challenge of
hosting. While we're not going to play in McGrath and Joanie Phillips arena‑‑
Joanie is out there by the way. She's the one that bucked up so we could have
that arena. That's why it's Joanie Phillips Arena. Thank you, Joanie. Thank
you for all you do for DePaul.  
But because we're not going to be able to play in McGrath Phillips Arena, we
know we're going to play at home, so we know we're not going to have to
travel, so that's an advantage. So what's going to happen, who we're going to
play and all that and who's going to come to our place, we have no idea. But
where I need your help, and I need the help of everybody in Chicago, women in
Chicago have been playing sports too long to be ignored, and we deserve the
right‑‑ we've earned the right‑‑ these women have earned the right to have
17,000 people at Allstate Arena. That might seem like, 17,000, are you crazy,
why don't you settle for 8,000 or 9,000.  
It's not about settling. Katherine talked about settling for jump shots. We're
not here to settle. She's right; she should have been in the post. We're not
here to settle for 5,000 or 6,000. Why can't we have 17,000? 17,000 showed up
for heavyweight fights in the '30s. They showed up for prep football in the
'50s. Well, how about starting to show up for women's basketball. These women
have really, really put their blood and life and guts, as have a lot of women
in our program, so we've got to get some people out there.  
Now you asked me my plan. What are you going to do to help us? What are you
going to do to help us‑‑ that's one of our DePaul guys out there. What are we
going to do to help us get those people out there, those 17,000 people out
there. It's St.Patrick's Day. They're doing themselves a favor by not starting
until after the games. Just think about that. (Laughter.)  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about Kayla McBride and how you might have the
big three from Notre Dame covered but then McBride can cause some problems,
too, can't she?  
DOUG BRUNO: Yes. Both UConn and Notre Dame, and I should‑‑ I really did vote
for all five players, and on the UConn side, Kaleena is the sixth man, but we
voted for Kaleena as the fifth player on UConn. That's because I believe
they're ten of the best players in the league. And McBride is really‑‑ McBride
and Mallory both are really, really good, and you talked about the big three,
McBride‑‑ it's just not‑‑ those two match‑ups, McBride and Mallory, present
major issues because you can't hide somebody on‑‑ it's not like you can take‑‑
because she's a threat and she's a great sized threat because she can play
face to the basket very, very efficiently, and then she can also take you
inside very, very efficiently. So just a really, really talented player.  
You talked about the big three, and it's going to be‑‑ well, I guess the big
three aren't all leaving, but two of the three are leaving, so it's not going
to be the big three next year. I read somewhere Skylar is thinking about going
pro. Can you help us encourage her to get a degree in three years? But McBride
is really good, and you just can't make Mallory for granted. She sits around
on the perimeter, and you leave her alone, she knocks down threes and daggers
you. She's terrific on the defensive side of the ball.  
Three defenders in this league, Kelly Faris, Mallory and Devereaux, and
Devereaux gets it because she's in the paint where she can multifacet her
defensive abilities. But Mallory and Kelly are really, really good, too.  
  
Q. How important is it for you guys going forward to get a second or third
consistent scoring option to sort of help Anna out and maybe free her up a
little bit more?  
DOUG BRUNO: We've really had some pretty good balance all year, and Jasmine is
averaging 13 points a game in the Big East, and Brittany is averaging 11. You
know, we were yesterday three baskets away from having five players in double
figures with Anna getting 33. So I think it's huge that we have balance, and
that didn't happen today. It did happen‑‑ the big guys got to get‑‑ we've got
to get something inside. You just can't rely on shooting threes, and we don't
just rely on shooting threes, but we've got to get something going inside. We
always have to get Jasmine and Katherine aggressively looking to score inside.
So it's very important that we have more than just Anna.  
And this has never been‑‑ that's never been the Anna show. It's not trying to
be the Anna show. She's taken about 15 shots a game, and that's a pretty
reasonable number of shots for a scorer. You know, I haven't even looked down
because I haven't put my glasses on yet. Maybe she took ten shots, and that's
a tribute to Notre Dame, too. It's not like we're trying to skew this thing
and turn Anna into the next Jackie Stiles here. It's really about balance, and
we're at our best when we're totally balanced. It's the way it's been all
season long.

_HARTFORD, CONNECTICUT_  
  

West Virginia  39  
Georgetown  32

  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us is head coach Mike Carey along with sophomore guard
Taylor Palmer, freshman guard, Akilah Bethel, junior center Asya Bussie.
Coach, an opening statement, please?  
COACH CAREY: Yeah, really wasn't a pretty game, needless to say. But you know
what, you just try to survive, and we just tried to survive that game. We
struggled all night.  
With that being said, I want to give our girls credit. We didn't get shook‑up.
We continued to play defense. We didn't let our offense affect our defense, so
that was key.  
Then I think Taylor Palmer coming in and hitting those threes was really big
for us to open it up a little bit, the lead. Then with our defense, we were
able to keep the lead.  
Then at the end to make it interesting we missed probably about ten foul
shots, so we want to keep it interesting, don't we, Asya? Asya scored her
thousandth point in her career, so proud of her.  
Akilah wasn't playing a lot early, but now she attacks for us off the guard
positions. But we're young on the perimeter. As you can see, we made some dumb
turnovers and some dumb things, but we continued to play defense. That is the
key with our team. We'll continue to play defense, even if our offense is not
clicking.  
  
Q. Asya, you talked yesterday about how physical that game was yesterday,
and it looked like this one was even worse than that. Talk about how tough it
was to get a clean look at the basket much less score when you were down in
the paint?  
ASYA BUSSIE: Yeah, like I said yesterday, we knew this game was going to be
physical. Last time we played them, I didn't get too many clean looks. But I
think our guards really stepped up and played, and got this win for us because
they stepped up big time.  
  
Q. Taylor, I know coming down the last part of the season has been kind of a
struggle for you with your shooting. But you've got your chances from three
today. You knocked down some big wins. Can you just speak to a little bit
about what you've gone through toward the end of the season and trying to get
your shot back and then seeing it come back in a big way today?  
TAYLOR PALMER: I just think the biggest thing for me was the confidence. I
started losing my confidence at the end of the season because I wasn't hitting
my shots. But I just talked to my teammates, and they had confidence in me and
the coaches still had confidence in me. So I just came out today and just took
my shots and didn't even think about it, just let them go.  
  
Q. What did Coach say to you guys at the half? 15 ‑12, you guys are winning,
but clearly I don't think he was too happy with the offense. Just what did he
say to get you guys motivated to come out?   
COACH CAREY: The clean version?  
  
Q. Sorry. The clean version.  
ASYA BUSSIE: He was saying our defense was good. Offensively we were being
really tentative. Just, you know, just not taking the shots we usually take.
We were confident. It was just offensively that was holding us back, but
defensively, we were playing well.  
  
Q. I think Sugar Rodgers was 5 for 20, so obviously you guys made her work
for every shot. Can you talk about how important it is when you play them to
make her work if she's going to score her points?  
AKILAH BETHEL: Because she was their main player, I think it was important for
us to take her out of the equation just so we could make the other players on
their team beat us, because we know she's the go‑to person. Every shot she
has, she worked for. So that was our main goal.  
TAYLOR PALMER: Yeah, you've got to give it to Jess Harlee. She played really
hard. All the guards contributed to it, but she really busted her butt out
there, basically, and made every shot she takes. Basically contested it, and
it was harder for her to make shots.  
  
Q. Mike, you've coached a lot of games, but if you looked at the stat sheet
now and saw your guys shot 9 for 24 from the free ‑throw line and scored 39
points, would you have thought you'd win many of those games?   
COACH CAREY: Not unless I looked at Georgetown stats. That's the only way I
think we would have won that game. But, no, absolutely not. I want to echo
what Taylor Palmer said. Jess Harlee, when Sugar did hit a couple threes on
us, she was out. We had to rest her. When she was in the game, I tell you
what, she made it very tough and fought over picks and talked and
communicated.  
The thing with Sugar, she gets a lot of her threes on transition, and Jess
Harlee did an excellent job. That's one thing we kept working on. Go find
Sugar Rodgers. I don't care if you have somebody else stop the ball, go find
Rodgers and don't let her have the three on transition. So I thought she
stayed focused 40 minutes defensively. Really did.  
But to answer your question, no. My goodness, no. The score was 15‑13 at
halftime. I mean, my goodness. I kept feeling that we were playing good
defense, and we were turning it over, but not turning it over for lay‑ups. You
know what I mean? There is a big difference. I kept telling them I'd rather
you throw it up in the stands than turn it over in half court and give them
lay‑ups, because then our defense can't set up.  
Even though we were playing bad offensively, and Asya's right, I talked about
offense, our guards weren't attacking. We were hesitant on our shots. We were
scared to miss, and we can't play that way. We can only play one way.  
  
Q. How much is it to see Taylor get some confidence today in hitting those
big threes when you need it?  
COACH CAREY: Yeah, I'm happy for her, because it's not like she doesn't get in
there in the gym before practice and after practice. She's been getting a lot
of shots up and working on her shot. Then in practice a lot of times she looks
very good in her shooting. I was glad to see her. Maybe she'll have some
confidence now going down the stretch here.  
  
Q. Mike, I know you have a lot of work to do still in this tournament, but
what do you feel about ‑‑ how do you feel about this being the end of the line
in the Big East for West Virginia and how will you look back on your time
here?   
COACH CAREY: Needless to say, I love the Big East. I always did. When I first
got a job at West Virginia, I was so excited to coach in the Big East and
coach against great players in the Big East and the great coaches and go see
different places that I've never seen before.  
I've made a lot of friends in the coaching community in the Big East, in the
Big East office, staff people, everything. So I'm definitely going to miss it.
One thing I wanted to say before I let, the people of Connecticut and the
media of Connecticut have just been great to West Virginia since I've been
here. I want to thank them, and thank everybody.  
We are going to the Big 12. I'm looking forward to that challenge. That's
going to be a big challenge. But I'm definitely going to miss the Big East.

_HARTFORD, CONNECTICUT_  
  

Connecticut  49  
Rutgers  34

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, an opening statement, please.  
COACH AURIEMMA: We talked all long about how difficult the Rutgers games are
and how they all have the same pattern, though it doesn't matter when you play
them, where you play them, who you have on your team, who they have on their
team. All the games take on a similar characteristic, you know, and it's
difficult to get shots, difficult to get things flowing in a kind of a
sustainable way. You compound that by the number of open shots that we missed
today, which I don't even know the number. I don't want to look. I don't even
care. It was a lot.  
You add all those things together, and our defense had to win it for us. I
thought the first half our defense was great. The second half it was great.
For 40 minutes I thought we guarded them exactly the way we wanted to guard
them. I tip my hat off to these guys because it takes a lot. It takes a lot to
concentrate that hard and play that hard on defense. We thought our rebounding
was great.  
So all in all, I think it's a pretty gutty performance by our guys.  
  
Q. Kaleena, could you talk about the lift you gave the team coming in and
hitting those five three ‑pointers in the first half and kind of what you
sensed the team needed there?   
KALEENA MOSQUEDA‑LEWIS: I just tried to help the team because we were in a
little bit of a slump. But every other player on the team was setting screens
for me. So when I got open, I just tried to shoot and knock it in.  
  
Q. Stefanie, can you talk about the defense? Coach said it was the best 40
minutes you guys have played, and how it carried you guys when the offense
wasn't there?  
STEFANIE DOLSON: Yeah, absolutely. I think we played an amazing game of
defense. We communicated a lot on defense. We helped each other with screens.
We guarded the screens correctly. I think overall we just did a really great
job of helping each other and communicating with each other, and just making
sure the lane was clogged and that the people that we wanted to get shots got
shots, and just end the possession with rebounds. I think we did a great job
of doing that and playing defense for the entire 30 seconds each possession
and finishing it with a rebound.  
  
Q. Bria, what was Rutgers doing defensively that caused to you struggle
tonight? You went 3 of 13 shooting?  
BRIA HARTLEY: I think sometimes Rutgers comes out and they play hard defense.
Sometimes you miss open shots and if you're struggling, you have to keep
shooting them. If you're open you try to do other things.  
  
Q. Coach, Khadijah does a lot of dribble penetrations getting into the lane
and assists, but she had almost no luck inside the paint tonight and had no
assists. How did you handle that defensively?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I think, like Stefanie said, I thought we communicated pretty
well. We helped each other out. Players like Khadijah are not easy to defend
one‑on‑one because she can get in the lane. So it's not like you're going to
keep her out of the lane the whole game. It's what happens after she gets in
the lane that maybe you can do something about.  
I thought we were pretty disciplined, and we stayed where we were supposed to
be and made it difficult for her to find who she was looking for. That's not
an easy task, but I thought we did a great job of that.  
  
Q. Coach, say hypothetically you lost all five of your starters. How good do
you think the team would still be with the best five players coming off the
bench?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Lousy. Okay, that's the answer to that question.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about the challenges facing St. John's again, and
particularly Shenneika Smith?  
COACH AURIEMMA: St. John's had a chance to lose the game today, and they
showed a little bit of the kind of confidence that they have that they're
playing with right now. They just have this look about them that‑‑ and it's
kind of bugging me, because they think they're really good. I liked it better
when they weren't sure whether they could win or not. But I get the sense
watching them that regardless of whatever situation they're in or whatever the
score is or the time, they're going to find an answer, and somebody's going to
step up for them.  
Shenneika's been fabulous the whole year. She's become somebody that they can
count on for big plays at big moments. It's remarkable what they've done over
there. But I'm glad we're playing them again too. I think our guys want
another shot at them. Regardless, it's going to be a great game.  
  
Q. Coach, I think it's been seven years since you guys won a game scoring
under 50.  
COACH AURIEMMA: Good.  
  
Q. Just you had a feeling early on that your defense would have to step up
because it's Rutgers, and things weren't flowing, especially in the first
half?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah, right now we're just not very good offensively. There
doesn't seem to be any rhythm. There's no flow to our offense. People are kind
of wondering where the next pass is going and the next shot's coming from.
Normally, we can get a little bit of a flow with our offense. We can get that
pass that leads to that pass, that leads to that pass, that leads to that pass
so we can get enough people movement and ball movement to generate some shots.
The few times we did that tonight. We did, but it's just not happening enough
right now.  
It's just a real struggle right now. We're kind of caught. There is a lot of
indecision on our team right now, and that's probably what accounted for such
a low‑scoring game.  
  
Q. Coach, during the St. John's press conference, the subject of Shenneika's
admiration for you came up.  
COACH AURIEMMA: Really? She wants to switch sides tomorrow?  
  
Q. Unfortunately, no. But Kim was saying that you've helped her a little
bit, giving her words of support and building her confidence a little bit.
Could you just comment on your relationship with her?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I don't know that I've done anything. I think Kim and her
staff and Shenneika have done all the work. I just remember Kim introducing me
to her at an event when she was a freshman, maybe. Typical New York kid, you
know. Thinks they're a lot better than they are coming out of high school.
Think they know everything about everything, and was really, really good. I
just tried to tell her that you've got a lot to learn, and if you pay
attention and you listen to your coaches and go to school and work hard,
you've got a chance to be a great player in this league. Don't waste it. Don't
ruin it. Don't be like one of those kids that comes out and next thing you
know two years from now we don't know where you are.  
So I just said the same thing I would tell any young player that I thought had
a lot of potential in our league. I said the same thing. But I probably said
more to her than I would say to any other player because she started the
conversation off by saying that she's been in love with me her whole life, and
that she wanted her picture taken with me and my autograph, and that's when I
kind of fell in love with her.

### [Nadirah McKenith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23273)

### [Da'Shena Stevens](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20545)

  
_HARTFORD, CONNECTICUT_  
  

St. Johns  68  
Louisville  61

  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us from St. John's is head coach Kim Barnes Arico along
with senior forward DaShena Stevens, junior forward, Nadirah McKenith. Coach
an opening statement, please.  
COACH BARNES ARICO: I'm exhausted. I feel like I just played an overtime game.
I'm sure the players are tired as well. I thought it was a great basketball
game. I thought Louisville came out and really, really played hard. They
rebounded the heck out of the ball, and challenged us in every way.  
I was really proud of the way they took their first three late in the game,
they just battled back. That's been the character of our team all season long.
I think time and again we keep proving to everyone out there that we're really
a great basketball team. Tonight was another opportunity for us to do this. It
was a great game, and I'm just proud of the kids.  
  
Q. Shenneika, it looked like a war out there. Was it as physical as it
looked from the sidelines?  
SHENNEIKA SMITH: Probably worse. Louisville is a tough team.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the defensive effort in overtime?  
SHENNEIKA SMITH: Yeah, I mean, no, just late in the game like that your shots
not going sometimes. It was a physical game, like someone said. At that point
in time, you have to buckle down on defense and try to limit them as much as
possible. You knew they were going to attack. They were looking for the
three‑point shot late in the game. It was time to focus defense and try to get
any stop that we could?  
  
Q. Can you each talk about the defensive effort that was out there.
Shenneika, you shut down Shoni after that start, and Nadirah you had a
ferocious rebound late in the game that you just skied over their bigs. You
guys played phenomenal defense down the stretch. Can you talk about that
effort?  
SHENNEIKA SMITH: We really commend ourselves on defense. We really tried to
get one stop at a time. We played a four‑minute game. Every four minutes we
should come in, and she had some tough shots. She hit some good shots with me
contesting. I just tried to book it down there and make it really difficult
for her. My teammates helped me out on the screens so.  
NADIRAH McKENITH: I'm kind of surprised they didn't call a foul on that
blocked shot. In my mind I think I'm a shot blocker sometimes. But from the
rebound for my position and my size, I think I'm a great rebounder. I just try
to go in there and get my teammates to help the bigs with some rebounds.  
  
Q. It's been a crazy senior year for you. Here you are going to the
semifinals for the first time. Can you talk where this ranks in your career as
it winds down and the future of this tournament?  
DA'SHENA STEVENS: It really means a lot. Like they said, we haven't been here
in a while. It's just great to be a part of this, especially my last year and
how it started. To be finishing up as strong as we are, it means a lot. This
game was tough.  
I think it's kind of getting us ready for tomorrow, because it's going to be a
battle either way whoever we play. I just think this overtime game tonight is
really going to put us in a great place for tomorrow.  
  
Q. Shenneika, that three ‑pointer you took at the end of regulation, was
that the call? Walk me through that shot. What was your reaction after?   
SHENNEIKA SMITH: No, it wasn't the call. I was open for a quick second, and I
just put it up. I hit a few early in the game. I've gotten a little confidence
in my teammates to continue to shoot.  
  
Q. Shenneika, the rematch, if it happens with Connecticut, obviously, you
beat them on their home floor. How much confidence does that give you if you
play them again?  
SHENNEIKA SMITH: Well, we've got to go out there and watch right now who we're
going to play. So we really don't know right now. But we're focused with every
team we come out and play. We're going to give it our best. And hopefully we
come out and win?  
  
Q. Coach, Schimmel went off 11 in the first half and was not a factor all
the rest of the way. What adjustments did you make?  
COACH BARNES ARICO: The first time we played them, Shenneika did a tremendous
job on her. She really locked her down. We have spent the last three or four
days talking about her and how we were going to defend her. I thought she made
some difficult shots in the first half. I came in at halftime. The big thing
about her is we said we don't want her going right because she has such a
quick release going right. We want to try to at least force her left. In
transition, if you come up and let her get a head of steam, she can get it off
quickly. So we talked about that at halftime.  
The big thing we talked about at halftime, is the most irrelevant thing is the
halftime score. I said to Shenneika I don't care how many points she scored at
the half, that was the half. You can make a big difference in this game, if
you go out and lock her down in the second half. And she did that. She was
focused in. That was her job, and she was going to commit to it. The greatest
thing about her tonight is she did that as well as score. She showed what kind
of player she's capable of being tonight, but she did a tremendous job playing
in the second half.  
  
Q. Coach, tonight you were only really able to play maybe six and a half
players for an extended period of time. How does that affect you playing an
overtime game and having to turn around and play again tomorrow?  
COACH BARNES ARICO: Yeah, I think one of the biggest things we really haven't
talked about is that we are down a starter. She hasn't been back, and we still
have been able to pull it out and grind these games out without her. But it
definitely has taken a toll, and we've had to go a lot smaller and it's
affected our rebounding, obviously, as you can see tonight.  
But at this point in the year, it's survive and advance, and these kids got to
dig down and be ready to play. They've got to go back and get ice baths and
drink Gatorade. I think a lot of it is mental. They're young. You know,
they're in the best shape of their lives. So mentally they've got to say to
themselves they're ready to go and they've got to bring it tomorrow.  
  
Q. Coach, as a follow ‑up, can you talk about the minutes that Briana Brown
and Keylantra gave you doing all the little things that need to be done?   
COACH BARNES ARICO: You know what's funny, in the locker room after the game,
I said we were watching film and preparing for Louisville, you know. Mary made
a bunch of key plays in that game. She took a couple charges and got a couple
rebounds. If you looked at the stat sheet, it would have said two rebounds,
four points, and no one would appreciate that. We have kids on our team like
Mary, like Briana, like Keylantra, like Tesia Harris that their stat line
might say four points, two rebounds and to the rest of the world that doesn't
mean anything.  
To our program, that's the difference between winning and losing games. With
Mary out, Briana has stepped up and done a tremendous job for us. Keylantra
has made some outstanding plays tonight. If you weren't watching the game or
you just looked at the stat sheet, you might not appreciate that. But for us
it's the difference between the victory.  
So those kids are doing a great job for us. We really value whether it's six
minutes, one minute, or 20 minutes. They can make an impact on our game, and
it's important for us to have them play well.  
  
Q. In what ways have things changed since the UCONN win?  
COACH BARNES ARICO: You media people actually talking to me (laughing). No,
actually on that note, people know who we are. St. John's, even though we were
doing really well, and even though we were in third place in our conference
and our kids had been recognized in the past, once we beat Connecticut, I
think the rest of the country really knew who we were.  
For our players, I think that's a great tribute to them how hard they work and
they're really deserving of it. Nadirah McKenith, I'm still saying it every
single day, she's second team all conference. Golly. She's second team all
conference. I think she's one of the best point guards in the country, but
that tells you about our conference.  
But I also think Shenneika, Da'Shena, we've got great kids in our program, and
I'm happy that they are starting to be recognized.  
But I think the other thing, I keep talking to them, okay, just because we're
being recognized doesn't allow you to become soft. All these people out here
are trying to make us soft, so we've got to continue to work hard and get
better every single day. But I think their confidence is at an all-time high
tonight. Louisville battled back and we went down, but our kids didn't stop
playing. Our kids didn't quit. They're very resilient and they kept working. I
think it gave us a tremendous amount of confidence that we can play with
anyone and they have a no‑quit attitude.  
  
Q. The other day at the awards ceremony after it was all said and done, you
were talking to Geno, and Shenneika came over, and Geno and Shenneika kidded
around and had some fun. It is kind of unusual for a kid to hit a three ‑point
shot to win a game. But is there any story in their relationship that you knew
of beforehand that would allow them to have that kind of relationship?   
COACH BARNES ARICO: Yeah, actually, I think Shenneika's freshman year I
brought her to Big East media day. She had asked me at that point can I
introduce her to Coach. She always looked up to him and idolized him. He's the
greatest coach in the game. And I have a pretty good relationship with him, so
I brought her over to him. They chatted, and she was just in awe after.  
Then the following year I brought her back to media day, and she was going
through a lot of struggles and she had her little bumps in the road. People
were trying to get in her mind, and some people were trying to do different
things with her, and she was struggling.  
I said to coach, you know, Coach, can you just grab Shenneika for a minute and
talk to her for a minute? And he did. That kind of turned the kid around, and
she's the greatest kid ever. The commitment that she's made to our program and
the strides that she's made have been tremendous.  
He really pumped her up. He gave her a bit of confidence and made her feel
good. She came back and was a different player.  
When we walked in the other day he was in the corner. I didn't even know he
was here. She was like, oh, Coach is here. Coach is here. I said let me go say
hi to him before I leave. I said you can come on over. She walked over and he
was like, come on. Like you planned to hit that three? You said give me the
ball? She said yeah, I did. So he started busting her chops a little bit. He
said I let you make it. I let you have it.  
So it just means the world to her. I think sometimes people don't realize the
impact that Coach Auriemma can really have on kids. I think he does. What he
did for this young lady in just a short bit of time has really helped her and
made a major impact on her.  
I can't thank him enough. He didn't have to give her time the other day, and
it means the world to her.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 25, 2012

  

### [Connie Yori](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13896)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
CONNIE YORI: First of all, it's great to be here. A year ago at this time our
Associate Head Coach Sunny Smallwood was here in my absence because of an
illness that I had. So this is all new to me. I didn't really know which
hallway to come down to get here. But I'm really glad to be here.  
It's great to be a part of the Big Ten. I feel like it's a great fit for
Nebraska. We really enjoyed our first year in the Big Ten last year. We're
excited for what we have in the future.  
On paper, if you just look at paper, we have 66 points returning and 38
rebounds returning, so if you look at us on paper, there's a reason why we
were picked second behind Penn State in the preseason poll. But unfortunately
paper doesn't win games, and we've got to get a lot more healthy if we want to
be competitive in this league, and we're‑‑ a couple times last week we
practiced‑‑ well, the majority of our practices have been inconsistent largely
because of our injuries.  
We practiced a couple times last week with instead of 66 points and 38
rebounds, we practiced with 23 points and 15 rebounds because of where we are
injury‑wise.  
The key for us right now is to get healthy. Our continuity hasn't been there.
October is a really important month to get your base stuff in and to get
reasonably good at your base stuff, and we haven't been able to get to that
point, largely because, like I said, where we are injury‑wise.  
If we can get healthy, we have a chance to have a great season, but that's a
big part of it. We've got some very good players in our program, but it would
be nice if they had a chance to practice a little bit more than they have at
this stage.  
I think Penn State is clearly the favorite in the league after winning it last
year. I don't think there's any doubt who they have returning that they're the
favorite. But you guys as media members and our coaches picked us second, but
you haven't watched us practice.  
  
Q. Update us on your injury situation. Who's not practicing and who is
practicing?  
CONNIE YORI: I think my time is reduced to a 15‑minute block up here, so I'm
not sure we have enough time.  
Let me start with our returning starters from a year ago. Hailie Sample, I
think the Big Ten Tournament, playing four games in four days, started two of
our players, Jordan Hooper and Hailie Sample, were injured after that
tournament. And Hailie really has been injured all through the summer and the
fall. Up until the last week she had not played any basketball up until this
last week, and she's a key for us. You look at her stats and you don't think,
well, she's an impressive statistic, but she's a great defender and she
rebounds for us and she does a lot of the right things.  
Now, Jordan has probably been in about one‑third to one‑half of our practices
and our reps in practice because of, again, a recurring stress injury related
back to playing last year, those four games in four days.  
Then you've got Lindsey. Lindsey has missed‑‑ we've had 17 practices, she's
missed five of them and has been limited in some ways in some other practices.
She's definitely more healthy than those other two guys.  
Emily Cady, knock on wood, is the healthiest of our four returning starters.  
Then you go to other kids who we expect to play for us. It's just been Meghin
Williams has our third post last year, and she's practiced maybe one‑quarter
to one‑third of the time, Adrianna Maurer is a kid that didn't play for us
last year because of injury and she's practiced about one‑quarter to one‑third
of the time. She'll be one of our backup post players.  
Rachel Theriot who is a freshman who we think is going to play big minutes for
us and we're expecting her to play big minutes, and we need her to do that.
Out of our 17 practices she's practiced in five of them because of an injury,
as well.  
Then we've had kids sprain their ankle, and we just have had one thing after
another, kind of inconsistency. Most of our practices we've had seven or eight
kids being able to go, and then some of them are part‑time, so they maybe
can't go the whole time. It's been an interesting year in terms of trying to
juggle our practice setting.  
Again, I don't want to sound like a whiner up here, but that's part of the
game. You've got to control the controllables. The good news is that those
kids who are able to go have got a lot of reps, and you hope that they're
taking advantage of those and getting better because of that. But our
continuity is a little scary right now.  
  
Q. How would you evaluate your first year in the conference, and what goals
have you set for this year?  
CONNIE YORI: Well, I thought it was a good start, considering how young we
were a year ago. We were an exceptionally young team a year ago, and we were
inconsistent at times. But I do think we had a good end to the season, at
least in the Big Ten, in the Big Ten Tournament. However, we were just not as
consistent as we would like to be, and again, largely I think that's because
of our youth.  
Moving forward to this year, I think on‑‑ like I said, on paper we can set our
goals high, but realistically right now we aren't the second best team in the
Big Ten, realistically, based on the fact that we're not very healthy. Goals
are great, but you've got to have the personnel to achieve those goals.  
  
Q. A little bit off the topic, but UConn coach has proposed some changes to
women's college basketball, to lower rims, a larger ball, shorter shot clock,
in an effort to make the game more attractive to fans. Does women's college
hoops need some changes along those lines, or is the game fine as you see
it?  
CONNIE YORI: I think there's one person who has recommended those changes. I
don't necessarily think that's across the board in women's basketball.  
You know, we talked about that last night. We were together as coaches, and we
talked about what would it do to lower the rims to 9 foot or 9'6, because in
volleyball you play with a lower net in volleyball, and in golf, women's
golfers hit from shorter tees than the men. If you look at ‑‑ the challenge
that you would face in lowering the rims would be every gym in the country has
10‑foot rims. So it's from grade school, playgrounds, all the way to‑‑ I think
that's the challenge.  
I think there's some merit to that, but I think logistically I think it would
be a very difficult thing to do across the board.  
  
Q. A new conference a year ago. So much is talked about rivalries. What may
be one or two really ‑‑ the second you walked into their arena or they walked
into yours did you say this is going to be something special going forward?   
CONNIE YORI: Well, I think it's a little early for us to say that. But I just
think naturally the schools in your area are naturally going to be a little
bit more rivals just because you probably see them a little bit more in
recruiting. You know, contiguous states. Obviously Iowa, it makes sense that
we're rivals. But I think that's a very friendly rivalry on the women's
basketball side. I have great respect for Lisa and her staff. I've known those
guys for years and years.  
But I just think it may be a little bit early. Obviously what happened with us
and Purdue last year with the number of overtimes we played, I think that's
what people think of as a rival. But I'm not sure we deem that any more a
rivalry than anyone else.  
  
Q. I want to go back to the 15 ‑minute question for a minute. Are you
fearful that you might not have some of these kids, or would you be more
likely to maybe not play them in November to get them ready for later in the
season?   
CONNIE YORI: Well, I think the concern is that we have rested them, and we've
rested‑‑ the two starters I mentioned, Hailie Sample and Jordan Hooper really
throughout the summer, in Hailie's case throughout the fall. I'm not sure
that's the answer because we've tried that already.  
Our non‑conference schedule is very, very challenging, and so if we want to do
anything in the non‑conference, we're going to have to have some of those
kids. But you've got to play kids who are healthy. You can't‑‑ I just think
some of our kids are going to be‑‑ I think we're going to be really limited in
our practices. We're probably going to be playing games without‑‑ in some
cases with kids without a lot of practice time, which don't bode well for
preparation.  
My belief system is that you practice‑‑ you play the way you practice, and I
think most coaches say that, but we've historically been a very good
practicing team, and when we can't practice well, we typically don't play
well.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 25, 2012

  

### [Coquese Washington](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18021)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
Q. With your team, with the kids coming back, basically that's a great
thing. Who among the newer kids is stepping up right now to maybe fill the
void of the one you did lose?  
COQUESE WASHINGTON: Honestly, I'm really happy with all of their progress in
terms of our non‑starters that are returning. They've all been in the gym over
the summer. They've all improved their game. I'm really excited to have Dara
Taylor active this year. She's a transfer, so she sat out last year, and
Candice Agee, our lone freshman, has really showed some promise early in our
practice sessions.  
  
Q. Two of your kids are actually ‑‑ were on the All Big Ten team last year,
your two guards. But the kid last year who seemed to make the biggest strides
was Nikki Greene, at least from the outside looking in. How did she change
last year and what can she add to what you do this year?  
COQUESE WASHINGTON: I think last year Nikki just really started to get
comfortable with everything, being a college student. She just really started
to get comfortable on the court and off the court, and once she got into a
comfort zone and things started to get easier for her in some ways. What I've
really liked about what I've seen so far is I think her confidence level is
really high, probably the highest it's been since she's been here. So I think
those two things, her just really getting comfortable with the game and her
confidence level growing, I think that's going to make a big impact for her
development on the court this year.  
  
Q. Everyone thinks you're the best in the conference. Do you try to take
what you've always done and just get better at it, or do you try to expand
your repertoire and kind of push the envelope and do some different things?  
COQUESE WASHINGTON: A little bit of both. We're going to continue to play
fast. We're going to continue to get up and down the floor. One of the things
we talked about with our team over the summer is having better balance,
especially offensively with our post and guard production. We're very‑‑ we've
been a team where our guards have kind of carried us most nights.  
But this year we want to be a team that has more balance, and I think with our
post crew having more experience, them getting more comfortable and confident
in the way that they can contribute on the floor, you know, I definitely think
that that's going to be something that's important for our development if
we're going to continue to get better.  
  
Q. I know that Alex Bentley was a preseason Player of the Year last year and
is again this year, but you also felt last year she kind of disappeared at
times. What will be different with her going into this year?  
COQUESE WASHINGTON: Well, with Alex it's‑‑ how do I say this? She did what I
asked her to do last year in terms of be a better floor general and run the
team, and sometimes that disappearing was her attempt and her focus on making
sure she got her teammates involved and ran the team. She wasn't as focused on
dominating from‑‑ dominating the game as an individual.  
So I think having a better understanding, having a better feel for when to
kind of stray away and take over the game and when to keep the team involved,
keep the team running, keep the team going as a well‑oiled machine, hopefully
this year she'll have a better sense and a better feel for being able to do
that.  
  
Q. It's been some time now since the football scandal erupted at Penn State.
How difficult has it been to sell Penn State and sell your program?  
COQUESE WASHINGTON: It hasn't been difficult at all. What Penn State is known
for, academically it's a strong institution academically, and all of the‑‑
over the years, the decades, the centuries that Penn State has existed and
what Penn State has stood for, that hasn't changed. That hasn't changed for
women's basketball, hasn't changed for any of the other sports. If anything,
it's given our University an opportunity to highlight all the other strengths
in other areas, academically, other sports. It hasn't been a problem for
women's basketball in terms of recruiting, in terms of‑‑ in any way.  
  
Q. Three new coaches in the league. What kind of impact do you see them
having with either their style or their recruiting?  
COQUESE WASHINGTON: Well, I think they're having an impact‑‑ they will have an
impact in both of those areas, as well as their coaching. They're all three
very good coaches and were successful from the programs that they came from,
and that's exciting for us.  
We want our conference to be strong, and we like having strong coaches,
competent coaches, credible coaches that are going to come in and add value to
the conference. You look at some of the kids that they've been bringing in in
this early part of their tenures, and it's going to be good. Their presence is
going to be really strong and really powerful for our conference.  
  
Q. I know when a coach takes over a program, they sort of have a five ‑year
plan of where they want to take it, and usually there's a lot of detours and
it never really pans out. As you sit here in your fifth year, yours has panned
out pretty nicely. Has it progressed sort of the way when you came you thought
it would?   
COQUESE WASHINGTON: Well, honestly, it's a little slower. But I'm pleased with
where we are, and I'm pleased that we have progress every year. We got better
every year. We've got the players to come in that can play the style of play
that we wanted to play. We got more and more competitive every year within the
conference.  
So to look back over five years, we're very pleased with how we've grown the
program, and we just want to continue to get better every year and continue to
grow the program in a number of ways.  
  
Q. I know last year you said chemistry was a huge deal with this team in
terms of relating it to its success, and you said this team is fun, so with a
lot of people back, how do you characterize this year's team?  
COQUESE WASHINGTON: Even more crazy than they were last year. They're fun. And
that's‑‑ I love the team. I love being around them. I love coming in the gym.  
I think one of the things that's happened is they've learned how to transfer
the fun, their personalities off the court, and add that work ethic on the
court and have fun on the court in the middle of working hard.  
That was a challenge early on. It was, okay, we're having fun; okay, now we've
got to go to work. And now they're learning you can work hard and have fun at
the same time. It makes your productivity in practice better. We can get more
done when we're having fun through working hard.  
And I think some of that has to do with maturity and growth, because our team
is juniors and seniors. So they've been through a lot together, and they're
excited about this year.  
  
Q. Do you mind being the preseason favorite with the media and the other
coaches, and how do you see the league from maybe like seven or eight up to
the top coming into this season?  
COQUESE WASHINGTON: I don't mind it. I don't think about it in terms of our
preseason ranking, and I never have. It really doesn't matter where you are in
October. What's important is how you get better during the course of the
season and how you end the season.  
So I don't mind it. It's good for our program. It's good for our kids to have
that kind of recognition from the rest of the coaches and the media for what
they've done and how much work they've put in.  
But it doesn't impact how our work ethic and what we do. So we just want to
continue to get better.  
What was the second part of your question? Oh, I think it's going to be the
same. I think it's going to be the same. Our conference is really competitive.
I think last year we had like three teams tied or four teams tied for third
place, and most of those players are back. The best players off of those top
six, seven, eight teams are returning.  
I think it's going to be the same thing. I think it's going to be a tough
conference race and probably won't figure out who's going to be on top until
the last week of the season.  
  
Q. Coach Geno has ‑‑  
COQUESE WASHINGTON: I knew it was coming. I was waiting for it.  
  
Q. He's proposing some changes, lower rim, shorter shot clock, bigger ball.
Where do you stand on that? Do you think the game needs change or do you like
it the way it is?  
COQUESE WASHINGTON: Well, the thing is you can't be stagnant, and I think
everybody, certainly in our conference, wants the game to continue to be an
exciting game. We want women's basketball to continue to grow. And if you make
some kind of contrarian statements or some salacious comments to get attention
to the fact that we do need to continue to grow our game, then that's okay. I
think the sentiment simply is, is our game the best, what do we need to do to
continue to make our product, our game exciting for the fans, exciting for our
coaches to coach, exciting for the players to play. And as long as we're
continuing to investigate and ask those questions, we can make the game
better.  
And I'm all for that. I'm all for progress. I'm all for experimenting with new
rules, experimenting with new ways of playing the game. We have to continue to
do that, and I think the Big Ten conference has a commissioner, Jim Delany,
who's a fan of women's basketball, who's a fan of the game, and will encourage
us to do whatever we can to continue to make the game exciting for fans. I'm
open to anything.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 25, 2012

  

### [Sharon Versyp](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16880)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
SHARON VERSYP: Well, we're just excited for the season to get going. We have
quite a few returners, but we have a very good recruiting class that came in
as freshmen that need to do some good things for us if we want to continue to
be successful and have a good ride into the Big Ten and play well at the end
of the year.  
  
Q. Are there one or two freshmen that you look at that you think are capable
of stepping in and having a significant impact right away?  
SHARON VERSYP: I'm hoping at least three of them will come in and do some
significant things. I think Taylor Manuel, post player down low, I feel that
she will come in and do some things. Doesn't matter how long she plays, but
she's very productive. I think a backup point guard, April Wilson, who's a
freshman, will come in. She's really grasping things right now and really
understanding our offenses and she's really poised. She always defers to
others so she's that ultimate point guard that she's going to make sure that
everybody else gets involved, and she's last, in her mind, to score the ball.  
And then maybe Hayden Hamby, who scored a lot of points in high school,
hopefully she can come in and shoot the three ball very well. She's just a
very physical 5'8", 5'9" guard.  
  
Q. You've got Drey Mingo back for a sixth year, which is a good deal, but
how much does it mean to your program to get her back for the sixth year after
what she's gone through the two previous seasons, and how is she right now?  
SHARON VERSYP: Well, it's fantastic news. I think some people have forgotten
that she's on our team, which I appreciate that you recognized. But with Drey,
the biggest thing is she's such an amazing human being, she just won a giant
step award, courage award. I was with her last week in Orlando, and just to be
around her as a human being, you just want her to have a great year. It
doesn't matter what her team does, it doesn't matter what her skill set can
be, she's been in school for about six years now and has only played like a
year, year and a half, so it would be nice if she could just be a young woman
that has had a great college experience this last year at Purdue.  
She's doing fantastic. She still has hearing loss in her left ear, so that
will never come back. But for her playing and her ACL and all of that, she's
very strong and pretty much has picked up where she left off and is very
healthy.  
  
Q. You look at the names on the preseason list, if Drey gets to the point
where you think she can get to this year, is she a Player of the Year type of
player? Is she a top five type of player? Could she have that kind of a
year?  
SHARON VERSYP: I totally believe so. Again, if she stays healthy ‑‑ you know,
at the end of the year after she had her illness and she was only 65, 70
percent then, people ‑‑ more or less fans and audiences got to see what she
was about, being able to score down low very effectively against any size
whatsoever. She has a great three‑point shot. Her rebounding ability and
defense has improved. So I feel if she's healthy, she should be one of the top
players in the Big Ten.  
  
Q. Can you talk about replacing the production that Brittany Rayburn brought
last year now that she's graduated?  
SHARON VERSYP: Uh‑huh. With Brittany you can never replace any player that you
lose. I think the biggest thing obviously because she scored and she was that
go‑to player, but it's her just understanding our system, her understanding
what I wanted. She played as a freshman, so she just really had the mindset of
what we needed and when we needed it. So I think that's what we're going to
have to overcome more so than anything.  
I think collectively hopefully her‑‑ the scoring we can try to replace with
two or three different people. I think that will be big. But I'm really
relying on KK Houser to really understand, her and Courtney Moses, of having
the mentality that Brittany had of understanding what we need in game
situations and just understanding my mind.  
  
Q. We've talked a lot about the improvements you've tried to make
offensively in the off season, but where is your team at defensively right
now, and how far do they need to go to get to the level that you want?  
SHARON VERSYP: Defensively? Well, defense, we always play defense here at
Purdue, so I've just tried to work on our offense a little bit. I think our
defense is going to be very strong because we're the most athletic we've ever
been at Purdue since our staff has arrived. I think we're very quick. We've
got a lot of length. We've got great size down low, 6'5", and then Taylor
brings a different type of physicality with just her body type.  
So we can do some run‑and‑jump; we can do a lot of different things. We just
have more depth, so hopefully we can play that 9, 10 rotation defensively. And
then obviously working on offense we put a lot of shots up this summer and
hopefully we can put some more points on the board.  
  
Q. The dynamics that you use between KK Houser and Courtney Moses last year,
will you use them in a similar way or tweak that at all?  
SHARON VERSYP: No, we'll still use them in a similar way. There could be a
time where I put April Wilson, KK and Courtney Moses on the court at the same
time, really three fast, very quick guards that all can score the ball very
well.  
But Courtney, we have four players that can play the point guard, which is
great, so we have a lot of ball handlers, including Dee Dee Williams, in that
group. But Courtney needs to score the ball. She's our three‑point shooter.
She has to take up the slack for Brittany's loss, and she just has an amazing
mentality.  
With those two on the floor, we're energized; the excitement is there, and
they both understand, obviously, what we want on the court defensively and
offensively.  
  
Q. I'm sorry to switch gears for a second, but you've got three new coaches
in the conference. Can you talk about the impact that's going to be on the
season and future recruiting?  
SHARON VERSYP: I think any time the Big Ten has kind of gone through that over
the last probably five years, I think when you have a different group, a
different philosophy, coming in from different areas of the country, they've
been proven winners. So I think it's great for our conference. It'll
strengthen our conference, and obviously the recruiting bases are very
different. The three new ones are going to be great, like the ones that came
in last year and the year before.  
Hopefully now we can keep our coaches solid now for 5 to 10 years in their
careers, and that's when I really think the Big Ten is going to kick off.  
  
Q. Specifically with the new coaches, can you talk about Curt Miller? He
said he wants to close the borders in the state of Indiana. How do you see him
building that program and maybe competing with you to get some of those kids
down the road in Indiana and trying to renew what hasn't been much of a
rivalry recently, has been more one ‑sided in your favor?  
SHARON VERSYP: You know, it's a tough question because I'm not Curt. I'm
worried about closing my own borders in Indiana and recruiting nationally and
being the best that I possibly can be for our program.  
But I think in any institution you just have to know what your brand is. You
have to know what your system is and the type of student athletes you can
recruit at each school. That's where all of us kind of lose sight. We try to
maybe go and do something different, but we are who we are. I think Curt, I
have a lot of respect for him; I think he's a great guy, a great coach, and he
will turn it around there.  
  
Q. You guys made a great run last year in the Big Ten Tournament. How have
you built off of that in the off season and then in this preseason?  
SHARON VERSYP: Well, the biggest thing for us is when South Carolina beat us
at home, they were quicker, more athletic, stronger, tougher. And so that's
the game that we keep going back to. When you see our student athletes now,
their bodies are totally different. They really put in a lot of work in the
sports performance area. You'll be amazed probably at all of them, but KK has
really‑‑ her body type is very different now.  
But we have to be stronger, we have to be more athletic. We want to be the
best in the Big Ten, but we want to be one of the best in the country, just
like everybody else that comes up here and talks. We need to‑‑ our Big Ten has
to continue to prove and win in the NCAA Tournament. We've had a game that we
really look back on a lot.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 25, 2012

  

### [Curt Miller](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24308)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
CURT MILLER: Well, it's a pleasure to be here, an honor to be the new head
coach in Indiana and a part of the Big Ten, which is a dream come true for my
career and an opportunity to be at an institution like Indiana.  
We're walking into the Big Ten at a historic time with seven NCAA Tournament
teams last year and an eighth team winning a postseason tournament. So the
league is as good as it's been, as deep as it's been, and so it's an honor,
but a scary proposition of rebuilding right now in the Big Ten with the league
as strong as it is.  
Excited that I've inherited some senior leadership. We have three seniors on
the team, highlighted by Aulani Sinclair and Jasmine McGhee, who are here
today with us. They've got to give us leadership. But we only inherited nine
scholarship players in June, and out of those nine scholarship players when I
got there in June, we had three of them injured. So depth is an issue.  
We certainly know who we are. We're going to set realistic goals for our
program this year to be the hardest working team in the Big Ten, to have the
best team locker room in terms of chemistry in the Big Ten. But we know this
is a journey. It's certainly going to be a marathon as we rebuild this program
and not a sprint, but we're excited about the opportunity.  
The players have really, really bought into the new system, are excited about
the new system and are working every day to get better.  
  
Q. Why Indiana? Why was this a good job for you?  
CURT MILLER: Well, it was a dream opportunity for me. One, I've always looked
at Indiana as a sleeping giant in the world of women's basketball. There's
more tradition at Indiana than it's given credit for in women's basketball.  
But when you think about basketball, I grew up thinking about Indiana. I grew
up in a small western Pennsylvania town, and I referred to my hometown as a
Hoosier town and didn't even realize why I necessarily said that, other than
the fact that I grew up in a crazy basketball town in western Pennsylvania. So
we called ourselves a Hoosier town because we viewed, or I viewed growing up,
that everyone in the state of Indiana grew up with a basketball hoop in their
driveway, a basketball hoop in the barn, a basketball hoop in the park, at the
end of the street. And so when you think about passion and basketball, it all
comes back to Indiana.  
It was a great time for myself in my career. Hard to leave a program where
you've won eight straight championships and built something very special as a
mid‑major power. But it was the right time, and I really look forward to
rebuilding this program.  
  
Q. When you take over, where do you start rebuilding? How do you set up? How
do you set up your recruiting?  
CURT MILLER: Well, obviously we're trying to build a program and not a team,
and we're going to take our time. We've got a great blueprint right across the
hallway in Cook Hall, our practice facility in the men's program, four years
ago 0 and 18 in the Big Ten, four years later the preseason No.1 team in the
country. So we have a blueprint right in our own building. So I'm excited
about rebuilding, and it starts really in recruiting. We have to improve our
talent level on our roster, and we've got to do that by recruiting the state
of Indiana and then the Big Ten footprint.  
We can run all around nationally and recruit because Indiana can attract
people academically, can attract people because of our facilities, the beauty
of our campus. But if we can't compete in the state of Indiana in the Big Ten
footprint for recruits, we're not going to build it the way we want.  
So we've got to roll up our sleeves and win recruiting battles in the Midwest,
starting with the home state.  
  
Q. We know about the senior leadership of Aulani and Jasmine McGhee. Can you
talk about what younger players you think will make a big impact this season
and see a lot of minutes?  
CURT MILLER: Sure, and again, right now we are practicing on a daily basis
with 10 scholarship athletes that are eligible to play, and so depth is a
concern. A lot of those 10 haven't been huge contributors, so we have to rely
on our upperclassmen, Aulani and Jasmine. But another player you have to look
at to have a breakthrough season for us to be successful this year is
Quaneisha McCurty, our 6'5", 6'6" sophomore post player. She's very versatile
and can step out to the arc.  
We love versatile post players in the way we play. We love to give the green
light for post players to shoot threes, and that's where she likes to be.
We've got to get her a little tougher and get her in the paint. I think she's
allergic to the paint, but we'll get her a little better here in the future.
But we have to have a big year out of those three.  
Other players that need to step up is our other senior Rubene has to have a
good year for us, and then we have good depth. The one position that we have
good depth in is the center position. Now, when you look around the league and
you look at the centers in our league, we may not have the individual talent,
but we definitely have fouls to give; we definitely have bodies to throw at
people, and so even though we might not have a superstar in the post, we have
to have a lot of people step up and help us at the defensive end rebounding
and running our ball screen offense that we believe so much in.  
  
Q. You talked about the center position. Talk a little bit about Sasha
Chaplin and the role she will play on the team this season.  
CURT MILLER: Sasha Chaplin is important for us. She's a fifth‑year junior.
With so many injures early in her career, she's really only played one season
in her career healthy wise, and she's 23 already. So she brings leadership.
She's affectionately referred to as "Grandma" on our team. But she is a good
athlete around the rim. She scores in a variety of ways. She's a great
offensive rebounder. At 6" 3 1/2, 6'4" she can bring a physical presence to us
in this league that's very, very important.  
We need to keep her healthy; we need to manage her minutes in practice, we
need to manage her health, but if we can get her to games, she can be a big
help for us this year.  
  
Q. When you talk about winning your home state, obviously there's some
schools up north that are in Indiana, as well. Does you coming to Indiana take
the Purdue rivalry maybe to another level as far as recruiting and
competition, like let's get after it?  
CURT MILLER: Absolutely, and when you mention Purdue, you mention Notre Dame.
We're in a unique situation as the school and state that has other really,
really talented women's basketball programs in our state. But we didn't win
any of those battles in the past. When you look at our roster, in the nine
returning players on our roster, we only had three Indiana kids on our roster
out of the nine, and when you looked at our roster, we had Hawai'i, Texas,
Florida, Georgia, Latvia. Didn't know where Latvia was, had to get out a world
map.  
And when you pull out a stats sheet, your two leading scorers were still
Indiana kids; your starting point guard was an Indiana kid. We have to recruit
the state, and the buzz right now in the younger classes, which is most
important, the 15s, the 16s and beyond, the buzz in the state right now that
Indiana is a factor and Indiana is a destination place for players in the
state of Indiana. We're really, really excited about it.  
And again, it's going to be a marathon, it's not going to be a sprint. We
don't have visions that‑‑ we're not putting unrealistic goals on our team
currently. We know we have to build this program, but I'm excited about the
journey ahead.  
  
Q. I know you have a winning formula, a system that's brought you great
success. How much of that can you really utilize this year, or is it more sort
of look what you have for pieces and try to make that work?  
CURT MILLER: That's a great question. We truly believe in our pick‑and‑roll
system. We asked to go around nationally and speak about it. It helped develop
a Bowling Green into a mid‑major power. We actually started to develop it with
Becky Hammond at Colorado State and built them into a mid‑major power. I
believe in it, so we're going to play it. Do we have all the pieces that are
perfect for how we play? No, but we're going to recruit to that system because
we believe in it. So we have to have a little bit of tweak here and there to
allow the offense and defense to work with our personnel this year, but we are
not going to back away from what has been so successful nationally. We're
going to recruit to that system in the future and put the pieces in place. So
a little bit of tweak this year, but we really, really believe in our
pick‑and‑roll system.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 25, 2012

  

### [Suzy Merchant](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17249)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
SUZY MERCHANT: Well, it's exciting to think about another season upon us.
That's for sure. You know, we've had an interesting off‑season. We've
graduated some key kids off last year's team, but the youth that we have is
really exciting and kids are going to be very impactful right out of the
gates.  
The issue with that is that we've got nine freshmen and sophomores, so we're a
very young team but very talented, too. So we're looking forward to the
challenge of the Big Ten, and some of those kids are red‑shirt freshmen, so
they really understand the rigors and the challenges of the Big Ten without
having used a season of eligibility. They have a little different sense about
them. But we're excited.  
  
Q. Can you just kind of talk about how Madison Williams has progressed and
how she's looked at practices?  
SUZY MERCHANT: Sure. Well, it's nice to think of her as a freshman because
basically that's what she is in her third season. She'll be a kid that we
apply for that sixth year later down the road. But it's been a challenge a
little bit. I think she's doing well, she's practicing. We do‑‑ our team of
people do an amazing job just checking on the status of her knees all the
time. She does get some swelling in there, but I was kidding her the other
day, I'm like, you're a pencil that swallowed a grape. That's just how she's
built. She's a stick. So she swells a little bit there in her knees. The big
thing is that we stay on top of it medically and from a conditioning
standpoint, as well.  
As coaches we meet every day with our trainer and strength‑and‑conditioning
coach just to make sure we have a good plan for her that day.  
Does she do everything in practice? No, she doesn't need to do everything in
practice. But she's out there and she's competing and she's doing well when
she's in there. So that makes me happy.  
  
Q. You mentioned the young kids. Who are some of the young kids who are
standing out right now who I might not know about who are going to show up
real early?  
SUZY MERCHANT: Well, Aerial Powers is an incredible swing guy. She can play a
3. Eventually I think she'll be someone that can go back and forth between a 3
or a 4. She's out of Detroit Country Day, like a 6'0", 6'1", creates her own
shot, athletic, long; has some catch‑up to do a little bit defensively,
certainly like most incoming freshmen at this level, but is a real talented
kid, a real talented scorer.  
The other one that she's a little bit hindered with an injury right now but
we're going to get her back here shortly is Brandi Agee out of Detroit Cass
Tech. They just put‑‑ 1st of October basically they put a pin in the outside
of her foot. She had a fifth metatarsal crack on the outside bone of her left
foot. They put that pin in, and it's usually a six‑week thing. So we're
thinking she might miss two or three games early. But she's an unbelievable
athlete and talent. She can handle it, she can shoot it, she can get to the
rim, very competitive. I see those two freshmen as being very impactful for
us.  
I was asked about Madison Williams. Hopefully we all see her. I think Becca
Mills as a sophomore has really had a great summer. She did some nice things
for us last year as a freshman, and I think this summer she's really had a
nice off season, as well.  
  
Q. When you have those injuries and you've got people in and out of practice
and they can only go do so much, how difficult is it to have a feel for what
you have and how you're going to start the season?  
SUZY MERCHANT: Yeah, I appreciate that. That is an interesting dilemma that we
have every day, and we have to play a lot of different combinations given our
situation. Right now the nice thing is on the women's side that we have a
scout team that helps us a little bit, so we can try those combinations
against other kids while maybe some‑‑ like a Maddie might not be able to do
that drill perhaps. We have a situation with Brandi she can walk through some
stuff, but she can't do anything live. We've had a lot of those in‑and‑out
type kids playing multiple positions.  
For us we've used our scout team, who is as good of a scout team as I've seen,
to be honest with you. Two of the guys have tried out for Izzo's team and have
practiced with them. They're like borderline could make it, and I'll tell you,
that's never happened before. So they're very, very talented group of guys,
which helps us obviously get better.  
And that's one thing we needed to do early with all of our injuries early on.  
  
Q. What do you expect from the new coaches in the league?  
SUZY MERCHANT: Well, I think there's no question that every hire that's come
through has been one that's impressive and done some amazing things nationally
with the programs they were at. So I'm excited. I think our league is just
getting better and better. I think they bring‑‑ certainly come from programs
that they themselves helped build and take it to an extremely high level. They
certainly know what recruiting is all about, they know what it's going to take
in the rigors of the next level.  
I think Curt, Matt and Kim will do a very, very good job in the league. They
each have their own systems and styles that they're going to bring to our
conference, which some we've seen, some we haven't seen, and it's to be
determined.  
But I'm excited for it. I think those are three great hires for the Big Ten
conference.  
  
Q. I know you'd like to see Jasmine Thomas slow down a little bit in the way
she plays. What speed has she been playing at in practices and what kind of
leadership?  
SUZY MERCHANT: That's a great question. The three things I just talked to her
about right now, the only three things that matter from my perspective just to
keep her focused on is number one is ball security and that comes with exactly
what you said, the pace that she keeps and the decisions that she makes and
you can't go so fast that you don't take the ball with you. You can't go so
fast your teammates don't know what we're in. So that kind of is something
that we talk about with ball security.  
Having more of a commanding presence, going offense to defense, defense to
offense, I mean, you need a PG out there that's really loud and aggressive and
has that commanding presence.  
And then the last thing for me is to challenge her defensively. I mean, she's
a world‑class athlete. She's an amazing specimen that way, and she should be
able to keep people in front of her and do a really good job for us
defensively.  
When you ask me about her, especially early on with some of our limitations,
it's going to fall on her lap a little bit here out of the gates, and those
are three things our team really needs the most.  
  
Q. Preseason schedule built for a young team, just to get some success both
at home and on the road?  
SUZY MERCHANT: I think so. I think we knew we were going to lose a lot of kids
and we'd have a big incoming freshman class. And in some ways it's kind of
worked out with some of the injuries that we didn't think we'd have that we do
have and a couple other issues. It's certainly going to challenge us, though.
When you have a young team that's never been there and done it, it is a little
interesting.  
But I do think we have some kids. I mentioned Maddie. I just think she has a
difference presence about her now. Klarissa Bell has had a great off season
and is doing an amazing job in practice with leadership and being a scorer.  
We don't have to rely on all freshmen, but they're going to be impactful and a
big part of what we do early on. That's a you‑never‑know kind of territory.
But we're excited. I think it's really about getting the entire team back
healthy and ready to go for Big Tens, which we fully anticipate happening.  
  
Q. You played against Wisconsin, Green Bay in the NCAA Tournament two years
ago. Can you tell me what you know about Coach Bollant from that experience?  
SUZY MERCHANT: Well, they beat us. I remember that.  
No, they run that motion offense, actually a lot like what Michigan did
because Kevin put it in at Green Bay before he came to U of M, and then when
Matt got the job up there, I think he just kept it and built in his own little
details that he'd like to see within it.  
I think they share the ball well within that system. I think defensively they
do a really nice job of switching screens and being in help side. They really,
really do a good job of not letting you get the ball in the paint, and they'll
switch 1 through 5 screens, and that's tough to play against sometimes.  
And I think those kids were physical and tough. They were a veteran group when
we played them. They had two, I think, Players of the Year in that conference
that were co‑players of the year that were seniors that year. They were really
tough‑nosed kids.  
I think that's what he'll bring, as well. He's got a talented group there at
Illinois. There's some really, really high‑level pieces there, I think. Amber
Moore can really shoot it, you've got Penn inside, you got GodBold, you've got
Magrum, you've got a lot of kids there that really can do some things and I
think fit into the style that I've seen him play at Green Bay. I think they'll
have some success early and maybe more than people expect early.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 25, 2012

  

### [Joe McKeown](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19252)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
JOE McKEOWN: I'm just excited to get going. I think like most people this time
of year, we're actually 4 and 0 instead of probably everybody else is 0 and 0.
We took our team to Italy and played four games, so I'm counting those. You
know, just really looking forward to‑‑ I have five freshmen and four seniors
back basically, so we're really looking forward to trying to blend this team
together. Should be a lot of fun.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit more about Italy and how that might have
matured your team and the experience?  
JOE McKEOWN: Well, it was justfor our players a once‑in‑a‑lifetime experience
probably, and I appreciate Northwestern and Jim Phillips giving us the
opportunity to do that. The NCAA allows you to go every four years, and I know
Coach Carmody took his team, would be three years ago now, and you just saw
how much that helped, just giving freshmen especially a chance to play with
seniors.  
You know, the culture part of it, the team bonding part, you just can't
replace.  
  
Q. Can you speak a little bit about how Dannielle had such a great season
last year, really emerging last year and what kind of role is she going to
play this year as a senior?  
JOE McKEOWN: Yeah, I'm really‑‑ she's had so far a great preseason as far as
workouts and the way we're practicing. I think she at 6'4" can step out and
shoot. She had some injury problems last year that I think stopped her from
maybe even having a better year. But right now she's playing as well as I've
ever seen her play.  
  
Q. I understand you guys talked a little bit about this last night, but
there's a proposal out there for some changes on the women's side of
basketball, lower rims, shot clock. Do you think the game needs some changes?
Is it necessary? Is it practical?  
JOE McKEOWN: You know, I saw‑‑ we talked a little bit last night, some of the
coaches. I saw some of the articles. You know, I think we're still evolving as
a game, and you're going to go through some peaks and valleys when you think
about we've only had the WNBA since 1997, I want to say, and I remember‑‑ I
was fortunate enough to spend a lot of time with Coach Auerbach when I was at
GW and he talked about the early years of the NBA and how much they struggled
at times, too. I think we still have to nurture our game. They talked about in
the NBA putting 12‑foot baskets up year ago.  
I think you have to look at changing things if you feel like they're not
working. I will say this: I would like to see a bigger basketball. I'd like to
see us use a big ball again, and I think we miss a lot of lay‑ups. Some of it
is your ball, some of it is you've got bad lay‑up shooters, and I've got a
little bit of both probably, but I've said that for years. I don't know about
lowering the rims, but I do think we shouldn't be intimidated by change,
either.  
  
Q. Who are a couple of the freshman kids who might be impact players this
year who I might see very early in the season playing?  
JOE McKEOWN: Probably right now we have four freshmen. The one that's probably
been the most consistent as a freshman who's from the Chicago area, Maggie
Lyons, from New Trier High School, same high school as Amy Jaeschke, who just
had an incredible career for us. I think Maggie has a chance to play a lot as
a freshman, contribute a lot. She can really score, doesn't play any defense
like most freshmen. She'll be fine.  
Lauren Douglas is a 6'2", kind of utility player, can play second base,
shortstop, third, everywhere. But she can do everything. Just learning the
game for us. She's from Memphis, Tennessee. So I think those two have really
stepped up.  
Like most freshmen they're up and down, but I'm excited about them.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about Karly Roser? She has one year under her
belt, how she's matured and how her game might have improved over the
summer?  
JOE McKEOWN: Yeah, Karly Roser last year played 35 minutes at point guard in a
league that put seven teams in the NCAA Tournament. We threw her right into
the fire, and it was more sink or swim. She did a great job for us. She's
really come back now I think a much more mature player.  
Really, really excited about her. She's shooting the ball a lot better, she's
running our team better. She's kind of taking control of practice, which you
want to see as a coach.  
She just needs, I think, to just get her confidence level way, way up. It's
tough when you're a sophomore when you've been playing 35 minutes a game as a
freshman and your roles change a little bit. But hopefully‑‑ I think if she
has a great year, that's really going to help us.  
  
Q. You have two seniors, Kendall Hackney and Dannielle Diamant. What kind of
ownership are they taking with this team in their senior year?  
JOE McKEOWN: You know, I think the best thing to happen to us was to put them
in charge of some of the things that we did overseas. They really embrace that
role right now. I think sometimes in athletics, naming captains and things
like that becomes very ceremonial, and I think in their case we haven't even
named a captain yet, but just from a leadership standpoint, they've been
through some really rocky times and some great times at Northwestern. They're
the first two players I recruited when I got the job. So they feel really
invested, and I think they want to have a great senior year.  
They're both healthy now and they're both playing real well.  
  
Q. You have some new coaches in the league. How do you think they're going
to impact the Big Ten?  
JOE McKEOWN: You know, I'll tell you, coming in, they've all come from
programs where they've had tremendous success, whether it's been within their
conference, in the NCAA Tournament. Pretty experienced rookies, actually. I
think they're walking in‑‑ each situation you walk into is a little different,
especially the one I walked into. But you're able to just use your experience.  
So I think all three of the coaches coming in will have an impact on that
program. Their track record is terrific. I think it's great for the league
when you see‑‑ when we do have job openings, the level of coaches that come
into our league.  
  
Q. You talked a little bit about your trip to Italy in the preseason, as
well. Which player have you seen make the biggest improvement so far this
year?  
JOE McKEOWN: Good question. Probably‑‑ we've had a couple people really step
up. I think Karly is one of those where she has just matured a lot. You know,
again, we have a sophomore named Alex Cohen and a junior Meghan McKeown,
coming off tough years with injuries; Alex as a freshman didn't play a lot.
But they really played well in Italy and did a lot of different things for us.
Alex is 6'5" and can play multiple positions, and both of those guys can
really shoot the ball well.  
I think this year hopefully we'll be a much better shooting team. We're going
to spread the floor out more, chuck and duck a little bit.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 25, 2012

  

### [Bobbie Kelsey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22737)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
BOBBIE KELSEY: Very excited about what we have coming back and what we're
adding to our program this year, seven newcomers, seven returners, so
half‑and‑half. We have some people that can jump out and know what they're
doing, unlike last year where we had 12 new people to me and new to our
system.  
So it's a different year for us. We're looking to improve upon what we've done
so far. We're not satisfied with that, so we have a lot of work to do, but
we're excited about it. The kids are excited about it.  
  
Q. What kind of goals have you set for your team this year?  
BOBBIE KELSEY: We always have the goal of improvement. You'll get bored with
me saying that year after year coming here. But we really want to improve upon
what we've already done. Obviously we can improve upon that because it wasn't
as‑‑ we didn't do as well as we wanted to.  
But the kids, we want them to improve individually, and then we improve as a
group, and that will always bode well to your success, in my experience, being
at a high‑caliber team. Kids improve year after year after year, and those
that do that find themselves really achieving their personal goals as well as
the team goals. I'm preaching that constantly to my group.  
  
Q. What didn't you know about being a head coach that you now know and can
utilize going into your second year?  
BOBBIE KELSEY: I think the biggest thing coming from being an assistant at a
top program to being a head coach at a BCS program that has not achieved the
level of success that maybe I was used to was being patient and recruiting
hard. You can't coach what you don't have. The kids now are really hard
workers. They're really talented kids, but you're always looking for the most
talented year after year after year.  
I think now that I am a head coach, it makes me appreciate my former head
coaches that I worked with, not sitting there thinking, well, why doesn't she
do this and that and the other. Now I know, this is why she did not do this,
that and the other, especially working with Tara VanDerveer, I played for her,
as well. I don't know if I would have been ready to be a head coach had I not
worked for her the last previous four years and achieving the level of success
that we did at Stanford. It was really helpful to me.  
  
Q. When you first come in, you have to sort of pick up the pieces and hope
they can do something that you like. System ‑wise, what are you guys going to
look like? How are you going to continue to evolve into what Bobbie Kelsey
basketball is, and what will that be?  
BOBBIE KELSEY: Well, I like the triangle, so that's what we run, and I had an
opportunity to learn it at Stanford, so it's not something that I'm copying
what they're doing. I just like it. I think the kids like it. They actually
love it because I don't have to call plays every time down the floor and they
don't have to look back at me to get a play. Triangle is just where the ball
goes, you know what to do. So kids like it. Everybody gets to touch the ball.
It's not one or two people hogging it and playing two‑on‑two basketball where
you've got other people on the side just watching. It gets everyone involved.  
So we're going to‑‑ we're married to it. We're not getting a divorce from
triangle. We're in it for the long haul.  
I think the more they understand it, the better they'll look running it. It
takes two or three years of the same kids running for it to look fluid and
look very smooth. We're going to stick with it. We're not going to abandon it,
and I think the returners really enjoy it now because they understand what
they're supposed to be doing, what they can look for, and they get really
creative within the flow of the offense, which makes it fun for me because I
don't have to tell them every little thing. They understand it and they flow
with it.  
So that's kind of the direction we're going to continue to move in with the
offense.  
  
Q. You talk about improving. What players so far have really impressed you
with their improvement from the off season into this preseason camp?  
BOBBIE KELSEY: Well, the returners, Morgan Paige and Taylor Wurtz, are our two
most potent offensive threats. Obviously Taylor Wurtz is a player that can
average a double‑double. She almost did last year, 16 points, I think almost
eight rebounds a game from the guard position, so that's really nice to have a
guard that will not only score but that can rebound so you don't have to
outlet the ball to the point guard so she can bring it down and it doesn't
stop your momentum going down the floor.  
And Morgan is just a water bug. She just makes things happen. She's a smart
player, will make a timely cut, a timely score. She just does things that you
cannot teach, nor do I have time to teach. So I think Morgan and Taylor are
going to be the ones we look to to really give us that offensive punch.  
For the newcomers, Nicole Bauman, Gatorade Player of the Year in Wisconsin,
she's probably the most college ready to play if we had to play today. Nicole
would be someone that I would‑‑ she's already proven that she can do some
things out there that some of the other new ones aren't quite ready to do.
She's a great scorer, she's an instinctual player. She doesn't know all the
plays right now, but you couldn't tell because she just goes hard.  
So I think that others can learn from her being a freshman coming in, just
going hard, sometimes that makes up for the things you don't know. But when
kids are really wanting to do it right and perfect things, sometimes that
slows them down because now they're thinking instead of playing.  
Nicole just plays, and she worries about not knowing something later. I like
that she has been able to come in and really show that right away.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 25, 2012

  

### [Jim Foster](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16894)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
Q. One of your favorite topics is preseason awards.  
JIM FOSTER: Yeah.  
  
Q. Tayler Hill, the media and the coaches preseason ‑‑  
JIM FOSTER: Yeah, I think we're going to have the banquet on Monday
(laughing).  
  
Q. Can you speak to the kid you recruited as to how much she has risen from
that kid to the kid who would get that kind of ‑‑  
JIM FOSTER: Well, she's had different responsibilities every year. She came to
us as a very athletic slasher and was complemented with Sammy Prahalis and
Brittany Johnson. Brittany was a great shooter, and Brittany graduated last
year, so Tayler became our shooting guard, and Sammy graduated, so she'll be
playing a significant amount of point. I just think it gives you an indication
of how varied her skill set is and how much she's improved in a lot of areas.  
  
Q. Are we all invited to the banquet?  
JIM FOSTER: Yes. You're emcee.  
  
Q. How did you get your team prepared to play on an aircraft carrier?  
JIM FOSTER: You just go outside to the local playground on a windy day and
throw it up. If the wind is blowing, we're taking it to the hole. That's all I
can tell you.  
  
Q. I guess some of the ‑‑ I guess the million‑dollar question this year is
how is your team so far filling the void of Sam Prahalis being gone?  
JIM FOSTER: Very well. I'm very happy with the first three weeks of practice.
The ball is really popping. We've had some significant improvement by our post
players, and instead of the ball being in Sammy's hands, as gifted as she was,
actually Adams may be the best passing post player in the country.  
Tayler Hill is doing a terrific job at point; Ameryst Alston at freshman is
very, very good with the ball, makes terrific decisions. We're just looking
forward to getting to play some games.  
  
Q. You mentioned just style of play ‑‑  
JIM FOSTER: Go Giants.  
  
Q. Oh, my gosh, I know. One style of play with Sammy, 40 minutes a game. How
will you guys really be a different team when we see you play?  
JIM FOSTER: I don't necessarily think we're going to be that different, except
the ball is not going to be in one person's hands as often as it was.  
Sammy had a skill set that was more of a combination guard than a true point
guard. But very gifted passer. And we were very good in transition as a
result, but I think we're‑‑ early indications are we're going to be as good in
transition because we've got a lot of speed and will probably get our post
players a little bit more into the early transition.  
But I think those‑‑ I'm not asking anybody to walk in and score 20 points a
game, but I think you'll see people's point production go up incrementally,
and we'll be a more balanced team this year in my opinion.  
  
Q. I guess there's some proposal or discussion out there about some changes
to the game, lower rim, bigger ball, shorter shot clock. Does the game itself
need any changes, and if so, what would you like to see?  
JIM FOSTER: I really don't think about that stuff. Geno has got a team that
allows him to have escapist moments, and the rest of us are spending a lot of
time trying to get our team better.  
  
Q. There are three new coaches in the league this year, and there was one
last year. But how do the new coaches help the league do you think?  
JIM FOSTER: You know, it's just‑‑ I'm about to maybe purchase my third home in
11 years in Columbus, and I did the same thing in Nashville, I had three homes
in 11 years. If you can't‑‑ if you're not changing your job‑‑ I like changing
my location, and I like the fact that we have new coaches, which allows you
the opportunity to prepare this year for three different philosophies that
weren't present last year.  
I think we've had 24 coaching changes since I've been in the Big Ten, so it's
not something we're not used to.  
  
Q. What are your expectations for Tayler Hill this season and how have you
seen her game kind of progress so far?  
JIM FOSTER: Well, I expect her to lead. She's got to have the ball in her
hands, and I think that goes hand in hand with that. I think she's done a very
good job the first three weeks. I thought my team was prepared earlier this
year when we walked into the gym when we were allowed to be with them. It was
very obvious that our seniors had done a great job through the course of the
summer of implementing some of the things we like to do. So it was a very easy
transition.  
I'd say Tayler, Amber Stokes and Emilee Harmon would be very responsible for
that.  
  
Q. Who has stepped up or who needs to step up with the loss of Beach
inside?  
JIM FOSTER: I think that's an area where we have a lot of candidates. Darryce
Moore has really played well the first three weeks. We thought Darryce had a
lot of potential, and it took her that first year‑‑ I think she struggled with
conditioning and such, but I think she shot 58 percent from the floor last
year, and she's a very gifted passer. She's playing at a very high level.  
Martina Ellerbe, Emilee Harmon‑‑ Amy Scullion and Emilee Harmon have been
healthy for their first time at Ohio State, and they had terrific off seasons,
and they look very good. So we've got‑‑ that's a position that we have some
depth at.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 25, 2012

  

### [Pam Borton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14360)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
PAM BORTON: Well, it's great to be here. Great to see everybody. Good morning.
Obviously everybody is excited about the season. This is everybody's favorite
time of the year because we get to teach and get into the gym and practice and
so forth.  
But really I'm excited about this team this year. Really we are able to build
off how we finished the season last year, ending the season with a win,
playing three and a half more weeks of basketball, four extra games.  
Freshmen have brought a lot to our team. I know I said that last year with
Rachel Banham, and I think she proved everybody right with what a freshman
last year brought to our team.  
What our freshmen bring to our team this year is more ball handling. They're
tougher. We've got more speed on the floor, and I think that was probably one
of our Achilles heels last year was just more ball handlers, our speed on the
perimeter, and just basically taking care of the basketball.  
I think if you look at a lot of stats, our stats from last year, the turnovers
were really the difference of winning and losing basketball games.  
But I'm excited to get all of our kids healthy back on the floor. Rachel
Banham was just cleared to practice this week from recovering from a blood
clot this summer and I can answer some questions about that. But we're excited
about the season and put a lot better team on the floor this year.  
  
Q. I guess I will start with that because I wasn't aware that Rachel had had
any problems. How long has she been sidelined, and I guess will she start the
season?  
PAM BORTON: Yes. Well, it was the middle of July when we had discovered a
blood clot in her lung, very genetic, got it from one of her parents. It was a
very flukish thing that happens to people and athletes that sometimes don't
make it. We were very fortunate to have caught it in the middle of July. She
was hospitalized for a couple days and put on medication.  
But she is healthy. She's been in practice ever since we started practice,
just doing no‑contact activities, five on 0. She's been able to keep most of
her conditioning in practice, but she will start fully this weekend, actually
tomorrow. So we're excited to have her back and excited she's healthy.  
  
Q. You were the most successful program in the postseason last year in the
Big Ten, going 4 and 0. There were eight qualifiers for the postseason. What
does that say about the quality of competition in this league and on a
national level?  
PAM BORTON: I think it's a tough league. Number one, I'd like to get ourselves
to the NCAA Tournament, so that's definitely our goal this year is to contend
to win a Big Ten title and get ourselves to the NCAA Tournament. Any time you
can play some extra games in the postseason is great.  
But I think the Big Ten was very deep last year with a lot of talent, very
talented seniors. I thought the programs did a great job just scheduling and
putting themselves in a position to figure out a way to get seven teams in the
NCAA Tournament.  
I think we have a great chance of doing that again this year, just with the
quality of players, the quality of coaches that we have, the quality of the
schedules that people put together, and then just the quality of play.  
  
Q. I think last year I talked to you about Rachel Banham at this thing, but
there was another kid, Kayla Hirt, who everybody told me was going to be ‑‑  
PAM BORTON: Good if not better.  
  
Q. How is she this year coming off the injury?  
PAM BORTON: She's doing well. She's back. She's healthy. She's a 6'2" athlete
that we're going to be playing at the power forward position. She's a prolific
scorer, great athlete. She's still shaking some of the rust off herself a
little bit. She hasn't played in a couple years, but she's a great scorer,
great rebounder, great athlete, probably one of the toughest ‑‑ biggest gym
rats that I've seen. She's one of those throwback kids that every coach looks
for those kids that you have to kick out of the gym.  
But Kayla Hirt, she was a top‑25 kid in the country coming out of high school
before she got injured, and I think she's still a top 100 kid. But she will be
starting for us this year at the power forward position. I think she's going
to be a match‑up issue for a lot of teams at the forward just because she can
score. She can shoot, she can put the ball on the floor, she rebounds. I think
she's a lot like‑‑ I hate to compare players, but I think she's a lot like
Hooper at Nebraska and just that type of scorer, shooter, can play in and out.
She's not there yet because I think Hooper is a pretty special player, but I
think that's the vision that we have for her. But she'll be starting for us
this year, and it gives us another legit scorer on the floor.  
  
Q. Before Rachel's blood clot this summer, what were the things that she was
trying to work on in the off season to get better?  
PAM BORTON: Well, I think the biggest thing I wanted her to work on was just
getting in the best shape in her life, and then her leadership skills. She's
one of our captains this year, and just her becoming a great leader and her
and I getting on the same page, not that we weren't on the same page, but just
that type of relationship that a head coach and a point guard needs to have,
and being able to trust her with things off the court, information, getting
her opinion, and she was in my office four times a week in the summer. She'd
stop by and you could see her doing that and working on things.  
She's become a great leader. She gets it. Her being more vocal on the floor.
But I think her leadership skills are probably the biggest thing that we both
wanted her to get better at this summer.  
  
Q. You mentioned getting to the NCAA Tournament as your goal after winning
the NIT. What will it take to get over the hump and start beating the Purdues,
the Ohio States, Penn States and so on and so forth in the conference?  
PAM BORTON: I think it's a couple things. Number one, it's playing consistent.
I think we had a lack of consistency last year with production from players. I
think we played well at home. I think we went 15 and 4 at home, but we went 1
and 9 on the road, so we've got to learn to win on the road, and that's with
veteran players, veteran teams.  
I think there were six games in the Big Ten that we lost by one or two
possessions. I think Big Ten games sometimes are a fine line. Whether you
close out three of those games, three out of the six depends on if you're
eighth or fourth, and I just think it's a fine line for a lot of teams in the
Big Ten. Just being able to close out close games, learning to win some games
on the road and taking care of home court. It sounds pretty simple, but it's
not when you get into the Big Ten.  
So I think that's all we need to do. It's not like we've got to work our magic
or throw everything that we've been doing out the window. But we just have to
figure out how to close out some games and win on the road.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 25, 2012

  

### [Matt Bollant](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22150)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
MATT BOLLANT: Really excited to be here, excited to be in the Big Ten, and
just so fortunate to have an amazing staff and a staff that we're so together
and so talented. And then inherited a team that was really open and trusting.
I think if you want to sum up kind of our spring and fall, look at the
transformation in Karisma Penn. From when we got there, with her work ethic,
her drive, her desire to lead and do things the right way, when we got there
compared to now is just an absolute worlds apart.  
We've had I don't know how many practices, 14, 15 practices, and she's been
our best defender, our hardest worker in just about every one of those
practices. We challenged her to do that. When your best players are your
hardest workers, you've got a chance to overachieve, and that's what we're
believing is going to happen this year.  
Really excited to get back to practice tonight and get better, and we're
taking it one day at a time. We have a system that will fit our athleticism,
and we're going to play very quickly, very aggressively and play similar to
what we did at Green Bay, but even a little bit faster and more aggressively.  
Thank you.  
  
Q. You mentioned overachieving. Isn't it possible that you do have a good
bit of talent and that you could really have a pretty good season?  
MATT BOLLANT: Yeah, certainly that's one of the things I looked at in the job
is what's the returning talent and how does it figure in the system. We're a
switching team, we switch 1 through 5, we want to play real quickly run,
dribble motion, so yeah we inherited some very talented players, some players
that have a high level of athleticism and just need to be taught how to be
fundamentally sound, how to play some triple threat, how to pass with their
feet on the floor, and so we're certainly excited, and certainly something
that drew me to the job over some other possibilities was the returning
talent.  
  
Q. What's the biggest adjustments you've found so far moving from Green Bay
up to Illinois, and what's your challenge in recruiting for a program that
hasn't been as successful in recent years?  
MATT BOLLANT: Yeah, it's been kind of what we had hoped for in the recruiting.
Honestly, the class that we'll sign here in November is every bit and probably
more talented than any of the classes we ever had at Green Bay, and that's
kind of why coaches leave the mid‑major leveling. I get that question a lot.
Why would you leave a program that's ranked in the top 15 in the country three
years in a row, and really it's about the recruiting. If we're ranked in the
top 10 in the country at Illinois, which we believe that's where we're headed,
and we can go after any recruit in the country. Here at Green Bay we still had
to wait to see what the Big Ten schools‑‑ I think we beat a Big Ten school one
time on a player in my five years there, and a lot of times we beat them on
the court, but we couldn't beat them in recruiting. So that's why you leave,
and the recruiting has gone extremely well.  
We have a transfer, Sarah Hartwell, from Georgia Tech I believe is going to be
a star in our program. She has to sit out this year, but is a four‑star kid
coming out of high school kid, that at Green Bay we don't get Sarah Hartwell
and we go to Illinois and her AAU coach calls me and tells me this is the most
athletic kid ever to coach and he's had 50 Division I players, so pretty
exciting.  
I guess the biggest adjustment would just be a different team, in teaching
from the beginning. The cultures at Green Bay were so strong. If anybody
watched us practice, they'd say you practice as hard as any team in the
country, day in and day out, and teaching those cultures at Illinois. But our
kids have bought in; they've given us hearts and their trust and they've done
extremely well trying to build those cultures.  
  
Q. When you look at the names of the players, the top players in the
conference, to me one is obviously missing and that's Karisma and maybe that's
because she's underperformed. Do you feel like at the end of this season she's
going to be right there with the Player of the Year just with her rebounding
numbers and her scoring and her field goal percentage ability?  
MATT BOLLANT: Yeah, absolutely. Where she was at this spring, she may not have
been deserving of being on that top 8. Where she's at right now, she's one of
the best players in our league. There's absolutely no reason why she can't be
a First Team All Big Ten player and lead our team offensively, defensively. I
believe she's a WNBA prospect and I think she'll lead us and be extremely
good, in every aspect of the game. If you watch her, she can guard point
guards. We'll switch and she'll guard our quickest point guards, and she might
be our second best on‑ball defender and then she can block shots and rebound,
run the floor and do everything.  
But certainly, yeah, she wasn't on that list, and I'm disappointed for her.
But I think what matters is who's on the end‑of‑the‑year list, and that's
where I believe she'll be.  
  
Q. Aside from Karisma, are there any other players that maybe you were
surprised about or going to show a lot of improvement this year?  
MATT BOLLANT: Yeah, when I got there, the point guard position was a concern.
They graduated Lydia McCully and didn't really have much for a backup point
guard last year. Then when Lydia rotated out, the tapes I watched they really
struggled at the point. But Alexis Smith has come in and gotten in great
shape. She'll be our starting point guard and she'll be a really good point
guard in the Big Ten.  
I think if you look at a reason why this team is going to be transformed and
be night‑and‑day better than what they were last year, I think Karisma Penn
buying in and then also the point guard play. Alexis is as fast and as strong
as probably any point guard in the country, and I think the combination of her
speed and strength‑‑ there's a lot of point guards that are really, really
quick, but we very, very few that have her strength and ability to finish at
the rim. She's going to be able to get the rim; we're going to run our dribble
motion and play really fast, and she's going to be a big part of that.  
Probably part of her adjustment, I think our fans ‑‑ she didn't play much last
year and she wasn't very effective. She's going to go from not playing to
being one of the best sophomore point guards in the conference, and we believe
one of the best point guards around.  
  
Q. How will you define success this year in your first season?  
MATT BOLLANT: We're talking about getting better every day. For us we want to
be a different basketball team at the end of this week than we were last week.
We've done that the first three weeks of practice. We've been a much better
basketball team at the end of the week, and hopefully at the end of each day.  
We were a better basketball team yesterday at the end of practice than we were
the start, and just growing each and every day.  
John Wooden said, the worst thing you can think about in basketball is losing;
the next worst thing you can think about is winning. We didn't want to get
caught up in the end result; we want to get caught up in getting better every
day, learning to play as hard as any team in the country, learning to play as
together as anybody and learning to play as smart as anybody, and when we do
that, success will follow.  
  
Q. Big picture, where do you think this Illinois program can go, and what's
sort of your timetable? I want to be in the top 3 NCAAs? Is all this something
that you think is doable?  
MATT BOLLANT: Absolutely. I had some other opportunities, great opportunities,
and obviously Green Bay returning five seniors to this year's team and
probably should be the most talented they've ever been, so you don't leave
that unless you believe it can happen at Illinois and happen fast.  
Our depth is a concern this year, but besides that, we believe we can be great
this year and have a great first year, play in the postseason and go from
there.  
But obviously there's challenges ahead. We've got to get better every day. But
we really believe this is going to happen fast for us.  
  
Q. As an outsider before this year, just your impressions of the league, and
now obviously with Nebraska in, but kind of your thoughts on where the Big Ten
is at right now and where maybe it needs to go.  
MATT BOLLANT: Yeah, obviously we played six Big Ten teams in the last two
years at Green Bay and had great success. But at the same time I really feel
like the league is going to take a jump. The men's conference is the number 1
in the country; the volleyball is number 1 in the country. I don't see any
reason why women's basketball can't take a jump. I don't think we're going to
be the Big 12 this year, but why can't we challenge to be the No.2 conference.
I think the coaches are very good, the talent is good, and I think it's going
to get better. I think the Big Ten network is a huge plus for our conference,
and I think to get 7 teams in the league, in the tournament last year is a
great success. Now we need to win in the NCAA tournaments and have teams
advance to the Final Four, and hopefully that's where the league is going. But
I think it's a very bright future for women's basketball in the Big Ten.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 25, 2012

  

### [Lisa Bluder](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16868)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
LISA BLUDER: Well, this year is exciting for us because we have the
opportunity to host a national tournament to begin the season, and we have an
opportunity to host a national tournament at the end of our season. So not
often do you get the opportunity to bookend your seasons with hosting both
types of tournaments.  
We're in the preseason WNIT; we have guaranteed hosting the first two rounds
in Carver Hawkeye arena and we've also been awarded the NCAA first and second
rounds in Carver Hawkeye arena. So it's a great opportunity for our team, and
we have three tremendous seniors on our team that I would love to see them
take full benefit of this.  
  
Q. Just an update on Printy, where is she at in her rehab?  
LISA BLUDER: She's doing very well. Jaime, as you know, suffered an ACL tear
the beginning of February, so kind of late in the year last year, but she's
had a successful surgery, a great summer of rehabbing, and she is doing almost
everything in practice at this time. Not completely 100 percent everything in
practice but just about.  
Yesterday she took a charge against a guy in practice, and I just smiled at
her because that's another hurdle. Every day we kind of go through those
hurdles, and when you learn that your knee is okay and it can take those
things, that's most of the battle is the mental part of it.  
  
Q. Of the first four coaches that are speaking this morning, I think you
were the only one that was here last year. What do the new faces bring to the
conference or the reputation of the conference and maybe challenge ‑wise for
the coaches that were here in the past?  
LISA BLUDER: Well, we have three exceptional new coaches in this league. All
three of them have had a lot of success on the national level. So I think it's
just going to just make our conference‑‑ continue to make our conference
stronger by bringing great coaches into our league.  
You know, the thing it poses for us veterans is we've got to work a little
harder on those scouting reports again because you don't know the style of
play that you've been seeing from an Illinois, Indiana, Michigan consistently
over the last several years, so we have to work a little bit harder in
preparing for those people. But they've got the harder job because they have a
whole bunch of new people to learn about.  
  
Q. You have a lot of depth at a lot of different spots, maybe even more so
than in the past, especially in the post with Bethany Doolittle and Morgan
Johnson. What do those two bring and how do you like the pieces of your team
as a whole from a depth perspective?  
LISA BLUDER: I like the depth that we have on this team because in the past we
haven't had any, so it's‑‑ any depth is great depth for us. But we do have‑‑ I
feel like we are solid in every position with a backup there, and that's just
something we haven't had in the past. We've kind of had to piecemeal things
together because of injuries.  
But this year‑‑ and another thing that's kind of different about our team this
year is we won't be relying on freshmen to carry us. In the past we've always
out of necessity had a freshman that's entered into the starting lineup and
really had to carry our team and show up big to begin with, when this year I
don't think that'll happen, and I think that's good for our basketball team.  
  
Q. You do have a lot of good players coming back, but you did lose Kamille
Wahlin, and she kind of had the keys to the car for like four years. Did
Samantha Logic learn enough last year do you think to maybe ease that
transition?  
LISA BLUDER: Yeah, you had to bring that up. Kamille is definitely a loss, and
when you have a four‑year starter like her that was such a great leader, too,
it's hard to replace that. But I do think Samantha Logic just got better and
better as the year went on last year. I think in the last month of the season
she was three‑time co‑Big Ten Player of the Year‑‑ Big Ten Player of the Week,
excuse me. So she just got better and better. I think over the summer she's
really developed more leadership skills. Even though we have three seniors
that are captains of this team, she is definitely a leader on the floor, and
everybody around her knows that.  
So I think she's looking forward to the role of taking over for Kamille in
that leadership role, and I think she'll do a fabulous job for us.  
  
Q. With a healthy Jaime, let's say we assume that, are you a top three team?
You look who people voted, maybe one and two are solid. Could you be the third
best team in the conference?  
LISA BLUDER: You know, I think one and two are really solid in our league. I
think there's a bunch of us that could be three through six, and I think that
we could definitely be in the mix of that discussion. But again, doesn't
matter, and I always kind of like to throw that back into my players' face,
too.  
  
Q. You're the most experienced Big Ten coach in the conference. What do you
think about the three new head coaches joining the conference and what do you
think the biggest challenge is coaching in the Big Ten?  
LISA BLUDER: Well, the biggest challenge I think of coaching in the Big Ten,
and when I came here 13 years ago, I know it was for me, is that there are no
easy teams in the Big Ten. There are no games that you can automatically say,
oh, that's going to be a W or that's going to be a W. It just doesn't happen.
There's too good of coaches in this league; there's too good of athletes in
this league. We have some great home court advantages, so going on the road is
difficult in this league.  
I think that's what's the difference is coming into this league, is that you
probably came from a league, with the exception of Kim, that you were playing
where you knew you were going to win those games, and you just don't have that
in this league.  
  
Q. Seems like one thing you have that nobody else has is Morgan. What has
she worked on in the off season, and will we see a player that has taken a
step or two beyond where she was a year ago?  
LISA BLUDER: You know, I am so thrilled that I get to go to practice every day
and Morgan Johnson is there, because not only is she a great player, she's
obviously a presence inside, at 6'5"; last year she was the seventh best field
goal percentage shooter in America; she was 24th or 26th best blocked shots in
America, but she brings a joy to practice every day that you just don't get,
especially out of big girls. I mean, big girls are usually a little bit
quieter, they're not the ones that talk a lot. She is exuberant every day in
practice. She just brings a joy and a level of effort that our freshmen really
need to learn from.  
I am thrilled that Morgan is returning. I think she's going to be a great
senior year. I'm thrilled that she's been voted on the preseason all Big Ten
team because I think it's deservedly so.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 25, 2012

  

### [Kim Barnes Arico](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24309)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
KIM BARNES ARICO: Well, thanks, everybody, for being here this morning. I am
truly excited to be here and represent the Big Ten as well as the University
of Michigan. I was at St.John's for the past 10 years, and I didn't have to
leave, and I would have only left for something incredibly special, and that
something is the University of Michigan.  
Michigan is a wonderful place. I'm truly excited to be there. I'm truly
excited to have the opportunity to coach the student athletes in our program
as well as an opportunity to coach against some of the best coaches in the
country in the Big Ten, as well as some of the best players in the country.  
I think our league is getting stronger and stronger. Last year we sent seven
teams to the NCAA Tournament, and I think we returned a lot of great players
and a lot of great teams, so it's just getting tougher and tougher each and
every year. But I'm excited to be a part of it.  
Our program, we graduated two special players last year, but we have a core
group of five seniors returning, led by Jenny Ryan and Rachel Sheffer.  
Jenny Ryan is really a special young lady. I don't know if you guys will have
the opportunity to meet with her today, but she is truly the heart and soul of
our team. I've been doing this for a long time, and I've really never found a
leader as strong as her for her age. So she's a special, special young lady.  
And Rachel Sheffer is probably our most talented kid. She works extremely hard
every day. But I think our team is led by that core group of seniors, and they
have done some pretty terrific things since the day they stepped on campus.  
So I am excited to be their coach and to be at the University of Michigan and
to be here today. So thanks again, and any questions.  
  
Q. When you meet the kids for the first time, how well did you know these
kids, but what's the toughest thing about coming into a new program and
meeting kids for the first time and saying, hi, I'm your boss now.  
KIM BARNES ARICO: Well, I think a couple things. First, I had the opportunity
to watch them play in the NCAA Tournament live because they were at the same
site as we were, so that was really nice, so I kind of got to see them a
little bit and see how hard they worked and got a little bit of a feel for
them. But any time you coming into a program, and they were coming off one of
their most successful years in program history, so I didn't know how they
would receive me.  
Their coach wasn't let go; they really loved their coach, so I wasn't sure
what things were going to be like. But I can tell you this: From the first
minute I was hired I reached out to them, and that was the first thing I did
was to give them all a call, and then the next day I had an opportunity to
meet with them, and they are just such wonderful kids that they opened their
arms to me, they embraced me, they embraced my family, and they welcomed
having a new coach in their program.  
And I think that has made my transition a lot easier than it could have been,
because you never know. Like you said, when you take over a team, you never
know how the players and the program are going to respond. But these kids are
just really incredible kids. They're Michigan kids, and they're great
character kids. So they've welcomed me and my family with open arms, and that
has really helped make the transition smooth.  
  
Q. Your words on Jenny Ryan are pretty strong, saying she's the strongest
leader for her age. Can you give a specific example of what she has done that
maybe took you aback?  
KIM BARNES ARICO: Yeah, I think a lot of times kids are afraid to say things
or to act a certain way because they don't know how their peers are going to
respond, so a lot of times for players that age it's more about making friends
or keeping friends than saying the right thing and doing the right thing. And
Jenny never has a fear for that. She's our most energetic player. She comes to
practice every day with a certain level‑‑ a certain passion for the game of
basketball. She wants to win and be the best at every single thing that she
does every second.  
And you know, you have kids, and I'm sure you guys see this, where one minute
they look great and the next minute they're not so great and they have bumps
in the road and they're up and down, and that's a typical kid. But Jenny is
never like that. She never has a bad day. She never takes a possession off.
She just is an incredible worker, does everything she does 100 percent all the
time.  
And that's kind of the consistency with which she's performs. It's a whole
'nother level.  
  
Q. What have the first couple of weeks of practice been like, the adjustment
to you and the adjustment of the freshmen to the upperclassmen?  
KIM BARNES ARICO: Yeah, I guess probably every coach up here is kind of going
through the first couple weeks of practice, but when you take over a new
program, and I always have to remind myself at the end of the day, golly,
these kids have never done these drills or it's their first time with me, so
it's a learning curve, it's a learning experience. So it's taken a little bit
of time, but their culture‑‑ the culture that's already established, the
culture that's already been developed is one they're going to work extremely
hard at anything they do. So I never have to question their commitment, their
work ethic and whether or not they're buying into what we're trying to do.  
The freshmen, I mean, for every freshman it's a big, big adjustment. We have
four freshmen, three of which are coming off of ACL injuries. So that's pretty
tough.  
And the other freshman is Madison Ristovski, who was Miss Michigan last year,
so there are a lot of high expectations for her. But she's really come in and
adjusted to college basketball pretty smoothly. Obviously I think she's
getting adjusted to the schedule because when you're a college basketball
player, there's never really a second off. She's kind of adjusting to that.
But her play on the court has been really good, really solid, and I think
she's going to contribute for us this season.  
  
Q. (No microphone).  
KIM BARNES ARICO: Yeah, too early. Jenny and Rachel both started last year,
and without question they will be in the starting lineup. After that it's
probably a mix of five, six or seven kids.  
  
Q. Since you're new in the league, what will be your style? What will be
your stamp on this program? What should people look for when watching your
team?  
KIM BARNES ARICO: Well, I think my first couple years it's probably going to
be a combination of the style that I played for the last few years at
St.John's, but also a style that fits our program.  
You know, I think I have to play to the strength of the players in the
program. I can't come in and try to revamp everything if I don't have the
players to play the kind of style that I want to play.  
So I'm in the process of figuring out the strengths and weaknesses of our team
and playing to our team's strength. So I think it's going to be a combination
of things.  
You know, I would prefer‑‑ I'd like to pick up pressure defense, played
full‑court type of style, but I think, like I said, it's going to be‑‑ our
team really shoots the three really well. We move the ball well. We share the
basketball extremely well. So I think it's going to be a combination of the
Old Style and a little bit of mix of my style.  
  
Q. You're not the only new coach in the conference right now. Do you take
any comfort in knowing you've got some other newcomers in the conference and
the type of struggles you might go through or the ups and downs?  
KIM BARNES ARICO: Well, it's always nice to know that you're not the lone
ranger, so it's nice to know that people are going through the same struggles
as you are. But also we just have to worry about our program and trying to get
better each and every day. So I'm sure they feel the same way, but they are
tremendous coaches, the new coaches coming in the league as well as the
coaches that are already here. So I'm really looking forward to the
opportunity to coach against some of the best coaches in the country.  
  
Q. You come from a league that gets 9, 10 teams in the NCAA and they get in
the Final Four. Kind of a two ‑parter, but what was your view of the Big Ten
before you got here and how does the Big Ten take that next step?   
KIM BARNES ARICO: Well, I think last year was really a big step for the Big
Ten, and I think they kind of took that first step. Being in the BIG EAST for
the last 10 years, I've kind of watched it go from a league that had five to a
league that had record‑breaking teams go, and it was really kind of neat to be
a part of that because you knew that you didn't have to win the league and it
was always pretty tough to win the league with Connecticut and Notre Dame. But
you knew if you were in the top of the league, you were probably a top‑20 team
in the country, and that's kind of special. You knew you were going to get a
berth every year being in the top half of our league.  
And I think the Big Ten is on its way there. I think last year was really a
step in the right direction. Getting seven teams is incredible, and now the
depth of our league‑‑ our league is growing each and every day, and players ‑‑
just being at Michigan for a short period of time, players around the country
want to play in the Big Ten. The schools in the Big Ten are so rich in
tradition and pride and their campuses are unbelievable atmospheres, so I
think for me to be at Michigan and just to be surrounded by the teams in our
league is really great, and I think our league is going to get better each and
every year.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 4, 2012

  

### [KK Houser](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23272)

### [Brittany Rayburn](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19283)

### [Sharon Versyp](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16880)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Purdue  74  
Nebraska  70

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Purdue head coach Sharon Versyp and
student‑athletes KK Houser and Brittany Rayburn.  
Coach, an opening statement.  
COACH VERSYP: What an amazing championship run. Nebraska takes us five
overtimes. They beat us in three overtimes. Takes us two to beat them.  
Just an incredible basketball game. The wills of both teams. And the biggest
thing, they knocked down free throws like no tomorrow. But we did a great job
on the boards and our defense is exceptionally solid.  
We made the free throw when we needed it at the end of the game to seal it.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Brittany, to finally get a championship during your time at Purdue?  
BRITTANY RAYBURN: It's a great feeling. We said coming into this year with six
seniors and underclassmen that played their butts off every day, it's just
something that we came into this, we've been through a lot of adversity with
this team, near‑death experiences and many injuries to fight through.  
But we played through this and we came together as a team and it's a great
feeling.  
  
Q. KK, what kind of role did you have to assume today when they were taking
care of Brittany a little bit and Moses a little bit?  
KK HOUSER: I had to set my team up, and we executed our plays. We were getting
Brittany and Courtney open.  
The first half we didn't execute, but the second half I thought we did a lot
better job and we executed our plays. We we're getting the people open that we
need to.  
  
Q. Brittany, you talked all season about this being a team. Today you and
Courtney struggled from the field, but you get big contributions from KK and
Chantel and obviously others. Just did sort of that theme for the whole season
really pay off today?  
BRITTANY RAYBURN: Oh, yes, I think that's what makes us the victors of this
tournament. We have a deep team. Anybody any day can go off.  
We're all very unselfish people. I mean, when somebody's on, we get it back to
them. KK was on, and we needed it. And obviously it shows what great of an
all‑around team we have.  
  
Q. Brittany, can you talk about the job KK did defensively, five steals,
what she did to determine the game a little bit?  
BRITTANY RAYBURN: She determined the game in every game we played. She's
constantly guarding their best offensive player. Whenever we put her on
somebody, she locks them down and she makes it her job to help this team in
any way she can, whether it's lockdown D or getting points, and she did an
amazing job of that this entire tournament.  
  
Q. KK, was this a bit of a redemption game for you, two ‑part, from the
first Nebraska game but also last night's game when you had some turnovers? I
mean, you didn't have a turnover tonight in 39minutes.   
KK HOUSER: Really, I just‑‑ I gotta let the games go. The games I have high
turnovers, I don't think about them the next day. If I dwell on it, it's just
going to get worse.  
I came in today thinking we have six seniors that I have to play for, we
deserve this. So I just played hard today. I thought nothing of my turnovers.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Sharon, just with KK, her floor game, obviously her defense was a big
spark, but how she bounced back so quickly after yesterday?  
COACH VERSYP: I think it was a huge key. We just talked. It's her turn. We've
had different players‑‑ we've all played great, defense, team defense. Sharing
the basketball.  
But certain players stepped up each game, and said you're going to be the one
that steps up and carries us through today. And she absolutely did that. And
KK's gotten stronger. Her leadership skills continue to get better and she
doesn't carry one game to the next.  
  
Q. Coach, I'm looking for something, some sexy way to define team, because I
see 10 different players with rebounds, nine different players scored. Seven
different players had assists and eight different players had at least
18minutes. Is this team unique in that way; you have so many people that they
just plug in and fit in wherever?  
COACH VERSYP: It's been the history of our program this year. We've been very
successful. Again, we keep talking about adversity and resilience and players
that haven't been able to play so someone else has to step up. And when we're
at our best, we have players stepping up and doing things left and right to
help each other.  
I think that's huge. And we're a true team. Like we talk‑‑ we don't talk about
individuals. You don't just see one face everywhere on our program. It's about
the whole team.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about executing late in the game you did yesterday,
obviously the game winner here and then just overtime the mentality of your
team late in the games and their ability to overcome?  
COACH VERSYP: Biggest thing was we had one bad turnover, but other than that
we needed to stay poised and make sure we got a shot. And it just comes back
to being in tough games. We've been in a lot of close games. We pulled the
majority of them out. The Michigan State when it went into overtime, we had a
chance. We didn't get the shot. And then obviously when Nebraska beat us.  
So those kind of stick in your mind, so we want to make sure we finish.  
  
Q. When Moore kind of lobbed up that 3 ‑pointer with about three seconds
left, what were you guys trying to do defensively? What was your plan there?  
COACH VERSYP: The very last one?  
  
Q. In the second overtime.  
COACH VERSYP: When we were ahead by 4?  
  
Q. Yeah. When Moore tried to tie it.  
COACH VERSYP: Well, what we did we switched every single screen. We switched,
switched, they were trying to go to Moore, trying to go to Hooper. And KK
switched. Chelsea switched. KK switched. Just stayed on that one side of the
floor and we just had our hands straight up.  
She had to launch it and we secured the rebound.  
  
Q. The way Chantel took advantage of her athleticism today, and Connie said
they really didn't have a matchup for her, and just how she took that game to
the level where she was able to get the 10 boards and really impact the game
down low?  
COACH VERSYP: Chantel said that very last rebound: Coach, I felt like I was
flying. I'm like: You were. And when she comes through there, I think her
wrists were way above obviously the rim.  
But she's very athletic, explosive. Didn't feel like she finished very well.
Fighting for 10, maybe two layups.  
We believe in Chantel, and she's a big reason why we keep growing and getting
better. She's taking her outside shots, she can score down low. She doesn't
have those weaknesses like she's had in the past.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about the two plays at the end of regulation when Moses
was blocking and the overtime when KK missed and sort of what you were looking
for? I know the second one you didn't have Brittany in there. Sort of go
through what you were hoping for on both those plays.  
COACH VERSYP: First with Courtney, we were just going to have her attack the
basket. If she didn't have anything, we were going to set a double screen and
get Brittany on the back side.  
Courtney ended up taking it, rather maybe attacking and getting it to
Brittany, but there's a couple of seconds left. So we ended up having three on
her, so we were trying to get around her, so it was more developing for her
shot or Brittany.  
The other one we were supposed to execute a plan and it blew up. KK got it and
she obviously attacked and had an opportunity.  
  
Q. What kind of momentum does this build going into the NCAAs?  
COACH VERSYP: Great. When you can win three games in three days, you're just
exceptionally excited. We put this goal down to be Big Ten champs, whether
it's regular season or tournament champs, when we're in Europe sitting next to
some water and enjoying that trip.  
And I'm just so proud of this group. I just couldn't be more proud.  
And now they can just really flourish this and take it. Now we have the NCAA
hosting at home. So hopefully we'll get a good seed.  
  
Q. From the first time you played them, and they hit some threes late, did
you learn anything from that game or did you just play defense on the
perimeter in late ‑game situations better today?  
COACH VERSYP: We just played better defense in late‑game situations, because
we were switching, we played different defense than we did the first time.
They weren't knocking down 3s, and then Hooper nailed it, and Moore. It's like
here we go again.  
But our defense is the key, and I think Chelsea Jones with her height caused a
lot of problems. We were trying to get Hooper to put the ball on the floor and
try to get some charges.  
But I just thought we defended better. And then they started taking it to the
hole when we had the mismatch of Moore against Chelsea, and our help side
needed to come over.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Purdue  74  
Nebraska  70

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Nebraska head coach Connie Yori and
student‑athletes Lindsey Moore and Jordan Hooper.  
COACH YORI: Congratulations to Purdue. That was a hard‑fought game. And they
played a great tournament. And they deserve the crown. They played really
well. They rebounded the ball really well.  
I thought our kids fought really hard. I mean, I don't know what else we can
ask of our kids, in terms of our effort, you know, playing 50minutes after
already have played three games previously, I think it says a lot about our
kids' toughness. But Purdue was pretty tough, too.  
So credit to them. And congratulations to their program.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Lindsey, you played 50minutes. How exhausted are you? How hard was it to
keep coming?  
LINDSEY MOORE: It was hard. But, you know, we just wanted to finish this game
strong. And so it's not like we could really let up.  
I just had to keep telling myself that I'm not tired, and I have plenty of
time to rest.  
  
Q. Jordan, you feel like you were reliving a game about a month ago, West
Lafayette?  
JORDAN HOOPER: It felt a little similar. But I felt like we had this one, too.
But, yeah, I guess.  
  
Q. Lindsey, at the end of the one overtime, were you kind of trapped when
you flung the ball up?  
LINDSEY MOORE: I don't know what you're talking about. I don't really
remember. What overtime?  
  
Q. The end of the first overtime, you had the ball, then you got ‑‑ looked
like you got trapped in the corner and just kind of flung.   
LINDSEY MOORE: Did I make it?  
  
Q. Second overtime.  
  
Q. That was the last shot.  
LINDSEY MOORE: Oh, yeah.  
  
Q. You were trying to tie the game.  
COACH YORI: We should have called a timeout. There were two to threeseconds
left. I should have used a timeout. That's my mistake.  
  
Q. When you play a game like that, I know it's fresh right after the game is
over right now, but when you walk out of here, isn't there a sense of pride in
what you gave and what you did, because I think we'll probably know a lot more
about Nebraska, those that are here, and we'll remember this game longer than
probably a lot of other ones we've seen.  
LINDSEY MOORE: Absolutely. I think it says a lot about the type of team we
are, the fact that we can play four games in four days and go into double
overtime and still be right there. We had plays down the stretch where if we
had executed or done something differently, got stops on defense, the outcome
could be different for us.  
The fact we hung in there and being as young as we are, it says a lot about
who we are and the type of ball club we are.  
  
Q. Jordan, your thoughts?  
JORDAN HOOPER: I agree. There's a lot of pride that comes from this. And I'm
really proud of all this.  
  
Q. Lindsey, let's go back to the shot at the end of the first overtime.
There were three seconds left, right around there, after the shot. Did you
think there was less time on the clock?  
LINDSEY MOORE: No, I honestly should have taken it to the hoop with that much
time. I shouldn't have forced the shot.  
  
Q. Lindsey or Jordan, in the first half you guys were both driving to the
basket a lot. Got to the free ‑throw line a lot. Is that because their defense
loosened up a little bit when they got in foul trouble, a lot of their
players?  
LINDSEY MOORE: I think we were just being aggressive, honestly, is what we
were trying to do, just be aggressive, not settle for the outside shot. We
struggled a little bit shooting it from the arch, just getting in, creating
contact and trying to finish the old‑fashioned 3‑point play.  
  
Q. Jordan, are you tired? You're smiling.  
JORDAN HOOPER: I don't know. I mean, the first two games I didn't play as
much, so I guess I'm not tired in that aspect. But you're always tired after
an overtime game, for what that's worth.  
  
Q. Lindsey, do you guys feel comfortable when you're down by 11 there in the
first half as you've done it all week long?  
LINDSEY MOORE: I definitely think that we are. We're a type of team that we
seem to come back from those deficits.  
So we're just competitors, and we will keep fighting until we can get close
enough and either come back from behind or get it close enough down to the
stretch.  
  
Q. Lindsey and Jordan, when you guys see your teammates not hitting the
shots they have been this entire tournament, how much of, I guess, an
offensive load does that put on you guys?  
LINDSEY MOORE: You know, not really, because we were confident in each other.
So we know that they're going to get the next one. It's not like we're going
to stop passing to them. We're going to keep feeding them because we have
confidence in each other.  
So, if anything, that just means for us to be more aggressive and get to the
foul line.  
JORDAN HOOPER: I agree. It didn't take any confidence away from me seeing them
not go in or anything. I'm still going to give them the ball when they're
open. It doesn't put any more pressure on me at all.  
  
Q. Jordan, at the end of regulation, you got that block. If you commit a
foul there, they go to the line. Do you know how aggressive to be in a
situation like that?  
JORDAN HOOPER: I knew I wasn't going to hit her because she first went around
my body or whatever and then I went to the ball. I knew she wasn't going to go
to the foul line in that situation.  
  
Q. Was that kind of a swat, a spike?  
JORDAN HOOPER: It wasn't a spike, it was more of a swat, I guess.  
  
Q. What was going on that you were able to really stop their inside game
towards the end, when you're down by four at the end of regulation and then
come back?  
JORDAN HOOPER: I don't really know. I guess we just buckled down and we got
rebounds when it counted.  
  
Q. Lindsey and Jordan, what do you each think of when you walk out of
here?  
LINDSEY MOORE: Just how proud of my team that we are. We are young, and I
don't think anyone expected us to do what we did. And I think it says a lot
about the type of character we have on our team and we how love playing with
each other, and I think you can tell that out there.  
And we're very confident right now, and even though we lost, I still think our
confidence is right where it should be, hopefully leading into the NCAAs.  
JORDAN HOOPER: We have a lot of basketball left to play, and I'm happy moving
forward from this.  
  
Q. Lindsey, when you kind of smashed into the floor there, were you seeing
stars?  
LINDSEY MOORE: Yeah, those are always hard, especially when you're hounding to
get a drag screen, but I just have to be more aware as I'm guarding the girl
coming down the floor that those are going to be there. You just gotta get up
and get back into play.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Connie, you get Rayburn, 1 ‑and‑9\. Moses, 2‑of‑11\. Houser becomes a
little bit of an X factor for them. Is that just a byproduct of a lot of your
defense on those two, or did she create a lot of openings for herself?  
COACH YORI: She played well. And she did a lot of good things. Plus, she stole
the ball and she got some easy baskets in transition, she hit some shots.  
But I think overall I think the game was won and lost in the area of
rebounding. I think that's really what was the biggest factor in the game.
They scored a lot of points off of offensive rebounds, and we had a lot of
offensive rebounds we didn't score.  
But I thought KK played well. I thought Poston played well. They have a couple
physical kids that can post us that provide some matchup problems for us. And
we have Kaitlyn Burke who weighs about 115pounds trying to guard Poston, and
that's not a good matchup. They're smart enough to take advantage of it.
They're a well‑coached team.  
We definitely had some issues with some of their perimeter kids. But we did a
good job on Moses and Rayburn, but they've got good players, KK is a good
player, Poston is a good player, Howard is a good player. They've got good
players. They've got a lot of kids who can score the ball.  
One thing we don't have, we don't have many scorers as they have.  
  
Q. How difficult was it, then, to match Poston's athletic ability and her
desire to maybe get some of those?  
COACH YORI: We really don't have a matchup for her. And she's an issue. And
she can get it down low and she can‑‑ we're guarding her. If you look at‑‑
we're trying to put Hailie Sample, who is our bigger guard, on Rayburn. And
then if Poston's in, that means Kaitlyn Burke or Lindsey Moore have to guard
her. That's a bad matchup.  
Then we switch our matchups, Lindsey guarding Rayburn and put Hailey on
Poston, which helped us a little bit.  
So you just gotta do what you gotta do. But they definitely had some options
there that they could go to that they did a good job of going to.  
  
Q. Coach, after Lindsey's kind of desperation shot at the end of the second
overtime, what were you thinking about when you were staring off into space?  
COACH YORI: I was thinking of stupidity on my part. We should have called
timeout. We had maybe two seconds to get a shot. But I've also seen Lindsey
hit that shot, too. So it's not like I haven't seen her make miraculous shots.  
But, anyway, I should have called timeout.  
  
Q. Overall now you guys have played through a tie in two games after five
overtimes. Do you feel like these two teams are pretty well matched?  
COACH YORI: Yeah, I think that's a pretty good assessment of the situation.
Yep. You've got two teams that are two games and a lot of extra ball.  
  
Q. So you guaranteeing like a four overtime when Purdue visits Lincoln next
year?  
COACH YORI: I hope they visit Lincoln. I don't know. Seemed like we got
everybody on the road this year, top half of the league, if you noticed. The
new guys on the block.  
  
Q. You talked about the rebounding battle. Seemed like Emily did a pretty
good job of sneaking in there, getting some balls and forcing the steal in the
overtime. Can you talk about her impact even though she didn't score a lot?  
COACH YORI: Emily's a tough kid. She's built like an eighth grader yet she's a
kid that can rebound the ball, and she's really active. She's got long arms
and she's got great hands. She can go get the ball.  
But, overall, they're a more physical team than us. And pound for pound they
have an advantage on us. And we knew rebounding was going to be a huge key.
When it's all said and done, really that's the biggest factor in the game.  
  
Q. I know this is moments after this game, but now that you've been through
this Big Ten one season, just what comes to mind about the league, and maybe
what your program ‑‑ what step it has to take for year two in this league?  
COACH YORI: Well, first of all, I'm really proud of our kids because I'm
pretty certain if they would have picked 1 through 12, you know, if they had a
preseason poll to pick 1 through 12, we probably would have been picked 10,
11, or 12.  
And so for us to be in the championship game, to go into overtime, I think
that says a lot about the character of our kids and the toughness that we
have.  
We gotta get stronger. That's one of the things that we gotta do. We gotta get
in the weight room. But we're young. When I watch other teams in warm‑ups, I'm
like, whoa, they're physically stronger than we are.  
So that doesn't mean we can't‑‑ but that's also part of the youth. When you're
not very old you haven't been in the weight room so much. Those are areas we
can improve.  
  
Q. Talk about ‑‑ you say how young you guys are. Talk about the leadership
of Burke, of Hooper and Moore throughout this tournament today.   
COACH YORI: Well, Kaitlyn's a great leader. She is as good a leader as we have
in terms of her understanding of her role and understanding of others' roles
and buying into our system, and she is a great behind‑the‑scenes leader for
us.  
And Lindsey does a really good job of leading by example. That's the kind of
leader Lindsey is. She's going to go out and give everything she's got. And
she's got phenomenal toughness.  
And Jordan's a worker. We've got kids, our best players are hard workers.
Anytime you have that, I think there's a lot of positives ahead for us.  
  
Q. I know it's fast after a tough loss, but what case would you make to the
NCAA Selection Committee and where do you think the Huskers should be
placed?  
COACH YORI: I don't know. I mean, I don't think I need to make a case. I think
our resumé speaks for itself. We've won a lot of games, a lot of games on the
road.  
So we'll see what happens.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Purdue  68  
Penn State  66

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Purdue head coach Sharon Versyp as well as
student‑athletes Brittany Rayburn and Courtney Moses.  
Coach, an opening statement.  
COACH VERSYP: I just thought it was amazing basketball game. Both teams had
the will to win. Knew it was going to be tough on the boards and a very
physical game.  
And envisioned it would come down, since it continued to stay close, down to
the last possession. And, you know, we executed exceptionally well. We were
able to finish at the end. And obviously we're very excited where we're at
right now.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Brittany, can you just talk about the last possession and sort of the
progress that the ball took in getting to you and what you saw on your way to
the basket?  
BRITTANY RAYBURN: Yeah, I think, first of all, we executed it perfectly. I
think Coach drew up a perfect play for us.  
It was a play that had been working all second half. And we just kept going
back to it. And Chantel made a great pass, and the rest is history.  
  
Q. I think you went up over Greene. Is that right?  
BRITTANY RAYBURN: Sure, I don't know.  
  
Q. She obviously has some height advantage. Did you have to adjust at all or
did you feel you just went straight up strong?  
BRITTANY RAYBURN: I knew that the refs aren't going to decide the game at the
end of the game. It's right not to do that. I knew that regardless of who was
there, I had to finish. I knew I had to get to the basket. And also for an
outside shot.  
Regardless of who was there, I had to get to the basket.  
  
Q. Brittany, how much of this was about when you were on the bench and had
to watch your team and still maintain a lead and kept enthusiasm, still seemed
pretty fired up in the first half?  
BRITTANY RAYBURN: Yeah. We had a great all‑around effort by everybody. This
young lady kept us in there with a great percentage from the floor. She's
shooting well and everybody's setting great screens. And Antionette Howard
coming in with 18 boards, that's awesome. I think we had an all‑around great
performance from everybody tonight.  
  
Q. Brittany, you've had some opportunities, Michigan game there, I guess,
whatever game it was, Michigan State, did you learn anything from that today
about trying to take it hard on the layup like that?  
BRITTANY RAYBURN: Yeah, I think we've had a lot of close games where we didn't
finish, a lot of overtime games. We didn't want it to go into overtime,
obviously, because we wanted to be able to play another game and have fresh
legs.  
And I think we all decided in that timeout this is ours, and we just came
together as a team and said we're going to get it.  
  
Q. Courtney, take us through your vantage point of how everything unfolded
on that last play.  
COURTNEY MOSES: Like she said, we ran it perfectly. Coach set up the perfect
play. It had been working all game. Chantel made a great pass, Brittany just
read it, went baseline. She had Maggie Lucas on one side and Nikki Greene on
the other, and she just went up over right off the glass, and there was like
one second left, but we played good defense and won the game.  
  
Q. Courtney, I think Penn State led for maybe five seconds throughout the
game. You hit a lot of 3s. Every time they seemed to have momentum, you seemed
to answer with big shots of your own. Where did that mental toughness come
from and how did you progress off the season to develop it?  
COURTNEY MOSES I say mental toughness comes from being in the gym, and not
only from being in the gym, but it comes from the people you surround yourself
with, my teammates and coaches. Once you have all the confidence in the world
from them coming to you, then the rest is history.  
  
Q. We think of Purdue and how much success the program has had in this
building. But the thought registers that this class hasn't won this title yet,
right? Tell me, each of you, what this win would mean tomorrow.  
BRITTANY RAYBURN: As a senior this is your goal when you come in as a
freshman, win Big Ten titles.  
We've had a lot of fun with this group. This is a great young group of women.
We've been through a lot of things in our time here. People that are here,
we've went through near‑death circumstances and we've pulled together as a
group.  
And I think it's something that we've worked extremely hard for, and it would
be a great win in our season going into the NCAA.  
COURTNEY MOSES: Just speaking from what Brit said, we have six seniors, and
being on behalf of the underclassmen, we're playing for our seniors.  
  
Q. Brittany, could you talk about the job that the bench did there when you
and Sam O. were on the bench with two fouls in the first half, in particular
Antionette Howard seemed to really rise up today?  
BRITTANY RAYBURN: Like I said earlier, everybody played extremely well today.
Bench, starters, everybody that went in the game did their job and they did it
great.  
That's the big key to the team: We have a big bench because everyone that goes
in works as hard as they can and gets their job done. Antionette did a great
job today hitting the boards and scoring buckets for us.  
  
Q. You've avenged losses to Michigan State and now Penn State, and you'll
have to do it tomorrow against Nebraska. What did you learn from those games
and what did you maybe change between the times you played Michigan State and
Penn State the first time and then now?  
BRITTANY RAYBURN: A lot of the same things. We played every team extremely
hard and to the end, and our coaching staff has put up great game plans for
us. And I think right now we're executing it to a T. We have to continue to do
that.  
  
Q. Your thoughts on playing Nebraska tomorrow? I know the first game was a
thriller. You came out on the wrong end?  
BRITTANY RAYBURN: I just say we're excited. It's exciting to let this victory
settle in. We're going to get rest tonight and hit it hard again in the
morning and get a good scout in.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Did you feel like you made Maggie Lucas uncomfortable tonight maybe not
getting in the spots she wanted to get into?  
COACH VERSYP: I feel we did. You know, anytime you play a team, you have to
make adjustments. And I thought we did a good job on her, kind of just chasing
her, face guarding her everywhere.  
I thought KK did an exceptional job early on, her quickness. Then Dee Dee and
Chantel, those two are constantly rotating off on her.  
I think we disrupted her. Then at the end of the game, probably the last
minute 30, we just were switching off screens, so it was just a totally
different look, bigger person on her, making her do something that she didn't
feel comfortable with.  
  
Q. Softball question, but I'll throw two at you at once. Coaches love to
talk about team basketball and how much all different facets come together,
but talk about the stretch in the first half with Rayburn on the bench and you
guys maintain a lead. And then, secondly, I'm wondering what you or your
program think about this place, because you always seem to do well here.  
COACH VERSYP: I think for us, the entire year iswe're not about one player;
we're about a team. And every player on this team has stepped up and done some
great things. When people have been sitting, people have been injured. So
we've always had someone else that might have been a leading scorer. So I
think it's hard to defend sometimes and other people will step up.  
As for playing here, you know, this Fieldhouse has been amazing to us. I think
our last memory of this was last year, though, when Drey almost died and we
were here playing Auburn. It was a celebration of life. That's what we're
bringing into the tournament today.  
We had success before. But that was more important than any basketball game,
and I think we're thriving off of that right now.  
  
Q. In the last minute things weren't necessarily going your way there with
several things. Just what was your message there with 16seconds to go, and
then what did you set up and what did you see?  
COACH VERSYP: We knew they were going to make a free throw. They were ahead by
two. Got the ball, supposed to get the ball in by Courtney the first time and
kind of dribbled off her leg, and she's very frustrated and, yeah, they
scored. But bringing it up, we knew exactly what play we were going to run.  
It's been working. We called a specific set. But I think we took care of the
basketball exceptionally well. Made very good passes. Lucas tried to deny
Brittany. And just like take it to the hole. She was going to have a shot,
curl or try to get to the basket.  
And she just read it very well. And it got overplayed. So Brittany finished.  
  
Q. If you can set Brittany's plays aside, what does it mean to have someone
like her in your program, the kind of captain she is, the leader, the person
who does everything right, the foundation?  
COACH VERSYP: Yeah, I mean, Brittany's a leader on and off the court. She's a
great human being. She gives back to the community.  
She's an amazing student. Going to be in vet school. And she's an incredible
basketball student. And she really makes everybody around her better. She
brings a calm and a confidence when she's out on the court. We're just totally
different. And she's obviously had a lot of accolades, but she's going to give
credit to everybody else.  
So she's very special to our program.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about the job Howard did? And also you had a 54 ‑33
rebounding advantage. What did that mean for you in terms of getting this
win?  
COACH VERSYP: We said we had to do a great job of boxing them out, limit their
offensive goals. So holding them to 12 was a big feat for us, because we
didn't do that that well yesterday. So we were really focused on that.
Antionette brought so much energy. And I thought that was good.  
She didn't play as many minutes yesterday. So she had great legs today,
playing 27. Being able to rebound. Being able to score. But I think her
offensive boards was obviously the big difference.  
But it was everybody. For us to beat them on the boards by that amount, we
said that was the key to the game.  
  
Q. Coach, I don't know if you've seen much of Nebraska's run recently, but
how tough do you think tomorrow's final will be?  
COACH VERSYP: When you get to the final, it will be tough. Doesn't matter who
you're playing right now. Nebraska had a month like we did in February. They
went on a losing streak and so did we, and now we turn it around at the right
time.  
They're playing really good basketball, and so are we. And I think the depth's
going to come in. But they're a great basketball team. They've been a great
addition to the Big Ten. No matter who gets to the final game, both teams are
very solid.  
  
Q. Huskers have gone on runs of 41 ‑10, 40‑16, and 40‑10 the past three
games. What do you think the key will be for Purdue to stop them going on a
run like that?  
COACH VERSYP: The biggest thing is just playing good solid defense, matching
their intensity. They're a great offensive team and obviously defensive team
as well.  
They gave us everything, and we played an exceptional game, the three
overtime, so just go back to the basics of playing some defense.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Nebraska  77  
Ohio State  62

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Ohio State head coach Jim Foster, as well as
student‑athletes Tayler Hill and Samantha Prahalis.  
COACH FOSTER: I congratulate Nebraska. I thought they played very well. I
thought they handled the beginning of the game, kept their heads about them
and kept plodding away. Executed the way they needed to execute. I think they
played a terrific game.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Sam, you guys started out like on fire. But you were up 24 ‑11, then the
wheels came off. In your mind what happened in that period of time?  
SAMANTHA PRAHALIS: Well, we fouled and then they just hit shots. Like they're
hot. Weren't guarding them very well. And they got hot, and they were hitting
everything.  
  
Q. Tayler, did anything change for you guys defensively in that time, in
that period of time, the last five and a half minutes of the first half?  
TAYLER HILL: What do you mean did anything change?  
  
Q. Defensively they were popping up a little bit better, weren't they, or
were they running their offense better, I guess?  
TAYLER HILL: No. We were just missing defensive assignments.  
  
Q. Sam, this is the first loss for anyone on the team in the Big Ten. Is
this a particularly tough one to swallow?  
SAMANTHA PRAHALIS: Yes.  
  
Q. Tayler, what are you thinking I guess in terms of the next thing in line
is the NCAA tournament. How do you recover from what just happened?  
TAYLER HILL: As a team, starting with myself as one of the leaders on the
team, we have to get back to where we were at the beginning of the season. We
played together as a team. We reversed the ball. It's not like that now. We
need to figure out a way to get it back there.  
  
Q. You haven't shot well for a while. What's been going on there, Sammy?  
SAMANTHA PRAHALIS: We're not getting good shots. So we're trying to make hard
shots, cuz, I don't know, you just gotta get back on track.  
  
Q. Tayler, were you at all surprised that somebody can meet your pace the
way Nebraska met your pace and basically pull away from you?  
TAYLER HILL: I don't really think it's about meeting the pace. I just think we
need to make better decisions, starting with myself in the back court. Make
sure transition to defense. I think that hurt us tonight. Then our offense, we
were transitioning on defense, rushing on defense, and just rushing on
offense.  
How we played; it's not how Nebraska played, really.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Again, you guys came out with a lot of energy, and you were messing them
up and you could have been maybe a little more ahead than you were because the
shots weren't falling early. Was there anything significant that changed in
the last five minutes of that half to open things up?  
COACH FOSTER: Two things. First of all, you can say the shots weren't falling.
I would question the quality of the shots, okay.  
I think we played at a very hectic pace. Defensively, I thought we were
engaged and aggressive in making a lot of good decisions.  
The two things that I think happened where I think we committed three very bad
fouls, and they now are going to the foul line. When they are struggling to
score points. I think it could have been extended by not losing our
discipline. I think we lost our discipline.  
When you're that energetic, you've got to be disciplined. You've got to be in
the right place at the right time. And then I think when we started to commit
the fouls, I think we backed off our pressure. And they could run their
offense much more efficiently, because the pressure that was causing them a
lot of problems early was not as significant.  
And a couple of them were young fouls, young players. And a couple of them
were veterans that should know better.  
But you have to play with your head. You can never lose your head. And I don't
think we had it today, had a head. I think we just played at a frantic pace.  
We had energy. We had energy. But not the kind of energy that leads to good
offensive play.  
  
Q. How much of that hectic play is a credit to the Nebraska defense?  
COACH FOSTER: I would credit their defense if I thought it was their defense.
I think we rushed and took low percentage/high difficulty kind of shots. With
a lot of patience, one of the strengths of this team is the patience on
offense. And we didn't play with that.  
And when you hurry like that against a team that's as potent as they are, it
causes you problems. There's nothing they were doing to make us play fast. We
were just playing fast.  
  
Q. How do you get refocused now in the next couple of weeks?  
COACH FOSTER: I think that's kind of easy. You've got time to take a few days
off and we will show them a lot of film when we were playing very well and
what we were doing, what made us a good basketball team at that point. You
have time to take a deep breath right now and to refocus.  
And you get out of league play. You get out of the same officials, the same
sites. The same venues. It's sort of an opportunity to go out there and
challenge yourself with another venue.  
  
Q. Coach always said basically that she thought you were trying to take
three people away from them, and that's why Burke ‑‑ I mean, Burke kind of
stepped up.   
COACH FOSTER: I think she played a very good game. She played like a senior
who wanted‑‑ played with a lot of poise. And I think her poise and her
decision‑making helped them a lot.  
And I thought we were doing a very good job on those three players. But to her
credit she stepped up.  
  
Q. You've lost like three of the last ‑‑ I don't know, lost a few now. Have
you thought at all about the NCAA seeding and where you might have dropped
to?  
COACH FOSTER: No. Just thinking 1985 and Villanova's men basketball team
finishes the season 17‑10 and didn't think were going to get into the
tournament and figured out a way to win six games in a row.  
You just get ready for what's next. You don't labor and spend time in negative
areas. You figure it out and you challenge young people to figure it out.
We'll provide a lot of information that will help them engage.  
  
Q. Did you like ‑‑ Raven was kind of a bright spot there, especially in the
second half.   
COACH FOSTER: I liked Raven the last three weeks. I think a light bulb went
on. She's practiced better. She's become more focused, more disciplined, the
things that take a while to understand coming out of high school and coming
out of a league where you're looking Columbus Dispatch sometimes and you see
like 108‑12 scores. If that's the league you're playing in, learning how to
play serious basketball and play every possession like it matters, it's not
something you snap your fingers and do.  
So for her to figure that out in her freshman year I think bodes well for her
basketball future.  
  
Q. Do you feel like through the course of the season a lot of your role
players are pretty young? Do you feel like there's been some ups and downs
with her included?  
COACH FOSTER: Are you asking me if young people have ups and downs? Yes, we
were no different than most. And you learn from that. I'll give Beach some
credit in that she has learned to sustain energy for longer periods of time.
Starting to do some things she couldn't do a month ago. So I think those young
people are learning and understanding what their job is.  
  
Q. The technical foul in the first half, what happened and how much did that
hurt?  
COACH FOSTER: Well, I think Sammy, on a possession, was hit in the face. And
she got angry. There's no call. And I'm sure she said something she shouldn't
have. I don't know what she said. But it was in anger‑‑ we were running a
play, and she threw the ball inexplicitly to Ashley when she was supposed to
dribble off her and make a play.  
I asked her why, and she said: I got hit in the face. And I think that was
shortly before the technical. That's all I could‑‑ I'll see if there's more to
it when I'm looking at the film.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Nebraska  77  
Ohio State  62

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Nebraska head coach Connie Yori as well as
student‑athletes Kaitlyn Burke and Jordan Hooper. Coach, an opening statement.  
COACH YORI: We're excited about tomorrow and having an opportunity to win a
conference championship, and particularly because this is our first year in
the Big Ten.  
I think it magnifies that. And our kids were really tough today. And we have‑‑
I think we're a very well‑conditioned team and I've said that all year. And I
think mentally we have a pretty good toughness about us.  
But we've been a team that's gotten down numerous times this year and has made
comebacks. So getting down early in the game I don't think scared us, and
we've been there. And our kids stayed composed and stayed poised. Credit to
them.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Ohio State is a lot bigger team than you guys, yet you guys outrebounded
them by seven in the game. Including 20 offensive rebounds. Talk about your
guys' grit in the paint today?  
JORDAN HOOPER: That was one of our focus to outrebound them. To make energy,
get energy for our team. Offensive rebounds so we focused on that, that was
one of our keys to the game.  
  
Q. For Kaitlyn: Explain yourself.  
KAITLYN BURKE: Well, I give a lot of credit to all my teammates. They set
screens to get me open, which allowed open shots. And there was a lot of
people‑‑ they were guarding Jordan and Lindsey and Emily really hard. And that
allowed some openings for me, and I was able to get open shots and open looks.  
  
Q. Jordan, I think I had you charted for 2 for 21 to start the game, and
then in back ‑to‑back possessions Kaitlyn hit two short jumpers, and I think
you might have hit a 3. How big was it that she did that for you guys?  
JORDAN HOOPER: It was game‑changing. Her hitting those points gave us all
confidence. And we just talked in the huddles every time. She's like our shots
will go in. Hers went in, so that gave us confidence. So it was huge.  
  
Q. You really kind of got mine, but you seem to be standing around maybe a
little bit star ‑struck the first couple of minutes. Was it just kind of a new
environment, you were pushed out on the perimeter and not doing a whole lot?  
JORDAN HOOPER: Yeah, I don't know if I was star‑struck I guess. Maybe I just
wasn't being as aggressive as I usually was. But I guess as the game wore on I
got a little more‑‑ yeah, we probably just weren't being as aggressive as we
should have been. We were kind of maybe in a daze from yesterday a little bit.
But we snapped out of that and came back.  
  
Q. Kaitlyn, they came out really, really fast, really, really pushing,
really, really pushing, and basically I guess you like to play that way. So
when you guys got into it, I guess, you showed them you could more than
answer, right?  
KAITLYN BURKE: Yeah, they're a team that likes to push the ball and so are we.
We had to make sure we got back on defense and stopped their transition, and
we just wanted to push the ball ourselves on offense.  
  
Q. Kaitlyn, what did Brandi Jeffery do for you guys in the first half, kind
of rally?  
KAITLYN BURKE: Brandi played awesome tonight. She's such a spark player for
us, she was pressuring the ball really hard. Hit open shots, too. So she was
attacking on offense as well as defense, and she played so awesome tonight and
we're just really proud of her.  
That's the thing about us, we're an entire team, and everyone comes in and
contributes in different ways, and she really gave us that spark offensively
and defensively.  
  
Q. Kaitlyn, how special is it to walk off the court at the end of the game
and see Lane (phonetic) and Harleen and be able to give them a memory like
this even though their careers came up short due to injuries?  
KAITLYN BURKE: They're the seniors on our team. We're all playing for them,
too, as well. And, like I said earlier, we're just a team and we want to play
for each other and also play for the University of Nebraska.  
  
Q. Kaitlyn, Jordan kind of talked about the rebounding, but you and Lindsay
were really having to post up against much larger opponents there in the first
half. Talk about that. And then you guys being able to shoot from the outside,
how much did that help pull them way from the paint?  
KAITLYN BURKE: They're a bigger team. We had to box out. We weren't doing that
early on. Coach reminded us: Hey, we've got to box them out.  
So I think that was big for us as well.  
  
Q. Jordan, your first season, it ends 13 ‑18, tough loss to Iowa State in
the Big 12, and now you're 24‑7 playing for the Big Ten Championship tomorrow.
How does it feel?  
JORDAN HOOPER: It feels really great to be on this team. I almost said it, but
I didn't. But it feels awesome to be a part of this. And just making history,
I guess.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you so much. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, Emily had gotten 24 against them the last two times. Were you
expecting them to shut her down and then open up?  
COACH YORI: Yeah, they guarded us differently. They matched differently. The
first two times we played them they put a big kid on Emily, exclusively. And
she had a matchup advantage.  
This time they mixed different kids on her and she didn't have as much of an
advantage. But what they did essentially they guarded three of our players.  
And they chose to guard Lindsey hard and Jordan and Emily hard. And that
enabled other kids to have looks. That's why Kaitlyn had the game she had. And
somebody had to step up and make shots.  
And they were really focused on three kids. And they wanted to take those
three kids away. And we feel like Hailie did some good things and Brandi came
in and gave us good minutes. And kind of got us going in the first half.  
And then Kaitlyn had the big game. So somebody had to do something for us to
win, other than those three that they focused on.  
  
Q. Before the tournament, you guys struggled shooting from the field for a
while. Were you worried at the beginning of the game when you were 2 for 21 or
whatever it was?  
COACH YORI: Well, that's been the nature of our season. I mean, when we shoot
it well enough, we're good enough defensively. We feel like we can compete at
a fairly high level.  
And our struggles have primarily been on the offensive end this year, during
the stretch where we didn't win we couldn't get to 50 hardly because we did
not shoot the ball well.  
And we were in an offensive slump. And we have played better offensively here
lately, and I think that we're sound enough defensively that we‑‑ not to say
we're going to stop on every possession, but we work hard enough defensively
that if we play well enough on offense to make some shots, I think we're a
tough out in some ways.  
  
Q. How much fun, how exciting is it to coach so much good young talent, and
is there a poise to it although they're young?  
COACH YORI: Yeah, it's been really kind of an amazing year. Going into the
year, you know, we thought maybe we would have Harleen Sidhu, one of our
seniors, and now she's not really played for us all year. And Adrianna Maurer,
a kid we counted on playing the post for us, has been hurt most of the season.
And she was experienced, she was a sophomore, but we knew we were really,
really young. And our kids have grown up a lot. They've learned a lot.  
We went on a foreign trip in August, primarily because we wanted to gain some
experience for those kids and get some practice time and get an opportunity to
teach them the things we want to teach them.  
So we have made great strides. And those guys have‑‑ our young kids have made
great strides.  
So we have a bright future. And we're probably overexceeding I think the
expectation this year, but I think our kids have a lot of toughness. And we
are probably more of a mentally tough team than I would have expected for such
a young team.  
  
Q. At the highest level that this team can play, where does that relate to
all the other teams you've coached?  
COACH YORI: Well, we were pretty good two years ago. That's the best team I've
coached. We were the No.1 seed in the NCAA tournament. And we were a veteran
team. And we were really good at every position. So that's the best team I've
ever coached.  
We had‑‑ I don't remember what year it was‑‑ I can't remember, Kelsey
Griffin's sophomore year, I think. And we had a really good team that year,
too. And so, I mean, this is probably comparable to that team. And so this is
one of the best teams I've coached, but had other good teams as well, but it's
definitely not the best team I've coached.  
  
Q. No matter who you play tomorrow, what's the condition of your team do you
think?  
COACH YORI: Well, every day we wake up in the morning in this tournament and
we're like, okay, who can walk today.  
And Emily Cady is playing with a torn cartilage in her knee. I don't know how
much tougher she can get. And she's trying to play through it. This morning
she woke up, and she couldn't move her leg. She got it worked on by the
training staff, and she was able to go. I don't know how many minutes she
played; sure seemed like a lot.  
We are not the healthiest team, but there are a lot of teams not healthy at
this stage. But it is hard to play four games in four days, and particularly
because we play full‑court defense.  
If we were a zone team, a team that didn't put as much effort into the
defensive end, it might be easier. We're not going to change things now,
unless we want to put a 2‑3 zone in in the hotel tonight. Probably won't do
that.  
  
Q. What did you do defensively against Prahalis when she was driving every
Ohio State possession?  
COACH YORI: They're a ball screen team. You have to defend their ball screens.
We tried to mix up what we did. They took advantage of our switches early in
the game and that's where they got their low block touches. As the game got
on, we switched our defense. And it's a little bit more of a containment.  
And I thought‑‑ I mean, she's just really good. She's going to get the ball in
transition. And she's so fast and she's so good with the ball. I mean, you can
swarm four people around her and that doesn't mean you're going to stop her.  
So you gotta get there and hopefully get in front of her a little bit and do
the best you can, hope she missed.  
  
Q. You guys closed out the first half on a big run, but just how important
was it to open up the second half with another big run? You guys went on a 12
‑2 run I believe to open up the second half.   
COACH YORI: Well, you want to play well coming out of halftime. And we did
that. So nothing magical about that. Just our kids were focused and they came
out ready and we hit some shots.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Purdue  68  
Penn State  66

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Penn State head coach Coquese Washington and
student‑athletes Alex Bentley and Mia Nickson. We'll start right off the bat
with questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Mia, could you just talk a little bit about the rebounding battle
tonight. You had 13 rebounds to lead the team, but overall the team struggled
in that aspect. Could you talk about that a little bit?  
MIA NICKSON: I mean, they just‑‑ they had all five people on the glass. And so
it was difficult at times to get your hands on it.  
They really keyed in on getting on the boards. And they did a great job of
that tonight.  
  
Q. Alex, I imagine you had some people here tonight. I just wonder how tough
this is for you. I'm sure you would have liked to have won at your hometown?  
ALEX BENTLEY: Yeah, I mean we're not happy. It's really a tough loss. It hurts
really bad. It's not the way, you know, we wanted it to end up. But just gotta
keep our heads up, because we have more basketball to play.  
  
Q. Alex, just looking at the box score, you guys did a pretty good job of
keeping the ball ‑‑ only eight turnovers. Despite how they were able to really
play defense and shut down Maggie, can you talk about how you guys were really
able to handle and go up and down the floor?  
ALEX BENTLEY: I think my teammates are great at ball pressure. We stuck to the
game plan. We moved the ball well. And that's pretty much it.  
  
Q. Alex, when you fouled out with about a minute left, I saw you huddle up
your teammates on the court and they came back from five points down to tie it
up. What did you say to them in the huddle?  
ALEX BENTLEY: I told them they got it. I believed in them 100percent. I knew
that my teammates were going to pull out something crazy. And I knew‑‑ and I
believed we were still going to win it.  
And I just told them to go out and do it.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about the job that Purdue did defensively, particularly
on Maggie?  
COACH WASHINGTON: I thought they did a pretty good job all night long. They're
a good team, defensive team. It was a struggle. I mean, I think both of us are
pretty good defensive teams.  
And that's why it was a struggle all night long for either team, I felt, to
get into a rhythm. So they did a good job.  
  
Q. I just spoke to Alex briefly in the locker room. She seemed trying to
stay optimistic despite this loss. Can you talk a little bit about her
leadership tonight and how she played on the court?  
COACH WASHINGTON: Well, she's a tremendous competitor. And you could‑‑ it's
evident by her play that she's the leader of this team. And she willed us to
stay in the game when we really couldn't get into an offensive flow, rhythm.
She made some big baskets.  
And so I mean, the team kind of feeds off that. And I think her competitive
fire and her will to win is one of the things that we key on and count on.  
  
Q. When we see rebounding differentials like this, when you guys beat Ohio
State, you did it pretty handily. Despite being down 22, you guys only lost by
two. Can you talk about their will to stay in it and keep fighting, working
getting the boards?  
COACH WASHINGTON: Purdue did a great job rebounding, obviously, but I thought
we did a pretty good job defensively. We pressured them into some turnovers,
turning those turnovers in the points.  
We just didn't do that quite enough. But obviously if you give up 22 rebounds
and 19 offensive rebounds, it's going to be tough for you to win the game.  
So we gotta‑‑ moving forward, we've got to get better at the rebounding.  
  
Q. What were you trying to do on that last play defensively to try and get
that stop?  
COACH WASHINGTON: Well, I thought we did a good job defensively. And I just
think Brittany Rayburn made a better shot. Sometimes that happens. She drove
it right into Nikki Greene. I think Nikki might have even tipped it a little
bit. And she got it up high and it went in.  
So we defended it as well as you could defend it without fouling. And she made
a great shop.  
  
Q. No. 2, Antionette Howard, I think only played ten minutes in West
Lafayette, didn't really do a whole lot. But today she goes for a double
‑double. What did you see out of her maybe that was a little bit unexpected?  
COACH WASHINGTON: Nothing unexpected. She just‑‑ she played like a senior. And
I think her energy on the boards really gave them a lift especially the first
half. She got a lot of offensive rebounds. And she was tough on the boards and
given second chances, and I think that really galvanized them and gave them
some confidence.  
  
Q. Really close game like this, how did you miss the presence of Ariel
Edwards tonight?  
COACH WASHINGTON: We missed her. We missed her big. I think she could have
helped on the rebounding, for sure. Gave us a little bit more size. She
probably would have been guarding Rayburn, that last play. So maybe with a
little bit more size maybe she doesn't have quite the angle to make it.  
But hopefully we'll have her back for the NCAA tournament.  
  
Q. Nikki, second game where she hasn't been, she hasn't scored in the first
half. Any concerns looking ahead at the NCAA getting her going earlier than
halftime?  
COACH WASHINGTON: She had great shots. She just didn't put them down. So I'm
not worried about that. She'll make them.  
You can't worry about offense. I mean, I'd be worried if she wasn't getting
touches. I'd be worried if she wasn't getting the ball in spots where she
could do something positive with it. But she's getting great looks. And the
last two games in the first half they rolled in and out, just came off her
hand a little short, a little long, a little left. She'll be fine.  
  
Q. How long do you think it will take for the team to shake off a buzzer
beater like this in the Big Ten tournament and look totally ahead towards
NCAAs?  
COACH WASHINGTON: Hopefully they'll shake it off pretty quickly. Fortunately
for us we're at spring break so they've got a few days to go home and get some
home cooking and TLC and get revved up for the NCAA tournament.  
But we talked in the locker room. I'm not disappointed in the way we played. I
wish we would have won the game, but, I mean, this is what happens when you're
in competitive sports.  
Sometimes you play as hard as you can, you do everything you can, and you
lose. And that doesn't mean you're a loser. And that doesn't mean you need to
hang your head. We played a very good game, especially the second half. Purdue
played a great game and they made the last play. They made the last play, and
there's no more time left for us to make a play.  
And I just take my hat off to Purdue. They played a great game. And I'm really
proud of our team. And we're going to go in the NCAA tournament and we're
going to be confident and we're going to be a tough team to play, and our kids
are going to go home and get rested up and get rejuvenated, and we're going to
get ready to go and play in the NCAA tournament and play our best basketball.  
  
Q. Talk about the last play. Just your thoughts going into it, going for the
quick 2 when you guys could have held for the potential last shot of the game.
Just your thoughts on that offensive series.  
COACH WASHINGTON: I wanted to put the pressure on them to make a play. And
they did. And they did. But our thought was we're going to go for the tie, and
we're going to try to tie it up and see if we can get one stop.  
And unfortunately we didn't. But I like the way we executed on the last play.
And it turned out the way it turned out.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Purdue  73  
Michigan State  64

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Purdue head coach Sharon Versyp and
student‑athletes Brittany Rayburn and Chantel Poston.  
Coach, an opening statement.  
COACH VERSYP: We were just excited to get on the basketball court. It was a
long time. We were the last game. And we knew we'd get out and have a little
bit of jitters. And I think we did.  
But we got over it. And I thought that we played exceptionally hard. We played
very well. I thought our defense was very good in the second half, holding
them to 34percent.  
But Michigan State is an extremely tough team. Probably will go and do some
great things in the NCAA tournament, and we have a lot of respect for them.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Chantel, how much did this performance from Brittany remind you of one
that you had seen earlier this season?  
CHANTEL POSTON: Brittany's a special player. And she kind of got down, but we
always‑‑ mid‑seasonkind of going through some things, and we just always tell
her to keep shooting, the next one, the next one, the next one.  
She's that type of player that's willing to do anything for her team, take a
charge, knock down a shot. She's a gamer. She's a gamer. Gotta love it.  
  
Q. Brittany, since we're older and out of touch, is that called feeling it
or what do you call that?  
BRITTANY RAYBURN: Yes. I would say something like that. It's called great
trains and passes from your teammates. It's easy to knock down open shots when
your teammates are getting you open.  
  
Q. Could you describe what it's like during that whole process for you?  
BRITTANY RAYBURN: You know, honestly it's a rhythm that you get in with the
team. And taking charge is the same way, getting rebounds the same way.
Anything you have to do to get your team to victory is what you're going to
do. And I think the biggest thing is going out and having fun.  
  
Q. How disheartening do you think it is for an opponent when you've got
someone that just is draining everything, especially from the outside?  
CHANTEL POSTON: I know how disheartening it is for us to be on the opposite
side, it's very draining, very draining.  
BRITTANY RAYBURN: I'd say the same thing. It's hard to do when people are‑‑
you can't get around anything and the shot just keeps going in. And they're
playing great defense at times, and it's just‑‑ like you said, it's a rhythm.  
  
Q. Brittany, was this a little bit of a flashback to Minnesota?  
BRITTANY RAYBURN: I mean, I don't know. I can't compare it to that game. I
mean, it was mid‑season, completely different thing, playing in Big Ten
Tournament is huge. Any game you can lose, you're done, and I think the
biggest thing was just the will to win tonight.  
  
Q. Obviously you did great things in the first 24 to 30minutes, but can you
talk about Chantel's two 3 ‑point plays there when you guys needed to get over
that hump a little bit and how big those plays were?  
BRITTANY RAYBURN: It's huge. Especially coming off boards for her. I mean,
she's doing a great job on the offensive boards and defensive boards and
getting them at big times for us. We knew she'd be able to power it in down
low because she's got the ridiculous ups, but to be able to finish through
contact is something that she's really done well this season, and it really
gave our team a good boost.  
  
Q. Chantel, can you talk about it was a very physical game, seemed like you
guys got a lot of the 50/50 balls, a lot of the offensive rebounds. Could you
talk about what that did for your team when the offense was a little stagnant
in the second half?  
CHANTEL POSTON: Anytime you struggle in offense you need the 50/50 balls, and
it's something that coach stresses all the time. She drills it in practice and
constantly telling us we have to get those hustle points. We have to get those
50/50 balls because it can make a difference in whether you win or whether you
lose.  
  
Q. Brittany, did you block out it could have been your last game on Hoosier
soil as far as college game? Do you block that stuff out about the finality of
it being a senior, or do you think about that?  
BRITTANY RAYBURN: You do and you don't. Going into the game, you know, that's
definitely the thing. But like I said, just going into a game like this, you
will just have to have the will to win and play to win and not to lose. And I
think our team did a great job tonight showing maturity, just fought through
everything tonight. And definitely it comes to your mind at the beginning, but
when you're in the heat of the moment you just want to win.  
  
Q. If you could both talk about the matchup tomorrow, and just what you
expect, only played them once, so not as much familiarity, but just what
you're expecting?  
BRITTANY RAYBURN: I think as familiarity goes, we've played them recently,
which is a good thing. Especially since you don't have a whole week to prepare
or anything like that. So it's good to know scouting report quickly.  
Our coaches will get us prepared very quickly tonight, or tomorrow morning,
actually, because it's already tomorrow. But they'll get us prepared.  
CHANTEL POSTON: At this point in the season like Brittany said, it's about the
will to win. Doing the little things. Obviously we're going to go over
personnel and go over the scouting report and the coaches will have us well
prepared. But at this point it's just playing hard, having heart and having
fun, I think, is huge.  
  
Q. What do you think is the biggest difference between the last time you
guys played Michigan State losing by 15 and today with how well you were able
to play from start to finish?  
BRITTANY RAYBURN: I think losing in overtime at their place was a heartbreaker
for us. The toughest game to lose is the one that's close that you have in
your grasp. I think it definitely was still with us, a reminder the last time
we played them we didn't come out on top. And I think that's definitely a huge
boost going into that game.  
CHANTEL POSTON: I'd have to agree. Also being we've been in this position
before. We love playing here. It's kind of‑‑ it's our home away from home. I
think that helped us there at the end, just closing out the game, just knowing
we've been here before, we know how to do this.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, what are you thinking when she hits a couple and seems to be
getting on a roll, are you thinking, okay, hope this keeps up, or what's going
through your mind?  
COACH VERSYP: Oh, definitely. I just started calling plays every time for her.
She had the ball in her hand quite a bit and she had a great shot coming off
the dribble, so I just did a lot of high on ball screens and she kept nailing
them. And then certain other people were setting great screens for her.  
You've got to ride somebody as long as you possibly can in games like this
because you just don't know what's going to happen. And she felt it. Her
teammates gave her a lot of energy. And the crowd gave her a lot of energy.  
So I think everybody did a very good job allowing her to be successful.  
  
Q. With Michigan State being on a real roll, what was the key for you guys
in really slowing them, especially Porsché Poole who had been really carrying
them?  
COACH VERSYP: I think the biggest thing is our defense. Our guards really had
to step up and play some great defense. We switched a lot of screens. We used
some taller athletes on their guards. So we kind of switched 1 through 4.  
And we tried to keep our 5s on Lykendra Johnson. That helped us. And for us
being able to run early and knocking down shots early, I think that's a big
key for us. If we can defend and knock down our first couple of shots, then we
feel pretty good.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about the development of Chantel? Mid ‑Big Ten season
she was playing single‑digit minutes off the bench and here she is hitting
layups and 3‑point plays that are critical down the stretch?  
COACH VERSYP: I think with every player the light switch goes on different
times. She's been in the gym doing a lot of extra, watching a lot of film. And
I think just like anybody, she's just very confident right now.  
We can instill that, but they have to feel it. And I think her teammates
empower her, we all empower her, and I think when that comes, give her the
ball and she's going to go to work.  
And we'll real proud of her growth and what she's done for everybody.  
  
Q. Chantel, those two 3 ‑point plays when you really needed to keep that
distance, just how active she was today, especially in a very, very physical
game inside there.   
COACH VERSYP: Well, it really helps she can jump as high as she can so she can
maneuver her body around people. So that's still amazing to me, her
athleticism. But she knows that she needs to rebound. She knows she needs to
attack the glass.  
She's done a much better job shooting her free throws, but she's doing what
her responsibilities are and her role is, and I think she's doing it well and
she really takes it to heart and she just wants to help this team win.  
  
Q. Coach, just noticing that all four semifinalists are ranked in the top
25, how good is this conference? How many teams do you think should get into
the NCAA tournament?  
COACH VERSYP: I think this conference is one of the best in the country now.
And I believe seven should get in. And that would be the first time, I think,
ever.  
So Michigan totally deserves it. Iowa, Michigan State, definitely with their
RPIs and the strength of schedule. We should get seven in.  
  
Q. Michigan State had that 13 ‑0 run early in the first half and then I
believe Johnson picked up her second foul. What changed with her offensively
on the bench and what were you able to do with her not being down low?  
COACH VERSYP: I think Brittany kind of got on a run that was huge. That was
the key. But also I felt like we attacked down low a little bit better when
she was out of the game.  
So I thought Chelsea scored and attacked the basket when she got it down low,
made two field goals, and then we just started attacking the rim.  
She changes the game because she's a shot blocker. So when she's out, you
know, we did what we were supposed to do.  
  
Q. Michigan State, you just played about 12days ago. Penn State's going to
be about 15days ago. Just the freshness of the opponents that you're going to
face, how much is that going to help prepare this team for semifinals?  
COACH VERSYP: I think it helps. I think they still have‑‑ like our players
said, they still remember those games. And we weren't at our best. So now we
have another opportunity.  
So we need to be at our best to play them, and we'll see what tomorrow brings.  
  
Q. How demoralizing do you think it can be when a player is really rolling
like that? And did you see any signs that that was wearing on Michigan State,
the way that Brittany Rayburn was draining 3s?  
COACH VERSYP: I think just in athletics in general, when you have someone just
performing at a real high level and knocking down shots, or in any sport, it
can be draining, but they kept fighting back.  
They're well coached. Their seniors on that team, they kept fighting back. We
were ahead by 18 and it could have went to 20 or 22, but it didn't. It got
down to about 11. And then it was around 11 or 9 for a while.  
So, you know, you just gotta keep playing the way you're capable of playing
and you can't worry about what the other team is doing.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Purdue  73  
Michigan State  64

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Michigan State head coach Suzy Merchant as well
as student‑athletes Jasmine Thomas and Lykendra Johnson.  
Coach, opening statement?  
COACH MERCHANT: You have to give Purdue a lot of credit. I thought they came
out of the gates really strong I thought both offensively and defensively. I
thought defensively they got into Kiana and we couldn't get a flow going early
offensively, and that's kind of her responsibility, to make sure that we're
flowing a little bit from that side. And obviously Brittany Rayburn was
insane. That's the best way to put it.  
And I just‑‑ it was disappointing that it took us that long. I thought J.T.
did a great job on her late in the second half, or three‑quarters‑‑ or half,
about six minutes into the second half. She was really in her and forcing her
to put the ball on the floor. But it was disappointing we didn't have an
answer for that.  
We weren't physically and mentally as sharp as we needed to be, and give
Purdue a lot of credit. I thought they really played and really played well.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Lykendra, how tough was picking up that second foul? It seemed like you
were in a good rhythm, and as soon as you went to the floor, Brittany got hot
and the game really changed.  
LYKENDRA JOHNSON: It's always tough picking up fouls where I shouldn't pick up
fouls. I hurt my team too many times, and I gotta mature from that area. I
mean, that's killed my career being in foul trouble. So it changed the
momentum of the game and I just let my team down.  
  
Q. Jasmine, what was it like watching Brittany get off like that?  
JASMINE THOMAS: I mean, definitely it's never good, especially if she's
hitting everything. I mean, literally everything. But, I mean, defensively, it
was just hard to watch, just because you know you want to go out there and
stop that player. But you still have to have somebody to step up and do that
job as well.  
And, I mean, it's a team defensive thing. It was team defense on her the whole
time.  
  
Q. Lykendra, what do you think was the biggest difference between the last
game you played against them a little less than two weeks ago, where you were
able to win in this game, where it seemed like you guys couldn't find a
rhythm?  
LYKENDRA JOHNSON: We just needed one more person to come alive on the
offensive side. I think nobody deferred from not trying to score, but I think
it was just tough to get somebody else going, when they was all up in our
grill being real physical with us and basically getting us off our game.  
If we just had that one more person, we would have won this game.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Suzy, how frustrating was it for you to watch Lykendra like that?  
COACH MERCHANT: Beyond frustrating. And it is just disappointing because we
were prepared for everything they did. And we just didn't have theintent. And
the difference was J.T. just decided‑‑ when she decided it wasn't going to
happen and she got up into her. And we kept saying it and saying it. But there
wasn't a whole lot of response.  
I could tell in the first four minutes we just were not as sharp as we needed
to be. We have some transition rules, and, I mean, Porsché's responsible to
block the basket, and every time the shot went up, she's still standing in the
court.  
I got into her at the timeout. I just felt like it was fighting your own team
a little bit to get what was important accomplished.  
So I was a little disappointed in that. And like L.J. said, I don't think we
were offensively in the flow. And then obviously they got off to a great
start. But it was frustrating. I'm not going to lie. We're kind of built to
defend, and that was a little troublesome. And we're capable and athletic
enough and we've done it against some really, really good players this year,
and key people have done it. And it just didn't seem like we elicited enough
intensity of a response.  
And we know she can hit them. She hit 12 against Minnesota. So, I mean, it was
definitely part of the scouting report.  
  
Q. Porsché and Kiana have been playing well for you for a stretch the last
couple of games, but tonight really struggled. What do you attribute that to
and why was it such a tough night for them?  
COACH MERCHANT: I'm not sure. Maybe it's a question to ask them. I'm not sure
where they were. But I didn't feel like they were mentally or physically the
players that they had been. They were kind of in their own little world out
there from a defensive perspective, from an offensive perspective. Hadn't seen
that in a long, long time.  
And I just felt like there was no leadership from either one of them as
players. And they had been doing a good job of that prior to this point.  
You know, we knew they were going to be physical with Porsché. And talked to
her about really doing a better job of setting up her screens and from the
tip.  
I mean, there were just things like that. Her safety position. She was just
not as sharp and focused as she had been. And I felt the same way with Kiana.
I think when Kiana is not strong and focused and someone's getting up in her
to a point where she lets them, because she's capable of not, it's happened
before where she just handles it, no big deal.  
I was disappointed and it causes everybody to play a little bit rattled. And I
thought she got rattled tonight. And it affected both ends of the floor for
us, her and Porsché.  
  
Q. Did you feel the second foul on Lykendra was a turning point in this
game, and was there any part of you that thought maybe I should keep her out
there with two fouls because she's playing so well?  
COACH MERCHANT: No. I know her. I've coached her for four years. The third was
coming. I was happy to get her out before she got her third because we had to
wait a long time. And I was really worried about it. She just doesn't do well
in those situations.  
So I've just coached her long enough to know that‑‑ you know, I thought about
it, but it was to the point where we were under‑‑ when I really thought about
it, when they kind of pulled that stretch was later in that, in part of the
first half, and it was like we need to ride that because we're going to need
her, make a statement out of the gates. So I guess I felt like, yeah, for
sure. For sure.  
I mean, I think she gives us a lot of confidence in different ways. And it
always does. Sometimes you can get away with it. But it definitely defensively
bothered us. I thought Becca came in and just defensively was not very sharp,
no matter if she's guarding a post or had to switch out onto a guard or was on
a different situation, I just felt like she wasn't as sharp as she needed to
be defensively.  
So it put us into a real mode. I mean, in the second half I was playing A.P.
at the 4, just trying to get somebody in case we could switch out in those
situations. She was defending the 4, playing the 3 at times.  
We were doing things that were a little outside the box from what we normally
do. And a lot of it had to do with the situation that we were in because of
L.J.'s foul situation.  
I mean, that charge was frustrating a little bit because I thought she‑‑ we
know that about Rayburn, and she said she stopped and the kid fell. But I
don't know. I have to watch it on film.  
But I told her, you know, you don't ever get the benefit of the doubt, L.J.
They got a quick whistle for you, usually.  
  
Q. How do you compartmentalize sort of going into ‑‑ potentially going into
the NCAA tournament? Seemed like you were playing real well, winning five in a
row in eight of nine versus the feeling after this one of just not playing
very well?  
COACH MERCHANT: We played a bad 20minutes the first half. But the last 20 I
thought we played well. I mean, we fouled them at the end. Gave them four,
five free throws. I have to look exactly. But I know we fouled Moses twice.
Might have been three people to the line.  
So, I mean, we outscored them in the second half. And we played hard. We were
just in a little bit of a hole. I think you can build positive on the second
half and the way we fought and competed.  
I thought we got some good minutes out of some other people. I mean, I thought
that J.T. really sparked us, and, you know, that's something that I feel like
we can build on.  
I mean, certainly disappointed with the loss, but I thought at least the
second 20minutes, I thought we played good basketball. We really played good
basketball. We were just a little bit in the hole. And we couldn't quite get a
couple situations, whether it be the ball falling for us, we had a couple of
puppies down there we missed, we had a defensive rebound scramble a couple of
times where that would have gone our way, we probably could have done some
things.  
So I guess I felt like‑‑ I don't think‑‑ I think you can build on that. I
think we're an NCAA tournament team. I really do. I mean, we have 20 wins.
We've got some key wins, playing really well down the stretch.  
We had one bad 20minutes and a kid that went absolutely insane. That doesn't
happen very often, that situation where a kid is that hot. And so we can learn
from it.  
But I don't feel like that hurt our postseason, and I was trying to build on
the positive on the second half.  
And I think there's merit to that. It's not like you're trying to make
something up. I really feel like we played hard and played well in the second
half. We were just in a bit of a hole.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Nebraska  80  
Iowa  68

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Nebraska head coach Connie Yori, as well as
student‑athletes Jordan Hooper and Lindsey Moore.  
Coach, an opening statement.  
COACH YORI: Well, you know, when Jordan got in foul trouble to start the game,
I thought we hung in there. And it was a reasonable margin at halftime. And I
felt pretty good at half that we could get Jordan back and play a little bit
better on both ends.  
And that's exactly what happened. You know, our kids, I thought, showed
tremendous toughness, being the team they had to play back to back, it's not
easy‑‑ we have very little preparation time.  
But our kids were tough. And I thought in the second half, you know, between
Jordan and Lindsey, those guys kind of took over there for a while.  
Lindsey has the ability to do that. And for some reason she's played really
well against Iowa this year in all three games. And she's got the ability to
do that when she's hitting her 3. And it sets up her penetration. And I
thought that was a really big key to the game.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Lindsey, you hit a long 3 at the buzzer going into halftime. Did you
think that gave you a confidence boost either as a team or you personally with
how you came out and played the second half?  
LINDSEY MOORE: I definitely think it did. We kind of gained momentum from that
even though it was going into halftime. It was a big shot. And the likelihood
of that going in was really slim to none.  
But the fact it did, knew that good things were going to happen come the
second half. I definitely think that gave us an energy boost.  
  
Q. Lindsey, they were up about 8 in the second half, and you guys kind of
turned it on. Was there anything that changed or was it the back
‑to‑back‑to‑back 3‑pointers?  
LINDSEY MOORE: I think it could have been the 3s, but also I think we were
getting stops finally on defense. They started going on a run and we were able
to get stops, and that opened up our offense. Anytime we can get stops on
defense and rebound and get out and run, we're a pretty tough team.  
  
Q. Jordan, you go out two minutes into the game. What's going through your
mind there? You come out in the second half and you put upI think it was
13points in the second half.  
How are you able to regather yourself to come out there and score that many
points in the second half.  
JORDAN HOOPER: When I came out it was pretty frustrating to get those first
two fouls. But you have to stay focused mentally and know you need to go back
and do what you need to do in the second half.  
So, I mean, you don't really look at the first half at all, you just go out
and play a new game.  
  
Q. Your thoughts on the upcoming matchup with Ohio State?  
LINDSEY MOORE: We're excited about it. They're a really good team, and
whenever we play them I feel like it's always a really good game. They have
really good guard play, but they also have some posts inside that can give us
a run for our money.  
So it will be definitely fun to see. It's going to be I think a fast‑paced
game.  
JORDAN HOOPER: Sounds good to me.  
  
Q. Lindsey, can you talk about what you guys did defensively in the second
half to slow down Logic and Wahlin? They scored a lot of points in the first
half, but you guys kind of shut them down there after halftime.  
LINDSEY MOORE: We switched our matchup on who was guarding her. I thought
Hailie did a good job guarding her. She's a really big guard, so I think she
bugged Logic a lot on that. And we were just more aware of where Wahlin was
and making sure she wasn't getting anything open and no easy looks.  
  
Q. Do you think you running so much on offense kind of tired them out when
they were on offense?  
LINDSEY MOORE: Definitely. We were moving the ball pretty well and getting it
down to the lower seconds of the shot clock. So definitely moving it for like
20seconds.  
No one really wants to play defense that full 30seconds. So making them play
defense was definitely a huge key.  
  
Q. Jordan, there were times in the second half where almost it seemed like
the ball was attracted to you, whenever the misses would happen, the team was
rebounding really well. Was that how you guys were set up in the paint? Was
that Iowa's misalignment? What was going on with the rebounding margin
there?  
JORDAN HOOPER: I think we were just going to the boards hard. I don't know if
it was really they weren't, but we were just‑‑ I mean, I was focused on
getting every rebounding, like Coach told me in timeout. She said: Every
rebound is yours. So I was just focused on getting every single one.  
COACH YORI: Finally have a player who listens to me.  
  
Q. Lindsey, during a run like that, at what point does it just stop thinking
and turn into action, you let the adrenalin take over?  
LINDSEY MOORE: We needed to get good shots, and at a point I was feeling it,
and I decided to go with my gut instinct and get to the hoop and get easy
stuff going for us.  
I think that's when our best basketball is, when we're playing hard, we're
getting easy looks inside, moving, and I thought like offensively we were a
really good moving team.  
  
Q. Lindsey, did you have feeling in the first half when a lot of Iowa's
points were from outside, a lot of your points were from inside, that you were
going to be able to take control?  
LINDSEY MOORE: You know, they started stitching up more to man when they would
miss. So knowing that, just to be aggressive, they were going to make some
misses, and on makes they were going zone, and then on misses they were going
man.  
So just knowing that and just pushing the ball and just being aggressive
really is how I was trying to look, just to attack and not settle for outside
shots.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. How much I guess guts does it take to sit Hooper for 17 1/2 minutes?  
COACH YORI: Well, I think it's the smart thing to do. As long as we're in the
game and the game isn't getting away from us, I think that's what you have to
do.  
And it would be foolish to bring her in when the game‑‑ when the margin was
what it was. And you have to gamble a little bit. But I think that's the
gamble you've got to try to make.  
  
Q. How crucial was it for Katie to shoulder that offensive load in the first
half?  
COACH YORI: I just thought that Emily‑‑ I thought Emily was really good. She
is not playing at 100percent. She's got a bad knee. And she's tough. I mean,
the kid is tough as nails and can do so many things for us. And I just thought
she really kept us in the game.  
I thought Hailie Sample did a lot of really good things throughout the game.
Two freshmen starters for us. I thought they were both really active and made
good things happen for us.  
  
Q. The final minute of the first half, very important, obviously. Can you
talk about just the significance of getting it closer and then being able to
bring Lindsey in?  
COACH YORI: They came down and they turned it over. And we get the last look,
and that's not a shot that most people work on, but the funny thing about
Lindsey is she does that every shootaround. She takes half‑court shots every
shoot‑around. I've always said Lindsey is going to hit one of those one of
these days because she loves to do that.  
She doesn't always make them in shootaround, but occasionally she does. But
that was definitely a good break for us. And we had a couple of breaks. We had
that and Hailie Sample hits a 3 in the corner, and that's her first 3 all
year, when the shot clock is running down.  
But that's part of playing tournament basketball. You've got to make plays.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about the matchup next game against Ohio
State?  
COACH YORI: Well, we obviously are familiar with them. We just played them. So
there's some advantage, I think, to having just played, but that's to their
advantage as well. You don't have to go through a really extensive scouting
report that our kids have to review. It's fresh in their minds. I think that's
a positive.  
But it's also a positive for Ohio State. But we're going to be the team that's
playing two days in a row, and so I think to play a team that you're somewhat
familiar with, I guess that can be a positive.  
  
Q. Can you expand a little bit on Iowa switching from man to man and zone
defense? Is that something you saw out of them before and did you tell the
team anything in particular about that?  
COACH YORI: Yeah, they did that to us in Lincoln. They switched their
defenses. We saw that against Northwestern last night. I think our kids are
starting to handle that better.  
And when they‑‑ I feel like we're getting better in our zone offense. We're a
lot more productive. We're getting better shots and we're making more shots.
And when you have a young team, to recognize defense, sometimes that's a
challenge.  
But our kids I think‑‑ here lately we've seen several teams do that to us, so
that definitely I think has played into our favor tonight.  
  
Q. Coach, there are times over the last couple of weeks that the team really
struggled offensively and periods in the last three games where the team has
been able to score at will. What do you think has changed?  
COACH YORI: Well, I think, I mean, a couple of things. I think when Lindsey
makes the decision that she wants to be aggressive, I think that helps us. And
I think there was a series‑‑ Lindsey is not playing healthy. She's struggled
with injuries herself and I think she played tentative for a couple of weeks,
because she wasn't healthy.  
And those are things that you may not be familiar with and we can bring them
up now because I think she's getting her legs back and I think her knee feels
a little better than it did.  
So that's‑‑ I think when she's aggressive, I think it sets a tone for us. And
she's also‑‑ she made shots today. So that sets up the drive. And that knocks
them out of the zone and that sets up opportunities to drive the lane and get
into the paint.  
  
Q. Having to play now a third game in three days, is it more mental or
physical for your team?  
COACH YORI: I think definitely there's a physical side to it. We playful court
defense. That is not easy to do. It's demanding. Generally the day after a
game we do either nothing or very, very little to save our kids' legs. And to
play three days in a row with the style we played, it's not going to be easy.  
But I think we have a good toughness about us. So I think the mental is going
to have to overcome the physical in this case.  
  
Q. Coach, a little bit more of a general question, but how good is this
league overall and how many teams do you think should get into the dance?  
COACH YORI: It seems to me we should have seven teams in. I think Michigan
made a great run in the tournament and played really good basketball today.
And Iowa should be‑‑ looks to me like we should have seven teams.  
It's a great‑‑ you look at the RPIs of the team the way some of them have
played lately, the Michigan States, and I think we definitely played our way
into the tournament, in my opinion. And I'm not on the committee, but I think
we have a really good shot to get seven teams in.  
  
Q. Lindsey had a great offensive game but she also had five steals. Can you
talk about how important her defense was in this game?  
COACH YORI: Well, Lindsay's a very underrated defender, I think. She's our
best defender overall. And she really understands defense, and she understands
positioning, and she gets her hands on a lot of balls. She deflects a lot of
passes, and she was able to‑‑ late in the game I think there's Logic that
drives baseline, she gets out on the shooter on the corner and makes a steal.  
I thought that was a big play. All of a sudden it could be a different game,
they hit a 3 there and they get some momentum.  
So she can make plays on both ends.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

### [Maggie Lucas](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21801)

### [Coquese Washington](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18021)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Penn State  78  
Minnesota  74

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined now by Penn State head coach Coquese Washington
and student‑athletes Maggie Lucas and Zhaque Gray.  
We'll start with questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Maggie, how tough was it playing the rest of that first half with the
foul situation?  
MAGGIE LUCAS: You know, I usually don't get too many fouls. So it wasn't that
difficult. Just a little extra thought. Probably not going to try to take a
charge at that point.  
So, you know, tried to focus on it.  
  
Q. Maggie or Zhaque, you said time and time again you don't worry about the
halftime going into the locker room regardless of the score if it's somewhat
close. Were you worried today?  
MAGGIE LUCAS: We weren't happy with how we played in the first half. I don't
think we were concerned. We know we can string together quick points. So we
can get back in the game easy, just get a few stops.  
  
Q. Maggie and Zhaque, what changed for you guys in the second half? You came
out with a 16 ‑2 run and completely took away the halftime lead.   
ZHAQUE GRAY: I felt like we got the first‑half jitters off. We came out kind
of tight, and then I feel like in the second half we just relaxed and executed
the game plan.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, did you try to take advantage of Minnesota's physical play in the
second half and try to draw those fouls like that and get some points?  
COACH WASHINGTON: Well, I wouldn't necessarily say we tried to take advantage
of it. But we certainly talked about responding to their physical play in that
we had to play a little bit tougher in the second half than we did the first
half. And I thought we were able to do that and we got on the bonus early
which helped us.  
  
Q. Alex started 1 ‑for‑7, Nikki started 0‑for‑7\. What did you say to them
in halftime to get them going the second half and get production out of
them?  
COACH WASHINGTON: We didn't talk about offense at all. We talked about our
defense. I thought offensively we were impatient. And I take that back, we did
talk about offense in the sense that we talked about being more patient and
getting more ball movement.  
The first half I thought we took a lot of quick shots. And we weren't moving
the ball and making the extra pass. The second half I thought we did a little
bit better job of that. I also thought we mostly defended better. And we
defended better. We got some transition opportunities. We got to the
free‑throw line. And Nikki and Mia did a great job on the board in the second
half giving them second‑chance points.  
  
Q. You said you talked about defense. Just Alex had a steal, just ran the
floor completely, looked over at you, all you could do is smile and shake your
head. Then you have another one from her and it leads to a 3 ‑point play from
Maggie. Can you talk about what that did to spark you guys?  
COACH WASHINGTON: Our defense is what keeps us in games. In the first half, we
shoot jump shots. Sometimes they go in. Sometimes they don't. You can't always
control whether or not you're making baskets, but you can control your effort
on the defensive end. You can control how you make shots for your opposition.  
In the first half we didn't do that. The second half I thought we did a better
job of it. But I thought Minnesota did a really good job of staying in the
game, even when we went on our run and we got the lead, they kept attacking.
Banham had a really good game and Buford was aggressive the second half, and
that allowed them to stay within striking distance.  
  
Q. Coach, earlier game today Jordan Hooper got two fouls early and sat the
rest of the first half. This game Maggie gets two fouls. She plays through it.
Can you talk about the thought process behind that and her being able to play
through it and be effective?  
COACH WASHINGTON: Well, again I just have a lot of faith and confidence in
Maggie. I've told her it was like you've got two fouls you've got to be smart.
So she said you just can't gamble. Maybe you don't get in there take a charge.
Maybe in some areas you're not as aggressive or assertive.  
And then we talked about offensively she had to be smart in terms of shooting
the pull‑up and not putting herself in the position to pick up a charge call.  
So I just have a lot of faith and confidence in her ability to play smart with
two fouls.  
  
Q. Alex and her energy level. Obviously radiates. Obviously she doesn't do
anything quietly. And I know that sometimes controlling that and pulling the
reins in can be difficult. Can you speak to her energy level what it means to
the team? And then for those who aren't aware of your career, how does her
temperament and how she played the point compared to when you played?  
COACH WASHINGTON: Oh, okay. Well, her energy level is key. She pushes the pace
for us. I mean, she changes things defensively for us. I mean, I think you can
see tonight why she was named to the All‑Defensive team because she gets into
the action and creates plays.  
I thought one of the biggest plays she made was steal late in the game on
three‑on‑one transition, and she gets a steal and comes back down the other
end. And I think we either get a layup or we get an offensive foul. Yeah, that
was a huge play. So her energy level is off the charts for us.  
How she and I compare? I'm a little more cerebral than Alex. But, I mean,
she's‑‑ we're similar in the sense that we like running the team. We do it a
little bit differently.  
But, at the end of the day, she's a winner and she wills our team to win with
her leadership, her energy level, her effort, and she makes big plays. Doesn't
matter how she's playing. If the game is close down the stretch, she'll make
plays that we need to win.  
And that's just a tremendous attribute that she has.  
  
Q. What changed for Nikki in the second half? Two different players there.  
COACH WASHINGTON: You know what, I think the first half she‑‑ Zha‑Zha said
they had a few Big Ten Tournament first game jitters. I thought she rushed a
little bit. She played a lot more in control and a little bit slower in the
second half. That allowed her to kind of get in the rhythm.  
So I just think‑‑ I think they all were a little nervous, a little jittery,
and we didn't play our best basketball the first half, but the second half I
thought we, all of them played a little bit better.  
  
Q. Back to Alex. I'll be totally unhip to say this this way, but do you dig
her swag?  
COACH WASHINGTON: Absolutely loved it. Loved it. If I had a little bit of her
swag, I'd probably still be playing.  
  
Q. You were talking about leadership and calm around Maggie, free throws
down the stretch. Can you talk about what makes her such a good player and why
you can trust her in that situation?  
COACH WASHINGTON: Maggie has put in so much work that she trusts everything
with her game, because she's put in all the work. She shot a gazillion free
throws coming into this game.  
So she gets‑‑ she expects every single time she shoots it she expects it to go
in. She's slightly neurotic when she misses, and we have to go, Maggie, you're
not going to make every single shot she shoots. But because she's put the work
in, she has a lot of confidence in herself and I have a lot of confidence in
her.  
So her confidence and her composure just comes from the preparation.  
  
Q. You guys were down 31 ‑18 in the first half. Were you worried at any
point during this game?  
COACH WASHINGTON: You know, I can't say that I was worried. Honestly, I can't
do that math. I don't even know how much it was. So that keeps me calm.  
I always just think that the game is long. And, you know, if you're down
double digits and it's still the first half, there's so much time left in the
game. There's so many opportunities for adjustments.  
So I wasn't concerned about the score. I was concerned about our execution or,
I should say, lack thereof of the game plan. And like we talked to the team,
if we start to execute the game plan, the score will take care of itself.  
So I feel‑‑ I have a lot of confidence in our team that we can make
adjustments from first half to second half. And we usually play better the
second half, we haven't had a great first half.  
  
Q. Do you think you guys took them lightly at all?  
COACH WASHINGTON: Absolutely not. We absolutely did not take them lightly at
all. I mean, Minnesota's a good team. They beat Ohio State. They almost beat
us at their place. We caught them at the end of the season last week. And we
played better at home.  
But we absolutely did not take them lightly. I think Minnesota is a good team
and deserves a lot of credit for how well they played, how aggressive they
played. They didn't appear tired at all from having played on the first day.
And I just have a tremendous amount of respect for Pam Borton and what she
does with her team.  
  
Q. With the team's initial struggles in the first half off the bat, how key
was it for Zha ‑Zha to pop those 3s and keep the attitude up?  
COACH WASHINGTON: She's playing some really good basketball, and she got some
open looks and she played within herself and took what the defense gave her.
That made some great shots, big shots, and that allowed us to stay within
striking distance.  
  
Q. Looking ahead, it's not going to get any easier from here. What do you
need to work on the most looking ahead to tomorrow?  
COACH WASHINGTON: I think we've got to put a full game together. We're not
going to be able to advance in the Big Ten without a complete game for
40minutes on the defensive end. So we've just got to start off the game better
in the first half in terms of executing our defensive game plan.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

### [Samantha Prahalis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19286)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Ohio State  57  
Michigan  48

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Ohio State head coach Jim Foster, as well as
student‑athletes Samantha Prahalis and Tayler Hill.  
Coach, would you like to start with an opening statement or straight to
questions?  
COACH FOSTER: Questions.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Sam, before this game you talked about getting everybody involved was
important. Do you feel like you did that with the way Kalpana and Darryce and
some other people played?  
SAMANTHA PRAHALIS: Yes, I think especially in the second half there was a time
Tay hit a couple of big shots Darryce and K.P. had a couple of big shots for
us. So at times I think our post players held us up a little bit. So I think
we've got to keep that up.  
  
Q. Tayler, in the first half, you didn't get many looks in the first half,
but you came alive in the second half. Was it you were just taking what they
were giving you?  
TAYLER HILL: Yeah. I think it just cameup ball reversals. We reversed the ball
a couple times, and then (indiscernible) was ball watching and I got a couple
of looks. In transition I think I got some looks too.  
  
Q. It got hairy at the end, Tayler. What let them get back into it, do you
think?  
TAYLER HILL: I think shooting the ball quick, and then we wasn't transitioning
to the 3‑point line. We was kind of running back to the lane, a little
confused on defense, and they got a couple 3s.  
So I think that hurt us for a couple minutes, but then we got it back
together.  
  
Q. Sam, did you expect this to be such a low ‑scoring game?  
SAMANTHA PRAHALIS: I don't know. Michigan kind of likes to grind it out a
little bit. So that's the kind of game it turned into. So we just had to grind
it out.  
  
Q. You did ‑‑ I don't even know when you knew, when you broke the Big Ten
assist record. Does that mean anything at this stage of the season?  
SAMANTHA PRAHALIS: I mean, it's cool, but it will probably‑‑ it's really cool,
but it will mean a lot more after everything's done. I'm just focused on the
next game.  
TAYLER HILL: It's a great accomplishment.  
  
Q. Sam, what did they do to make it a grind ‑out kind of game?  
SAMANTHA PRAHALIS: They packed the lane a little bit. I would say that they
packed the lane a little bit and they made us play a little bit half court
offense.  
  
Q. This is a season low ‑‑ well, this ties the season‑low points for you
guys, and you still won. What does that mean to you guys, that you can score a
season low and still win?  
SAMANTHA PRAHALIS: It's a good thing because we can score high and win
hopefully and low, so to know that we can grind it out or we can get up and go
up and down with people, it's good to have both. It means we're getting better
in half court, moving the ball pretty well.  
  
Q. Tayler, you scored 16 of your 19points in the second half, seemed like
once the buckets started falling for you they started falling for your
teammates. How did it feel to personally see your team get back into it and
take the lead and carry it through the rest of the game?  
TAYLER HILL: I guess it's a good feeling. I think we got some stops and got
key rebounds so that helped us transition, and I think they got us going for
everybody. They started playing us on the guard. So Ryce and K.P. got layups
down there. I think the stops and rebounds we got this game helped us
transition to offense and helped us get easy buckets.  
  
Q. You'll get either Iowa or Nebraska in the next game. From this game, what
do you need to do better to advance to the next game?  
SAMANTHA PRAHALIS: I think we need to keep our rebounding up. I gotta take
care of the ball a little bit more and just keep moving it. Just be us. We
don't care who we get, we just want to play well.  
  
Q. In the second half you guys attack on transition a lot. I know you were
already halfway down the court wide open for an easy layup. Was that something
that you were trying to do coming out of the locker room?  
SAMANTHA PRAHALIS: Yeah, well, we got to get stops and rebounds for us to do
that, and I thought we did a pretty well job, our posts did, even our guards
rebounded pretty well and we were able to get a couple runouts.  
  
Q. In the second half Michigan went on a 10 ‑0 run, what do you do
offensively trying to stop that and maybe score points?  
SAMANTHA PRAHALIS: Move the ball. That's really it. Attack them when we can
and move the ball. But if they're going on a 10‑0 run, the bigger thing is
defense, because they're going on a 10‑0 run.  
So we need to focus a little bit more and get out to the 3‑point line.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. You've been talking lately about getting the posts engaged. And it seemed
like that that not only happened but it also kind of probably saved you in
this game.  
COACH FOSTER: It's a reality of the ability to win all types of games. You
have to involve all your players, and we just have this habit sometimes of
taking quick shots.  
And when we do that, we're very easy to guard. And when we engage our post
players and don't do it, we're very difficult to guard. And we got it figured
out and took care of our business, and I thought our defense was terrific
tonight.  
  
Q. What makes Michigan's defense difficult to score on?  
COACH FOSTER: I think the tempo of their offense has a lot to do with their
defense. They want the score level. They want to eat the clock on both ends of
the floor. And you have to be patient. And you have to grind. They want it to
be a grind game. And you've got to be willing to get your hands dirty.  
  
Q. Late in this game, basically your defense actually ‑‑ your defense won
the game. But you got two All‑Defensive players on your team. Each of them had
a steal in the last minute. What kind of an advantage is that for you guys to
have that kind of‑‑  
COACH FOSTER: It's only an advantage if you take advantage of it. I mean, you
have to have a mentality to be a good defensive player and to know when you're
guarding your own, when you can help.  
I thought we did a pretty good job of staying within the framework of our
individual responsibilities except for a five‑minute blip. We had a couple of
young kids out there for the first time.  
And a learning experience for them. They'll be better at it tomorrow.  
  
Q. And I think it's been almost two years now that you guys have beaten
Michigan. Especially in the tournament, what does that mean to finally beat
them especially in a game like this?  
COACH FOSTER: It doesn't matter who you play today. Like winning today is
important, because we paid for a hotel room tonight. I mean, we want to stay.
We want to play tomorrow. We want to take care of our business on a daily
basis. And it doesn't matter who it is.  
When you get in these tournaments, you can't put too much emphasis on the game
today, because the objective is to get to play tomorrow. If you get two up or
two‑‑ I think we know we lost to Michigan. I think you could tell by the
attitude that we brought on the floor defensively that we weren't going to
allow it to happen. And scored enough points to take care of our business.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Michigan head coach Kevin Borseth and
student‑athletes Courtney Boylan and Carmen Reynolds.  
Coach, an opening statement.  
COACH BORSETH: I guess it's hard‑fought. I thought our kids played very well.
I was very proud of them. Got down there, start the second half.  
So I'll take one of your questions away from you: We thought the difference of
the game was the start of the second half, and we came back and fought our way
back into it and fell short.  
But we're very proud of our effort.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Courtney, there were a flurry of missed shots and missed free throws
around the 3 ‑, 4‑minute mark. Do you feel like you had your opportunity to
get back there and just weren't able to convert?   
COURTNEY BOYLAN: Definitely. I felt we had some good opportunities around that
time. I believe we were down like six points, six, seven points. And, like you
said, I had a couple of opportunities to make some free throws. Some of us had
some good, open shots. But just didn't seem to knock them down at the time.  
  
Q. For both of you, you guys struggled from the 3 ‑point line, especially
early. Was that their defense or was it you guys just not being on?  
CARMEN REYNOLDS: They were pressuring us. I think we had to focus more on
getting shots and rhythm.  
But I think that was key, getting shots and rhythm. Sometimes we would take
shots that were a little out of rhythm.  
COURTNEY BOYLAN: That was a good answer.  
  
Q. You guys held (indiscernible) in the playoffs again under their season
average like you did earlier in the season, and your defense played
exceptionally well again today. Talk about that might ‑‑ like Jenny Ryan or
Kate Thompson might have helped you keep the score extralow and made it more
like a grind than a high‑scoring shootout.   
COURTNEY BOYLAN: We had a similar game plan to the first time we played them,
just to focusing on stopping their key players and helping off on players who
don't shoot as much. So I guess we were able to do that, but...  
CARMEN REYNOLDS: Going into the game we know Prahalis and Tayler Hill take 50,
60percent of their shots every single game. So you know you really have to key
in on those two players, they're so talented, and that's what we tried to do.  
  
Q. This tied Ohio State's season low points. Would you think you guys would
have had such a good defensive effort and still not come out with a win;
didn't you think your defense would be this successful?  
COURTNEY BOYLAN: Our defense has been great all year. It's been‑‑ I feel like
it's been our strong point all year. And we, down the stretch, just didn't hit
the shots that we needed to hit. And I think had we done that, we could be
sitting here with a win.  
  
Q. Brenae Harris, the freshman, she hits that 3 ‑pointer from the baseline,
and Ohio State is forced to take a timeout. What kind of momentum did that
bring you guys?   
COURTNEY BOYLAN: That was great. I love anytime our freshmen or people on the
bench get a chance to come in and play, especially when they're successful.  
That was a huge, huge shot that Brenae hit, cutting it from 9 to 6. It was
huge. And had we capitalized on some more opportunities, that would have been
great.  
  
Q. After that timeout, they came out and they spent a little bit more, had a
couple of missed free throws. Do you think after the timeout that might have
been the game ‑changer?   
COURTNEY BOYLAN: I never thought we were out of it, no matter what. Even after
that timeout, even if they scored a bucket, we're down 8 with still three,
four minutes to go. I mean, that's a lot of time. So I never thought we were
out of it.  
  
Q. Courtney, you finished with 10 points all in the second half. Was there a
particular struggle in the first half with not getting on the scoreboard?  
COURTNEY BOYLAN: I can't say it was a particular struggle. I think all of us
would have liked to hit shots that we had taken in the first half or to start
the second half. I don't think it was necessarily just me.  
But looking back, I'm upset with myself, had opportunities that I didn't
capitalize on that I think would have really helped our team.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Defensively, was that the game plan, to try to keep the score low and
just do what you pretty much did out there today?  
COACH BORSETH: Defensively, you've got ten or two kids, Prahalis and Tayler
primarily. We did a pretty good on Prahalis, all things‑‑ turned her over
seven times‑‑ held her to 11 points. She was four for 15 from the floor. One
for seven from the arc. So that was a good thing.  
Looks like Beach did a pretty good job coming through for them. Tayler, those
kids get their points. So we held Prahalis down.  
Defensively, I thought our kids did a really good job. You can't hold a team
scoreless. I wish you. It's not football or baseball, from that standpoint.
But I thought our kids did a great job defensively, on one day prep or without
even one day prep.  
  
Q. You probably got a feel going into the game it's going to be tough on the
boards. Do you feel like you battled there anyway?  
COACH BORSETH: Yeah. I don't think that was‑‑ I don't believe that was the
difference of the game, in my opinion. That wasn't.  
I think maybe the shot selection we took in the first half potentially could
have something to do with it. But you gotta feel it.  
We tried to get down inside that lane, but they kept challenging us from the
arc. We had some good looks down low. Nicole went down low and missed it. Nya
went down and missed it.  
We tried a few backdoor cuts, when we went after it with one hand instead of
two hands, got deflected, went out of bounds. We tried to get it in there and
the ball just wasn't going our way in the first half. And as a result you line
up with 3‑point shots that don't go in.  
If they go in, it's a different conversation we're having here, but...  
  
Q. When Brenae checked in late, I'm not sure if it was a coincidence, but
you went on a 10 ‑0 run with her defensively. Obviously she's giving you guys
good defense. Talk about Brenae, what she gave you today during her time.   
COACH BORSETH: Very good. I put her in initially and then I took her out and
had to get her back in there. She's a great athlete.  
She can make a lot of things happen, hasn't had much of a chance this year to
show her wares, but she's a tremendous athlete. She really is.  
Game experience is going to make her a whole lot better. She hit that 3
tonight, good to be able to see that, because that was a big 3. And she was
pretty fired up.  
  
Q. You mentioned in the beginning of the second half, how did you see what
happened?  
COACH BORSETH: I went back and looked at it. I just got done looking at it. We
traveled the first time we had it. Sheffer missed a 3, Courtney missed a
pull‑up 2 Sheffer missed a pull‑up 2. Those are first four possessions. Didn't
score on them. They went down and scored.  
As soon as the game was over, looked at that, the start of the second half. It
wasn't bad shots we took, they were good shots. They were shots that were
taken in the lane trying to get inside.  
And then we're making our comeback, how many shots did we have that one time?
Remember that one flurry? Shot. Miss. Rebound. Shot. Miss. Rebound. Another
shot. Miss. It was like, okay, what's going on here, is there a lid on that
thing?  
So I thought we gave it a great effort. I really did. And Courtney missed a
couple of free throws and she makes those free throws. There's a lot of things
in that game that could have changed the outcome. And I thought our defense
did everything it could on that side of the ball to give us an opportunity. We
just had to be able to knock some shots on the offensive end of the court.  
  
Q. Do you think the pace of the game ever got too quick?  
COACH BORSETH: Did I think the pace ever got too quick? Got too quick, we
missed and went down and laid it in, when it got too quick.  
That's playing with fire with those guys. You play with fire, you have
Prahalis and Tayler running up and down that court, and they're getting those
kinds of things. I think they caught fire in that stretch when we weren't
making baskets. That's when it got a little bit quick for us.  
  
Q. Do you feel like you've done enough for the committee?  
COACH BORSETH: I hope so. I mean, we had a great year. We had a great
preseason. We beat everybody from the major conferences.  
We put 20 wins on the board. We finished 5 in our conference. Our RPI is good.
We had a great strength of schedule. You know, we're a strong team. We're a
very strong team. We feel we've laid our case, but at this point it's
unfortunately not in our hands, it's in their hands. So we have to have a kind
of wait‑and‑see scenario right now.  
  
Q. Do you feel like, with your strategy, looked like they were trying pretty
hard to get other people involved, which sounds like you were hoping they
would do that. Do you feel like that sort of worked for you and then they were
able to make things happen after that?  
COACH BORSETH: When you're dealing with Prahalis and you're dealing with
Tayler Hill, you don't know what you're wishing for, because those two kids‑‑
if you think you want to get this, they take that. You think they want to take
that, they get this. We were trying everything we could to concentrate on
those two kids, and from that point just hope for the best and rebound, hope
they miss shots and rebound. Those kind of things.  
But I thought defensively it was‑‑ we were very good defensively. I felt,
yeah, there's breakdowns, but you can't pitch a shutout on every possession.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 2, 2012

  

### [Lisa Bluder](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16868)

### [Samantha Logic](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22973)

### [Kamille Wahlin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19309)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Nebraska  80  
Iowa  68

  
THE MODERATOR: Now joined by head coach Lisa Bluder and Kamille Wahlin and
Samantha Logic.  
COACH BLUDER: I want to congratulate Nebraska. I thought they played very
good, especially the second half. And it's like we got up eight or nine and
they just turned it on.  
It's like that's when they turned on the engines at that point, and really did
a great job defensively and on the boards. Outrebounded us by 10. And we can't
afford giving up those opportunities. And Lindsey Moore and Jordan Hooper were
outstanding in the second half.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Kamille, did you need to get more scoring, bigger advantage when Hooper
was out in the first half? When Hooper was out sitting on the bench with
fouls, did you guys need to get more points in the first half?  
KAMILLE WAHLIN: Yeah, obviously she brings a presence to them offensively and
defensively, she's good at rebounding, and we wanted to try and extend that
lead. But they have a deep bench.  
And, unfortunately, they made that 3 at the end also in the first half and cut
the lead again. They're a deep team. And when their top player goes out,
they're able to have other players step up.  
  
Q. You guys are 1 ‑and‑6 against ranked teams. How concerning is that
heading into the tournament where you're going to be playing good
competition?  
COACH BLUDER: I think we're 2‑and‑6, win over St. Johns and Purdue. Not taking
any of those away from us, sorry.  
KAMILLE WAHLIN: It is a bit of a concern, I guess, but it's one of those
things where at the beginning of the year we weren't playing quite as well as
a team. We were still trying to find our identity.  
Today unfortunately we didn't step up in the second half. So it's one of those
things where we still have to learn from those top teams and learn how they
play and learnat the same time we have two weeks here where we have to get
ready and hopefully for the NCAA tournament, and it's one of those things
where you can't focus on it too much but you have to learn from it more than
anything.  
  
Q. Sam, what happened in the second half? You had the eight ‑point lead and
then things turned pretty quickly.   
SAMANTHA LOGIC: Yeah, I think that we lost some intensity on the defensive
end. Lindsey Moore just hit some big shots for them, and I think that it
deflated us a little bit. But we can't let that happen.  
I mean, Moore and Hooper, especially, they're going to hit shots. We just had
to bounce back from it. And we just didn't this time.  
  
Q. Kamille, was there a sense with your guys' history with Nebraska, the way
they come on in the second half, was it kind of a "here we go again" type
feeling in the second half?  
KAMILLE WAHLIN: You know, they just seemed to be a team where they step up at
the right moments. And it's kind of one of those things where we knew it was
coming in the second half. We knew in the locker room. We said, hey, we've got
to continue to play hard, continue to battle.  
Even when they got that lead a little bit, it's one of those things where we
just kept trying to get ourselves out of the hole. We went cold from the
field. And they're pushing it hard in transition, and it was kind of one of
those things that felt like deja vu again.  
But it's just the way it goes.  
  
Q. Lincoln, the zone in the second half that you guys went to gave them
trouble. Here it didn't seem to give them as much trouble in the second half.
Did they do anything differently, or was it just a case of shots going in as
opposed to them not going in in Lincoln?  
KAMILLE WAHLIN: I felt with Hooper back in there they attacked the high post
really well. They also hit the short corner and drove to the basket extremely
well.  
And by them getting those in‑the‑paint shots is what opened up their zone a
lot. We didn't clog the paint as well and we didn't defend that high post I
felt like as good as we did in the first half.  
So they definitely I think made some switches where they were going to attack
with Hooper in the short corner and the high post when she was back in the
second half.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, is Nebraska just a tough matchup for you guys?  
COACH BLUDER: Not an easy match up for us because they don't have that true
five. There's not a way that Morgan is going to guard Hooper. She's really a
guard and a post body. And so she's just kind of some strange hybrid that's
out there that's very, very hard to defend.  
So we don't match up very well against them. And that's why our zone was
really pretty good at their place in the second half. And it just wasn't as
effective tonight. But they were more prepared for it.  
  
Q. Coach, Kamille and Sam both had big first halves and Nebraska kind of
changed the way they threw the defense at them. Could you talk about how that
affected them?  
COACH BLUDER: I thought the second half we didn't run our offense as well as
we did the first half. Now, I'm sure some of that has got to do with Nebraska.
And they intensified their denial in keeping track of our shooters and such.
And part of it is us getting away from our system. We felt like kind of
panicked a little bit when they closed the gap on us and then got ahead of us.
I felt like we got away from what was working for us in the first half.  
And we have a couple of freshmen on the floor. That's what happens when you
have freshmen on the floor. But I also want to‑‑ I think Nebraska does a
really good job on the defensive end.  
  
Q. This is the first loss in about a month.  
COACH BLUDER: I don't like it.  
  
Q. How do you feel about this team's chances assuming you make the Dance and
what do you think are your chances you will make the NCAA tournament?  
COACH BLUDER: I think we have very good chances of making the tournament. Our
RPI is good. I don't think this loss is going to take us that far down into
the RPI. We were in the 30s this week. Usually when you're in the 30s, it's
pretty good.  
Good chance. We're in one of the toughest women's basketball conferences in
America. We tied for second in that conference. We played well down the
stretch.  
That's something that people look for. And we played very well down the
stretch. We proved we could play without Jaime. I think that was important for
us.  
So I feel very good about our chances. I think we'll have a good contingency
from the Big Ten representing us in the NCAA tournament.  
  
Q. How big do you think the momentum changer was that play where at the end
of the half where she dribbles it off her foot and Lindsey goes down and hits
a 3 at the buzzer?  
COACH BLUDER: That probably got into the psyche of our players a little bit.
But we started off the second half okay. I felt we were resilient through that
getting up 8 through the second half. To me it was when they hit the
back‑to‑back‑to‑back 3s. That was pretty tough.  
And when‑‑ I have to find my glasses to even see. When Hailie Sample hits a 3,
is that her only one of the year? That's kind of tough.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 2, 2012

  

### [Rachel Banham](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23253)

### [Pam Borton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14360)

### [Kiara Buford](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23236)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Penn State  78  
Minnesota  74

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Minnesota head coach Pam Borton as well as
student‑athletes Kiara Buford and Rachel Banham.  
Coach, opening comments?  
COACH BORTON: Very proud of our team's effort today. We fought. I thought we
battled until the very end. I thought we had the entire momentum in the first
half. I thought the momentum changed at the very beginning of the second half,
probably in the first two or three minutes. I felt like we came out of the
locker room and weren't as aggressive. A little tentative. Stopped doing some
of the things that we did defensively in the first half to really set the tone
in the second half.  
And I felt like that completely changed momentum. Very pleased with our
rebounding. We outrebounded them. Hit more field goals and felt like the only
difference today was at the free‑throw line.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Rachel, you guys were ‑‑ after that great first half, you guys fell
behind 58‑45\. How were you guys able to stay composed and come back, make it
a game?  
RACHEL BANHAM: I think we just never gave up. We kept fighting. And I mean we
just wanted to win the game. I think we kept looking for that. And even though
things were falling apart, we just kept tight together and we kept composed
and we tried to win.  
  
Q. Kiara, can you describe how you feel right now?  
KIARA BUFORD: I'm obviously sad that we lost, but with a game like that I'm
very proud of my team. I thought we played so hard. Coming off the game we had
yesterday, I thought we fought to the end.  
I thought we easily could have put it down in the dumps when we came down in
the second half at the beginning, and we fought back and took it all the way
to the wire and we played hard.  
I think it showed a lot of character about our team.  
  
Q. Do you guys think the way you played against Wisconsin yesterday gave you
some momentum coming into the first half with how strong you were against the
conference champs?  
RACHEL BANHAM: I definitely think so. Whenever you can get that big of a win
on your first night, you obviously have a little bit of momentum. And I think
we played Penn State‑‑ we were their last game before tonight, and I think
that helped us a little bit, too, and we don't want to go home, so we played
hard.  
  
Q. Rachel, you guys were down 74 ‑71 with like 30seconds left. And you drove
in and went for a two‑pointer. Can you describe your thought process, why you
didn't go for the 3?   
RACHEL BANHAM: I was trying to attack, get in the lane and score and hopefully
get fouled. But I think it would have probably been a little smarter if I
would have shot it. I was a little rushed and just trying to hurry up and
score and get the ball back, but that's what was going through my mind.  
  
Q. Also you had nine rebounds today. Ten rebounds yesterday. You were like
one of the shortest players on the court at all times. Describe how you can
rebound the ball so well.  
RACHEL BANHAM: I think our post players are really good at getting the girls
behind them. So when they do that I can just swoop in and get the ball.
Whenever it drops to the ground, I run in and go for it. Otherwise I'm just
running around trying to grab it.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. How difficult is this considering, I guess, what was on the line for you,
because you pretty much have to keep winning, postseason, and to come so close
and play so hard and not quite get there?  
COACH BORTON: Well, I was very proud of how we played. Obviously it's very
disappointing on how we lost. But I think there's still a chance to get in
postseason depending on how many teams get in the NCAA tournament, which I
really truly believe that seven teams in the Big Ten should get in hands down.
So we're holding out hope that we can be that team that's in the NIT.  
  
Q. Coach, you all did a good job on the interior defense on Nikki Greene in
the first half. I think she was 0 ‑for‑7 from the field. She had a much
stronger second half. What changed?   
COACH BORTON: I think our ball pressure changed in the second half right at
the very beginning, I think there was less pressure on the ball. I think
Bentley came out and really did a great job setting the tone and really
attacking the lane.  
But I thought we let her get in the lane too much and I think that really
opened things up. I think our players maybe took a step off a little bit to
try to get her in front. But I think our ball pressure really affected us in
the second half because we gave her vision to throw it in.  
And Nikki Greene, she's big and strong. She's a big post presence, and she's
really worked on her game. She's gotten a lot better. And at this point last
year she wasn't able to score on the block, and I think she's come a long way
and has worked on her game.  
  
Q. It seems like every time you put Jackie in the game she provides an
instant spark. Can you talk more about that?  
COACH BORTON: She's a senior. She's got a lot of experience. She's been a
starter for us until she got a concussion about eight games ago and she plays
like a veteran.  
She's going to step up and make plays and she's going to put her body on the
line and take charges and dive after loose balls and go one‑on‑two on the
boards sometimes.  
But she's got that experience and the refuse‑to‑lose attitude.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 1, 2012

  

### [Joe McKeown](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19252)

### [Karly Roser](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23235)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Nebraska  88  
Northwestern  56

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, opening comments.  
COACH MCKEOWN: You know, two of the smartest people in coaching told me‑‑ or
one I read, the other told me‑‑ say as little as possible after the game. One
was Tara VanDerveer and one was Tom Landry. So I'm just going to say Nebraska
took the game to us from the opening tip, really, and we can never bounce
back.  
Give them a lot of credit. I think the pace they played at we controlled in
Lincoln, and today we couldn't do that, and that was the big difference.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Karly.  
  
Q. How much of their pressure upset your guys' offensive flow today?  
KARLY ROSER: I think just them getting in our shorts right off the tip, like
Coach said, kind of rattled us a little bit. And last game we were able to
handle it no problem. But this game we let it get to us a little bit more. So
that made it difficult to run our offense, get the ball up the court, and they
forced a lot of turnovers on our part.  
  
Q. What goes through your head, Karly, in that big run in the first half
that they had and shots aren't falling for you guys and they're falling for
Nebraska?  
KARLY ROSER: Just that we need to find a way to bounce back. We've done it in
past games and had good results. So we knew we had it in us. I think we just
kind of ran out of gas at the end and they kept taking it to us. They didn't
really slow down at all. Just tough one.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. We'll finish up with questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, with what you saw today, what would you say of the Huskers'
chances going forward in the tournament?  
COACH MCKEOWN: I think in conference tournaments, really, I think you just win
and advance. I'm not sure you really‑‑ obviously they played well. But I'm
sure if you asked them, they're just focused on Iowa.  
But it's such a balanced league that on any given night in this league I think
you'll see a lot of potentially crazy things happen in this tournament. But
they're capable of winning it. So is probably a lot of people that are still
playing.  
  
Q. The change in their pressure defense was more half court than the last
time you played them?  
COACH MCKEOWN: Well, last time I thought the game in Lincoln, two things
happened in the first half. Number one, we just handled the pressure that they
put on us and we played great defense. We scored. We were able to score.  
So I just felt that we played with a lot of confidence. Went into halftime‑‑ I
think it was a tie game. But felt like we were in control of the pace of the
game.  
Where today we turned it over in that run. They made shots. They got‑‑ I think
they hit seven or eight 3s, where in the first game we defended the 3‑point
line really well.  
And today we just didn't do a very good job.  
  
Q. In the couple time ‑outs you took in the first half, what was the message
to your team?  
COACH MCKEOWN: Just trying to slow them down. Just trying to slow down and get
the ball inside and trying to make us play with some of the poise that we
showed when we were really good this year and try to control the game the way
we did in Lincoln. We just couldn't do that. I'm sure I'm probably out of
time‑outs this year. I'll have to check my stats.  
But the other thing, I'm just really proud of our team to start off 10‑1\. We
were one of the best teams in the country. Went on the road and beat top‑20
teams. I thought we were right there.  
We got bit a little bit with injuries and kind of carried through the Big Ten.
So I'm disappointed. We're disappointed. But I'm really proud of our team. And
today was not indicative of, I think, the kind of team we are.  
So for our senior class, to win as many games over their four years, I think
they won more games than any three‑year stretch in Northwestern history going
back to the'90s. So it shows you the strides we're making as a program. We
lost three great players last year, three seniors.  
So we'll bounce back. We'll be back. But I wish Nebraska well. They played
really well today.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

### [Morgan Paige](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23238)

### [Taylor Wurtz](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23237)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Minnesota  81  
Wisconsin  49

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Wisconsin head coach Bobbie Kelsey as well as
student‑athletes Taylor Wurtz and Morgan Paige.  
Coach, an opening comment.  
COACH KELSEY: We just ran into a very good Minnesota team tonight. They hit a
lot of their shots, a lot of loose balls. They did recover those and put them
in. They had balanced scoring. They played a complete game.  
And we really struggled to score. We struggled to pass. We struggled to do a
lot of things. But it wasn't for lack of effort, and it's just one of those
nights where we couldn't really get it going in our favor.  
But we didn't quit. We played all the way to the end. I was very proud of the
team. They didn't give up.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Can the two of you talk about just how difficult it was even to get those
shots off outside?  
TAYLOR WURTZ: Yeah, Minnesota is a really good team. They picked up their
defense intensity. But we had open looks. We just have to be able to hit
those. And obviously tonight they weren't falling.  
MORGAN PAIGE: I would say that we really got out of sync with‑‑ they were
really up on us with ball pressure, and at the beginning we really got out of
sync and we never really could get back into a rhythm where we could like take
our time with our shots.  
I feel like we had some open looks that we didn't knock down.  
  
Q. Looking forward to next season? How do you progress from this loss?  
TAYLOR WURTZ: I think you use it as motivation. And you just think, okay, how
can I get better. And we gotta go into the offseason every day valuing every
minute that we get and getting up shots and working on our ball handling so
next year we can make a run in this tournament.  
MORGAN PAIGE: I also feel that it's very important to take this opportunity
and have your team buy into what you want to do. I feel like if we can get
ourselves to believe that, we can be a top‑caliber Big Ten team in the
offseason and really work for it, that anything's possible.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, it seemed like they really took control of the boards. What were
some of the things that you and your team were trying to do to counteract
that?  
COACH KELSEY: I think the hard part was they were very aggressive, and we
didn't counter that. Tonight we got really pushed around on the boxouts,
especially they were going up very strong for the ball.  
And we kind of were batting at it, poking at it, but not really aggressively
getting it. And when a team wants it more than you do, and it appeared that
way, not for lack of effort. But you gotta put that effort into motion. You've
got to apply it. And we just didn't do that. And they were hungry for the
ball.  
We beat them before. And they weren't going to come in here and let us beat
them again. And they executed their game plan, and we didn't.  
  
Q. Did Minnesota do something different with their lineup from the time you
did beat them up in Minneapolis?  
COACH KELSEY: No, they switched on defense quite a bit. We couldn't recognize
the fact that if you have a post on a guard and a guard on a post, well, you
just go down and post up. And we did that in the second half.  
But it was kind of too little too late. We kept getting the hand‑off and just
running right by. And they just switched right back. So we didn't do a very
good job of reading the defense and really taking advantage of a mismatch when
they did switch a big on the little or a little on the big.  
  
Q. When four players score in double figures like they did, is it tough to
constantly get control of multiple scorers like that?  
COACH KELSEY: It's very tough. That's what you really want as a coach. You
don't want one 30‑point scorer; you want four that can get 40points, ten
apiece. So they really shared the ball. They had 15 assists and they hit the
open shot when they were open. And we had some open looks like the players
said, we just didn't knock them down.  
I've been at the highest level. I was here when Texas A&M beat Stanford. And
the difference is the teams that win, they hit shots, period. If you do‑‑ if
you switch, they're going to make you pay. If you don't, they're going to make
you pay.  
And that takes a total team effort, that's why when you do have four people in
double figures it's very difficult to get a handle on who can you help off of,
who can you not.  
When a team can shoot, you're pretty much a one‑on‑one by yourself, and they
took advantage of that as well.  
So they played a really good game. And we just have some work to do. It's
painful for the players because no one likes to lose that way.  
But I said: Channel it. Make it something that, again, motivates you to get
better. Don't cry about it. Get mad, and then go do something about it.  
  
Q. All 12 of your players played, in fact, the last couple of minutes you
had four freshmen and a walk ‑on out on the court. How does this help you for
next season?  
COACH KELSEY: We didn't want to get anyone hurt that was going to return.
Taylor and Morgan, you don't want to have them out there and Cassie getting in
a blowout game. You don't want someone to go down with a knee injury or an
ankle or something like that.  
But kudos to those guys who came in, the players who came in and really kept
playing.  
It's easy just to give up, look at the scoreboard, say, hey, we're getting our
butts kicked and this is over. But Kelly came and hit two 3s. Maybe I should
have put her in before then. But hindsight is 20/20. She does a great job in
practice getting us ready. So I felt confident she would go out there and at
least look for her shot. And she did that and they got her the ball and she
hit the shot.  
So I'm happy for her. Walk‑on, it's hard to be a walk‑on on a team where you
don't play a lot, and then when you get an opportunity in a game like this,
it's bittersweet, the fact you can get some shots up.  
But Kelly is a team player and she wants the team to win. It's not about her
individual stats.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Nebraska  88  
Northwestern  56

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Nebraska coach Connie Yori and Rebecca
Woodberry and Lindsey Moore and Jordan Hooper.  
Coach, a couple of opening comments.  
COACH YORI: I thought in the first half we were very aggressive. We moved the
ball well. We were aggressive off the dribble. We got some things in
transition.  
Very different game than the first time we played them. I think we scored more
in the first half than we did in the entire game the first time we played
them. But a lot of it, our players played with an aggressive mentality. They
played with confidence.  
They did the things that we asked them to do. In the first time around, we
were very passive, and I thought this time we just played with a different
mentality offensively.  
And the other key stat is we rebounded. We gave them very few extra
opportunities, and we did a really good job on our defensive glass.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach.  
Questions for the student‑athletes, please.  
  
Q. Lindsey, have you ever sat down that long for a game?  
LINDSEY MOORE: I don't think so. I think that's the first time that I've‑‑ I
don't even know how many minutes I played. But I think that's probably my
season low.  
  
Q. Is that hard to do?  
LINDSEY MOORE: Kind of. I think when T got hit, she was like, All right‑‑
Coach Kelly was like, One of you guys go. I jumped off the bench trying to get
in, but she ended up being fine and I came back.  
  
Q. Why were you guys so much different than the first time?  
LINDSEY MOORE: I think we executed what we wanted to do early, and I think our
pressure really bugged them. In our first game against them, I don't think our
pressure really affected them at all.  
And this time we're actually able to get out, pressure, pick up how we want to
and play the style we want to play.  
  
Q. Jordan, would you say this is the best you've seen the team play all
year?  
JORDAN HOOPER: We came in with an aggressive mentality. We focused on what we
wanted to do, and we executed.  
  
Q. Jordan, the last game against Northwestern, you guys really struggled
from the 3 ‑point line. But today the first two shots you took were
3‑pointers. You want to talk about that? Was that a mindset going?   
JORDAN HOOPER: Wasn't really a mindset. I think it's just a confidence level.
I think I've gotten more confidence as the games‑‑ the last two games have
gone on. So I think it's just confidence.  
  
Q. After you hit your first one, Dannielle came down the court and hit one.
Did you want to go back and hit another one?  
JORDAN HOOPER: I didn't really pay attention. I mean, I knew that happened,
but it wasn't really in my mind to do it again. We just had to score more
points. That's all we worried about.  
  
Q. The same thing Lindsey talked about, you sat on the bench basically the
entire second half. What was that like knowing you didn't have to go in
anymore?  
JORDAN HOOPER: It wasn't tough because our team was doing so well, but it was
kind of weird not going in every couple of seconds, I guess.  
  
Q. Rebecca, how did you and the other freshmen ‑‑ how were you guys so
successful today?  
REBECCA WOODBERRY: I think we were successful because of our practices, and we
just work hard in practice. So when we have the chance, when our teammates
need the rest, we're able to go in and contribute the way we're supposed to
and run our system.  
  
Q. Rebecca, the intensity didn't seem to drop off when you guys ‑‑ all
freshmen played the last ten minutes. Why is that?  
REBECCA WOODBERRY: We kept telling each other to keep the fire up and keep
playing defense hard because, like Lindsey and Jordan said, our pressure was
bugging them. So we wanted to make that a point, to keep the pressure up,
because if we weren't scoring, as long as we were playing good defense, we'd
be all right.  
  
Q. Lindsey, everybody is going to talk about the main shots in the first
half, but how much did the little defensive plays and the steals and getting
some of those hustle plays help you guys execute on offense?  
LINDSEY MOORE: Our defense created our offense I think today, and that was a
huge part of why we were able to get so many good looks. Our pressure was
really bugging them. And it's hard‑‑ it's a hard team to play against when
we're up pressuring and taking things away.  
So our defense created our offense today.  
  
Q. Lindsey, you think this game sends a positive message about how Nebraska
will be able to compete in the Big Ten long term?  
LINDSEY MOORE: I hope so, because this is the style we want to play. And the
fact we were able to execute on both ends of the floor I definitely think
shows how we are today.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.  
Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, at what point can you actually relax during a game like this when
you're up 20, 30points, if at all?  
COACH YORI: Well, I'm not one to relax a whole lot. I felt like a couple of
minutes left in the game we were finally in good shape. But up to that point
you want to keep playing your possessions.  
It's a focus in our program on a daily basis to focus on the possession. And
we want to do that and we want to keep doing that. And I think the exciting
thing about this game is that we did have kids who continue to do that.  
And we had five freshmen on the floor. I don't know how many minutes. But good
part of the second half. So the fact that we kept playing well, there was some
relief there.  
  
Q. Can you talk about what you did during that big run in the first half
defensively to keep them from scoring and neutralize their height down at the
post?  
COACH YORI: If you look at the stats, we won all the aggressive stat lines. We
turned them over. We run the battle of the boards. We got to the foul line
more than they did. So those are things you look to do, we look to do within
our system. And those are important stat lines.  
And we won the battle of the possessions and we were the aggressive team. And
we are a pressure team. We want to get out and play that way, and I thought
our kids did a really good job of buying into what we wanted to do today.  
  
Q. You're 2 ‑0 against Iowa, which you face tomorrow. What do you really
remember about those games?   
COACH YORI: I remember they were both really close games. And they came down
to the wire. And we were fortunate to win two games, and we know Iowa's a
really good basketball team and playing their best basketball right now and
they won eight in a row, and they're going to be well rested and they've got
the advantage from that standpoint.  
It's hard to beat‑‑ it's hard to beat a really good team three times in a
season. So we'll have our hands full tomorrow.  
  
Q. With the win streak they're on, their freshmen ‑‑ Samantha Logic has
really been dominating. Can you talk about how you plan to limit her
defensively tomorrow?  
COACH YORI: We don't really have a plan right now. We're going to get back to
the drawing board when we get back to the hotel and figure out what we want to
do tomorrow.  
  
Q. And also can you just talk aboutin a kind of a lopsided win like this
today, how beneficial is it for you to rest your star players and keep them
fresh for tomorrow?  
COACH YORI: It's huge. Like I said, when Katie Simon, who barely played for
us, plays more minutes than Jordan Hooper, that's a good thing in a tournament
setting.  
So we were fortunate to get the lead and hold the lead and not have to bring
the starters back in.  
  
Q. Was there a certain anger in your play today?  
COACH YORI: I don't think we have angry kids. So I would say no. We've got
happy kids.  
  
Q. A little revenge ‑‑  
COACH YORI: We've got angry coaches sometimes. Happy kids.  
  
Q. Revenge?  
COACH YORI: I don't know. You can maybe go with that angle. But I don't think
that was what our focus was. Our focus was to do what we wanted to do and be
who we wanted to be and be aggressive.  
  
Q. There was a couple of shots on the chin and that kind of thing?  
COACH YORI: That's the game. You're always going to have that.  
  
Q. After the Ohio State game, you said your team resembled a box of
chocolates, after the Forrest Gump reference. What would you say they pulled
out of the box today?  
COACH YORI: Well, I like a good caramel with chocolate on it. So maybe that
would be it. I don't know. Yeah, we played well. And it was good. We played
two consecutive games now, when we were not playing particularly well for a
period of time. And we've played two really good games in a row.  
So I think there's a lot of confidence to be gained from that going into
tomorrow and heading into whatever happens after tomorrow.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Brandi's on ‑the‑ball pressure and how important that
is? It doesn't necessarily show up in the stat line, but just frustrating
Northwestern's offense?   
COACH YORI: The good fortunate thing we had going today is we had our freshmen
Tear'a Laudermill and Brandi Jeffery primarily, they were able to get up in
pressure and really create some havoc.  
When those guys do things offensively and make plays on the offensive end and
make good decisions, then they get to play more. And they did that.  
And I think there's a wearing effect that we play with, and when we can play
with some depth‑‑ we had a series of games there that we did not‑‑ our bench
did not produce for us. But we had to go longer minutes with our starters.  
We're not very good when we do that. We are a team that wants to play kids
that are fresh. We want to keep running kids in at that position in
particular. And when those guys play as well as they did today, that's going
to help us in the long run.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 1, 2012

  

### [Adrienne Godbold](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21805)

### [Jolette Law](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18032)

### [Lydia McCully](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21771)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Michigan  68  
Illinois  53

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Illinois head coach Jolette Law and Lydia
McCully and Adrienne GodBold.  
Coach, if you would like to start with opening comments.  
COACH LAW: Give a lot of credit to Michigan. They set the tone the first half,
and we dug a hole for ourselves. We played better the second half, but the
deficit was too great to cut.  
Give a lot of credit to Michigan.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. You guys were at a pretty big deficit throughout the entire game. Lydia,
what were your game plans trying to work back into it?  
LYDIA MCCULLY: Whenever you're down like‑‑ I think as a player you want to try
to get everything back right away. But we've been in the situation multiple
times before, so you know something has to kind of ease back into the game.  
Unfortunately, we weren't able to do that today.  
  
Q. Adrienne, you got in foul trouble pretty quickly in the first half. What
did you do on the bench to try to keep your teammates moving and keep them up
when things were going bad?  
ADRIENNE GODBOLD: The best thing I could do is be more vocal and positive, try
to keep everybody's heads in the game. Us being down, it was harder. But we
tried. We tried.  
  
Q. Both of you guys were in foul trouble. What was that like watching a big
game like this sometimes from the bench?  
LYDIA MCCULLY: For me, I'm not really used to being in foul trouble. So I
think I was really frustrated from the bench. But at the same time a lot of
the fouls I had weren't the smartest fouls. So I really don't have anybody to
blame but myself.  
ADRIENNE GODBOLD: It was harder watching the game from the bench first half
because I haven't been on the bench in a couple of games. So staying positive
helped the team. And the fouls that I got were‑‑ I was just trying to crash on
the boards. I was kind of disappointed in myself.  
  
Q. Lydia, I know this is your last game. Can you talk about the growth
you've seen from this team from last year to the end of this year?  
LYDIA MCCULLY: I don't even think from last year to this year‑‑ I think the
program overall has changed.  
I can't express the feeling of what I feel like now, having a family, as
opposed to when I first walked in. I think there's nothing but hope for this
team next year because seeing the growth that we did have‑‑ I just know that
they can go‑‑ the levels we haven't reached yet.  
This is a great team. This is a great program. And one day we would be at the
top.  
  
Q. Adrienne, Coach always talks about the little things, rebounding and
turnovers. Where do you feel you guys fell short on, or was it just you
weren't hitting on the offensive end?  
ADRIENNE GODBOLD: Our shots weren't falling, but I'm not quite sure what we
fell short of today. I would say we did have a lack of focus in the first
half. That's where we dug a hole for ourselves, and it was hard for us to get
out. I think it was focus, mainly, for now.  
  
Q. Lydia, can you talk about your motions right now after playing your final
game?  
LYDIA MCCULLY: I wanted it bad for the team, more than I wanted it for myself.
But it's hard, that last game. We lost. I'm going to miss them.  
ADRIENNE GODBOLD: I don't think words can express right now, honestly. I don't
have much to say.  
  
Q. You guys came out ‑‑ you had like five straight points in the beginning
of the second half, but Michigan kept seeing‑‑ their shots kept falling. What
did you want to do on defense to try to get them to miss their shots?  
LYDIA MCCULLY: Defensively, it wasn't even‑‑ usually for us it's
communication. There were loose balls on the floor. They were on the floor; we
weren't on the floor.  
We had mental lapses at times that were crucial in the game, especially coming
out of the first. Like I said, we dug ourselves a hole. Whenever you dig
yourself a hole, it's tough to get out of it.  
  
Q. On a consecutive possession, you guys would have second and third
rebounds. You guys were really hitting the glass hard. What does that do for
your guys' mentality, in terms of knowing those boards were coming your way?  
ADRIENNE GODBOLD: In the first half we noticed that we were able to crash and
get offensive rebounds. But it gave us energy, getting the awards and the
putbacks, helped us with the energy in the game. Pumped us up a little bit,
but it wasn't enough.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, I know that Karisma Penn had two fouls going down into the first
half. Did you ever think about, when the deficit was growing up, putting them
back in in the first half?  
COACH LAW: I thought about it. But I know from experience, especially with
Karisma, over the course of the year, putting her back in the game I would
rather use her in the second half than put her back and jeopardize her picking
up a third.  
She and Adrienne and Karisma are a vital part of our defensive scheme. And I
know that they were going to continue to attack them. And I didn't want to
take that chance. I wanted to trust my other players on the bench.  
  
Q. Did you try anything different defensively when Boylan picked up her
second foul in the first half?  
COACH LAW: I did. When they brought Jordan in, we decided to back off a little
bit, and we doubled down a little bit. We weren't supposed to double team and
trap; we were supposed to dig. And Kate Thompson hit some crucial 3s.  
So some of the things we were supposed to do, like Lydia mentioned, there were
some mental lapses; instead of turning our backs to the shooter, we were
supposed to just help a little bit because we knew Jordan wasn't a 3‑point
threat. But some of our players lost track of their man by trying to help down
low on the post.  
  
Q. Players like Thompson, and they come off the bench, so how do you prepare
for those bench players that, you know, score like 13, 14 points?  
COACH LAW: We prepare for every person on this team. We do a thorough scouting
report. And Kate Thompson, seemed like every time we played them she always
comes up big, hitting big shots.  
So she was no stranger to us. That's why it was no surprise that we actually
turned our backs and lost sight of her.  
But it's unfortunate; you don't really want the bench players to come in and
have big games. But give her credit she came in found some crucial shots and
hit the wide open shots when they were there for her.  
  
Q. What did you tell your team when the lead, when they were starting to
thresh the lead and shots weren't falling for you offensively?  
COACH LAW: Just stay focused. Stay composed. Stay confident. And we have
another half. Right now we have to chip away. And we have to make sure we
can't turn the ball over.  
We have to be calm and execute. And there were times we had wide open shots.
But some of the people that were open weren't confident enough to hit the
shots. But my job as a coach was to try to bring confidence into each of the
players and let them know that time, situation, score. Continue to get stops
and let's be confident enough to knock down the shots that would eventually
fall.  
  
Q. Obviously you guys didn't get as far as you did last season. But do you
think this team has improved?  
COACH LAW: Totally different. I think this year we played one of the
toughest‑‑ the toughest non‑conference schedule in the country. And even in
the Big Ten. So I'm looking at how close we were with some of the top ranked
teams. And last year our schedule wasn't as tough, but this year it was a
very‑‑ probably I think top five schedule in the country.  
So when I watched the growth of my team and seeing how much we developed and
how much better we've gotten, I'm encouraged.  
  
Q. You're only losing a few players; you have to be positive looking
forward. You have McGee coming back and hopefully Kersten can stay healthy. Do
you feel you have a lot to look forward to next season?  
COACH LAW: I do. Centrese McGee, she was a starter last year. And Kersten, in
out of the lineup, dealing with a concussion. If we can stay healthy, have
everyone coming back, and we have some incoming freshmen that will be here as
well. This freshman class has gained a lot of good experience. So looking
forward to next year, and I think the future looks bright.  
  
Q. Coach, you guys played Michigan the very first team of the Big Ten
season. You beat them last year in the tournament. They were the 3 seed and
you were 11. You went on to beat the likes of Michigan State and Ohio State.
Did you have confidence knowing you could beat this team?  
COACH LAW: Definitely. We came in knowing that we've just got to be the best
team on this day. And unfortunately, you know, we weren't the best team on
this day. And every time we step on the court we feel that we have an
opportunity to win.  
So we came into this game 40 minutes, ready to play. And it's just unfortunate
that our shots wouldn't fall. We dug a hole for ourselves and came up on the
short end.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the emotions of this game, last game with Lydia,
Macie, and Eboni Mitchell?  
COACH LAW: I was in the locker room trying to hold back tears, because Lydia
McCully, Lana Rukavina, Macie Blinn and Eboni Mitchell really set the tone for
this team, the culture of this team.  
Every one of the freshmen, they were in there crying, like you guys, each one
of you gave of yourself to help us out.  
And this year and with the senior class leaving, it feels like a family, the
Illini family. And it's special. I'm going to miss Lydia McCully and Macie
Blinn and I'm going to miss Lana Rukavina and Eboni Mitchell a great deal.  
Although some of them may not have played, but it's the little things that
they did that most people don't see. They helped me to change the culture to
being back with that fighting mentality and that team chemistry concept.  
And I give a lot of credit to that senior class, because they really, in my
mind, left that legacy.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 1, 2012

  

### [Sasha Chaplin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23242)

### [Felisha Legette-Jack](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16871)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Michigan State  97  
Indiana  68

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined now by Indiana head coach Felisha Legette‑Jack as
well as Sasha Chaplin, and we'll go straight to questions for Sasha.  
  
Q. Sasha, could you give us your thoughts on the game in general?  
SASHA CHAPLIN: I just think we went out there and just fought to the best of
our abilities, just trying to keep fighting, stay positive throughout the
game. And Michigan State played a very well game, and we just have to learn
from this and get better for next season.  
  
Q. Can you talk about them out there? Looked like they blitzed you guys like
the start of the second half, getting the reads and everything else.  
SASHA CHAPLIN: I think just playing out there, it was just‑‑ I think we were
anxious to get out there and just play. And Michigan State just came out there
in the second half and kind of started shooting, hitting 3s, and all we could
do is just try to stay composed as much as possible and try to calm down and
just play Indiana basketball.  
  
Q. What did you feel like, maybe it was the 3 ‑pointers or something else,
what was the biggest‑‑ the hardest thing to defend, the biggest difference
between you guys and Michigan State tonight?  
SASHA CHAPLIN: I think the biggest thing for us was definitely the turnovers.
It kind of played a key factor in having them get transition baskets, which
kind of shifted the momentum. So that was the biggest thing for us.  
  
Q. First, the injury with Jasmine, more specifically the injury to Georgia,
how did you have to adjust your role on the team especially as the big man
down low?  
SASHA CHAPLIN: Just knowing that two of our players got hurt, it was an
adjustment. But we've been through this situation before, and the team just
try to come together and play to the best of our ability.  
As far as my position, I just tried to go out there and play basketball as
best as I could and help the team as much as possible.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.  
Finish up with questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Could you just talk a little bit about Candyce and Quaneisha getting some
solid minutes off the bench and what that says about the future for the
team?  
COACH LEGETTE‑JACK: First I'd like to congratulate Michigan State on their
performance tonight. I thought Suzy did a great job of coaching. Her team's
responded well to her.  
Candyce and Quaneisha is kind of interesting. I think that Michigan State has
a real special point guard, because usually freshmen don't play like that.
They usually need time to grow into a system. And clearly our kids are trying
to grow into the system.  
And it's really fun to see Candyce really emerging into that system late in
the season. And this game was a very tough game to play against because that
speed was tremendous. But I think she's played a little‑‑ played more composed
than she did in the past.  
I think this summer we'll get her stronger and getting her watching a lot more
film so she can become a better point guard for us, along with Andrea
Newbauer, but I thought Quaneisha showed grit. She's a kid that's really,
really a passionate person and really wants success, and sometimes she's in
her own way. But I like our chances in the future with her.  
I think she can catch the ball, run the floor, and shoot 3s. Once you get the
hang of the dynamics of these officials and how officials referee at this
level, in high school it's not as fast and she's not used to that.  
And it's the talent level in the Big Ten is tremendous. And she had to make
that adjustment as a really frail‑bodied freshman. But I think she's going to
get better. And I like the fact that she's on our team.  
  
Q. How frustrating was it in the second half when Michigan State started
hitting all their 3s, went 7 ‑for‑10 in the second half? What was it like
trying to defend that?  
COACH LEGETTE‑JACK: I thought we played silly basketball, because I thought
that it was very easy to find 33 since she was coming up the trail.  
And we needed to adjust to where she was. And she hit those first two 3s and
it was like: Prove it. She shoots 80percent from behind the arc. She's four
for five from the free‑throw line. She's not coming in. That should have been
an easy stop.  
You know 11 hitting 3s and 52 hitting 3s, that's a little different, because
that's not statistically sound that they're going to be the ones. But that 33,
she's the one that burst it wide open early in the second half. And that's
something we talked about in the locker room.  
So we didn't adjust from the locker room to the court. And we had a senior
player out there. So it was a little frustrating.  
  
Q. You talk about Quaneisha. Talk about the veteran leadership on this time.
You'll have Aulani, Jasmine and who is the other one, Sasha, they'll be back
next year. What do you think those players will bring to this team for next
season?  
COACH LEGETTE‑JACK: I know Aulani was hurting. This was not a great
performance by Aulani Sinclair. I know she want a do‑over for this game.
There's no do‑overs in the game of basketball. It's all about the next game.
There's no next games all summer long.  
I hope she'll let this one burn a little bit because no one can stop Aulani
but Aulani. She's good enough. We had plays for her and she didn't come
through as much as she should have.  
And so she's going to feel it the most this summer. I thought Sasha gave her
best. Those early two fouls, the one was undisciplined. The other one was just
her foot was there and the kid ran over it and you call it, you call it. It's
a foul. But nothing you can do about that.  
But her being on the bench early did not help us. And when she did got back
out there she'd done some fun things. So a lot of players that were going
against that hurt us that season has been seniors.  
So I think Sasha will have a chance to show her ability. And what's neat about
Sasha, she lasted the entire season. This is the first time ever that she
played an entire year. We're thrilled by that. That is the blessing that we
talked about in the locker room.  
So hopefully they will get that. Jasmine is a kid that's never been coached.
She's just been great. And this was kind of good to have her sit down and
watch and sense how the game feels from the bench perspective. And the role
she can play for us next year. I'm not certain what her role will be. I'm
going to be curious how she learned. And I know she's an unbelievable kid. She
wants to get better. But until we get her out there again, we won't know.  
  
Q. Coach, what do you feel like the team has to do either next year or the
following years to get to the level of a Michigan State or a Purdue or the top
teams in the Big Ten?  
COACH LEGETTE‑JACK: You mean get back to that level? Because we've been to
that level. And it's unfortunate that our injuries were in key positions and
it didn't allow us to be at that level again.  
But I like our youth. I like our fight. I'm not certain what team could go
through what we went through and handle it as gracefully as we did.  
It's unfortunate. It is what it is. But I like the kids that we've got coming
in. I like the kids that's in the bush that we're trying to get in the hand.
And I think that our kids are going to continue to grow. That leadership was
up in the air this year. Nobody wanted to take ownership of this team.  
And it hasn't had that cultural experience yet. But we have to get this team
beyond 20, 25 wins so they can understand what it feels like to win here
women's basketball. I think once we get that feeling in our hands, I think
it's going to really be exciting times at Indiana for both basketball
programs. But we have to figure out how to get them there and we're going to
have to get lucky with some injuries. We were lucky my first three years we
didn't get injured. We had seven players. We had nine players. We had 12
players, and we got no injuries. Significant. So we were able to push back the
fear of success.  
And we felt that success. In the last couple of years, injuries and come to
the edge and they're afraid and they turn around. And that's been an
interesting situation. But I like our young kids.  
They're wide‑eyed. Last night they were in my room and they really believed
they were going to have great success today. They really, really believed it.
It didn't happen. But I like the fact that they went into the fight thinking
they could actually win.  
And at this stage in the game, when you've won six games, have the eyes look
like that. I saw what eyes look like when you lose when you think you can win
and you don't believe it. But these eyes didn't say that to me last night. And
I just really love these kids. And these kids are fighters, and we certainly
haven't won a lot of games on the basketball court but I can promise you one
thing: These will be winners in life.  
  
Q. You talked about Michigan State the second half run, but it seemed like
that momentum really started in the first half. You were able to get within 10
and they got a couple of layups, and got within 11 and couple more layups and
that jumper right before halftime which looked like pretty good defense.
Seemed like it maybe took the air out a little bit.  
COACH LEGETTE‑JACK: Starting the game off minus the ball twice, two turnovers.
With silly turnovers like that, that's silly. That's silly. You can't give a
team like Michigan State who is an NCAA team the ball right away. You give
people like Porsché Poole momentum and energy, and that's veteran players
making those decisions. Rather, you get a five‑second call, give the ball to
the official, get back on defense.  
But we threw the ball just all over the place right away. And so that's not
going to help you. Then we fought and they capped their momentum and it's
herky jerky, they have a 12‑point team. You can't tit for tat with a team like
that. You have to get a couple of stops.  
We weren't quick laterally on the perimeter. We were addressing that need‑‑
and our recruiting class that's coming in next year. But we weren't really
quick, and we tried to play the matchup with this group. And Michigan State
brought out the water. So we had to go play the player, and we had to back off
because they were so quick. Backed off, they hit those 3s on us.  
We chess matched them. We had a lot of things in our tank to throw at them.
Everything we threw at them, they were ready. Tonight the best team won.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

### [Kiara Buford](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23236)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Minnesota  81  
Wisconsin  49

  
THE MODERATOR: Joined now by Minnesota head coach Pam Borton as well as Rachel
Banham and Kiara Buford.  
Coach, an opening comment.  
COACH BORTON: Yes, it was a great win. Great win as a collective group. I
thought we had great balance offensively. When we can get our post players to
score, we usually win and win pretty big. And that's probably been one of our
weaknesses all year.  
I thought our starters really got us off to a great start. I thought Kiara
really set the tone for our team with her defense and her attacking, and just
really our team really fed off of her tonight.  
Great team effort and gives us one more day to play together.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Kiara, you played a great game, 19points, 0 turnovers. Tell me about your
mindset going into the game knowing it could have been your last game.  
KIARA BUFORD: I think just leaving it all on the court. There's nothing‑‑ we
had nothing to lose going into this game. I had a lot of goals at the
beginning of the season, and this is one of them that I wanted to accomplish.  
I wanted to make sure before I went out as a senior that we had a good game
here at the Big Ten Tournament.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Michigan  68  
Illinois  53

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined now by Michigan head coach Kevin Borseth, as well
as players Courtney Boylan, Rachel Sheffer, and Kate Thompson.  
Coach, if you'd like to start with a few opening comments?  
COACH BORSETH: A great win. Illinois has a great team. I thought our kids came
out ready to play from the start. The first half determined for us, kind of
set the tone for the game. I think everything else followed.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes?  
  
Q. Courtney, you were about to burst out in smiles there with one minute
left in the first half. You had win No.20 for you guys. What does it mean for
you?  
COURTNEY BOYLAN: Oh, it's huge. Not just win No.20, but win No. 1 in the Big
Ten Tournament. That's what's most important right now. That's what we're most
focused on for now. It's awesome. Great team win.  
  
Q. I think you picked up your second foul pretty early and had to sit a lot
in the first half. What does it feel like to sit on the bench when your team
is obviouslycoming apart and still held their own in the first half?  
COURTNEY BOYLAN: Yeah, they did a wonderful job when I came out. Like you
said, I picked up two fouls early. But seems like every game someone new steps
up. So I wasn't even worried. I just cheered my team on, and they did great.  
  
Q. Rachel, Coach mentioned the first half set the tone. What do you think
you guys did really well in the first half to enable you to do that and how
did you maintain it?  
RACHEL SHEFFER: I think we just attacked the block and the lane, and Karisma
got in foul trouble and just helped us out, just having her presence off the
court really got us going, because she's a great player. And I think just
going at them and not relying on the 3 really helped us.  
  
Q. Rachel, they didn't shoot particularly well in the first half. Is that
their shooting or your defense?  
RACHEL SHEFFER: I mean, I'm not really sure. But, I mean, we did play hard.
They missed shots. It happens. But we did play well together on defense.  
  
Q. Kate, after what happened last year here, you lost the first round and
then things went really awry after that. How much was that on your minds
coming into this game, just to get past this game and get the 20th win and to
have an opportunity to do more?  
KATE THOMPSON: I mean, we're just taking every game one at a time. And like
this was a big win for us. And like Courtney said, first game in the Big Ten
Tournament, it feels good to have this win.  
  
Q. Kate, you obviously came off the bench, I don't know the final stats, you
scored 14 or 15. Talk about what that bench ‑‑ what it feels to come off the
bench and do that for Michigan.   
KATE THOMPSON: Just knowing my teammates have confidence in me. The whole
bench, when we come off, like our whole bench was really productive this game.  
  
Q. About the bench, when it helps?  
COURTNEY BOYLAN: It's great. We have supreme confidence in our bench,
especially Kate. We know when she comes in she'll knock down a 3 get a stop on
defense. They've been doing that for us all year, so no different this game.  
  
Q. Courtney, when she comes off the bench, are you looking for her
specifically, like 3 points?  
COURTNEY BOYLAN: I wouldn't say specifically looking for her. I mean, yes,
she's a wonderful shooter, so we're going to find her whenever we can. But our
offense is by committee. And so we all have a little piece of the puzzle, and
some nights is our night, some nights it isn't, but we do everything by
committee.  
  
Q. In the paint they outrebounded, and Coach always says rebounding isn't
always the final step, but were you getting kind of frustrated down there when
they're getting the second ‑ and third‑chance opportunities?   
RACHEL SHEFFER: Yes, it's frustrating. But credit to them. They crashed the
boards really hard. That's what kept them in the game. They scored most of
their points on offensive rebounds, second and third tries, and credit goes to
them for crashing the boards.  
We just know we have to step it up for tomorrow.  
  
Q. They didn't shoot particularly well. Were you relieved the second and
third opportunities not going in?  
RACHEL SHEFFER: It was just the flow of the game, just gotta stay focused on
that and go on what they're doing and what they're not and just capitalize on
that.  
  
Q. Courtney, Kate mentioned one game at a time. The next game at a time is
going to be Ohio State. You guys have had very good success against them the
last two years. What do you have to do to play a third game against them?  
COURTNEY BOYLAN: I guess I don't know yet. I guess we'll find that out today.
But you're right recently we have had success against them. We beat them
earlier in the year, so you know they're going to come out extremely hard.  
And we're going to be prepared for that. But we'll get ready for Ohio State
today.  
  
Q. How do you guys ‑‑ obviously you guys played in November straight games,
so how well prepared are you for these straight two games?  
COURTNEY BOYLAN: We played‑‑ you mean, just for the tournament style?  
  
Q. Yes.  
COURTNEY BOYLAN: We played a tournament over Thanksgiving, Paradise Jam, three
games over three days. We had a lot of success there, so I think we can do the
same thing here.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Going back to the one game at a time, but after last year, how large was
it just to get this one out of the way?  
COACH BORSETH: You know what, last year we beat Illinois twice during the
year. We beat them the last game of the year and then turned around three days
later and played them again. And they played extremely well, with a lot of
confidence when the game started.  
And to get this one under your belt is good. And I thought our kids were ready
for that. I don't know if it was in the back of their mind, but it's there. In
fact, Illinois has played so well in this tournament, the last two years, you
know that looms on you as well.  
So I thought our kids focused on us. That was the biggest thing. We didn't
ever talk about that. We just focused on us.  
  
Q. I know that you don't like to talk about the refs, but you and ‑‑ both
coaches seemed to be‑‑ you know, like foul calls?  
COACH BORSETH: Everybody wants more. As coaches we're never happy. I don't
think any coach really sits down and tells you he's happy with everything.
We're trying to do everything to help our team win. Our officials in this
league are extremely‑‑ they're confident. They're good. Their integrity is
high. Everything about our conference officials is very good.  
You go back during the course of the game, you think it's a foul. You go look
at the videotape, and it wasn't. You thought it was a travel, you go back to
the videotape, and it wasn't.  
As a coach, you're trying to find everything during the course of the game to
help you. You're also trying to help and remind them. But they do a fantastic
job.  
  
Q. Was there a difference in the rebounding effort in the first half and
second? First half they were missing very badly, so they get long rebounds. In
the second half they were getting ‑‑ fighting for rebounds?  
COACH BORSETH: I'll tell you what, you go back on videotapes and you look, and
when you're blocking out a bigger kid who is leaning against you and pushing
underneath, makes a whole lot of difference.  
There's a lot of contact on defense. Karisma Penn is a great athlete. And
Adrienne GodBold. That's where the rebounds came from, those two kids. They
just jumped right over, moved us out of the way, jumped in and grabbed them.  
Very hard to deal with. Kendra Seto came in, inserted Kendra because we felt
she could rebound. Sure enough, Kenny gets in, pulls two rebounds down right
off the bat.  
Always an area of concern. I think it's always an area of concern because Penn
and GodBold, they're good athletes and they've got a nose for the ball.  
  
Q. Kendra and obviously Jenny Ryan, two big defensive players in the second
half, how did they step it up and try to keep Illinois off ‑‑  
COACH BORSETH: Kenny got two rebounds immediately. Immediately Kenny got two
rebounds. Lobbed a couple in late and Jenny knocked it out of their hands.
Those two kids have that ability.  
It's a game of chess in and out offense and defense. I think every coach does
that. We try to utilize that as much as we could.  
  
Q. What does reaching 20 wins mean? Obviously winning one in the
tournament's important, but the number 20?  
COACH BORSETH: That's something you always shoot for. I think that's‑‑ I don't
know that is the number, I don't know that is the magic number, it's not, but
it's a good number. Better than 19. Better than 18 which we had last year. But
the big win, the first win in this tournament for us is just absolutely huge
to put us on the right track. Get our confidence back.  
  
Q. Coach, you've got Ohio State. You've beat them three straight times.
What's the difference? What stands out in those games? What's made the
difference that you've been able to win those three games?  
COACH BORSETH: That was then; this is now. Scouting reports tell them a lot
and tell us a lot, obviously.  
And the second half of that game was a lot closer than met the eye. They
battled right back to within like two or three points and down the stretch we
were able to hit a couple of baskets here and there to secure a win.  
But they're a great team. They're well coached. They've got two players that
are All First‑Team Big Ten. They're a handful for anybody that has to play
them. We have a great deal of respect for them, and we'll have to come with
our best effort in this game.  
  
Q. You seem to methodically feed the post. Did you spot a weakness there
throughout the game?  
COACH BORSETH: No. I don't know. I always felt it was a little easier to get
closer to the basket and shoot it than from the outside. You've got to get
some form of penetration, dribble it in there or pass it in there. Those are
your two choices.  
People play behind you in the post, generally sagged off. They don't give you
much of a choice to dribble in there because they're all packed in the paint.
So you've got to throw it at them.  
So that was the option that they give us. So we just took advantage of that.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Michigan State  97  
Indiana  68

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined now by Michigan State head coach Suzy Merchant as
well as student‑athletes Porsché Poole and Taylor Alton.  
Coach, opening comments.  
COACH MERCHANT: Well, it seemed like the day was never going to end. You're
waiting for that 8:30 mark. It was kind of a long day.  
But I thought our kids really came out focused. I think our second half was
better than our first half, certainly. But I thought we did some really good
things.  
I like we were able to spread the minutes with nobody really playing more than
20minutes. J.T. played 26minutes, but everybody was 20 or less. So that was a
really nice opportunity.  
And I think we were led, again, by at this time of year you really need your
upperclassmen, your seniors, to step up, and these two next to me certainly
did that and set the tone for everybody else to kind of follow suit.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Porsché or Taylor, how does it feel to sort of get a game under your belt
and sort of maybe develop a little bit of a comfort level heading into the
tournament now?  
TAYLOR ALTON: I think this was a good game for us, just coming in. We talked
about it's going to be hard playing four games in four days, but I think for
us it was really good, get on the floor. We were really talking about it like
it's a good chance for us to feel out the floor, get a game under our belt,
like you said, and just kind of get better ourselves so we can, you know,
really make a strong push these last three games, which is our goal, to be
here on Sunday.  
So for us, I think, it was a good opportunity just to kind of warm up a little
bit and obviously make some good things happen.  
  
Q. Did you have any idea this was going to be a 3 ‑point shooting contest
kind of?  
PORSCHÉ POOLE: No, we just took what the defense gave us. Today we happened to
be on. Usually we drive to the basket and try to get shots in the lane, but
today we just happened to be open for 3s, and we hit them.  
THE MODERATOR: Taylor?  
TAYLOR ALTON: It did go a little bit back and forth, so we want to focus on
that for future games, just that we're not trading baskets so much. But the
rims were feeling good tonight.  
  
Q. For both of you, looking ahead to Purdue, it's a team you guys played
recently. How do you guys match up with them? And you guys beat them by a lot
the last time. And they beat you by a lot the first time. So how do you see
it?  
COACH MERCHANT: That was an overtime game.  
  
Q. Still 15points.  
COACH MERCHANT: I don't consider overtime games beating them by a lot.  
PORSCHÉ POOLE: You know, I think Coach put a great plan together,
personnel‑wise, how to guard different players. And, you know, it really has
to start with defense. We have to get out, get stops, try to run. And the last
game, a lot of people stepped up on their playing, played great defense.
That's what we're going to need tomorrow.  
TAYLOR ALTON: We even talked about it in the locker room just now. Our first
meeting obviously was by far the worse game probably in the Big Ten. Then when
we got them at home, it really wasn't our best performance either.  
So, you know, I think we're just going to kind of focus on us, like Porsché
said, work on defense and just do what we can do to kind of stop who we need
to and be successful that way.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.  
Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, you talked about being able to get players, a lot of different
players, minutes. Can you talk specifically about Becca Mills and Jasmine
Hines showing something off the bench as freshmen?  
COACH MERCHANT: Yeah, it was a good start to their Big Ten Tournament, that's
for sure. But I think they were led‑‑ as I mentioned in my opening statement,
I think Lykendra didn't play a lot of minutes, got into some foul trouble. I
thought she was aggressive out of the gate. I thought Porsché and Taylor set
the tone, too.  
I think, as I said, they followed suit. They're talented kids. The thing with
Jasmine Hines, she could do more of that if she makes her free throws, and
today was a good night for her at the free‑throw line. And she's kind of been
suspect there at times, so it was really nice to see her knock down some free
throws. That obviously put her in double‑digit scoring.  
And I thought Becca really gave us some good minutes, too. I mean, she was
really aggressive offensively. I thought she played some solid defense as
well.  
So I thought they both gave us really, really good quality minutes off the
bench as freshmen.  
  
Q. How do you see the way you guys match up against Purdue, obviously a
really tight tough one the last time in overtime you played them?  
COACH MERCHANT: Good correction, Josh. You know, they're really, really
talented. I mean, they're big. They're athletic inside. They can block shots.
Their guard play is as good as anybody in the league.  
I think they're led with a great player in Rayburn, and then you've got Moses
and KK, and I think their depth and their ability to change who they are
offensively and defensively is a challenge.  
I mean, they can put Antionette Howard at the 3, and then the next possession
they can move her to a 4. And they become a little smaller, a little bit
quicker.  
So they can just kind of change with who they're playing. And their depth is
obviously really impressive. And they've got a senior group. They've got five
or six seniors or so that have been here and done that.  
And so it's going to be a tough challenge. They run great stuff. I mean,
Sharon does an amazing job there. I think she's really got them playing well,
and they had a little bump in the road like we all do in the league.  
It's a tough league. But, I mean, the last few games for them, I mean, winning
at Michigan is a tough thing to do, certainly, then turning around and playing
their last game against Indiana, I thought they played extremely well and shot
the ball and got their transition game going.  
So it's going to be a battle for sure. And they're well coached and certainly
battle tested.  
  
Q. Before the game you were asked about getting the win tonight being
critical for your guys' NCAA tournament positioning. But I kind of get the
sense from you that the job isn't done for your team. Could you talk about
that a little bit?  
COACH MERCHANT: Well, I mean, the only way the job's not done for any team
here is to win the whole thing. So that's kind of the goal. I think everybody
wants to take it out of committee's hands.  
But we felt like it was important to win this one. I think you gotta call it
kind of what it is. Indiana struggled a little bit this year. Hasn't been
their best season. And so because of that, a loss here could put you in a
tough position. I feel good about the way the team's performing, 20 wins. Our
RPI is very good. We've got quality wins over Penn State twice, Nebraska,
Purdue.  
So I feel good about our resumé. But it's just you're not in that realm
defending yourself, and we have 11days until that selection show.  
So we're just going to try to do everything we can to put ourselves into
position to be successful.  
  
Q. Lykendra got a lot of rest because of fouls. How crucial is it to keep
her out of foul trouble?  
COACH MERCHANT: Yeah, I talked to her a little bit about that. I said, you
know, it can't be a situation where‑‑ I play you by choice, not because I have
to sit you down.  
So my thing to her is just being a little bit smarter. She's just an
aggressive kid. And I thought she‑‑ it's really too bad she was in foul
trouble, because you could just see she had that kind of look in her eye. I
thought she was making some quality post moves down there and rebounding the
ball and doing some things.  
So hopefully they let a few more things go. But she's got to be a lot smarter.  
  
Q. With so many young players on this team, how big was it for you to have
so many people get in tonight and get into a rhythm and get some game action
here in the tournament?  
COACH MERCHANT: I thought it was big. You look at our guard play. Kiana and
J.T. played the point for us tonight, and they had nine assists between them
and no turnovers. And you throw Ché in there and you're looking at 11, 12
assists and one turnover.  
So I felt like our‑‑ the one thing we talked to J.T. about was, you know,
Kiana has never been here before, as good as she is, making All‑Freshman team
and being a solid staple for us. We didn't anticipate anything but her best
effort and for her to be the player she's been.  
But you just don't know. And J.T., this was her third trip here. This is her
third time around. We talked about as a group we felt like her and A.P. were
going to be extremely critical coming off the bench because they had the
experience and the wherewithal and understanding of what's at stake. You
really hoped Becca and Jas Hines would do what they could and Schiff was going
to give you kind of her mad‑dog minutes, as we call them.  
I guess when I look at it, you know, I felt like it was a quality performance
and we were able to rest some key kids. So that was good.  
  
Q. You were able to limit Indiana, Sinclair to just four points, two in each
half. Can you talk about the game plan and how important it was not let her
get going tonight?  
COACH MERCHANT: That was big. That was the kid we were first and foremost
worried about out of the gates. Kind of ranked them a little bit in order. And
I thought she was the one we needed to do a great job on.  
And you could see when Jasmine went down for them that she had really elevated
her ability to score so much so that Wisconsin went to a box and one against
her. And she's a very talented quick release shooter and a pull‑up jump
shooter. So we felt it really important that we took care of her.  
The two kids that I was frustrated with, our team, a little bit that bothered
me that got away from us were the Goodwin and McCurty kid, Quaneisha, because
those two kids were their X factor kids we felt, and Indiana is a team that
you don't know always who is going to come to play.  
But those two kids can get it going. One has enough in her game that she can‑‑
so I was disappointed in how we defended her in the first half, and same thing
with Quaneisha, because I just felt like they did the things we said they
could do and we just didn't really respond well, so I was disappointed in
those two things.  
But to answer your first part, I really thought we did a good job on Sinclair
and worked extremely hard to limit her touches. And when she did, make sure
they were challenged shots.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

San Diego State  57  
New Mexico  43

  
THE MODERATOR: We're ready to begin with New Mexico.  
Coach, if we can start with you, your remarks on today's game.  
COACH SANCHEZ: Yeah, I want to first congratulate SanDiego State and Coach
Burns and her staff for just a terrific season. They've led from beginning to
end. They did a nice job in the tournament. They did a nice job in the
championship game.  
It took hopefully everything they had to beat us because I know we gave
everything we had. But that's a terrific staff. It's a terrific bunch. They
set the bar high. So that's what we're going to aim for.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Porche, is that a bittersweet situation?  
PORCHE TORRANCE: It was a tough loss. But one thing I will say is our
teammates did come out, we fought till the end of the game, till the buzzer
went off. We made it to the championship. Not a lot of people expected us to
get this far.  
I think I'm proud of my teammates and the coaching staff for this year. Yeah,
it was a tough loss. But, you know, this was an adversity year. We lost, but
it was good to make it to the championship game my senior year.  
  
Q. Porche, how much do you take with you as seniors knowing you were able to
build something here at the end after all the struggles? Do you take a lot of
pride in thinking you might have laid the groundwork for success in the
future?  
PORCHE TORRANCE: Definitely. We haven't been here since my freshman year. So
to know that we started the legacy back up, to know that we are capable of
making it to the championship game, and hopefully the future Lobos coming up,
they can actually get past what we accomplished. So hopefully they can win a
championship next year.  
  
Q. Nikki, you closed it to four in the second half. What were your
thoughts?  
NIKKI NELSON: You know, sometimes you just give it your all and it doesn't
quite work out (tearing up).  
  
Q. Porche, this is your third straight game. How much of a factor was
fatigue today?  
PORCHE TORRANCE: You know, back‑to‑back games, normally we have a few days
off. I was a little tired. But I told myself, This is my last. I have to fight
through the fatigue and just give it all for my teammates and hopefully we
come up on top. We were a little short today but we fought till the end and
that's what really counts.  
  
Q. Lauren, the first couple minutes of the second half, you had the two
three ‑point plays? Did you discuss something at halftime that you thought you
might be able to drive and get those shots off like that?  
LAUREN TAYLOR: We knew we needed to get to the free‑throw line more because
that means we were being the aggressor. We kept saying, Get to the free throw
line, get to the free‑throw line. If the shots aren't falling, that's where
you can get your points. So that was discussed a little bit at halftime.  
  
Q. What did it feel like when you scored those two?  
LAUREN TAYLOR: Awesome, obviously. I felt like we turned the tide and had the
momentum going for us. I think that picked the team up. The fans got behind us
and helped us push back closer, you know, take that lead down.  
  
Q. This has been a tough season for you in a lot of ways, starting with
defections, coaching changes. When you stop and look back on it, is it a
tremendous accomplishment for you? Or was it just an unusual year for all of
you?  
LAUREN TAYLOR: I think we accomplished a lot. I think we showed people that
through every trial we stuck together. There was a core group of us who just
dug in our heels and said, We're not going to give up. Then we built on that.  
I'm immensely proud of the team for sticking with it through everything
because we could have given up. We could have just written this year off, but
we didn't.  
To get to this championship game is a testament to the will of this team.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll dismiss the student‑athletes at this time and continue
with questions for Coach Sanchez.  
  
Q. You only scored four points in the first 13 minutes of the game. What was
going on out there? Why were you struggling so much on the offensive side?  
COACH SANCHEZ: Because SanDiego State is a very good defensive team. You got
to give them credit. They're the No.1 team in our conference. They've been
from beginning to end. They're a great defensive team, both full court and
halfcourt. It's tough to score against them. At our place we only scored 10
points in the first half.  
We know that. We remember that.  
But everything that you get from SanDiego State, you have to earn. Tonight was
no different. They do a nice job. We tried to execute what we could. But their
defense is good.  
  
Q. Have you zoned that much in any game this year?  
COACH SANCHEZ: Not the entire game we had. We mixed it up quite a bit. But,
you know, they're very quick off the dribble. Their penetration even hurt us
in the zone. But we felt that that was the best opportunity that would give us
to win the basketball game. They didn't shoot particularly well from the
three, but they hit threes when they counted in the second half. I think
Harvey hit a big three there when we were cutting the lead.  
I mean, good players and good players make good plays, and SanDiego State did
that. I give them all the credit. That being said, I give my team a lot of
credit. We were led by a great group of seniors. They never gave up. They
could have written the season off. Six other teams thought they should be
here. They watched our team play in the championship game.  
That's the thing I'm most proud of. You know, the champions are SanDiego
State. I give 'em a ton of credit. They're well‑coached. They have a great
staff. But I told our kids to hold their heads high because they have nothing
to be ashamed of. They did a great job, not only these last three games, but
they did a terrific job during the entire season.  
I've seen teams in my tenure that are much more talented than we are just
pretty much hang up the season, and our kids never did that.  
  
Q. Specifically even in this game, down 19 ‑4, you got girls diving all over
the court battling. What kept them going? Is it a sign of their character for
this game?  
COACH SANCHEZ: Absolutely. They have a passion to play for the Lobos. They
wear their uniform proudly. As the fans are very passionate about our players,
our players are passionate about playing for the University of New Mexico.
We've got a great university. We've got terrific leadership in that
university.  
I think it's the best in the country. You don't see the leaders in other
universities do what our leaders do for us; our athletic administration, our
president. So our kids feel proud about playing for all of them. They get
well‑educated. When they put the uniform on, it's a privilege to play for UNM.
They handle it very well. That's why you see them never give up.  
  
Q. The rebounding is one thing. You had 16 turnovers. Was that a particular
problem, something you had trouble with?  
COACH SANCHEZ: Well, we had 24 yesterday, so... We went down a little bit
against a team that pressed us.  
But that's plagued us all year long. Out of those turnovers, they had 15
points off turnovers to our two. Again, you give a team like SanDiego State
opportunities, they're going to take advantage of it 'cause they're that good.
They do a nice job. They've done a nice job the entire year. But you can't
give a team like that second and third chances because they will take
advantage of it.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much, coach.  
COACH SANCHEZ: Thank you, guys.

_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

San Diego State  57  
New Mexico  43

  
THE MODERATOR: We're ready to start with SanDiego State.  
Coach, if we start with you, your remarks on today's game.  
COACH BURNS: Well, first would like to congratulate New Mexico on just a
fantastic run. I can't credit their coaching staff and their athletes enough.
They have a lot of older athletes on their team, juniors and seniors, who this
was it. It's kind of tough to have a struggle of a season. We've all been
there. But to rally and come here.  
I tip my cap to the people of New Mexico who really, really support their team
and give them a lot of juice. I've seen every minute of the two games prior to
this one and they were really impressive. Just would like to congratulate them
on the run that they made.  
As for us, couldn't be more excited. I think we may have skipped a step, if
you will. I knew we had a talented young group. But the key was young, and our
inside game beyond Kalena Tutt was such a question mark. We just weren't
really sure how fast everything would get put together. I think it's a tribute
to the older players on our team, the commitment they made, and the younger
players on our team listening to the older players because they did I guess
what you're supposed to do, which is get better and better and better as the
season went on.  
Now we have the grandest prize one can get in March, which is an opportunity
to go play in the 64 next week.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll now take questions for our student‑athletes.  
  
Q. I imagine it must have been frustrating when nothing seemed to fall in
the first half.  
COURTNEY CLEMENTS: Yeah, it was. But I think we came out so strong, all the
adrenaline went away, we weren't as focused as we usually are. It was a little
bit frustrating. We knew we were going to bounce back. Halftime we kind of
refocused and we came out strong in the second half.  
KALENA TUTT: I know with the first half how some of our shots weren't falling,
we can always depend on our defense. That's one thing we can control, is to
stop another team from scoring.  
CHELSEA HOPKINS: Yeah, copy that (smiling).  
  
Q. Getting off to a good start is always the game plan going in. When you
got to that point, how crucial was it in a game like this?  
CHELSEA HOPKINS: I think the start we had was really critical in how the game
played out. We came out really confident, really strong. Like they said, we
kind of took our foot off the gas a little bit. For the most part since we
were in the lead, if the game were to end, we were to win. I felt like we had
a little bit of a cushion and that led to us refocusing in the second half and
coming out even stronger.  
But for the most part we had the lead. I felt like we had control most of the
game. They made a great run and they did rally, but at the same time we were
able to answer it and maintain the lead and get the win.  
  
Q. Chelsea, you had a strong tournament. What do you attribute to the strong
three games you had?  
CHELSEA HOPKINS: Honestly, I attribute everything to my teammates. Everybody
likes to talk about my assist‑to‑turnover ratio. I'm doing whatever it takes
to make this team win. I pass the ball, Courtney makes the shots, KT makes the
shots. I know having my teammates back me, counting on me to lead, help this
team rally, is really what was my motivation for the tournament and the
success that we had.  
  
Q. There was a time this year when you struggled a bit. What does it feel
like now to know you're going to the tournament?  
CHELSEA HOPKINS: It feels amazing. From day one we set goals for ourselves. We
knew we wanted to win 20 games, win the conference tournament outright and
obviously get a NCAA bid. We feel confident and blessed to be in the position
we are in. We don't want to stop here. This is the start of a new season.
We'll celebrate this victory but then we'll lock in and refocus to see where
we end up Monday.  
  
Q. Courtney, when you got going in October, could you see this coming?  
COURTNEY CLEMENTS: Oh, yeah. Right away I could tell that our freshmen were
very talented. Even though they're young and inexperienced, they have so much
energy. They bring that energy every single day. It just spreads to us.
Sometimes being older you get bored. You've been doing the same thing for
three years, four years. Our freshmen do a good job of coming in every day
energetic, ready to learn. I knew we were talented and it was going to be a
special team.  
  
Q. Chelsea, could you talk about how special it was to win it here in Las
Vegas where you grew up.  
CHELSEA HOPKINS: It's the best feeling in the world. Like I said previously,
when I made the decision to come to SanDiego State, I just wanted to be
involved with my family and friends. I wanted them to have the opportunity to
see me play and to see me do what I love.  
So just to be out here, I just feel really blessed and fortunate that all my
family came out. The crowd support we had for the entire team was amazing. We
had a lot of people that had been supportive all season, that made the trip
all the way from SanDiego to come down to be with us. Really excited, really
grateful and happy we performed and got the W.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll dismiss the student‑athletes at this time and continue
with questions for Coach Burns.  
  
Q. ESPN Bracketology has you as a 14 seed. Do you think that's right or you
deserve better?  
COACH BURNS: The key phrase is they have us as 'a seed'. You see SanDiego
State. That's the first step.  
Early on, I thought for us to do what we did this year would be skipping a
step, but I also knew it was a transitional year in the conference. We had
some people leaving, we had some people coming in. Most importantly we all had
a ton of seniors a year ago.  
So it was more kind of a, Why not us? We're all going to do bonehead things,
we all can maybe do some good things. We knew the kind of recruiting class we
had brought in to be able to do that.  
With that said, I think because we all had really young, inexperienced teams,
it's like two different seasons. When you look at the non‑conference records
of all our Mountain West teams, if they played those people now. Because
everybody was playing with people in different roles. Other than Vegas,
everybody was a brand‑new group of players. I think that's why their
non‑conference record, we're way out here in the west, once you mess up early,
it's hard to get it back.  
I felt ourselves with our DePaul win, and Vegas with a couple
out‑of‑conference wins gave us some credibility. But if night after night
you're playing somebody that potentially is a low RPI, that's going to affect
you.  
We'll have most everybody back. We'll beef up next year. We're too young this
year to do that. We'll do the best we can to balance that going forward.  
Am I disappointed in that? Not at all. There's a lot of really good teams out
there.  
  
Q. Obviously your bench played a pretty big role in this tournament. Talk
about the progression of that group.  
COACH BURNS: Well, I think that's the whole difference. Well, two differences.
One is we have the best point guard in the conference, one of the best point
guards eventually I think anywhere around.  
The second part of that is I'm not afraid. You'll see, our stats are
misleading. It depends on what we're playing. If we're playing a game like
tonight, Ahjalee Harvey is going to play 20 minutes. Or play a game like big,
strong Wyoming yesterday, then Melissa Sweat is going to get 20 minutes or
Amarikwa.  
That's what has been so good about this team. They don't have green‑eyed
monsters. Everybody knows the sum of our parts help us to win. To me, that's
why we won the league, because we could have a bad night, somebody getting
sick, on and on, somebody always picked somebody up.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the dominance on the rebounding category, especially
the offensive rebounds.  
COACH BURNS: For us, this isn't very good. We've kind of tailed the last two
or three games. Not necessarily our starting group, but our young guys off the
bench can really get to the rim. Ofttimes their own shots are what they're
going to get off the rim, but they do go up.  
I don't know if I ever had a game where somebody didn't have an offensive
rebound at halftime. Yesterday they had a couple offensive rebounds at the
half. We run if we control the defensive glass. As you saw in our halfcourt,
we like to run. That was kind of a point of emphasis coming in. Really proud
how we kept them off the glass and enabled us to get out and get such a great
start. I thought that was a huge key to the first half.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much, coach.  
COACH BURNS: Final comments. The Aztecs are here to get two championships.
Just wanted to put that on record to get two. Don't leave, fellas. Get back
out there. Got more work to do.

_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

San Diego State  73  
Wyoming  55

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined now by Wyoming.  
Coach, if we can start with you, your comments on today's game.  
COACH LEGERSKI: We talk all the time about being able to play 40 minutes. And
I thought the first half was a tremendous basketball game, up and down, both
teams scoring, rebounding. We were making some free throws.  
And then in the second half, SanDiego State stepped it up to a different
level, specifically with Hopkins. We could not get her slowed down in
transition. That became an issue for us.  
Then we missed a few free throws. You could just see the drain of a season
starting to wear on this group.  
But I'm so proud that they ended up turning things around in January from what
we were doing in November and December, and played tonight just a tremendous
effort by a young team that I'm very proud of.  
THE MODERATOR: Now we'll take questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Chaundra, 50 points in the paint from them tonight. How tough of a team
are they to defend?  
CHAUNDRA SEWELL: They're really tough. They have really quick post players,
strong girls. Just a diverse group of inside players. Kind of have to be ready
for anything when you're playing inside with them.  
  
Q. Chaundra, you were in a lot of foul trouble tonight. How hard was it to
defend them 'cause they're good players but also because of foul trouble you
were in?  
CHAUNDRA SEWELL: Yeah, that makes it tough. You have to watch your fouls and
be very careful in that situation. With how physical they are inside, it made
it that much more difficult to defend them.  
  
Q. Ashley, coach talked about after the first five minutes in the second
half, you were right there, then they made that run. How much did that hurt
you guys?  
ASHLEY SICKLES: We talked. Teams are going to make runs. You have to go out
and make a run yourself. We tried hard but we weren't able to get the run we
needed to go ahead and keep winning.  
I think our team went out, we did extremely well. We've done a lot better than
people anticipated at the beginning of the season. I think our team did
awesome.  
We're all coming back next season and looking for a good season then.  
  
Q. You all do come back next year. Winning a game here and experiencing
that, knowing what it's like, seeing the type of play that goes on, what is
that going to do for you towards next season?  
ASHLEY SICKLES: I think it just gets us motivated. We have to really work hard
in the post‑season, you know, on the court and off the court, and just come
out next year with a fire, come out knowing that we're going to take it to
every team that we play and produce as many wins as we can.  
  
Q. Kayla, can you reflect on this season a little bit, particularly the last
two and a half months, where this team has kind of come.  
KAYLA WOODWARD: Like Ashley said, a lot of people weren't expecting us to be
very good this year. They thought it was just going to be, you know, kind of
just working on, like since we're younger.  
I don't know, I think we set the bar high for years to come. I think we need
to go out next year and prove people wrong next year.  
  
Q. Chaundra, getting a tournament victory here, playing this team tough for
25 minutes, do you think that will carry over into the off ‑season?  
CHAUNDRA SEWELL: Yeah, I think what we've done here at the tournament, what
we've done all season, is really going to motivate us, get us excited for the
years to come. We're all very excited for what the future holds for this
program.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. We'll dismiss the student‑athletes at this
time and continue with questions for Coach Legerski.  
  
Q. Chaundra said a diverse group of post players. What makes them so
effective down there in the block?  
COACH LEGERSKI: I look at it a little differently. I think their point guard
was able to get to the basket. When Hopkins is able to get to the basket, you
end up rotating and trying to take her away. She is such a tremendous passer,
has great court vision. So all of a sudden she's able to find players that are
within two, three feet of the basket.  
You know, it makes it very difficult because you have to give help, but then
when you provide help, she could also find the open person. So that became a
bigger issue.  
So I see the points in the paint, but so much of that I look at is because a
point guard is creating all that rather than just, say, we couldn't handle
somebody at the block.  
  
Q. You mentioned Hopkins. Did she just step it into another gear? What did
she do different where she was able to take over there?  
COACH LEGERSKI: I'm an older man. I remember driving that standard. Most of us
go from first to second, maybe to third before we get up in speed. Hopkins
goes from second to fifth. She can move in a hurry, make a lot of things
happen. That is really where it was at.  
And we did not have an answer. And then you have Clements running the other
side who can score in a number of ways, putting it on the floor, shooting the
ball from three. Her midrange game is very good. That puts so much pressure on
everybody individually defensively, and that's not what we do best.  
We have to be able to rotate. We have to be able to help. SanDiego State was
just very good today. I give Coach Burns credit. She has 'em playing at a very
high level and they really came out in the second half. Like I said, they
jumped a couple gears.  
  
Q. How much did you think those free throws hurt?  
COACH LEGERSKI: When you take a look at it, we shoot 36% in the first half,
they shoot 58%, the free‑throw line was a big benefit. We were 8 of 10. That
became a big part of it. All of a sudden you start missing the front end of a
one‑on‑one, you start missing two shots, we go to 50%.  
Not the difference in a basketball game, but maybe the difference in keeping
the game, maybe breaking a run, giving you some hope. Free throws missed are
very difficult. You could see it in the expression of the players. They know
they're missed opportunities.  
  
Q. It's tough right after a game, but just reflect on what this group
accomplished, particularly after the New Year's.  
COACH LEGERSKI: I told them in the locker room I couldn't be more proud of a
group. I remember our last non‑conference game, we end up going out to Eastern
Michigan, a very talented team, and we got beat really good. They had to make
a decision of what they wanted to do as a group.  
I kept working with 'em, pushing 'em. They responded. For this team to be able
to come out here and win a game in the Mountain West tournament, I couldn't be
more proud of 'em to be able to get to this point.  
It's very difficult. They're going to find this out next year. This just
didn't happen. You have to put so much work in to even find a way to get a
victory out here. This league was very good, very evenly matched.  
When I reflect back, and I'll do that over the next couple weeks, I'll be very
proud of the effort I was able to get. We were so undersized most of the year.
Brenna Freeze steps up, has to play on the inside at 5'10", starting three
freshmen. I'm pleased with where they're at. We have a great deal of work to
do.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much, coach.  
COACH LEGERSKI: Thank you, everybody. I appreciate it very much.

_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

New Mexico  51  
Boise State  50

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Boise State.  
Coach, if we could start with you, your comments on today's game.  
COACH PRESNELL: Disappointing. First half I thought they controlled the pace
and the tempo of the game. They run a real slow pace and we're a real physical
pace. We tried to speed it up a little bit in the second half. Thought we did
that, got ourselves back in the game.  
So just didn't go our way in the last minute or so, I guess.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll open it up for questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Did you feel like you had the same energy that you had the other night
coming out or did you feel a little flat at the beginning of the game?  
KATI ISHAM: I mean, I think everybody could tell we were a little flat at the
beginning of the game. But I'm really proud of my teammates for coming back in
the second half. I thought we played hard. We made a game of it. That's what
we wanted to do.  
LAUREN LENHARDT: I'd agree with Kati. We didn't come out like we had hoped.
But battled back in the second half. That slow start, we've had a couple of
those this season. We just can't afford to do that.  
  
Q. Lauren, Porche, defensive Player of the Year, outstanding game. How much
did they adjust what you were able to do inside?  
LAUREN LENHARDT: Torrance is a great player. Very physical. She's fast. She
can get around in the block very well. Great rebounder.  
She affected us a little bit just getting in the boards. We didn't get to box
her out and lost a few O boards that we needed to have.  
  
Q. Take me through the final play, what was called.  
KATI ISHAM: Well, the original play was set up for Keiahnna to come off that
screen. She's one of our main drivers, gets to the rim really well. She went,
they helped out. Tried to dish off to Lauren. It was kind of a scramble.  
I ended up with the ball in my hands, which is what I wanted. I wanted to take
the last shot. It just didn't go in.  
  
Q. Lauren, talk a little bit about obviously you came in, first year at the
Mountain West, as the No.6 seed, won a game, one shot away from going to the
championship. What did you learn and take away from this experience?  
LAUREN LENHARDT: I mean, we took a lot. The Mountain West has been a great
conference. We've loved being here. Our whole motivation for the whole season
has been that dead last. At the beginning they picked us eighth. We were going
to make sure we didn't finish eighth in the conference or the tournament.  
But it's definitely different than the WAC and we'll be ready next year.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll dismiss the student‑athletes at this time. We'll continue
with questions for Coach Presnell.  
  
Q. I know the start you were obviously flat, but you were able to get out of
that. How did you get some energy back in your players?  
COACH PRESNELL: I hate to use the word 'shellshocked' a little bit, but just
crowd. Because we competed very well with New Mexico. But they came out with a
lot of enthusiasm, kind of got us on our heels a little bit. So the only thing
we could do at halftime being down, not scoring, is try to speed the game up,
speed the pace up.  
One of their deficiencies is their skill level in terms of ball handling. We
tried to attack 'em in the full court a little bit and tried to speed the game
up a little bit.  
  
Q. Your assessment of the final play. It broke down a little bit. Were you
happy with the look you got?  
COACH PRESNELL: You know, I'll think about it now for the next spring or
something. When you're down one, I think you attack the basket. But I don't
know if I'd attack the basket again. I'd have to see the film to see if we got
hit or not.  
The play is called cross key, it's for Keiahnna. She gets penetration because
she goes left so well. Then Lauren back‑doors her player.  
So I think we kind of got what we were wanting to get. I just need to see the
film. I can't make anymore comments on it. But I hope it was right.  
  
Q. You referred a little bit about the crowd. How much did that affect you?
Was that the most vocal crowd you have played in front of all season?  
COACH PRESNELL: Yeah, I guess so. We played them down at the Pit. We were
ahead so far all the time that it kind of neutralized the crowd. This time
they have improved. Tribute to their head coach. They've improved. They're
long, and their length bothered us. I've never heard of 12 blocked shots,
whatever it was. I need to take a look at the film and see if those are
blocks.  
I think she's done a nice job with them. She's getting better. Their length
bothered us. I know they're not a tall team, but they're tall in places that
we're not.  
  
Q. Overall on the season, no expectations, picked last, you're one shot away
from the championship. Talk about the year as a whole and how it finished
up.  
COACH PRESNELL: You know, I think looking back it was a positive. It's
disappointing we were one point away from making this jump and having at least
a minimum of a .500 season. That was really disappointing.  
I'm proud of the seniors, proud of the effort they played with today. I think
it's a conference that we can compete in. We were in every game, other than
Wyoming drilled us.  
Hopefully, you know, things are brighter on the horizon.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much, coach.

_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

New Mexico  51  
Boise State  50

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by New Mexico.  
Coach, if we could start with you, just your remarks on today's game.  
COACH SANCHEZ: Again, I'd like to congratulate Boise State. What a terrific
game. It was a 7, 6 seed, winner take all. They're a formidable opponent,
terrific bunch, very well‑coached. Coach Presnell does a terrific job. He's a
terrific coach. I'd really like to congratulate them, their seniors, on a very
good year.  
Again, that being said, our kids were warriors tonight. They gave it
everything they had. They knew they were a little bit away from the
championship game. We still said it's a three‑game series. Wednesday was a
good game. Today they gave it everything they had. We're going to get a lot of
sleep and just see what happens tomorrow.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll open it up for questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Caroline, if you look at this team, you're the first 7 seed to get to the
championship ever in the history of this tournament. Can you have ever
imagined getting to the final considering everything you went through during
the season?  
CAROLINE DURBIN: You know, we have been through a lot this season. But I think
we started peaking at the right time, right towards the end of the year. We
got some key players back for this tournament.  
I'm not surprised at all. This team works hard all the time. We've really come
together and had some really good chemistry lately.  
  
Q. Porche, describe that last sequence. I thought you deflected a pass first
before the blocked shot. Was that right? Did it seem like about four and a
half hours' worth of play?  
PORCHE TORRANCE: I don't know. It just happened so fast. I don't know.
Somebody drove to the basket, then I just pushed it out, tapped it out. I
think No.24 got it. Jourdan was guarding her. I was thinking in my head, box
out, box out. The ball went up. It happened so fast, I couldn't even tell you
(laughter).  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
PORCHE TORRANCE: My adrenaline was so high. I either got to box out or try to
get a stop, whatever I could do to help my team.  
  
Q. Porche, you had 10 quick points there. What was going on?  
PORCHE TORRANCE: I just told myself that this is my opportunity. Either I win,
I keep playing; or I lose, and my season is over with. I just told myself to
go out there and play my hardest, do whatever it takes for us to be
successful.  
  
Q. Caroline, you held Boise State to 6 of 30 in the first half. How were you
so successful against their offense?  
CAROLINE DURBIN: Well, our assistant coaches and head coach put together a
great game plan, and we followed it very well. Everyone was playing together,
talking. Our help defense was there in the first half, for sure.  
  
Q. Obviously Boise State wanted a full ‑court game in the second half. It
seemed to cause problems. What makes them so tough to play against when they
go full court?  
CAROLINE DURBIN: They're very good in transition. They have some shooters that
will spot up, so you have to get out to them, but also you can't leave the
paint open. Lenhardt had a great game today. They're a dangerous team in
transition.  
I think we did an overall job, though, of stopping them in transition today.  
  
Q. Caroline, the crowd out there, does it amaze you how faithful the
following is? Is it like a home game when you are playing there?  
CAROLINE DURBIN: It's really incredible. It did feel like a home game. Even
better than a home game, since we're not at the Pit. It was so loud. It's just
incredible, an incredible feeling. We really thank the fans for coming out and
supporting us so much.  
  
Q. As far as tomorrow's game, you have to feel like that same feeling is
going to be there plus some. You're supposed to be home by now, people said.
Are you feeling right at home?  
PORCHE TORRANCE: Yes, we do. We got to go out there, play our hardest, leave
it all out there on the court. It's anybody's game. Going into the tournament,
everybody started at zero. It's the team that shows up to play.  
Our fans, we feed off that. The gym got louder and louder. The momentum from
their energy, we just fed off that. Things just started to go our way toward
the end.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll dismiss the student‑athletes at this time and take
questions for Coach Sanchez.  
  
Q. After all the frustrations all year, you've never made any excuses. Five
players leave last year. You get injuries. You just kept plugging. How does it
feel right now for you to be going to the title game?  
COACH SANCHEZ: It's absolutely incredible. There have been a lot of
challenges, I will say. I told these kids at the beginning, regardless of what
the case is, for my first year as a head coach, I don't want any other team
but them. They have incredible team chemistry. They are terrific to work with.  
My staff is unbelievable. They've worked so hard to develop players throughout
the year. Coach Turner and Coach Hall get the post, Coach Grant gets the
guards. You see the progression of those guys from then till now. I credit my
staff for that because they're absolutely incredible at developing players and
putting together game plans.  
Their scouting reports are terrific. The players just really fed off the
staff. Not one of them made excuses. Not one of them ever were difficult to
coach. They just wanted to win and play for each other. I think that was the
most important.  
  
Q. You held them to 17 points in the first half. What happened in the
beginning the second half?  
COACH SANCHEZ: I don't know (laughter). We wanted to start off, we were up 12,
and we wanted to start off‑‑ you know, you run the game in those four‑minute
segments because that's when the media timeouts are. We told ourselves in the
locker room, The first four minutes, you have to start out hard. You're up 12,
quick start those first four minutes, don't look back.  
The only problem is Boise State came out a little bit harder than we did. They
hit some shots. We had two straight turnovers. I called a timeout. We had to
hold on.  
But I credit Boise State. They came in there full‑court press, they wanted to
make it a full‑court game. They did a nice job with it and we just held on at
the end.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Nikki Nelson.  
COACH SANCHEZ: Well, we'll forgive her for the 10 turnovers for the big three.
She had an incredible game Wednesday. She didn't have a great shooting night,
but we kept running sets that they run in practice every single day, and they
do breakdowns so they can get shots off of.  
Nikki is a senior and she's a captain. She hit the one when we needed to hit.
We were up two, she hits a three. Actually tied, hit a three. We get a stop,
go back, we're up five. That was a huge shot.  
I credit Nikki because players sometimes will get theirselves out of a game.
If they haven't played well, they'll put their heads down, go through the
motions. That kid stayed positive. The kids and coaching staff kept her
positive. When you have that one opportunity and you hit it, that's all you
need, and that's what she did.  
  
Q. Porche Torrance seems to be at a point where she's ready to throw this
team on her back and take you home. Another double ‑double. Where is she?   
COACH SANCHEZ: She's playing at a level that I think she doesn't even know she
has. Porche just has that determination. She had the last half of conference,
because we've run a lot of sets towards her. She has that confidence right now
that, you're right, she's ready to take the team on her back.  
Some people are enjoying the ride. Caroline helped her today. Wednesday night
we had two other people besides those two in double figures. If she can get
some help, then she can carry this team.  
Who knows what can happen tomorrow. But Porche's a senior, she's a captain,
she's led this team all year long. She's an incredible kid. She's a fifth‑year
kid because she had an ACL tear.  
I know she doesn't want to be done. Those kids leave it all out on the court.
That's what I told them, If you leave it all out on the court, give everything
you have, I can live with the results. They've done that. You know, we'll see
what happens tomorrow.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.  
COACH SANCHEZ: Thanks, guys.

_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

San Diego State  73  
Wyoming  55

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by SanDiego State.  
Coach, if we can start with you, your remarks on today's game.  
COACH BURNS: First I'd like to congratulate Wyoming, the position they had
themselves in in the semifinal game. Tell you what I shared with our team was
these are the things we did first game against Wyoming, second game against
Wyoming, these were the results. These are the things they did.  
Now, they lost twice. They did two different things. So what are we going to
expect different? We don't know. We have to prepare for that.  
I think I figured it out it was going to the offensive boards. I deduced that
at about five minutes in that Joe decided, Well, we're going to struggle in
transition, so we're sending five people to the offensive glass. I think they
caught us. That made a huge difference in the first half.  
Their strength, their speed to rotate to the backside and push us out a little
bit, combined with a lot of free‑throw shooting, was the difference. At
halftime, you know, we discussed I felt we were winning every other phase of
the game. If we could control the defensive glass, then we do what our team
likes to do best, which is get out and run and not listen to me call a play.  
If we control the glass, we have an opportunity to do that. I thought we did a
terrific job in the second half of adjusting. I also think we have a lot of
good teams in our league. Everybody has good players. But I think, if not the
most, we at least are one of the deepest teams in the league. And our bench
saved us in the first half. They came off the bench, and everybody contributed
in some way.  
I think it's hard when you have a young group for everybody to understand how
valuable those two minutes are. I think the difference is what we were able to
do off the bench in the first half, straighten things out, then go forward in
the second half.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll now take questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Chelsea, can you talk about your performance today. You seemed to have
good control of the offense. On defense you were making plays.  
CHELSEA HOPKINS: Honestly, I was just trying to do whatever it takes to win. I
wanted to be aggressive. I wanted to limit my turnovers. I had six I think
last game. I was definitely trying to be more conscious of what I was doing
with the ball.  
For the most part our game plan was to attack them off of ball screens. I knew
that when I got the opportunity, I needed to be aggressive and I needed to
create opportunities for Courtney and Kalena. That's basically what I did.  
  
Q. Courtney, you talked about the motivation you had coming out of that
Colorado State loss. Where is the motivation right now because the approach
seems pretty businesslike for you guys?  
COURTNEY CLEMENTS: You know, the motivation for us right now is that we want
to go to the NCAA tournament. We're very well‑aware of the fact that even
though we won our conference, there's a possibility we could still not get
into the NCAA tournament.  
If it means that we have to win the championship to get to the NCAA
tournament, that's what we're going to do. That's our main focus right now.  
  
Q. Kalena, can you talk about your performance today. How does it feel to be
back in the championship game?  
KALENA TUTT: Five for five shooting, that's something I'd like to continue
because it's very rare that I score (laughter).  
To be back in the championship means a lot. Last year we had a fluke kind of a
season. I knew we didn't deserve‑‑ it's not our team chemistry to lose in the
first round. So to come back to a championship where SanDiego State belongs is
pretty good.  
  
Q. Chelsea, you really pushed the tempo in the second half. That seemed to
get everybody going on the floor. With that said, you played in front of
family and friends here. How big of an impact was that today?  
CHELSEA HOPKINS: Honestly, it's the best feeling in the world. When I made the
decision to transfer to SanDiego State, I knew I wanted to play in front of my
family and friends. I feel blessed I had so much crowd support from my family
and everybody that showed up to support the entire team. It feel goods to have
the loyal fans that drove all the way from SanDiego to come and back us. We
knew we wanted to get the win for them, for the program. So we're just really
excited.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll dismiss the student‑athletes at this time and continue
with questions for Coach Burns.  
  
Q. Wyoming was talking about in the second half Chelsea's penetration. Can
you talk about that, how that opened things up?  
COACH BURNS: Well, we really had talked about everybody takes a different
approach. Chelsea off the bounce, whether you know it's coming or not, there's
certain things in basketball you can prepare for and do a walk‑through, say,
We're going to do this, we're going to do that. But to get in a stance, to
stop her when her motor's running is really difficult. The best thing about it
is how she shares the ball ‑ sometimes to a fault.  
What I really had her focus on was, I want your first one to be to the cup,
take it to the cup, then see how are they going to adjust. Are they going to
leave Courtney? Are they going to step up? Sometimes she's so like all good
point guards, get everybody involved and do the right thing. I felt for this
team, for what we were facing, for her to just guns blazing, take it hard.
Then, like she said, ball screens, do different things, opens it up for
everybody else. You have to have a help defender to stop her.  
I thought she did a terrific job.  
  
Q. I know coaches don't like to compare players of past years. Where does
she stand among the players you've had? What kind of leap has she made?  
COACH BURNS: All of those players have won championships, so ask me tomorrow.  
That's a good answer, huh (smiling)?  
  
Q. Can you draw any ties between this group and the 2009 group?  
COACH BURNS: No, because the difference in age. They're all new, but the
difference of the maturity of a Chelsea Hopkins coming in. I told Q, I say
this lovingly, Q has been texting me, Janay has been texting me, Paris has
been texting me. Q as a freshman was the best player for both teams. I just
hoped it was more for our team than their team.  
Chelsea came in with such experience that the enthusiasm and the talent level
of the freshmen, even though they don't really understand what all this is
about, when someone at that position can be that experienced, it's made a
world of difference.  
But this team is really different from the Q, Janay, Coco. They're really
different. They're younger. They're more excited. They're more enthusiastic.
Maybe a little bit less businesslike. They don't love it any less. Those guys
certainly were passionate about it.  
This team, really to a player, is really one big happy group. Maybe that's
because we've won a lot of games. But I think it's because we've had pretty
good older leadership to involve everybody. We don't have somebody in there
feeling left out. Everybody feels a part of it. I think that's been important.  
Thank you, everybody.

_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

New Mexico  61  
UNLV  58

  
THE MODERATOR: We're ready to begin with UNLV.  
Coach, if we could start with some remarks on tonight's game.  
COACH OLIVIER: Well, I mean, first of all I'd like to say I'm really, really
proud of the Lady Rebels. I just think that we've done some amazing things
this year with 22 wins. These two young ladies up here with me have literally
changed the face of our program, along with the other seniors, and along with
Mia Bell. So that's my first thing.  
Today's game, I just thought New Mexico, they did a good job. They hit their
threes. They shot a very high percentage from three‑point land. We had a
drought in that second half when we were up by nine. That's when they kind of
got hot. When that happens, you just get in trouble.  
The thing we rely on the most is our defense. When they start hitting their
threes, it got a little scary there. We didn't execute well down the stretch;
they did. That was pretty much the ballgame.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll now take questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Kelli, just wonder, when you hit that long three to give you a nine
‑point lead, you had your chances at that point. Talk about what happened from
there.   
KELLI THOMPSON: It was a good momentum swing. We were up nine. We were feeling
good. They came back and hit two back‑to‑back threes.  
I feel like at that time we kind of let down a little bit, which we don't
usually do. But I picked it up and they picked it up. There's not much you can
do.  
  
Q. Kelli, I know it might be hard to look at the big picture today with the
loss. But 22 wins, the strides you have made. What worked for you this year?
What was the key to the good improvement?  
KELLI THOMPSON: Sticking together, staying together. We worked hard all
summer. We worked hard all pre‑season. We worked hard all season. It didn't
fall the way we wanted it to. I wouldn't want to be anywhere else. I wouldn't
want to play with any other girls. We stick together. We win together. We lose
together. Like I said, it's not how we wanted it to end.  
This season from last season, a totally different ballgame, totally different
team. We play together. Our chemistry is that much better. We didn't finish
how we wanted to. I feel like we kind of sold ourselves short. But, like I
said, I wouldn't play for any other team.  
  
Q. Can you talk about at the end when you had that look to tie it?  
KELLI THOMPSON: I was praying it would go down. It didn't go my way. Like I
said, we lost, and that's that. It was my shot. It was missed free throws or
whatever the case may be. We fell short. It wasn't just on my part. Like I
said, we lose as a team, we win as a team.  
I had a good look, I put everything into it, it just didn't fall.  
  
Q. How surprised were you guys?  
KELLI THOMPSON: Not surprised. More upset. It's tournament time. It's
anybody's game.  
So I wouldn't say we're surprised. We're upset. I feel like this isn't how we
wanted to end our season, not for the seniors. Like I said, the seniors led us
the whole way.  
I wouldn't say so much surprised but more upset.  
  
Q. Sandrine, talk about the progress of the team from when you first got
here to where you are now.  
SANDRINE NZEUKOU: I mean, we've really come leaps and bounds. One thing about
our team is that every single year we truly did progress. New girls came in
and everyone had a good attitude. This year, we all knew we had it in us. We
had this same sort of outlook last year when we knew we could make ‑‑ and
really like do damage.  
But, I mean, this year, finally everything fell into place for us and
everything came together. So it's unfortunate for us to have to end the season
like this certainly.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll dismiss the student‑athletes at this time. We'll open it
up for questions for coach.  
  
Q. When you had the nine ‑point lead, you had your chances at that point.   
COACH OLIVIER: Yeah, I mean, Kelli made a good point. I thought Kelli hit that
big three. We had momentum at that time. Again, it's tournament time. Anything
can go. They just came back and they hit, I want to say, two back‑to‑back
threes. It kind of took the wind out of our sail a little bit.  
That's never been something that's been a problem for us in the past. Like
we're a team that we, like Kelli said, we stick together. Something happens
like that, we usually, you know, say enough is enough, let's get a stop. We
just didn't close out hard enough on their three‑point shooters. They got some
looks. They're a team that if you give them some looks, they're going to make
their shots.  
  
Q. How surprising and disappointing is this loss?  
COACH OLIVIER: It's very disappointing, to be quite honest with you. In the
locker room, it was hard. I mean, this is a great group. Four seniors that
have given their guts. I loved his question about changing the face of the
program.  
The four seniors and Mia Bell and Kelli, because they played every game since
they've been a Lady Rebel, they have changed the face of this program.  
You're in that locker room, and they're very, very upset. Last year was
different. It was like, Okay, it's over, let's start building for next year.
This team talked about post‑season play. They talked about it from day one.
Hopefully the NIT won't overlook us. We have 22 wins. We had some great wins
early, beat Iowa at Iowa, beat K State at home. Those are big‑time BCS
conferences.  
Everyone is giving their guts. The team is giving their guts. My staff has
worked endless hours. We literally, this group, has changed the face of the
Lady Rebels and we're super proud of that.  
  
Q. When they went on the 16 ‑3 run to end the game, what would you have
liked to have seen differently on defense from the girls?  
COACH OLIVIER: Again, defensively we're very good. We have a great philosophy.
Coach Collier does a great job of teaching the defense. They all know it. They
believe in it. They work together. That's a big part of defense, working
together.  
The 16‑3 run was very uncharacteristic of what has gone on this year. Either
we'll answer and we turn the ball over in that little time or we'll say enough
is enough, like I say, and get stops.  
That's what we've done all year. We've gotten some huge stops. During that
stretch we didn't. They hit some big shots. She got some good looks and hit
some good shots. They were long bombs. They made 'em, so...  
I thought the crowd was great. I mean, this tournament I think is amazing.
Mountain West, I think the people in the Mountain West do an unbelievable job,
men and women. There was great electricity in Thomas& Mack. It's fun to be a
part of. We're super proud to be a part of it.  
It's sad for us to call it a tournament after a first round. I mean, it just
doesn't set well after such a good season.  
  
Q. Jamie Smith obviously would have liked to have had a better game. What
has her attitude been like in the locker room afterwards?  
COACH OLIVIER: Jamie Smith, anyone in this room who knows her knows that she's
unbelievable. A relentless worker, relentless rebounder. I mean, she does so
many positive things for this team. Had a huge family members here. Wanted to
play well. You know, probably was pressing almost too much. That's the type of
person she is.  
She's special in so many ways. I guarantee you, if you ask any of her
teammates, they know she gave her best. Her best wasn't good enough. But none
of our best was good enough tonight.  
Jamie is going to beat herself up until we play again. So we better get chosen
to play post‑season because she needs to play again because this is not the
way she wants to end her career.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.  
COACH OLIVIER: Thank you, guys.

_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

New Mexico  61  
UNLV  58

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by New Mexico.  
Coach, if we could start with you, some general comments on tonight's game.  
COACH SANCHEZ: First I want to congratulate UNLV. Not only a great game ‑ it's
what March Madness is all about ‑ but for a great season. Kathy Olivier has
done a great job for her four seniors. They've been terrific players, terrific
opponents for our players. I want to congratulate them on a terrific season.  
Going back to the game, I'm so proud of these young ladies. They've had so
much adversity throughout the year, they've stuck together. Anything that
could have gone wrong did go wrong and it didn't matter. I told them the
entire season for my first year, I wouldn't want to coach any other team, and
I feel that way today.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll open it up for questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. How important were those three ‑pointers when you were down by nine in
the second half?   
PORCHE TORRANCE: I think they were extremely important. We were down by nine,
I think. I just told my teammates to keep fighting, we're still in this. We
had eight or nine minutes left. Nikki, Lauren and Caroline, they stepped it
up, shot the ball well. We feed off that. The fans helped us out a lot.  
  
Q. Nikki, you lost your first two meetings against UNLV, then conference
tournament you win this one. What was different?  
NIKKI NELSON: You know, we had a little bit of a different game plan. UNLV is
really good and they did beat us twice. We were hungry for it.  
Tournament time is always exciting because anything can happen. So our team
was just ready. We came out hard and we fought. It turned out for us this
time, so...  
  
Q. Last year you were the 7 seed as well. Similarities from last season? Do
you see yourselves winning two more games in this tournament?  
PORCHE TORRANCE: I think we can. We just got past UNLV. I think we play the
winner of Colorado and Boise. We're going to go watch that. We told ourselves
we got to take it one game at a time. We took care of tonight's game, just got
to get prepared for the next game, whoever we play.  
  
Q. Nikki, you get the winner of the game that's going on right now. Is there
a team you prefer to play of the two?  
NIKKI NELSON: Uhm, you know, there's not. I'm ready for‑‑ there's not. They're
both really good teams and I'm really excited to play whoever wins. We're
excited (laughter).  
  
Q. You played almost the entire 40 minutes tonight and you had an amazing
night. Talk about your night.  
PORCHE TORRANCE: I told myself, I'm a senior, this is my last opportunity. I
just had to give it all for my teammates. I wanted us to win this game. It's
hard to beat a team three times in a row. We definitely stepped up. I took
care of business out on the court.  
Hopefully we can take this confidence and win and keep running with it.  
  
Q. Nikki, talk about the run where you hit four straight threes. Were you
feeling it tonight?  
NIKKI NELSON: It was exciting. We were down and it was a little bit
disheartening. We faced kind of that same pattern the entire year. Tonight was
a little different, though. The phrase 'don't give up' just kept running
through my head. This is it for us. It's all or nothing.  
As a team we rallied. Everyone started hitting. Everyone fed off of the
excitement and confidence. It was awesome.  
  
Q. Have you ever hit four straight threes in a game like that before?  
NIKKI NELSON: No.  
  
Q. First time in the year the team did that?  
NIKKI NELSON: I think it is.  
  
Q. How was it to see all those fans from New Mexico come down here and
basically overpower the Thomas & Mack?   
PORCHE TORRANCE: It's a blessing to have all the fan support that we have here
at UNM. Without them, all the adversity we've been through, ups and downs,
they stuck by our sides. We really truly appreciate that because we feed off
their energy. That helped us out a lot.  
NIKKI NELSON: It's wonderful to see them all here. Uhm, it really did feel
like we were playing at the Pit back home. It gets so loud in there, you can't
hear anything. You're screaming just so your teammate can hear you. It's a fun
atmosphere. They make it worthwhile, they really do.  
  
Q. Nikki, what does this mean for you as a senior, to win a game like this
in the tournament where you've had a rough season?  
NIKKI NELSON: It's incredible. It's absolutely phenomenal. I'm elated right
now. There's no really words for it.  
We've been in the past I think couple years, we've gotten beaten on buzzer
beaters, it hasn't gone our way. To finally have it turn over and have us win
is just incredible.  
PORCHE TORRANCE: I would say our hard work all year, like she said, buzzer
beaters, losing by two or four points, crunch time, being up the whole game.
Our hard work paid off. It showed tonight.  
Normally we struggle with taking care of the ball. We definitely only had 13
turnovers. That helped us out a lot. Just our confidence. Hopefully we can
take that going into the next game.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll dismiss the student‑athletes at this time and continue
with Coach Sanchez.  
  
Q. You had nine turnovers in the first half but only four in the second
half. What did you tell them at halftime?  
COACH SANCHEZ: I think the biggest thing is we addressed that in the locker
room. We said we needed to take care of the ball and execute. We needed to get
more possessions than they do. That's what we wanted.  
To only have four in the second half, especially when they were pressing, they
had to get the ball back, it was incredible energy with our team, confidence,
just to run our press breaker, then go down and execute on offense.  
I think that was a very good execution by our team.  
  
Q. The regular season didn't go as you'd hoped. You get a win here in the
first game. Is this enough for you? What do you want out of this?  
COACH SANCHEZ: No, no. No, no, no. We want to win it. There's no question. I
mean, I don't care what our record was anymore. That's gone, it's over. Right
now it's a three‑game season. We won the first game. We're going to work on
Colorado State as we speak, get a game plan together.  
With our team, they're beat up obviously, and we'll get them some rest. But
they'll be ready to play Friday, whomever it might be.  
You know, you're happy that you won. Our players executed well. But we're just
not happy to be here; we want to win.  
  
Q. Durbin only had six points before she hit those three ‑pointers. Talk
about those.   
COACH SANCHEZ: With four people in double figures, that helps Caroline get
loose a little bit. Everybody is going to face guard Caroline, hold, grab,
whatever they can do. Caroline is a terrific player. When Lauren started
hitting some threes, when Nikki started hitting some threes, we were feeding
Porche inside, it got Caroline loose a little bit. Boy, she stepped up.  
With eight minutes left, it was 45‑54\. We had a timeout. I told those kids,
Look, it's a three‑possession game and there's plenty of time left. That's
three shots by Caroline, Lauren or Nikki, it doesn't matter.  
We hit two straight threes. They just felt the energy. It was a complete team
effort. Caroline will manage to get some shots up. She'll go within the flow
of the offense. She won't force anything. That's what makes her such a good
player.  
  
Q. Talk about your three seniors that stepped up in the second half.  
COACH SANCHEZ: They did. Porche has been a senior captain all year. She's been
a go‑to player. She's been absolutely terrific.  
Nikki, this is her first full season of playing with two knee surgeries. She
didn't get that much playing time. Those guys don't want to go home yet.  
Lauren had a concussion the last time we were here, got hit on a pretty bad
screen. Took almost two weeks off because, number one, she needed to. It
rested her. It rested the knee. She had such a good practice on Monday before
we left.  
They just come in and they don't want to be done yet. We have another senior,
Ashley Rhoades, who is a volleyball player. I credit her a little bit because
Ashley Rhoades is someone who can go play on the U.S. national volleyball team
and she's decided to come help us. She's done that just in practice.  
The three seniors definitely stepped up today. But I want to acknowledge
Ashley because she's really done a great job for us.  
  
Q. When you were down by nine in the huddle, did they do anything
specifically to spark the team, the three of them?  
COACH SANCHEZ: You know, they had so much positive energy. That's what you
have to do. Like I said, we're down nine. We have eight minutes left. It's
three possessions. That's only three shots, 30‑second shot clock. There's a
lot of possessions left with eight minutes left. We could get some stops,
which we did.  
We hit a couple very timely threes. I think went on a 16‑3 run. Really gave us
a lot of energy for our full court press, a tempo press. Wanted to slow them
down, so maybe they would have 17 or 18 seconds on the shot clock to run their
offense. Then one and done. We had to box out.  
I tell you what, UNLV has some terrific post players. Porche gets 20 and 11.
That's just going to work. Jourdan Erskine was another that battled those
people inside. Chinyere Nnaji had her shoulder knocked out against Air Force.
That thing has to have surgery at the end of the year. This is how tough these
kids are. They refuse to lose and want to play hard for the seniors.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much, coach.  
COACH SANCHEZ: Thank you.

_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

Wyoming  61  
TCU  44

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Wyoming.  
Coach, if we could start with you, your remarks on today's game.  
COACH LEGERSKI: Coming into this tournament, we talked to the team that it's
one‑and‑done. You win, you advance; you lose, you head home. With so many
young players in this program, was not quite sure what we're going to get.  
I know they're very talented. We've played well in conference play. I thought
tonight they really stepped up. We asked that we needed to have more people
than just one in double‑digits. We needed an answer from so many people.  
I thought Kayla Woodward got us off to a good start in the first half, Kaitlyn
played well especially on defense, but it was a complete team effort. That's
what I'm happiest about. We took care of the basketball.  
The last four or five minutes, I tried to get them to slow up. That's not
something we do real well. They were moving and playing at a high level. A big
victory for Wyoming today.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll open it now for questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Kayla, the first 15 minutes, back and forth. What did you do that swung
the momentum?  
KAYLA WOODWARD: I think we played with a lot of heart. We just went out there,
had the momentum, kept pushing. That's how we like to play, is fast. I think
we just kept pushing and found the open people.  
  
Q. Kaitlyn, start of the second half, was there some talk in the locker room
about keeping your foot on the gas?  
KAITLYN MILETO: Absolutely. A basketball game isn't won in the first 20
minutes, it's won in a whole 40‑minute game. We had to focus in and make sure
we kept the focus and keep the foot on the pedal so we could get the win under
our belt. So that's what we did.  
  
Q. Kaitlyn, did you do anything different today? You played these guys last
week and lost by 10. Was it knocking down shots?  
KAITLYN MILETO: We did hit shots. That last game didn't fall for us. But we
came out with heart. We all knew it was one‑and‑done, like coach said.  
We had to come out. We knew we had the motivation to beat them. We had each
other to beat them. We backed each other up and came out with intensity.  
  
Q. Kayla, close vote for freshman of the year. Was that any kind of
motivation or did you give it a second thought?  
KAYLA WOODWARD: I guess, yeah, it was a little bit of a motivation. It was a
team effort. We came out really strong. With all the excitement, like she
said, playing with heart, I think that really helped us, really pushed us.  
I don't know, we just played our hearts out. It really showed.  
  
Q. Kaitlyn, same sort of question. Was there anything with this team playing
against the freshman of the year, shut her down?  
KAITLYN MILETO: We knew she was the freshman of the year. We knew Kayla had
the ability to get the freshman of the year as well. We just went out and
played as a team with heart. It was a team win, and we all put in the effort
and the heart to win the game.  
  
Q. Kayla, what do you have to do now? Play SanDiego State, a team that got
you twice in the regular season.  
KAYLA WOODWARD: Well, throughout the whole game, we were just talking about
keeping our focus. We have that day off tomorrow, so we got to keep focusing.
They're a good team. We got to go and play like we did.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll dismiss the student‑athletes at this time. Thank you,
ladies. We'll continue with questions for Coach Legerski.  
  
Q. I think you had 12 baskets on 10 assists in the first half. You finished
with something like three shy of the record in terms of assists in a
tournament game. Have you played a better team game than this?  
COACH LEGERSKI: You know, over the years it's kind of been our style. We share
the basketball. Everyone's asked to shoot when they're open. Tonight we got
off to a great start. I thought the game was back and forth early. Then all of
a sudden we started finding some people on the perimeter with threes. Those I
always say are easy assists.  
Then when it started attacking on the inside, everybody started making what I
call a great decision. That's what we've talked about. We turned the ball over
a number of times in the last two weeks. We talked about we had to get our
turnovers down, but you need to stay aggressive. That's a fine line with as
many young players as I have. Tonight they made the right decisions, found the
right person, we stepped up and knocked down some shots.  
  
Q. You played TCU last week. Did you do anything different or was it a
matter of kids making a few more plays and shots?  
COACH LEGERSKI: We made some small adjustments of how we wanted to attack the
press. I thought we were too time‑consuming the last time. We had to be more
aggressive.  
But we talked about having an aggressiveness throughout the whole game. I
thought you saw that with the assists that we had. We got in a little trouble
when we tried to slow things down.  
I liked the way we were able to go. But it was just a matter of, this time of
year, there are no surprises. You're who you are. You just have to make sure
you're focused. We played at a very high level today. I'm very pleased with
the effort that I was able to get from my team.  
  
Q. Can you discuss playing Chaundra through two fouls early in the first
half? She gave you some great minutes even with two fouls.  
COACH LEGERSKI: She's been a tremendous player all year. One of the things we
talked about coming into today was about focus. We needed to improve our
focus. We needed to move on from a play and get ready for the next play.  
My staff was talking, telling me she had two fouls. I knew I needed Chaundra
in the game. Sometimes you got to take a chance. I told Chaundra that I have
faith you're not going to pick up a third foul, but you got to respond and
play the way I know you can and not reach, slap, create a situation like that.  
But we needed Chaundra on the floor. She is such a calming factor for this
group because she has the most experience. When I look at her numbers, the
number that stands out to me is eight rebounds. It was huge when she was on
the glass. We gave up too many offensive rebounds to TCU. When I had Chaundra,
I felt so much better and we needed to keep her in the game.  
  
Q. Do you have the best freshman in this league?  
COACH LEGERSKI: I never worry about that. What we worry about is what Wyoming
does. What we always talk about is sharing the basketball. We talk about
making the next play. We move on in that direction.  
We always talk about that you need to have team success. That's why it just
says Wyoming on our jerseys. That's all I ever worry about. Every now and then
we step up and we can play at a very high level and we're only going to
continue to get better. Everything else, that's something you guys can debate
about. I don't worry about that.  
  
Q. I know you have SanDiego State, a day to prepare. You faced them twice.
What is it going to take to give yourself as chance Friday?  
COACH LEGERSKI: We're going to have to have a repeat performance. We need to
play at a very high level for 40 minutes. SanDiego State is our champs. Very
well‑coached. Very talented. It's going to take a complete effort from
everybody again.  
Once again, it's games like this where I talk about trying to win four‑minute
segments, trying to stay close so you have a chance in the last four minutes.
I think that's all we can ask.  
We're going to enjoy this victory tonight and we'll get to work on SanDiego
State tomorrow. But I can tell you right now, they're very talented, and we're
going to need to play at a very high level.  
  
Q. You talked about a young team, didn't know what you would get coming in
here. What do you think a victory like this does for a young group?  
COACH LEGERSKI: I tell you, for any team confidence grows when you get a
chance to win here. As I told the team, who knows. You go out and you play 40
minutes. We talk in four‑minute segments so it doesn't seem overwhelming to
this group. You play, you stay aggressive, we see where it goes.  
But I'm very happy with the performance today. I'm just glad to be hanging
around in Las Vegas for another couple days.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much, coach.  
COACH LEGERSKI: Thanks to everybody here. Appreciate it.

### [Kati Isham](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23339)

### [Gordy Presnell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23338)

  
_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

Boise State  68  
Colorado State  63

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Boise State.  
Coach, if we could start with you, some remarks on tonight's game.  
COACH PRESNELL: Sure. Very proud of our team. My hat goes off to Colorado
State. They got a very good team and they have a lot of length and a high
degree of skill. So I was proud. We'd lost to them twice. Our kids battled
back.  
I thought that going into the game we had a pretty good game plan. We were
going to put as much pressure on them. They don't penetrate a lot. They get a
lot of stuff off screening. Offensively, we would attack with our post
players.  
Kati did an amazing job. She played a lot more point guard tonight than she
has in the past and did a good job of running our sets and stuff. Kinzi and
Lauren did an amazing job in the post.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for our student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Watching the game, it looked like at the beginning they were the more
physical, aggressive team. As it went on, the role switched. Was there
something said or was there something that you each reached into?  
KATI ISHAM: The first two games we played them, they started out with a bang.
They went up the first game 21‑4\. So we knew this game we couldn't let that
happen. When they started getting physical and aggressive, we just had to
muscle up with them.  
  
Q. Could you all talk about the next matchup, playing New Mexico.  
LAUREN LENHARDT: I look forward to playing them. I thought the two times we
played them in conference were good. It's going to be a tough game. They came
here and they beat the home team basically. So I'm excited to play them. It
should be a really good game.  
  
Q. Kati, when you guys were going down in the second half, it seemed early
they get those two players in foul trouble. It looked like they became a very
different team without those two on the floor. That seemed to be when you
really kind of asserted yourselves. How different were they at that point?  
KATI ISHAM: Hartig and Martin, they're two great players. We knew when they
started getting in foul trouble we had to give it to our posts, really push it
at 'em. When they left the game, I thought that left kind of a gap for them. I
thought Kinzi and Lauren did a really great job stepping in.  
  
Q. Lauren, they were able to defend you pretty well last time. What did they
do different or what did you do different?  
LAUREN LENHARDT: We prepared a lot for the double‑team and even the
triple‑team sometimes. They have really a lot of length, so it was hard for
me. I got stuck the last two times we played them hitting it off their own
hands.  
But just making sure to see the players that are open. My teammates did an
awesome job communicating, then spotting up for me to get it out.  
  
Q. Kinzi, what does it feel like to win this game? It's been a while since
Boise State has come to a tournament and get a win.  
KINZI POTEET: You could say we're pretty pumped (smiling).  
It's my first win, to go to the second round, and that's just an amazing
feeling. The whole team is jazzed. There was a certain point in the game when
we felt the tides turn. It was a momentum shift, amazing. This win means a lot
to our program, to our fans and to each other.  
  
Q. What point did it seem like the tide finally turned your way?  
LAUREN LENHARDT: I mean, to be honest, we went into the game believing that we
could do it. I think you have to believe the whole way to not let them get the
run that Kati was talking about earlier.  
I don't remember exactly when it was, but there was a point in the second
half, we started getting the fast break layups. Heather took it to the hole.
Then Keiahnna took it. That's when we started feeling good, getting some easy
buckets, getting the rebounds. That's when we became even more confident than
we were in the start.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll dismiss the student‑athletes at this time and continue
with coach Presnell.  
  
Q. New Mexico comes here, they have a history of doing well at this
tournament. They pulled off a huge upset. What do you have to do to match it
with them on Friday?  
COACH PRESNELL: They're getting healthy, so they're going to be extremely
formidable. They've improved. They've actually played pretty well on the road.
So I expect it to be a great game. I hope we're in it.  
The Durbin kid is an amazing shooter, she's amazing at reading screens
correctly. Then Porche can defend our posts pretty well. So we're going to
have our hands full.  
The first game was our place, pretty fired up, we played well. When we were at
their place, they made a big run and basically ran out of time. We were
fortunate to get out of there with a win.  
  
Q. What is the most gratifying thing with tonight's performance?  
COACH PRESNELL: It sounds kind of little, but you always need a hump win. This
is kind of a hump win for our program. We battled injuries for a few years
that just decimated us. Our kids were so focused not on winning this
tournament but just focused on Colorado State. I was really proud of them.  
Just the bounce‑back stuff. Julia, the key to the game, she hit that three,
she played so poorly in the first half. Then Keiahnna came back and made huge
contributions in the second half.  
Then seeing some improvement. Kinzi Poteet ‑‑ they zone us a lot, a lot of
people do, because we struggle in the high post. I thought her decision making
in the high post was just terrific.  
  
Q. Some players seemed frustrated a lot out there. Was that a result of the
defense you were playing on them?  
COACH PRESNELL: Heather Pilcher and Keiahnna and Julia took turns on her. It's
kind of funny. We decided after halftime that we'd come out and run a
box‑and‑one on her. We did it for three possessions and gave up six points.
The only time we focused completely on her, they just killed us.  
We worked all week on it. We got out of it after about three possessions. Kind
of overcoached ourselves probably.  
  
Q. How were you able to commit 18 turnovers and still win?  
COACH PRESNELL: 18 turnovers is pretty good for us (laughter). We can give it
to the other team really well. We try to be as transition as much as we can. I
don't have a problem with that.  
I know at tournament time it's a grind‑it‑out kind of thing, possessions
become important. But we got some breakaways and we're going to keep pushing
and do what we do. I'm proud of our team. They could have rolled over. They
showed a lot of character tonight.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much, coach.  
COACH PRESNELL: Thank you.

### [Kim Mestdagh](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19428)

_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

Boise State  68  
Colorado State  63

  
THE MODERATOR: We're ready to begin with Colorado State.  
Coach, if we could start with some remarks on tonight's game.  
COACH HOLT: Well, obviously we're disappointed that the result wasn't
different. But I think I'm very proud of this team. I told them in the locker
room that, you know, we had a really, really tough non‑conference schedule,
and we were 4‑11\. Most teams would crumble or they wouldn't have the
confidence to maybe continue on.  
I think we just really hit some milestones this year by being undefeated at
home. We finished third in our conference. We just didn't play well today.
Tournament time, it's a matter of making plays, both offensively and
defensively. Boise State was very good today and they made more good plays
than we did.  
But Kim obviously is one of the best players to ever play at CSU. I'm very
proud of what she's done. And Hayley had a tremendous game tonight with 15
points and 10 rebounds.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll open it up for questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Kim, how difficult was it? It seemed like you lost a lot of your flow
offensively when Sam and Kelly had to go to the bench in foul trouble.  
KIM MESTDAGH: Uhm, yeah, with Sam and Kelly on the bench, it's hard 'cause we
didn't have the normal inside threat that we used to have. That was gone. And
then they kept pressuring to outside, so it was hard.  
They were really physical, too. Meghan kind of had to do it on her own in the
paint. All of that makes it a little harder. We were just kind of like out of
it. We couldn't find a way to get back in and get good shots and easy layups,
so...  
  
Q. Did that make it easier for them defensively to focus their effort on
you?  
KIM MESTDAGH: Uhm, yeah, there's definitely a player on me really tight all
the time. They just had one post player to focus on, just collapsed every
single time she caught it and it just makes the hard. We didn't make any
plays. We didn't use their pressure as an advantage I think.  
We made it a little harder for ourselves by playing really frantic.  
  
Q. Kim, all that was going wrong, nothing going right in the second half.
You were able to battle back, pull within three on the jumper. What happened
on that turnover there? Seemed like you lost control of the ball.  
KIM MESTDAGH: Yeah, I don't really know. I don't think she tipped it or
anything. I think just lost control of the ball. I think we couldn't come up
with it. Yeah, scored a layup on the other side at kind of a crucial moment in
the game.  
  
Q. Hayley, you obviously had a pretty good game tonight. What was working
for you? How frustrating is it to have one of the best games you've ever had
and go away with a loss?  
HAYLEY THOMPSON: It's really frustrating just because, I mean, it doesn't
really matter how good of a game anyone has if we don't win.  
Coach gave me the go to shoot today and encouraged me to be aggressive. I felt
like they were leaving me pretty open for some shots. I just took 'em and felt
it pretty good today, so...  
  
Q. Hayley, obviously you lose Kim and all, but you had a lot of young
players that played big roles. What does that mean for this team down the
road?  
HAYLEY THOMPSON: We'll definitely miss our seniors. We're going to lose a lot
with them. At the same time we have people out injured, like LaDeyah, our
freshman point guard, has been playing for us and has grown so much this year
already. I think we have a bright future because we are so young.  
At the same time I think we're going to miss Kelly and Kim not only on the
court but their leadership.  
  
Q. Kim, with the flight being delayed and all, do you think that played any
factor? Did that not matter at all tonight?  
KIM MESTDAGH: I think we had an entire day to prepare. I don't think we had
yesterday's delay in our head. We were ready, really fired up. We came out
with a lot of energy. It seemed like that went downhill in the game. We
couldn't keep that up.  
But I don't blame the delay on anything.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll dismiss our student‑athletes at this time and continue
with Coach Holt.  
  
Q. What did Boise do differently than in the previous two games to finally
get you guys, so to speak?  
COACH HOLT: I thought their pressure was very strong. You know, my team has
had really a problem at times of getting frantic. I think a lot of that is due
to the fact that we just have really one penetrator on our team, and she's a
freshman point guard. Really, everybody else relies on screens.  
I just think when teams‑‑ if we had another game I wouldn't be saying this so
everyone can hear it, but I think they were really smart to get in our face
and pressure us. Now you're asking some of your bigs that play on the
perimeter to handle the ball and that causes us to get a little bit frantic.  
I thought we did a nice job of getting the ball inside the first half, then we
got in a mode of panic. I think that's the gist of what happened. But I
thought they did a nice job at the other end executing offensively and making
tough shots.  
We got in foul trouble. Then Sam was in the middle of that zone and they went
right at her. She was trying to, I think, protect herself from fouling out. So
I thought they were very smart about the game plan and the way they executed
it.  
  
Q. Obviously you worry about their two top scorers, but they also had two
other players in double figures. How much did that hurt you?  
COACH HOLT: Well, you know, coming into the game obviously Lenhardt was a big
focus, and Isham, and Brady had hurt us in the two games we played prior, too.
So now when you add a couple other kids that are scoring in double‑digits,
that's not going to help your cause.  
I thought we were getting some good looks inside. We didn't make a lot of
tough plays today. I thought they were the tougher team. They got more
aggressive certainly as the game went along. We didn't handle that real well.  
It's disappointing. It's disappointing we didn't get more shots for Sam.
However, I do think Sam backed off a little bit. When she missed her first
three, I don't think she seemed as aggressive after that. That certainly
contributes, too. Sam needs to score for us. That's just the way it is if
we're going to win in a big game like this.  
  
Q. How difficult was it to have two of your best players sitting on the
bench for such a big part of the second half?  
COACH HOLT: That doesn't help us when we have such a small bench anyway and we
rely on those kids so much.  
We didn't play smart. I think some of the fouls we got were out of frustration
in the backcourt, get a turnover immediately that we hack somebody.  
Just the game, you got to play it composed and poised. I didn't think we
really handled ourselves very well today.  
  
Q. Obviously tonight didn't work out the way you wanted it to. The season as
a whole, the conference record especially, you feel like this program is
moving in the right direction considering where it's been the last couple
years?  
COACH HOLT: Yeah. Like I said, we had a lot of firsts again this year in the
fact we protected our home court. That was awesome for us to be able to do
that. I think if you're going to be a championship team in this league, if you
can be 7‑0 at home, then you can find more ways to win than we did on the
road, you're going to be right where you need to be.  
We were picked to finish third, we did. The non‑conference was extremely
tough.  
But at some point this program had to go to that level. We took our lumps. But
our kids are really good kids. That's the saddest part about this day coming
to an end is I don't have a chance to coach this group in particular another
day. They're great kids. Never have to worry about them. They take care of
themselves. They're great students. This program is moving in the right
direction.  
  
Q. What happened to Meghan there at the end?  
COACH HOLT: I think she just got smacked upside the head. Meghan is always
sticking her nose in there, so I'm not surprised. She was available then to
come back into the game.  
She got beat around quite a bit. Obviously she didn't finish very well in
there today.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much, coach.

_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

San Diego State  68  
Air Force  58

  
THE MODERATOR: We're ready to begin with the United States Air Force Academy.  
Coach, if we could start with some general comments on this afternoon's game.  
COACH WILLIAMS: We had a focused game plan. My team and kids gave everything
that they had, great energy and focus. We had been in that spot before, up at
halftime by two. Knew we need to come out and make big plays, had a little
spurt where they were able to get back to back offensive putbacks. That broke
the camel's back, but then we battled back and brought it within two
possessions.  
We were disappointed. We thought it was a team we could beat, even though
they're No.1 in the league. Just proud of the way my team came back and
focused for the third time seeing them.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions.  
  
Q. Katie, at the half, you seemed to have Courtney Clements pretty well
under control. How big of a key was that? If you could have carried that out,
do you think you could have been successful?  
KATIE HILBIG: Well, Courtney Clements is a very good player in the conference.
So it was pretty key to try to keep her scoring under her average.  
We were doing a good job at halftime. Then in the second half, we kind of got
lost a couple times. That definitely affected it.  
  
Q. Katie, could you talk about what you did? Usually you ended up against
Courtney. What did you do well against her, especially in the first half?  
KATIE HILBIG: I don't know. It was just part of the game plan. In practice,
probably over half of our practices we all focus on defense. I had a team
behind me that I could rely on if I ever lost her a couple times just
communicating 'cause I wasn't on her the whole time. We were switching a lot.  
My teammates, they picked it up. They did a tremendous job helping me out with
her.  
  
Q. How many different defenses did you run today? Switching possession by
possession.  
COACH WILLIAMS: That was one of our plans. We put in half our game plan for
New Mexico. The kids responded well. You want their point guard to think every
time they come down the floor. One of the surprises we have.  
We went with five different switching defenses, what we wanted to do out of
them. We went back to a couple staple zones that we did. We brought back 22,
just to slow them up, do some things, so they were never really comfortable. I
think that kept them off kilter in the first half.  
Our kids have been working on that game plan for a week and a half, close to
two weeks, with New Mexico. You had our leading defender going to go on
Courtney, trying to slow her down, we'll switch J. on her, a smaller defender
Austyn on her, try to keep track of her in that zone.  
  
Q. Dymond, what was the difference between the first and second half, in
your opinion?  
DYMOND JAMES: Let's see. I'll have to say a little bit of focus and energy. We
had a good 5 or 10‑minute period where we lost it, let Courtney Clements get
two offensive rebounds, putbacks. The focus dropped off for one of the media
timeouts, so...  
  
Q. Why didn't Dymond play in your regular ‑season finale and why didn't she
start today?  
COACH WILLIAMS: A team decision.  
  
Q. Is that something you can learn from, Dymond?  
DYMOND JAMES: Yes.  
  
Q. What lessons do you learn from that?  
DYMOND JAMES: I don't know.  
COACH WILLIAMS: It's just a coaching decision. We'll go with something else.  
  
Q. When you look at this season, obviously you played very, very hard today,
the regular season finale win over the Lobos, how does this shape up where you
can bring a little bit of momentum into next year? Was this season a
disappointment in some respects? Does this bode well, this energy, for next
season?  
DYMOND JAMES: Well, let's see. I think we can take some momentum out of this.
End of the season we lost two players. Katie and I both went through ankle
injuries for a long time. I don't know, we've been through a lot of ups and
downs and we still came out 6‑24\.  
There's nothing to be disappointed about here. We definitely should have
gotten this win today. Going against the No.1 team, they're going to find a
way to win. We're coming back with everyone except for our lone senior J.
Can't do anything but get better from this.  
KATIE HILBIG: I think we're a much better team than our record shows. We just
went out and we were beating the No.1 seed at halftime. That clearly shows our
record isn't necessarily‑‑ you have to look at more than our record there.
We've been very close with almost every team in the conference. We're getting
better and we're going to find a way to win next year.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll dismiss the student‑athletes at this time and continue
with Coach Williams.  
  
Q. The fact that you were up on this team, you played them really well, what
does that say about this team, maybe where it's going, what you could have
accomplished this year?  
COACH WILLIAMS: We think we're going in the right direction. Again, we want to
be competitive in every game. We've had to manufacture some shots. We struggle
when people go into zone. That's one of the things we worked on the last two
weeks.  
We knew when we lost three shooters, one to graduation, transfer, one didn't
want to play, that that hurt us tremendously. Again, a team with a lot of
people who played roles last year, they knew their role in that limited
amount, but did it very well, meaning minutes, defender, we knew what we could
do on the offensive end with them. Now they had to play both ends of the
floor.  
That's us going out and recruiting, adding to the pieces. The greatest thing
we had going for us, we definitely believed we could win this game, didn't
mind our seeding, who we were playing. Our kids have been focused and fired
up.  
Again, it's a good building block from where we are. No way are we done. We
want to turn those close losses to wins in the future.  
  
Q. What were you thinking at halftime when you were up?  
COACH WILLIAMS: That we were up (laughter). We had been in that position
before at our place. I was very happy we were hitting shots. That's usually
been our nemesis, not being able to hit shots. We couldn't trade baskets with
them in the past.  
Our defenses were working, taking them out of what they wanted to do, at least
tempo‑wise. Then concerned we needed to maintain that. You knew they were
going to come back fired up, focused, regrouped, we're the No.1 seed, we're
playing for something even more. Our job was to knock them off and have a
perfect game plan, things go flawless. You can't have two minutes, two missed
offensive board putbacks.  
We stuck with the game plan plan. Our kids knew it. The scout limited them 1
for 9 from three‑point range. That's a huge bonus, helps us stay in games.  
  
Q. What happened in the second half? What did they do differently or
better?  
COACH WILLIAMS: It's called the Player of the Year in the conference got a
little ticked off and said, I'm Player of the Year. Chelsea started driving in
the middle, dumping to who was going to be open. We need to bounce back from,
that change up our defenses.  
When you have Player of the Year and point guard of the year, you're going to
go to your bread and butter. I was proud of how our kids responded. Second
half, we were able to spread them and do some things. Again, it's a veteran
team, but our kids, we had those lulls. The putback rebounds, that hurt us
from Courtney.  
  
Q. You touched on this a little bit with the defensive switches. Can you go
into a little bit more not why just this matchups but your previous matchups,
you've been able to match up against them. Why do you think that is?  
COACH WILLIAMS: Our kids just really love that challenge. It's the No.1 team,
it's a top team. If you're going to beat somebody, let's do that.  
Again, we're going to play a lot of man. That helps us quite a bit. We're
successful against man. We knew where we might be able to get some shots.
That's where some of our kids were a little gun shy in the beginning.  
It's been a good matchup, good rivalry. You want to get them up at the
mountain, run at 7,000 feet, then go down there at sea level.  
We show great halves with them, and our kids don't back down. It's one of the
teams we have beaten in the past. That's always lurking in the back of their
minds, which helps. It's a good, fun matchup. You want to start building that
rivalry.  
  
Q. Back to your point about the confidence you had coming into a game like
this against a top seed. Could you have said that about this team a year ago?
Are you maybe a little further ahead of the curve than you thought you might
be right now?  
COACH WILLIAMS: Year two was tough. I don't know if we're ahead of the curve.
The one thing we did have is confidence. It's weird, because we won last year
in the first round. That's all we knew. Come first round, no matter who we
play, we win. Playing Colorado State was tremendous for belief in the locker
room.  
Talking about New Mexico, knocking them off senior night, leading in the
conference tournament. We had been playing our best ball. It takes us about a
year, but you want to be playing your best ball the end of the year.  
So the confidence level was there, which is great to have. If you just take
our record and go 6‑24, you're the AC, our kids are fired up. If it's a
man‑to‑man matchup, we're going to go to a slugfest with them and then we
don't quit. We're going to need a couple more possessions, again, make layups,
run a flawless offense a little bit.  
I'm glad we weren't rattled. I'm glad we were fired up. We're moving in the
right direction. It's always better when your team believes. We're like, Okay,
got SanDiego State, a great matchup.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much.

### [Ashley Colbert](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23315)

### [Jeff Mittie](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13840)

### [Natalie Ventress](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23314)

  
_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

Wyoming  61  
TCU  44

  
THE MODERATOR: We're ready to begin with TCU.  
Coach, if we could start with you, give us a brief statement on today's game.  
COACH MITTIE: Well, I thought Wyoming was much better than us today. I don't
think with the way our conference has been this year, I don't think anybody
can play bad and is so talented they're going to win. And in some cases over
the year teams have been so talented that you could do that.  
You cannot in this tournament, with the youth of the entire league, have a bad
day and win. That just isn't going to happen this year.  
We had obviously a bad day today. We did not do things very well, and Wyoming
did things very well. So if you have one of these days, and that would be the
entire league, you're probably going home.  
I thought Wyoming played very well today. Give them credit. I thought Woodward
was excellent. I thought Mileto was the difference maker for them. Give them
credit, they played well.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student‑athletes first.  
  
Q. Natalie, you struggled from the field tonight. Any reason for that? Did
you feel good going in today?  
NATALIE VENTRESS: I felt good going in. When I got out there, they were
playing really aggressive on me. My shot wasn't falling. I expected my
teammates to step in, they did, they tried, but our shots just wouldn't fall.  
  
Q. For the first 15 minutes, it was a normal back ‑and‑forth game, then they
go on a 15‑0 run, was there any inkling on the court that was about to happen?
  
ASHLEY COLBERT: Nobody anticipates a run like that. When that happened, we
have a mentality to cut it back down. It didn't come out.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll dismiss the student‑athletes at this time and continue
with questions for Coach Mittie.  
  
Q. The first 15 minutes, like I was asking the players, y'all were playing
well, looked like a good game was at hand. Did you have any inkling that was
about to happen?  
COACH MITTIE: Well, I didn't like our mental focus in that stretch. There were
breakdowns that you can't see from the stands that we were having. So we
didn't feel like we had all five engaged mentally.  
Noonie got off to a rough start. She was obviously trained to figure out what
she needed to do. We went 0‑4 in the free throw stretch. Lovings missed two.
That got us into our press because we weren't making any shots in that
stretch.  
We have a tendency to have some dry spells offensively because we don't shoot
it as well as we'd like. In that stretch we'd like to get to the free‑throw
line. If we can get to the free‑throw line, that gets our press set up and
it's different. We did not get our press set up hardly at all in the first
half.  
Then Wyoming made some good shots. They made some shots that I thought Mileto
was key in that stretch. We gave her two threes. I thought Woodward was steady
all day long. In that stretch we had opportunities because we have Sewell in
foul trouble, she has to come back in with two fouls. We just couldn't make
any shots.  
  
Q. Was it just them knocking down more shots today or did they show anything
different today that caught you by surprise?  
COACH MITTIE: I wouldn't say they did anything different. They just did
everything a little bit better than they did.  
It wasn't like they were running different sets. It wasn't like there was a
different emphasis. They made more shots. Woodward looked more comfortable.
She looked like she had a rough game against us, and that's what you get with
youth sometimes. You have a young kid that has a down game. Today we had a lot
that had a down game.  
I thought their mentality was more aggressive. Other than that, they just
seemed to have a different look to them than they did at our place.  
I thought early, from a just individual standpoint, Colbert got off to a great
start for us. Gets the first four points of the game for us. I thought our
team was executing some things. But then it looked like we got very internal
to our own struggles. I had trouble getting all five on the same page.  
Sometimes you get that with players that get frustrated. We had our share of
'em today.  
  
Q. Your thoughts on Antoinette Thompson, your lone senior?  
COACH MITTIE: She had a very good career. She came to us late in the
recruiting process. We actually signed her in August. She's one of those
players when we signed her we had a need. We didn't know how much she'd play
for us.  
Her hustle, her attitude has been great. She had her struggles today. But, you
know, she fights real hard and is just a great kid. Tough to see her go. She
had been a very solid player for us for four years.  
So, yeah, we'll miss her.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much, coach.  
COACH MITTIE: Thanks.

_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

San Diego State  68  
Air Force  58

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by SanDiego State.  
Coach, if we could start with some general comments on today's game first.  
COACH BURNS: First of all, I'd like to congratulate Air Force. We've played
two relatively tight games with them. We knew what to expect. With that said,
saying it and doing it and stopping it is another thing.  
I give them a lot of credit for how they came out, competed, gave us more than
we could handle early and feel fortunate we were able to get ourselves
righted.  
With that, I'm really proud of our team. I think the uniqueness about this
Mountain West Conference season is, maybe other than UNLV, which has a lot of
core, experienced athletes back, just about all of us have new people,
freshmen, people in positions they've never been before. I tell our team a
lot, no one has been in the championship end zone before. There's an
adjustment to that.  
I really felt that we had a little bit of nerves early, then I thought we
conquered our nerves by being determined to fix it by ourselves early. We were
down about 10 at that point. I thought that that wasn't a good strategy
either.  
I think we got ourselves regrouped. We got some help off the bench, got some
putbacks. Unleash Chelsea a little bit, make them stop her in the paint
because she's a catalyst for everything we want to do.  
After halftime we regrouped, talked a little bit about what we wanted to do,
was real pleased with the way we came back and finished the game, the energy
we played with.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll open it up to questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Courtney, what was the message at halftime? What were you able to do
coming out of the half that made you successful?  
COURTNEY CLEMENTS: We just knew we needed to focus on defense. That's our
biggest thing, been our big thing all year, is playing great defense.  
You win on defense, especially in games where you can't knock shots down, it's
a grind, it's a grind, it's a grind. If you don't play good defense, you don't
win. Championship teams always play good defense. That was our main focus,
coming in, getting stops so when we do score, we can get back in the game.  
  
Q. Chelsea, you were able to get in the lane more in the second half. What
adjustments did you make at the half and why were you so successful in the
second half?  
CHELSEA HOPKINS: I just feel like in the first half I wasn't being too
aggressive. In the second half I knew I wanted to utilize the pick‑and‑roll,
the ball screens. I knew that the switch was coming, so I was trying to be
aggressive and attack. My posts were slipping to the basket, me getting in the
lane and trying to create for my teammates. That was the biggest thing.  
  
Q. Chelsea, how surprised were you guys how many different defenses they ran
at you?  
CHELSEA HOPKINS: Not surprised at all. Air Force is a unique team. They've
been doing that to us the first two times we played. Not really a surprise
their game plan. We know they're going to be aggressive, up‑tempo, keep us on
our toes.  
At first that's what kind of led to our hesitation. We didn't know what they
were doing in the second half. Once we finally settled down, especially on the
defensive end, like Courtney said, that's when our offense came together and
we were able to read and play off each other and make plays.  
  
Q. Courtney, what was the difference for you in the second half?  
COURTNEY CLEMENTS: I just played as hard as I could. I just did whatever I
could do, I did it. Fortunately for me I was able to get some O boards. The
opportunity presented itself. I took the opportunity.  
Sometimes when shots aren't falling, you have to find other ways. A lot of
games where you can't knock it down, can't get touches. You got to find a way
to win. I just saw an opportunity by going to the offensive boards. Luckily I
was getting putbacks and getting and ones, get us going a little bit.  
  
Q. Coach talked about the fact that no one really has been in that
championship end zone before. You worked with the same group of girls all year
long, yet you come into a situation like this, conference tournament, is there
any sense of nerves in the first round that you got to get that out of the
way, first half, then get back to the game you know and play well?  
COURTNEY CLEMENTS: I think we'd be lying if we sat up here and said we weren't
nervous at all.  
COACH BURNS: I thought they were going to lie. That's impressive. I know
coaches aren't supposed to interject.  
Good job, Courtney.  
COURTNEY CLEMENTS: Last year we came in this tournament and lost first round
to a team we had beat two times prior. So having kind of that monkey on your
back, you know it's possible to lose to a team that you beat before that on
paper you should beat. Anything can happen in March. We're very well aware of
that.  
So you are nervous. Yeah, maybe this game was kind of us getting our nerves
out of the way. At the same time it's something you have to work through.
Fortunately for us, we were able to do that.  
THE MODERATOR: At this time we'll dismiss our student‑athletes. Thank you.
We'll open it up for questions for Coach Burns.  
  
Q. Beth, do you ever let yourself think what this team might be like without
those two players?  
COACH BURNS: No (smiling), because I've had that before. People say, Why are
you good? You cannot look at a stat sheet to figure out our team. I knew we
were nervous, because we're a very good free‑throw shooting team. We're at
good, gosh, 76% in conference. We try to get the right people in the right
spots, get them to the line. We're a good offensive rebounding team. We did
neither of those things today.  
But our question mark coming into the season wasn't the backcourt because what
Courtney had done in the off‑season to change herself, and Chelsea was in
practice with us crushing us on a daily basis a year ago, it was how to
integrate it all and how are we going to facilitate a system that we can help
these young ones along.  
It goes back to the old coaching adage of, You're going to know what we're
going to do, but fortunately for 23 times people haven't been able to stop it.  
  
Q. You're not going to be surprised with anyone coming out with a great
effort in conference tournament. Nuts and bolts ‑wise anything you need to
adjust to?   
COACH BURNS: I don't think so. Because I think really by this point, that's
why conference tournament games are usually so ugly. You can't change what you
do. They have a weakness there, let's shoot a 38 ‑ if you can't shoot the
three. You can't change what your strengths are, nor can they.  
They've done a terrific job all season ‑ and I say this with respect ‑ by
trying to play ugly basketball. They're going to foul or steal it from you.
Put their head down, take it to the hole. They're going to give us matchup
problems because we'll keep our bigs on the floor, but we're not a good zone
team. We're too young, don't communicate well enough.  
I wasn't really surprised. I think we were a little bit nervous. But I didn't
expect any 80‑40\. I think what was atypical for both team, both teams are
pretty good defensive teams. 53‑46, usually this is a final for us, we had 11
minutes to go. I think for both of us, it showed on both ends. Neither of us
were probably as good as we normally are because of the moment. Fortunately
for us, it's behind us.  
Thank you very much.

_SPOKANE, WASHINGTON_  
  

Gonzaga  65  
Miami  54

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach will give an opening view of the game and then we'll open
it up for questions for the student‑athletes, then the coach will remain after
for additional questions.  
Coach.  
COACH MEIER: Usually when you lose a game like this and it's your last game,
you have such special seniors, you're kind of devastated as a coach.  
But for some odd reason, I turned to go in that locker room and Shenise
Johnson is already in the locker room. I'm in there to tell them about lessons
of the future, how proud I am of them. Shenise is already up there running
that locker room, telling those Miami players how proud she was, how happy she
was. She never, ever could love a team more. She was proud of our efforts.  
As a coach, you get a moment like that, it's very hard to feel devastated.
Lessons have been passed on. We are a big‑time program now.  
We did not play our best basketball game, but we played as hard as we could
possibly play. Without any question, we fought and fought and fought and
fought.  
Gonzaga did a fantastic job of not turning over the ball. It wasn't for lack
of effort on our part by any means. They were very composed. I think Kelly
Graves is one of the best coaches in the country.  
I'm happy for Gonzaga, they represent women's basketball. I'm happy for this
community and that crowd. It's an awesome environment and an awesome
experience for us.  
So tough way to go down in terms of looking at the stat sheet and realizing we
only turned them over 11 times, realizing we went 1‑12 from the three and that
type of thing. I see they made four threes only, but they were four huge ones.
They made big shots. So we lose when that happens.  
But we do not feel like losers. We are very proud of ourselves. We lost to a
fantastic team who had a great game tonight. Pepper Wilson is obviously going
to be a headliner for us. That was a great thing for me as a coach to see
someone that cares so much, dominates, gets that ferocious mentality as we had
to adjust.  
We had to reinvent our team two times this year losing two starters. But there
were moments when we were executing plays that we had to bring back that we
haven't run since January to get some iso's for Pepper and looks for Mo. I'm
very proud. My hat is completely off to Gonzaga. I told them, Just keep
winning, just keep winning, because I love that team.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions from the media.  
  
Q. Shenise, obviously right now it's a tough moment. With everything this
team has accomplished over the last two years, you're feelings right now.  
SHENISE JOHNSON: Yes, very far from what we were hoping for. As coach said, we
had to reinvent ourselves so many times. I'm proud of our efforts. I'm proud
of my girls. I'm proud of my team.  
There's no pity losses. We left it all out on the floor tonight. We can go
home, lay our heads on our pillows and close our eyes with no regrets. That's
what we wanted to make sure we did tonight.  
As far as how I'm feeling inside, I don't want to take my uniform off yet. I
don't want to leave this classy young lady. She has more energy than us a lot
of the time. I'm looking forward to see what Miami is going to do next year.  
  
Q. Could you talk a little bit about the environment. You talked about
playing in other venues that were pretty large. Did that seem to have a impact
on either one of you?  
SHAWNICE WILSON: It was a great crowd, but this is a crowd that we already
experienced when we played Tennessee early on in the season. The crowd didn't
have anyone rattled. I don't think, like, the crowd was a big factor. We've
seen it before.  
Plus in the ACC we have a lot of big‑time games, big‑time crowds. I don't
think the crowd too much had anyone, like, nervous. I think we were ready for
it.  
SHENISE JOHNSON: Our shootarounds consist of a lot of noise. We made sure we
did a lot of hand signals to prepare for the Gonzaga crowd. I thought it was a
great arena. Classy, classy group of fans. I'm happy to end on Gonzaga's
court.  
COACH MEIER: We were clapping, giving them an ovation when we came off the
court. Bravo to the crowd. Every arena should be like that.  
  
Q. Shenise, this team had to basically reinvent itself, like you said. Do
you have any kind of feeling what could have been maybe had Riquna been able
to be here?  
SHENISE JOHNSON: No, we have everybody who was supposed to be here. As a
whole, we believe that everything happens for a reason. No one person
(indiscernible) a team.  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, you're excused. We'll continue with questions for
coach.  
  
Q. Coach, you spoke last season when you lost to Oklahoma in the tournament
about not having the kind of presence Pepper Wilson brings was a key in that
loss. How tough was it having her go out in foul trouble?  
COACH MEIER: We were very happy we were down three at halftime. Pepper was so
efficient. She had great minutes, not just enough of them. I was debating
whether or not I could keep her on that bench. If it stayed within five, I was
going to keep her on the bench.  
But I was thrilled. I loved the second half. We got down a little bit. But
that fight when we came back and took the lead, I thought we were in great
shape, I really did.  
We just had a series of well‑executed plays for the right reasons, for the
right shots. You got to hit 'em if you want to advance. Then we got a little
bit rattled when we had to go small there at the end. We got a little behind.
We had some freshmen playing out of position just because we hadn't been
scoring a little bit quicker.  
Other than that, I'm so proud, yeah. I'm usually miserable after a loss. You
have to understand that we lost to a great team tonight. My team responded in
doing what we needed them to do. I'm just proud. I'm just proud.  
  
Q. Obviously Stefanie had a tough game, but she was attacking the basket in
the last minutes.  
COACH MEIER: No one hit. No one hit. At halftime I just said, I'm going to
come after you. I'm not going to dance around the fact that you need to hit
shots or we're not going to win. I went right at her. She had her head up,
shoulders back. She is apologizing to the team in the locker room. And they
were saying, No way, you have heart and soul, you're gritty.  
Coached a lot of years. Coached a lot of years. But this team is just special.
They're so special. Forget what they do on the basketball court. If you had a
chance to be with them this last week, it would have been the best week of
your life. They're just unbelievable. They're unbelievably tough and full of
character.  
They're in there right now still talking about what we need to do better for
next year. So I feel great as a coach. I'm disappointed. Obviously I lost two
seniors that I love and one senior that was the most versatile player that
played. Except for Nancy Lieberman, there's only two people that done what she
did on the basketball court.  
The first thing out of her mouth was taking care of the young kids, that she
was proud of them, get your shoulders back, wear Miami with pride, I'm going
to follow you, I'm going to be on you. It's why you coach. It's why you do
what we do.  
  
Q. What did they do to take you out of your style that's usually up ‑tempo?
  
COACH MEIER: You know, the reinventing part had a little bit to do with
slowing it down, taking the ball in the air, going inside.  
Gonzaga to some extent did some stuff. To some extent that was me trying to
figure out how I was going to win the basketball game, knowing that we had to
establish Pepper, too.  
They can score. I felt honestly like they probably had an advantage if this
thing got really high. The other day they asked if it was 90. If it was 90,
we're not going to win that.  
I was really happy with our defense. I mean, we gave them some points at the
line at the end. But honestly we held them under 60, without those free throws
at the end. That's an amazing team that moves the ball, shares the ball. To
hold them under 60, we should win that game.  
That was definitely purposeful on my part, feeling like we took early shots,
they were sharing the ball like that. Pepper would be at halfcourt most of the
game.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much, coach.  
COACH MEIER: Thank you all. It's been a wonderful, pleasant experience. I
really appreciate it. Thank you.

_SPOKANE, WASHINGTON_  
  

Gonzaga  65  
Miami  54

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Gonzaga head coach and student‑athletes. We'll
start with an overview of the game from coach.  
COACH GRAVES: First of all, I do want to congratulate Miami on a tremendous
season. I've gotten to know Coach Meier a little bit over the last several
weeks and now having coached against her and watched her team play, I'm very
impressed.  
She's I think now one of my very favorite coaches. Her team played really
well. Tonight for two offensive teams, I thought we both showed a lot of grit
and a lot of toughness. We were just fortunate I think to make some of the
plays and some of the stops down the stretch.  
But my hat is off to Miami. But I am really very proud of my team, especially
my senior leadership up here. You know, sometimes I get on my team for being a
little bit soft, but I thought tonight we showed a lot of grit, a lot of
toughness, and we were physical. For that I'm very proud and happy that we're
moving on.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. You had to be tougher down the stretch. Can you talk about the difference
of playing that type of game right from the beginning today.  
KAYLA STANDISH: Yeah, I mean, we knew it was going to be a tough game, just
like it was on Saturday. They're a great team, all very skilled players. They
play well together, just like us. We knew it was going to be a good matchup.  
But we had to come out fighting from the beginning because they're a much
bigger and physical team than us so with had to get a jump‑start from the
beginning and carry it through to the end.  
KATELAN REDMON: Just like she said, they're very physical on the inside, we
definitely had to make sure we were battling hard. One of our big focuses was
rebounding. We had to make some space so we could get the rebounds. Just
battling down there and all around physical play. We came out hard and fought
with them.  
  
Q. Katelan, talk about the difference between Saturday and tonight for you
personally.  
KATELAN REDMON: For me personally, I struggled a little bit from the floor. I
needed to make sure I came out relaxed and continued to shoot the ball. A lot
of times I find myself leaking out a little bit. So one of my main focuses
tonight was actually going to the boards and making sure I was crashing hard
and getting the rebound.  
  
Q. You were the underdogs going into both these games. Did you ever get the
feeling you were the better team out there in either one of these games from
the beginning?  
KATELAN REDMON: We go out there and we don't like to think of ourselves as
underdogs. We know we're a very good team. They're also a very good team. We
can compete with any team out there. We go out there thinking we can win and
we did that tonight.  
  
Q. When Shawnice Wilson went to the bench early in the first half, how did
that change the conditions for your team on the floor?  
KAYLA STANDISH: With her out of the paint, we had to take advantage of that.
She's obviously a very skilled and...  
  
Q. ...formidable challenge?  
KAYLA STANDISH: Yeah, whatever that means (laughter).  
She's obviously a lot bigger and more physical. Getting her out of the paint
was a key to our success really. With her out of the paint, we're allowed to
get it in more. We had to run a lot harder when she was out. Just numerous
things we had to take advantage of her with her out of the game.  
COACH GRAVES: I was actually disappointed in the first half. I think we needed
to separate more. I don't think we took advantage of her absence in there.  
  
Q. Ladies, yesterday coach talked about a group effort to guard Shawnice
Wilson. Can you talk about how that worked out for you today, what adjustments
you had to make, what kind of an obstacle that was.  
KATELAN REDMON: One of the things we really wanted to focus on was packing in
our defense so that it was a challenge for them to even get the ball into her.
What we did on the wings when the ball went inside, we'd cover down a little
bit, force her to throw the ball back on the outside. By doing that, we help
try to keep the ball out of her hands as much as possible.  
  
Q. At the end of the game, you're last game at the athletic center, what was
that like?  
KAYLA STANDISH: Very happy to win our last game in our hometown, our home gym.
Our fans are amazing. To go out with a win like that, have all the support
we've got, we couldn't ask for a better situation.  
Being a senior, you like to go out with a good taste in your mouth on your
home floor and we did that. Yeah, being a senior, I'm very happy with what
we've done, very sad we won't be able to play in this gym again. We've still
got more games to play, so that's a good thing.  
KATELAN REDMON: She already covered it all. It feels really good to go out
with the win here at home, it being our last game here. You always want to go
out on a win. Especially me being from Spokane, playing in front of that
hometown crowd, having my family in the stands, it feels good to have my
family watch my last game here.  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, you're excused. We'll continue with questions for
coach.  
  
Q. I was one of the experts to predicted a high ‑scoring game. Were you
surprised at that final score or did you think it was going to be something
like that?  
COACH GRAVES: Well, no, I actually thought it was going to be more on the
defensive end. Knowing Coach Meier, we both were focusing on that. I think
everybody thought like you, they thought it was going to be a high‑scoring
game.  
Typically in the NCAA tournament like this, it does come down to who plays the
better defense. Both of us played pretty well defensively tonight.  
  
Q. You talked all season about Jazmine Redmon being the sixth starter out
there for you. How important was she tonight?  
COACH GRAVES: You know, Miami forces about 23 and a half turnovers a game on
the season. We committed 11. Seemed like there were more of them. We really
did a nice job of taking care of the basketball. It wasn't always pretty. They
did a nice job of extending our possession. I mean, sometimes we didn't have a
lot of time to score.  
But Jazmine has been terrific all year. I actually give her a lot of credit
defensively. I thought she did a really good job with Shenise Johnson. That's
one of the best players in the country. Jazmine just fought her like crazy. I
thought she did just a really good job.  
No one player can take her. We had to defend her as a team. But I thought
Jazmine did by far the best job on her tonight.  
  
Q. Do you ever get tired being considered the underdog? Do you ever feel
like you are the better team?  
COACH GRAVES: You know, we take whatever they give us. It honestly doesn't
matter. It doesn't affect how we play. This is a group now that has gone to
three straight Sweet 16s. We never consider ourselves an underdog. I think
we're a really good team.  
Where they seed us they seed us. That doesn't bother me. But we're good. We're
gritty. We have a lot of different players that can contribute and do things.  
What I'm most proud of with this group is every single night it's somebody
different. Sometimes every half it's somebody different. I'm proud of my team.
I wouldn't trade this group for anybody.  
I'm telling you, this is a good basketball team. It's not always pretty. We've
been used to pretty around here. But these guys are good. This team is
effective.  
  
Q. Obviously you talked about how winning the turnovers tonight was huge to
winning. Seemed like when you were trying to break that press, how important
was it having a big that can handle the ball against that kind of pressure?  
COACH GRAVES: That's an area Kayla has really gotten better in. As she
progresses in her pro career, it's going to be something she has to be able to
do, is handle the basketball. I'm actually really comfortable with the ball in
her hands. I prefer it not to be because that means we're doing other things
better. I'd rather have her down finishing.  
At times she has to be a pressure release for us. She's comfortable with it.
She makes good decisions. Kayla from time to time, you have to, C'mon, Kayla,
let's go, which works great in press situations. She's always under control
and confident and composed.  
Yeah, she played big all weekend. She played big.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about when Haiden...  
COACH GRAVES: I hope they didn't get that on camera. It was my attempt at a
chest bump. If you want to know the truth, that play, that loose ball
epitomized our game tonight. That's what made me so excited. There was no quit
in her.  
The one thing about Haiden, she does some things from time to time, head
scratcher, and I don't have much hair left to scratch, but then she'll come
back and do something like that. It energizes the team.  
I think she epitomizes what this group is about. We play with heart. We're
tough. I just got a little emotional there for a little bit (laughter).  
A chest bump from me is a really ugly thing. Then I grabbed her head and kind
of squeezed it a little bit. But you know what, my team actually enjoyed it.
It's something they'll talk about for a long time, I guess.  
I tell you, after that play, I just thought, you know what, this is going to
end well for us.  
  
Q. A lot of people might argue with this crowd, home crowd, it's an
advantage against these higher ‑ranked teams. Is that taking away from how
well your girls are playing?  
COACH GRAVES: It's a great question. I've tried to deflect the importance of
the crowd. Listen, we love playing here. Our crowd is terrific. This is an
atmosphere that you don't find anywhere else in women's college basketball,
nowhere. It's terrific. It's good for the game.  
I think everybody goes in knowing what the rules are. We bid on it. We get to
host.  
Ultimately, listen, good teams win on the road. That's why they're good teams.
That's why they get high seeds. I just think it comes down to the execution on
the court. So I've tried to deflect it, even though I realize that it is
important. But we have a good team and we executed on the floor.  
Tonight they gave us a lift. There were some times with the shot clock winding
down, I think Miami was a little bit confused because they couldn't hear. So
they definitely are an advantage for us.  
But I don't want that to overshadow the fact that we're a pretty good team
that executes well and plays hard.  
  
Q. One of the first things Coach Meier addressed is the fact you had big
shots. Can you talk about that against Rutgers, Miami tonight, the ability to
hit those shots?  
COACH GRAVES: I'm just blessed with those kind of players. I have gamers. It's
Kelly Bowen, Haiden Palmer, Taelor Karr. You go on and on, it's always
somebody different. I have a lot of confidence in them to shoot. We like to
get the ball up, shoot a lot.  
They've been in this situation. This was the 11th NCAA tournament game for
this senior class. That's a lot of experience. So they've been in those
moments. They expect to make 'em. I know they have confidence in taking those
shots because I have confidence in them to take it.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach Graves.  
COACH GRAVES: Thank you.

_SPOKANE, WASHINGTON_  
  

Gonzaga  86  
Rutgers  73

  
COACH STRINGER: You can ask me any questions.  
  
Q. Just general impressions about your defensive play and Gonzaga's
offensive play.  
COACH STRINGER: I think we had to pick it up. We had to be much more intense,
and that's why we changed, started picking it up to the full court level,
which wasn't what we intended to do. We were hoping that we would get them‑‑
cover their transition much better, but we weren't. And they are a very good
team, and Kayla and Bowen, the whole group, Palmer, they did what they were
supposed to do. We studied them on tape, and it was nothing new; they did what
they did. Obviously I thought our defense would be more destructive, although
I think when we began to put more pressure in the backcourt, they were having
problems running the half court offense, and so that was one key, because once
they got it into the half court, they had nice size and people that had nice
skills, and they were able to get the stops today. I hoped to double the big
girl on the inside. We obviously didn't, and she did everything.  
We knew that Palmer had had 28‑point games, and it could have been any one of
them, but we played hard, extremely hard. It just wasn't our day. We seemed to
be just a half step‑‑ I'm not sure why, but maybe a half step short, a half
step slow, but we worked hard, extremely hard.  
I'm sure that they could appreciate the energy, the enthusiasm of the team and
certainly the fans. It was a great atmosphere.  
  
Q. True to your word, your freshmen saw more minutes today than they did in
the Big East Tournament. What did you see out of them today?  
COACH STRINGER: You said true to my words that the freshmen were going to play
more minutes? Yeah, because I needed to tell the upperclassmen some things
that were going on. It was loud in there as you know, so we couldn't just
yell. We had to make substitutions so that we could personally tell them and
give them a chance to see what was going on.  
One of the things in particular is that there was a big girl that was coming
down for the block, and when it happens, it forces us to not send as many
people to the offensive boards, and yet they seemed to be getting that second
and third opportunity at the beginning.  
It wasn't anything intentional. It didn't matter, it was just a matter of
putting people in that we thought could make a difference, maybe a size versus
another player that they were playing. But they shot the ball well, rebounded
the ball well, did what they do.  
  
Q. Khadijah, noticeably you looked like you twisted your ankle in the first
half and were limping after that. How big a factor was that the rest of the
game for you?  
KHADIJAH RUSHDAN: It wasn't a factor at all. I twisted it, but I got it taped.
I was fine. My adrenaline was going, so I did my best to play through it.  
  
Q. For any of the players, just thoughts on the crowd and how they might
have played a factor, especially when you guys were trying to mount a comeback
in the second half.  
APRIL SYKES: They were supposed to play with that. They're at home. At Rutgers
our crowd probably would have played a factor. That's an advantage you have
playing at home, and they have a great crowd, great atmosphere to play in. The
team responded to their crowd, so they went on runs and we couldn't sustain
it, so they got the upper hand today, and that's how they won the game.  
  
Q. Erica, in this game and also the game against UConn, you really haven't
shied away from the big moments. How have you changed your game to be able to
put together that effort for 40 minutes?  
ERICA WHEELER: Just mainly playing for another day, just mainly playing hard
for the seniors. The seniors really deserve to play for a long time because
they work hard, and you have Khadijah that came back for a fifth year, so she
really deserves it, to play in extra games, so I was just mainly playing hard
for the seniors. That was it.  
  
Q. Erica, you and Haiden Palmer were having a pretty good one ‑on‑one battle
at times. She nailed some shots. She looked to me like she was right in your
face several times. You drained threes. What can you say about her game and
the little battle between the two of you?   
ERICA WHEELER: She's definitely a great player. She was knocking down shots,
we both were knocking down shots, but credit to her that she's just a great
player and I was just competing. That's what I do. I was just competing.  
  
Q. You referenced the full court you went into earlier maybe a little bit
earlier than you had planned, the pressure defense, but it did have a visible
effect on Gonzaga, 19 turnovers, and that keyed your comeback in the second
half, but if the players could go into what it was like during the comeback
and if there was a moment you thought you might have been able to take this
game.  
APRIL SYKES: We were supposed to press for the whole game. It's hard to get
into a press when you're not scoring the basketball. We weren't making shots,
we weren't getting to the free‑throw line. But other than that you have to
make shots to get into your press. You can't get into a press when
(indiscernible) break, so it was complicated. The game plan for us was score,
get inside, press, and it's hard to do when you're not scoring the basketball
how you should, and that's what made us struggle so much.  
  
Q. Can you girls talk about the first ten minutes when you got into a hole
and you weren't making those shots? Were you pressing or what did you feel
about the offense in the first ten minutes?  
APRIL SYKES: It was kind of confusing at first because they was just packing
it in on us. One time it looked like a man, the next time it looked like a
match‑up zone, so it was confusing. We couldn't hear each other and the crowd
was loud, and they were making shots. We can't match any team for threes.
We're not a three‑point shooting team, and when we're not getting it down low
to Monique and when we're not penetrating and finishing drives and lay‑ups,
that makes the game long for us, when they're coming down and executing and
scoring.  
The first ten minutes we were getting shots at the rim, we just weren't
finishing lay‑ups. It was frustrating for us, but we never stopped playing.  
  
Q. Khadijah, Gonzaga was having their way with their fast break offense. How
did that affect your own play as a point guard?  
KHADIJAH RUSHDAN: That was actually one of the things that we've been working
on for the last week, just trying to make sure that we stop them in
transition. We compared their transition game to UConn, and we felt we did
fairly well when it came to that, and just tonight, I don't know, we just‑‑ we
rushed that too slowly you could say. It's difficult when you have a team
that's getting out in transition and they've got wings that are out there
hitting threes or they've got a post that's in there just grinding and being
able to finish. I mean, it was tough for us and we struggled a lot.  
  
Q. There was a moment in the second half where after a made basket you tried
to get the referee's attention and call a time ‑out but it didn't seem like
they could hear you amid the crowd noise. Can you talk about that, how big a
factor that played today?   
COACH STRINGER: Well, I mean, for them it was a great atmosphere. Great,
great, it pumps you up. But the problem was when I was trying to get the
attention of our guards, which we're experienced to know at these events, but
we weren't enough. We couldn't hear each other.  
Like there were several times, you'd have hand signals, but withinsome of the
patterns that we run, there's very specific tips that we're looking for, and
the point guard, I was trying to get her attention, and I told her what we
were trying to do, but by the time it was communicated to everybody else, 12
seconds were off the clock and we're scrambling. Then I'd have to substitutes
at times to get the message clear in terms of what we were getting at. That
was really disappointing. So it might break the rhythm of the player on the
floor, saying what did I do wrong. It's nothing you did wrong, so I said, we
need to communicate something very specifically that they need to do, because
they couldn't hear.  
It was a great atmosphere, probably looked great on television, and it was
good for them. And the rest of us who are playing just got to learn to play in
that particular atmosphere. That's what it's like playing away from home.  
But you've just got to be able to handle that, and we didn't. I wouldn't say
that would be a totally‑‑ this is a very, very good team, and they execute
extremely well. I mean, they're blue‑collar workers, if you will, blood and
guts. They go after everything.  
I think the one thing that we knew is that good defense will never fail you.
If you just play defense, defense will not fail you. We weren't doing that as
well in the first half, and as well in the first half, we were settling for
jumpers, and when you're in other people's place that's great if you can hit
some, but great frankly you need to go to the hole, and I knew that. We knew
that. But we worked ourselves into such a hole in that first half that it
became extremely difficult in the second half to get out of that.  
They were shooting threes, but these are their rims and they know them and
they could shoot them well. We haven't shot extremely well from the
three‑point line all year, so we need just to be a lot more poised, a lot more
comfortable, and take our time to see what they were doing. But they did a
great job. They're well‑coached. The players play extremely well.  
The fans should be credited because they truly are great fans. I'm sure that
they don't have all their fans because some of their fans are probably
supporting the guys. So that's a real testimony to the kind of support that
Gonzaga has. I feel like I would rather play in a loud, boisterous atmosphere
than to play in a quiet atmosphere.  
  
Q. Can you reflect a little bit on the intensity and fight shown by Erica
and a couple of the freshmen in the second half, midway through the second
half, and also, do you think the trip across the country maybe contributed to
that, being that half step late on plays?  
COACH STRINGER: You know, I'm going to just be tempted to say what I think
quite honestly, so I'm going to give you these words, okay: We enjoyed our
trip. It was very good. We got a chance to meet and we had a nice long
conversation. It was wonderful. Okay? That was good.  
And Khadijah, I credit her because I saw that she was hurt, but she didn't
look for that. I think that an athlete understands that's the arena that you
compete in. That's the arena we competed in. That's the arena that we compete
in. If you want to know what I really think, I'll tell you later but not now.  
  
Q. You've been speaking all year about how the team puts in great effort
even when they're not shooting the ball particularly well. But they still
managed 73 points today, which is from what I can remember a good total for
them. How much does their effort and will to win, how much did that play into
it?  
COACH STRINGER: That's the thing. That's what Erica was saying about the
seniors having gone through the things that they have this year. I'm sure that
they could tell you a story. It hurts because we couldn't ask more for
Khadijah. They played their hearts out, and to score as many points as they
did says a lot.  
But we got into the same thing that we did against UConn. I think that with
less than nine minutes to go in the game we were within nine at UConn, but
what killed us is what happened in the first ten minutes, and that's also what
killed us today. It was a bit much to overcome. We just need to be settled and
a little more confident. It's not to blame them because this team did
everything that it possibly could. I really admire, appreciate, respect the
kind of effort. A coach couldn't be more proud of her players than I was of
the effort and the way our team played today. I don't hang my head. I'm sad
because I wish that they could play a little bit longer because they really
deserve to.

_SPOKANE, WASHINGTON_  
  

Miami  70  
Idaho State  41

  
COACH SOBOLEWSKI: Well, first off, congratulations to Miami. They did a nice
job. They played some great defense and they scored enough points. I think
with them missing one of their best players, they could have very easily had a
bad game or had a bad attitude and just not performed very well, but my hats
off to them. They did a great job.  
I thought that we really struggled to shoot the ball in the second half, first
half and second half. Early on ‑‑ we counted in the locker room at halftime,
we missed six lay‑up attempts, not that they were all uncontested, but we
missed some easy shots. We missed some perimeter shots that maybe we normally
would have hit. I don't know what you attribute that to. Maybe it's just
jitters being at the national tournament. Maybe we just‑‑ bad night shooting,
I don't know.  
Second half, I felt like we still played hard. I think we rushed some shots in
the second half, a little panicky, just wanting to get back in the game,
wanting to make plays, and I understand that, but we continued to miss open
shots that we normally might have a good chance of making.  
Miami's length and athleticism really bothered us. Any time we tried to make a
long pass, they could really cover a lot of ground and intercept passes or
deflect passes. They did a nice job with that. And in a nutshell, that's it.  
I'm very proud of our team to make it to this point. I told them in the locker
room, they helped me make a dream of mine come true. You know, as a coach you
work hard your whole life, and you hope you get an opportunity to be a head
coach someday, and you hope that you have a team‑‑ you can put a team good
enough together that can make a run to make a championship, to maybe play in
the NCAA Tournament, and they've helped me, they really helped me.  
I'm sure we've made some other dreams come true along the way, but I told them
I'm very appreciative of everything they've done. I'm very proud of them,
very, very proud of them, and I told them I am indebted to them the rest of my
life. They helped me make a lifelong dream come true.  
  
Q. Kaela, question for you: This team is young. You only lose one senior in
Chelsea sitting next to you. What do you take away from the whole Big Sky
Tournament, now the NCAA Tournament, that helps you going into next year?  
KAELA OAKES: Right now I feel very blessed to have the people I do on my team,
and of course we're going to miss Chelsea. She's a major asset to what we do,
but I think like we've always done, we've always just had someone step up,
whether it's my game or Vella's game or Chelsea's game or Cydney's game. And I
think that we're going to be able to flourish next year, and we're going to
have the extra experience, and the people that were younger this year are
going to be a year older. I think we're going to really take advantage of
that. Some other teams are losing some really good players, and I think that's
even going to be a better opportunity for us, so I'm really looking forward to
next year, even though we'll miss Chels.  
ASHLEIGH VELLA: I agree with Kaela. Chelsea is a huge asset. She does so much
for us, not just stuff that you see with stats but just little things. She's a
hustle player for us and a major role player. But it's nice because we have so
many younger people coming in. On any given night any one of us can step up
and play, but I'm looking forward to next year, even though we don't have
Chelsea.  
  
Q. Chelsea, as the season winds now, now your college career is over, what
goes through your mind as you realize that's the last game that you'll play?  
CHELSEA PICKERING: It's bittersweet, of course. You never want anything to
end, especially going into the NCAA. You hope to at least win one game, be the
Cinderella team. But now I just get to sit back and relax. I mean, I'm going
to miss it, but my plans are to continue playing basketball overseas. Give it
a month, relax, and then get back to work.  
  
Q. For any of the players, what did you have to do out there to adjust your
game to the sheer size of your opponents?  
CHELSEA PICKERING: We really didn't adjust to anything. We kept going at them,
and that was something that was probably not the best thing to do because once
you drive and have two or three people collapsed on you we should have kicked
it out. That was one thing we should have adjusted and could have. But other
than that, our game was the same. We just didn't execute it as well.  
KAELA OAKES: As a point guard I felt like I had to kind of adjust my passes,
they needed to be a little bit quicker, they needed to be not so long. We were
getting a lot of our long passes picked off. And I just felt like it was more
difficult to drive and dish and get to do what is normally easier for me to
do. Their athleticism and their long arms and being able to cover the floor
like Coach said was definitely a very good‑‑ it was really tough as a point
guard especially to do that.  
ASHLEIGH VELLA: They were just really aggressive and, as Kaela said, jumping
in the passing lanes, and I think we need to have been smarter and made better
decisions. But we tried to stay aggressive and tried to stick with our game
like we usually do, it just didn't work as well as it normally does.  
  
Q. Ashleigh, you said they were aggressive. Would you say this is the most
aggressive opponent you guys have faced?  
ASHLEIGH VELLA: I think they're the most athletic group we've ever faced.
Sacramento State are fairly aggressive in how they press us. But I think their
aggression with their athleticism was definitely an asset for them.  
  
Q. Ashleigh, speaking of aggressiveness, there was a couple moments in that
game, a hard foul from you, first half you got in a couple players' faces.
Were you trying to inspire the team or what happened with the aggression back
and forth, especially the one where she got up in your face and pushed you
back?  
ASHLEIGH VELLA: It's just play of the game. I'm going to stay my ground and do
my thing, and if she wants to get in my face, that's her business. But it's
just play of the game, really. I'm just trying to stay aggressive within my
own game.  
  
Q. And Chelsea, was it shots not going, or was it Miami's defense that
caused those shots not to go?  
CHELSEA PICKERING: We had wide‑open shots, we just clearly missed. I remember
one time‑out we had seven O‑boards to their five, so we were getting in the
mix but our shots just weren't falling, and that's that.  
  
Q. Ashleigh, could you just talk about what it's like going against that big
a player? That's pretty unusual obviously.  
ASHLEIGH VELLA: Yeah, she's probably one of the biggest players that we've
gone against, but we've played against a 6'8" girl, too. It's hard, you've got
to be physical with them within the limits of the game, but we just tried to
take it at them, but it didn't pay off tonight.  
  
Q. You and your players mentioned the length and the aggressiveness of
Miami, but both that press and almost like a swarming one ‑two‑two hybrid
one‑three‑one defense, what was that like?  
COACH SOBOLEWSKI: It was tough. It was a one‑one‑three, especially in the
second half, then they extended full court, and it would fall back into a
one‑one‑three or two‑three half court. They did that once they had a sizable
lead. In the first half it was primarily man‑to‑man, switching. They could
switch every screen. They did a nice job of knowing who to back off of and
helping in the lane. You saw No.40 in the lane the whole night, Wilson, and
they had a good game plan. But it's tough to play against.  
Like similar to what Ashleigh said, we've played against aggressive teams
before, but we haven't played against aggressive teams of that size and
athleticism before.  
  
Q. Ashleigh had a little bit of success tonight; she scored 12 points. Do
you think Miami was surprised by her ability to shoot from the outside?  
COACH SOBOLEWSKI: Possibly. Possibly. They watch film, too. They should have
seen the film and watched the stats, looked at the stats. I think she just was
able to get open shots.  
Ashleigh is a tough match‑up just because she can hit the perimeter shot, so
if they go bigger, it's usually someone that she's able to be quicker than,
and if they want to help off of her, she can hit open outside shots. But I
think Ashleigh just put forth the right effort to get open. She made great
cuts. She made good reads and just put herself in position to make shots.  
  
Q. Your team went up against girls twice their size. Do you think the fact
that they didn't back down is a testament to their true strength and desire
and determination?  
COACH SOBOLEWSKI: Absolutely. That's kind of how we've been the whole year. If
we're not better than you then we're just going to try to outwork you. That's
our motto. It's written above the doorway in our locker room, "outwork them."
It doesn't matter who we're going against; we're going to scrap and we're
going to play hard, and if we're not as talented as you, we're going to try to
outwork you.  
  
Q. Is it encouraging knowing that that you're only losing Chelsea this
year?  
COACH SOBOLEWSKI: Yeah, yeah, I think we have a very good team returning next
year, four starters returning, and then you've got some people on the bench
who are really developing nicely. Jessa Jeppesen is getting much better, a lot
of our freshmen will be in position to play more. I think our red shirt,
Justine Joudrey, is going to be a very good player. She's got size with the
ability to shoot and handle the ball and get to the basket. She's just got a
great feel for the game.  
So I think our future looks good, looks really good.  
  
Q. Forcing 20 turnovers, obviously that's something you want to do every
game, but what were you able to do as a team to force them into so many
mistakes?  
COACH SOBOLEWSKI: Well, we didn't cause the turnovers by getting up and
pressing, obviously. You saw the game. But what we did was anticipate well and
help off the right people, double‑team where we could. We took charges when we
could. Ash Vella took two really big charges. You probably heard them before
you saw them. And I think we just helped each other out well. We played good
team defense. We got deflections; we knew where to help; we knew what people
could do and what they couldn't do. We backed off the non‑shooters and stayed
tighter on the people who could shoot.  
I thought we did a really good job on No.3 in the first half. She's one of
their top three scorers, and we held her to, I think, two in the first half,
getting all the way out on her.

SPOKANE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+%26+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+SPOKANE)

  

## March 17, 2012

  

### [Shenise Johnson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23621)

### [Katie Meier](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23619)

_SPOKANE, WASHINGTON_  
  

Miami  70  
Idaho State  41

  
COACH MEIER: I guess you've got to start talking about our defense. Idaho
State has some great players, especially that starting lineup of theirs. They
can really score and they take really nice shots. When you look at those
numbers, you've got some of those really great players that they're 10, 10, 10
and 11, and they were 3 for 10, 1 for 10‑‑ that's our defense, because really,
really for them, they're really a nice flow team. They run good sets. They
made us work very, very hard and cover the court.  
You know, north‑souths we're good at. East‑west is something we've been
working on in terms of court coverage, and they're a great sideline to
sideline team. They move the ball so well. We exhausted ourselves, but it
worked out well for us because I think that the tempo and our defense was the
story of the game.  
  
Q. Talk about how you had absolute confidence in this team and you come up
with your most lopsided win ever in the tournament. Just talk about the team's
mental state. I would think coming into this game it seemed like everything
was ‑‑  
COACH MEIER: Yeah. I told you yesterday that I knew we would play our tails
off. I knew we would. Nobody held back. We have a saying that you have to
support the pressure. If I'm going to go out on a limb and exhaust myself on
ball pressure, then the other four behind me better support that effort. And
we supported the pressure today, and whatever defense we were in, somebody was
working, working, working that point guard. I think we really grinded out
their point guards. They started the game and they had their head up, and by
the end of the game ‑‑ by the very end of the game I think we had worn them
down.  
But that was probably seven different people that had that job for us, and we
just kept rotating, rotating, rotating, but it was all for the support behind
them.  
You'll be a little riskier if you know your team has got your back behind you,
and that's what tonight ended up being.  
  
Q. Just talk about the size advantage inside, getting the ball to Pepper,
getting the ball to Sylvia early and the way you just dominated inside.  
SHAWNICE "PEPPER" WILSON: Well, I knew coming into this game that I would have
an advantage. Obviously I'm 6'6", and their tallest player is about 6'1",
6'2". So before the game we discussed how it's important for us to use our
size and our strength as an advantage, so we talked about it, and our main
thing was just execute, and we came out on top.  
  
Q. Shenise, can you talk about the team's play in the first half and how you
guys were able to jump out and sort of take control of the team, your work
especially in that half?  
SHENISE JOHNSON: Yes, we also talked about that yesterday, as well, in the
press conference. We didn't want to come down on our heels, we wanted to
dictate everything that happened out there, and we showed that tonight. We
were very excited. We wanted to show who we were and just take an opportunity
to basically show who Miami is, and we were on our toes tonight.  
  
Q. Shenise, question about Idaho State and what you saw from them out
there.  
SHENISE JOHNSON: They moved the ball very well. They had a lot of screens and
a lot of action going on. We had to stay alert the entire game. They cut in
front of our face a lot of times. Coach kept yelling at us, saying, Don't let
them cut in front of your face, but we couldn't help it. But we had people
behind us supporting it. But I thought Idaho State did a great job of moving
the ball, as I said previously. They were very scrappy, physical, and they
played their hearts out, as well.  
  
Q. Coach Meyer, it seemed like Idaho State really wanted to get physical
with you guys. There was a couple times where players were back and forth, a
hard foul. What did you see from them?  
COACH MEIER: Well, we expect that. We expect it and respect it. Go ahead and
come at us. We want to be great and we want to be challenged, and we want
somebody to find something that they think we're not great at and try to
expose us for it because this whole season we've just been on a journey, and I
think they thought one of their advantages was to push us off some of our cuts
and try to slow us down, and I think that was really smart. He's a great
coach. I loved it, I loved seeing it, and I loved how we responded to it.  
  
Q. You held them to 16 points in the first half. I know that was a season
low for Idaho State. How good was your defense compared to the rest of your
games this year?  
COACH MEIER: I think that we had a complete and 100 percent commitment to each
other on the defensive end. I think there was no question that we understood
our schemes.  
I told you yesterday, too, we're a very conceptual team. If we get our
concepts and we see it developing, then we can play to our instincts, and I
thought the staff did a nice job of prepping that, and we saw some
opportunities that we could get and then you could see them unfolding that
made us even faster than we are, that made us quicker than we are, because we
had done a great job mentally of preparing and visualizing what we thought our
opportunities would be. That's why it was so fun for me to see some of those
freshmen making some high‑level reads and steals like Suriya McGuire, Michelle
Woods, just broke on the ball.  
My favorite play of the game, however, was Pepper's steal from the backcourt,
and she broke on the ball. That's not something that we practice a lot, that
we want Pepper to be breaking on the ball for what we call the pick six, and I
thought she did a fantastic job. Pepper was really into it today, and I was
really happy for her.  
  
Q. Would you talk a little bit about obviously a different lineup and how
that affected your pattern rotations and things like that and how they
responded to it?  
COACH MEIER: Right. I think we probably had less possessions as we sort of
kicked through more of our offensive sets a little bit, and not as much of our
early offense showed up and then not as much of our late offense showed up for
the first ten seconds of the shot clock and the last ten. We're just a
different team now.  
So we talked about that in our preparation, and we talked about it just now in
the locker room, how we can't just sort of jog through our basic sets and then
think that there's a ten, nine, eight, seven, six thing waiting for us. It's
not. So we just have to grow up a little bit more.  
But I actually think‑‑ I haven't seen my stats, but we talk about one point
per possession. We try to be a one‑point‑per‑possession team. I actually
thought, except for our turnovers, which I think is a function of just being
disjointed and having some lineups that are different, but offensively in
terms of execution we probably were right about at a point per possession, it
was just less possessions for us.  
  
Q. I guess obviously this is a close ‑knit group. Facing adversity the way
you are coming into this tournament, do you see it even more so off the court?
Did you notice it just in the body language today?   
COACH MEIER: I'll tell you what: Adversity is something that that's not‑‑ we
don't have any real adversity. We have opportunity right now, we really do.
You know, I grew up in a family where my mother was pregnant with me and had
three kids and she was 27 years old and my father was killed in a plane crash.
That's adversity. We're talking about a sport here. We're talking about
basketball. We're talking about opportunity. And that's just how I see life.
So something happened and we turned it into an opportunity, and I'm happy for
everyone that did.  
  
Q. I talked with Idaho State a little bit about your pressure defense, more
so the one ‑one‑three, the two‑three. Can you go into that, what you try to
look for? Obviously you have a lot of length on the defensive end, but what
are you trying to disrupt most in other teams on the defensive end?   
COACH MEIER: Yeah, I think that it starts with the ball pressure, and it's
very hard to ask somebody to absolutely exhaust themselves every possession,
but that's their job, okay, so if you're on the point guard and we're just
asking you just grind your legs, burn your legs, you'll see the language we
just keep talking, it doesn't work unless point A is pressure and that person
is one of the most unselfish players on our team. Whoever it is at that time
is just totally giving to the team. They're not going to get to see it.
They're not going to get any stats for it. They're going to be exhausted, and
they just have to basically suck it up and do it.  
And to see everybody willing to do that today started the whole attitude of,
okay, well, if you're going to kill yourself on that ball there, I'm not going
to let you down behind you. I was very proud. I hope it was fun to watch
because I saw it unveil, I thought, I'm really proud of this team, this is
really awesome. This was like a symphony of response, and it was beautiful for
me. But that's how I love to coach. That's why I coach. I love people to be
there for each other.  
  
Q. Krystal moves into the starting lineup, got a couple quick fouls. How
much did that bother you, because you probably wanted her to get a lot of
minutes with that group?  
COACH MEIER: Well, Krystal and Stef were both in foul trouble, and you would
think, wow, we're exposed now, and it just‑‑ the next person slid in and did
their job and we slid in with freshmen and they slid in and did their job and
then we had to take care of the ball a little bit and execute and go into the
post, and the points in the paint ‑‑ and for us to get 32 points in the paint
and for our bench to outscore any other team's bench 23 to 8 is a very big
deal for the University of Miami, and that's nice. I just think we've
adjusted, we'll move forward, and we responded in a way I really needed them
to.  
  
Q. Having seen Gonzaga, can you talk about your impressions of them?  
COACH MEIER: I'm not going to get a lot of sleep from now until that game.
They are awesome. They are awesome. They are awesome. Everything that I'm just
bragging about my team, you can just turn around and say right about Gonzaga
in terms of how they share the ball. They're in sync. I came just for the
second half, but when they need a big three, it's not just one person who can
hit it. Their end‑of‑the‑shot‑clock threes tonight were unbelievable, and I
just wish it was the same kid, but it wasn't. We've got a lot of work to do.
We've got a lot of court that we have to cover.  
They have our respect. They're an incredibly talented team and just so, so, so
well coached. I almost have jealousy about how well coached they are. They're
unbelievable. They get it in terms of concept, in terms of vision, in terms of
finding the open player. They're unbelievable. They've got a heck of a cast.

## March 17, 2012

  

### [Kelly Graves](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23609)

### [Haiden Palmer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23610)

### [Kayla Standish](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23611)

  
_SPOKANE, WASHINGTON_  
  

Gonzaga  86  
Rutgers  73

  
COACH GRAVES: Well, first of all, I do want to congratulate Rutgers on a great
season. Coach Stringer obviously is an idol of a lot of people, a lot of young
coaches, and just a really classy woman, spent some time with our team
yesterday, and I know it meant a lot to them.  
You know, they're a terrific team, but tonight I was just really proud of how
hard we played. That was the main thing. I thought right from the get‑go, we
came out, had a great defensive game plan that they executed perfectly, and we
played hard and got a lot of the hustle balls, the loose balls, the rebounds,
and when you play a team like Rutgers, you'd better play physical and you'd
better play hard, or it's going to be a long night. I'm just really proud of
our team.  
  
Q. Haiden, everyone was talking about how you did have to match this team
physically, and Kelly mentioned there wasn't a team that you had seen that was
this physical, and I know it was a factor but you made it look like it wasn't
much of a factor. Can you talk about just playing with that kind of
physicality and matching this team today?  
HAIDEN PALMER: Yeah, that was one of our focuses because we knew they were so
physical, so we just tried to pack it in a little more so it didn't matter as
much when they tried to push us off screens and stuff like that. But when they
did we boxed out hard and did the little things like you said and just tried
to be tougher than them, play physical.  
  
Q. Kayla, can you talk about the first ten minutes of the game and what the
team was able to accomplish in getting a big lead?  
KAYLA STANDISH: Yeah, the first ten minutes we came out and got off to a good
start, pushing the ball, making our shots.  
Our defensive end I think was‑‑ should be noted because we followed the game
plan like Coach and Haiden both had said. We weren't allowing them to get in
the paint as much as they would like to, so just our defensive end I think
really helped us go forward with our offense.  
  
Q. Talking with the Rutgers players, it was brought up that Haiden, you
caught a one ‑on‑one battle in the second half with Erica Wheeler. What was it
like going against her?   
HAIDEN PALMER: She just hit some tough shots towards the end. Great player,
but we won the game today. I won.  
  
Q. Kayla, just talk about the team's ability down the stretch to answer them
when they looked like they were going to make a push.  
KAYLA STANDISH: Yeah, we made some big buckets. We also made some big free
throws. We got to the free‑throw line numerous times in the last couple
minutes. So yeah, we made‑‑ I guess our offensive plan was to get to the
bucket, and I think we did that, and in different ways, our wings were making
big shots and we were getting it inside a few times, so I think our offensive
plan worked today.  
  
Q. If you could both kind of talk a little bit about you were just so
scrappy on defense, and I think that ‑‑ to me that seemed like it was the
game. Can you talk about how maybe the crowd energized you? You never seemed
to let up. Talk about how the crowd maybe fed that a little bit.   
KAYLA STANDISH: Yeah, first of all, we knew they were going to come out and
play really well. They're a defensive oriented team, so we tried to come out
battling before they could. And then obviously our fans, it was very loud in
there. They were on our side the whole time, so it only helps with our
momentum.  
HAIDEN PALMER: Yeah, same thing. That was our game plan. We knew we were they
were physical, so we couldn't be back on our heels, and the crowd just kept
the momentum going. It's tiring playing like that, and every time I would get
tired they would just stand up and start cheering.  
  
Q. Haiden, obviously a really physical game, but there were gaps that you
seemed to ‑‑ and also you, Kayla, seemed to exploit in the midrange. Can you
talk about what you were trying to find on offense, what you were going for,
especially just seeing match‑ups and finding your shots?   
HAIDEN PALMER: Well, since they were playing so physical and quick, they would
get out of position sometimes. If anyone would drive they would all kind of
crash and that would leave people on the three‑point line open, and just like
you said, try to find open spots and get open shots.  
  
Q. Haiden, can you just talk about finally being on the floor for your first
NCAA Tournament game and what that was like for you?  
HAIDEN PALMER: Oh, it was amazing. I had to stop myself from crying after the
game actually. Biggest game of my life. It was a lot of fun, especially at
home with the crowd, and I love these guys, so it was great getting that win.  
  
Q. On the same lines, how much of a relief is it to get this one based on
what you guys did last year, the pressure of playing in front of your home
crowd, and obviously you being a senior not wanting to go out this early?  
KAYLA STANDISH: Well, it's nice we won our first game. It's another game
closer to our goal. We'll go out and watch this next game, see who we've got
to prepare for. I know the coaches will put together a great game plan just
like they did for this previous game. If we follow the game plan like we did
today and hit open shots like we have been, I think it'll help carry us over.  
Being a senior, it's really nice to not go out on your first game, so yeah,
just carrying our momentum forward till Monday and get some good night rest
and some good food in us.  
  
Q. After the regular season finale against BYU you spoke to the crowd just
about how this team for the last four years is one of the five winningest
programs in the country along with teams like UConn, and today Coach Stringer
was saying that this team was the closest she'd seen to what they'd seen
against UConn. Can you talk about what this program has gone through where
you're being compared to a powerhouse?  
COACH GRAVES: Well, I'll tell you, Coach Stringer is a classy woman, there's
no question about it, and a great coach. Connecticut has won a lot more
national championships than we have, so we'll end the comparison there.  
I think what she was saying when we talked yesterday is we move the basketball
around. You know, we're not a traditional team as far as we don't really look
to break people down on the dribble. Seems like a lot of teams try to do that.
We still do it the old‑fashioned way. We set screens and we hit open jump
shots and we move the ball to different people. But that's quite a compliment
coming from a coach like Coach Stringer. That's pretty cool. But we've got a
ways to go before that comparison is more apt.  
  
Q. When I asked Haiden about her first game, can you talk about her going
off in her first NCAA game?  
COACH GRAVES: Well, she's terrific. She's an amazing player, and when she's
on, she can be one of those players that is difficult to stop. I call it every
once in a while she goes Dwyane Wade on us. There's a reason she wears No.3.
She likes him. She likes to play like him. And from time to time he gets into
those stretches where he can't miss, and sometimes that's good and sometimes
that's bad because I thought from time to time there were some bad shots
taken. But the reality is she's fearless. She is a fearless basketball player,
and even when maybe something doesn't go well for her, she'll make it up with
a key steal or a loose ball that she runs down or a big rebound.  
Tonight she took a charge. She had five steals, she had four assists, she had
20 some odd points. That's quite a night against a really good team. So I'm
just really proud of her, and in her first big game like this in the NCAA
Tournament to come up like that says a lot about her, about her character.  
  
Q. You said yesterday they're the toughest team you've seen, I think, ever.
Do you feel like you ‑‑ or the hardest playing team that you've seen ever. Do
you feel like you out‑toughed them for the majority of the game and how big of
a key was that for you guys?  
COACH GRAVES: Well, I don't know if we out‑toughed them, but I thought we
stood up to them, no question about it. That's their game; they're physical,
they're tough. We've talked about that 100 times already. But we knew that we
had to play that way, and it's in us. You know, it's in us. It doesn't always
come out, but it did tonight, and I thought it did right from the start, and I
think that was really important.  
I thought we set the tone defensively, and sometimes that has not been the
case for us. We've tried to outscore people early and then get tough late. And
I thought tonight they really focused on being tough early, and then that
toughness showed throughout the game. I mean, we built a lead and then they
would come back, and then we would answer the call and build it back up, and
they would come back like great teams do. But every time they made a run, it
seems like we had the answer, and you do that when you're tough, and tonight
we played tough. That +8 on the rebounds is always a telltale sign of a team
playing physical and being tough.

_WEST LAFAYETTE, INDIANA_  
  

South Carolina  72  
Purdue  61

  
COACH VERSYP: South Carolina played a great basketball game tonight. Their
guards collectively had 60 points, which obviously really hurt us. So hats off
to them. We wish them the best of luck. Our kids played exceptionally hard. We
did a lot of good things, but they were just a little better.  
  
Q. KK, how much did their defense disrupt what you guys were trying to do
offensively?  
KK HOUSER: They had good defense, but I think for the most part, at times we
took ourselves out of the game.  
  
Q. Brittany, did you feel like you guys ever got comfortable offensively?  
BRITTANY RAYBURN: No, I don't think so. Like KK said, the amount of turnovers
we had, we took ourselves out of the game, and on each possession it was us
grounding ourselves for the most part, but they were aggressive on defense,
and they got it done.  
  
Q. Was this game as physical as you expected? Was this one of the more
physical games you've played this year?  
KK HOUSER: Yes, I definitely think it was one of the most physical games we
played this year, from post players and the guards.  
BRITTANY RAYBURN: Yes, I have to agree, it was a very physical game, but it
was something that we expected going into it.  
  
Q. Brittany, when you got good shots, it seemed like ‑‑ not just you
personally but the team had some inside and missed. Just those opportunities
in a game like this, you can't let those go, right?   
BRITTANY RAYBURN: Yeah, definitely. I think those are the shots that are
emotion turning. I think that really got them going on the offensive end, and
we missed a shot and they got a rebound and started running. But those are
times where you've got to convert.  
  
Q. KK, where do you think they hurt you with their offense?  
KK HOUSER: I think their guards had a lot of open threes, uncontested shots,
and just taking us off the dribble, and they were pinning our post players and
getting wide‑open shots.  
BRITTANY RAYBURN: Yeah, I agree really. I feel like they were getting a lot of
uncontested shots that got their momentum going and they started knocking down
a lot of shots.  
  
Q. It seemed like in the second half the ball just wasn't going in for you
guys. Were they doing anything different to stifle your shooting?  
KK HOUSER: I just think our shots just weren't falling the first half.  
BRITTANY RAYBURN: Yeah, I agree. I don't think they changed up anything. I
think it was just ourselves, shooting ourselves in the foot.  
  
Q. I know it was the same temperature out there for both teams, but how hot
was it out on the court?  
BRITTANY RAYBURN: Same as it was all week. We've practiced in a it for a while
and we were pretty used to it, but it was definitely pretty warm.  
  
Q. When they get that combination going on offense with their defense, very
dangerous to stop, and you just couldn't come up with that one or two stops
that you needed in the second half?  
COACH VERSYP: Yeah, when we got close they kept running the play where they
pinned the player and we always got called on a foul, and we did it all year
and they did it about seven times and they only called it one time. They were
able to score a lay‑up, driving pinning our post, just moving them totally
across the lane. So obviously we tried to adjust, but that's when they would
come down and score.  
  
Q. Was this as physical a game as you were expecting, and also, do you think
this was one of the more physical games you've had all year?  
COACH VERSYP: Yeah, I mean, we played Duke which was extremely physical, Texas
A&M was very physical. Our Big Ten is physical, and you just have to adjust as
you're playing with a physical game. But I think we were just as physical as
they were.  
  
Q. Did you think that it was their defense? You had 20 turnovers, 13 of
those in the first half. A lot of them you were throwing the ball away and
trying to get into the post.  
COACH VERSYP: Yeah, our guards weren't settled down. Our guards were making
passes that we don't normally make, just playing kind of a little bit more
spastic. We needed to run the plays through, and we didn't run those through,
so that's where we struggled. We didn't execute in the half court.  
  
Q. Can you take a minute and reflect on the careers of the seniors and what
they've meant to the Purdue program?  
COACH VERSYP: Yeah, we just discussed it. We're losing nine people, two
managers as well as a trainer and then our six seniors. You know, they left
their legacy in so many different ways. They're probably the best group of
young women I've ever been around in my coaching career because of what we
have gone through, how they handled almost the death of a teammate, how they
persevered, how their personality and leadership helped our younger players,
how much they taught each and every one of us every day. On and off the court
they're one of the most amazing academic students we've had as a senior class,
as well. They won a Big Ten championship. So we said that we have to keep
getting better every time our seniors graduate, we try to promise that class
that we'll keep winning championships and keep moving on to get a little bit
better.  
  
Q. When you did get some looks you missed them. I think you missed 17 shots
in the paint, some of those pretty routine. Do you feel like you had some
looks when you weren't turning it over and that could have been a little bit
different in the outcome?  
COACH VERSYP: Oh, yeah, when you make shots your defense gets better, you have
more energy. You're not always trying to play catch‑up or behind, and we have
made those shots before. First half we were shooting 55 percent but we had 13
turnovers. Second half we had obviously only seven turnovers but we weren't
making the shots that we normally make.  
  
Q. What kind of impact when Poston got the technical on Sutton and also got
the flagrant, what that did for the game and also what that did for your
team?  
COACH VERSYP: It didn't do anything to the flow, it just got our kids fired
up. There was a lot of things going on out there, and when those things are
called and then you just feel it's an us against the world mentality, our kids
usually respond pretty well.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the season and the ups and downs until this point?  
COACH VERSYP: The only down we had was Drey Mingo blowing her ACL out. That's
the only down we've had. This season was an exceptional season. No one
expected us to finish second in the Big Ten or be Big Ten champs or be rated
in the top 20, so my hat goes off to this group. If you're talking about some
of the losses in February, grandfathers lost, it affects the entire team and
you have injuries and you have the flu. I think the last couple weeks has been
amazing for our group.  
  
Q. What advice would you give to Stanford about how best to challenge South
Carolina?  
COACH VERSYP: I don't really have any advice.

_WEST LAFAYETTE, INDIANA_  
  

South Carolina  72  
Purdue  61

  
COACH STALEY: Just very happy for our team. You know, it was a very
hard‑fought battle. Purdue gave us everything that they had, and I thought our
players took their hits and kept on moving‑‑ not literally hits, just making
baskets, making runs. They were an incredible opponent. The atmosphere was
incredible. So I appreciate all they've done to put object a great first and
second round. Fortunately for us we played well enough to steal a win on their
home court.  
  
Q. Just seemed like the game plan was just to keep attacking, keep shooting.
Was that pretty much the mentality going in against a defense that was tall he
than you?  
MARKESHIA GRANT: The game plan was to get it inside, if not attack the basket.
We're good at getting to the basket and we can use our speed and quickness.  
ALEIGHSA WELCH: And also to get them in foul open up the game for us, so just
to be able to drive the ball in the paint and if their post players came up to
dump it off on to get post touches and just really play our game, and when you
have a good inside game, that opens up the outside game, and that's what it
did for us tonight.  
  
Q. Do you think they were ready for the kind of physical game you presented
to them tonight?  
MARKESHIA GRANT: I think they're a really physical team, so I'm pretty sure
they were ready. They're known to be physical in their conference, and we're
physical in our conference, so I think it was a well‑fought game on both
sides.  
ALEIGHSA WELCH: Just like she said, they threw hits at us, we threw hits at
them. We fought, and we knew that we had to come out here and be physical and
play our game because they are a physical team, no doubt about it. They come
out, they play hard. They wanted this game just as bad as we did, so we knew
we were going to have to out play them because we were on their home court and
they did have that advantage.  
  
Q. Markeshia, can you just talk about what it means, Sweet 16, you guys are
going? What does that mean to you?  
MARKESHIA GRANT: It means so much to me, especially because I'm a senior, and
I've worked so hard just to get to this point, and growing up you always see
the Tennessees, the Stanfords, the UConns playing at this level, and just to
see what we did was just incredible, and then this is the first time Coach
Staley has ever been to a Sweet 16, so it's even more special.  
ALEIGHSA WELCH: You know, the same thing. Me being a freshman, it's just
everything I saw throughout the recruiting process coming true. I saw a lot in
this team that I loved, and I knew that we could be a great team, and we're
just going on and we're proving it practice by practice, game by game. We've
done a lot of successful things this year, but the run is not over.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the poise which you played with? They tried to apply
pressure, you guys just didn't seem to panic. Obviously you had a big bucket
inside and then the emotion just erupted. Can you talk about the panic ‑free
basketball you played with?   
MARKESHIA GRANT: It started in practice. I think we were well prepared. Our
coaches prepared us very well, so we're used to this environment, and we play
in the SEC and we fight day in and day out. We're used to it.  
ALEIGHSA WELCH: I think all the coaches do a good job of just calming us down
when it is the heat of the moment or they have the crowd on their side. They
do a good job of telling us to calm down and play our game. At the end of the
day if we play our game we know we can compete with any team. Just being able
to handle it because like they said, game in and game out, it's nothing we
haven't seen before.  
  
Q. It was rather warm in the arena this week and tonight. Was it warmer than
it was on Saturday, and also, how did you guys deal with that?  
MARKESHIA GRANT: It was quite warm, but we stayed hydrated. I took some
electrolytes before the game and stayed hydrated in timeouts when I came out.
I was warm.  
ALEIGHSA WELCH: And they made sure we were drinking fluids at all times having
wet towels, just making sure we stay hydrated because this wasn't the type of
game we could afford to have somebody come out with cramps and being
dehydrated. Everybody, the managers, the coaches, the bench, did a good job
making sure we stayed hydrated and stayed on track.  
  
Q. At this point in the year making it to the Sweet 16 knowing you had to
turn up the defensive intensity against these guys, would you say this was
your best game as a team so far this season?  
MARKESHIA GRANT: I would it was one of our best. I would say our best was
against Tennessee just because it was the first time in history we had ever
beaten them at Thompson Boling. This match was one of the greatest games we
ever played.  
ALEIGHSA WELCH: I agree with her. We played great team basketball, and that's
the thing that we go out and strive to do every night. I wouldn't say it's our
best team effort this year, but it's definitely up there in the top three, top
five, but being that the stage was so much higher, I think it's one of the
best we've had of late.  
  
Q. Can you both talk about the team's elevated play? I know you sorted
hinted on it, but offensively ‑‑ we know what you can do defensively, but
offensively we've seen such an outburst from you in the last two tournament
games that we really haven't seen down the stretch of the season from you
girls.   
MARKESHIA GRANT: I think we're just being confident and executing a game plan.
As I said, we talked about going inside to the post, and if they weren't
getting it, we would drive. I think we're just getting confident with what
we're doing.  
ALEIGHSA WELCH: And defense has been our staple for the whole season, so we
know that we can bring defense night in and night out, but when we bring both
to the table, defense and offense, I think we're a really hard team to beat
because when we're making buckets but also getting stops that's the best of
both worlds. I think we're starting to click more. We are starting to click
more now, and we are getting up shots, we are getting up good looks, and we
are hitting shots. When we have the defense that we bring every night and then
also bring out a consistent offense, we're really hard to beat.  
  
Q. I know coach has a 24 ‑hour rule. Do you think she'll let you celebrate
this a little longer?   
MARKESHIA GRANT: I think she will but we've got to get back to class tomorrow,
so classes first.  
ALEIGHSA WELCH: I think we might get like 26 maybe. We've got to go ahead and
look forward to the next game. Right now it's just win or go home, so we can't
really dwell too much on this win. We'll celebrate it for tonight, go into
tomorrow, but once it's back to practice we've got to prepare for the next
team we've got coming up.  
  
Q. Markeshia alluded to it, but can you talk about what it means as a coach
to make it to the Sweet 16 and also what it means to the program, first time
in ten years?  
COACH STALEY: Well, obviously this was a game in which in my coaching career I
could never get over the hump. Part of the reason was at Temple I thought we
were a player or two away from being able to get over this hump and get into
the Sweet 16, and I think that the coaching, coming to this University of
South Carolina, being in a position to play against some of the best talent,
the best coaches, I think it prepares you a lot better when you play in a
bigger conference and you're able to recruit a different type of player.  
So I'm very happy what it does to our program. Does it legitimize our program?
To a certain degree. I think our program has been through so much in the past
four years that I'm very happy because it goes to show that we've done it the
right way. I don't think we've cut corners. I think we stood by our
principles, and our kids really bought into the process of doing things the
right way, so I'm very happy, and they as student athletes, especially our
seniors, will be able to go on when they leave the University of South
Carolina and know if you do things the right way, success will come your way.  
  
Q. I have to ask, what was going through your mind as you saw the clock
winding down and the zeros finally?  
COACH STALEY: Well, the clock could not wind down any quicker. I was looking
at it wanting the time‑‑ Coach McCray and I always give each other a little
look to speed the clock up, and it wouldn't go down any quicker.  
But just very happy. You know, just very, very happy for our players, very
happy for our coaches who have worked extremely hard to put our players in a
position to be successful. It's a happy time. It's a great day to be a
Gamecock.  
  
Q. Those two games in Indiana you've really shot well, put up a lot of
points. How do you take that on the road with you to Fresno?  
COACH STALEY: Well, we're going to keep doing what we're doing. I think our
preparation has been good, our focus has been good, and I think the fact that
we're not playing inside our conference. When you go outside your conference
you're seeing a little different competition. They don't know you as well as
some of our conference teams, and I think we find some mismatches on the
offensive end and we're able to capitalize on them.  
  
Q. Coach Versyp talked about what was different in this game for them was
when your forwards pinned their forwards back on rebounds, usually they were
getting the calls in the Big Ten and they weren't getting them tonight. Did
you get a sense at all that that was a little different and is that different
in the SEC, how that usually works?  
COACH STALEY: Well, I mean, we have to play a certain way. We're smaller. I
think our post players, my hat goes off to them because they give up inches
and pounds every single night, so we try to do things to offset some of the
deficiencies that we have. You know, I mean, we've done it all year long. I
thought they did get a couple of calls in the second half when it came to
sealing. But for us we can't change who we are and what we've done to get us
here.  
  
Q. Sort of a two ‑part question. Can you talk about the poise with which
your team seemed to play in that second half? You got the lead and Purdue kept
trying to punch back. Also talk about how you have so many different players
who seem to step up in key moments when you need the most?  
COACH STALEY: Well, I think part of the reason we were so poised, we've been
working with Ieasia Walker for the past three years and running our basketball
team, and I think she played probably her best basketball game as a point
guard, just controlling the tempo. She took shots and took advantage of taking
shots. She was aggressive offensively. She D'd up defensively, so I think she
had a lot to do with how poised we were down the stretch.  
What was the second part of your question?  
  
Q. Just the depth of your team. A lot of different players seemed to step up
at different moments when the team really needed someone to take control.  
COACH STALEY: Well, all season long I think we've been that kind of team, it's
just this particular weekend I thought all of our players rose to the
challenge, and I think we were just hitting on all chords, Markeshia,
La'Keisha in the first half, Ieasia in the second half, taking advantage of
what was given to us and just knocking down shots. We haven't really been that
efficient, but we were efficient tonight and we rose to the challenge of
beating a very good Purdue team on their home court.  
  
Q. Have you had a chance to speak to your team?  
COACH STALEY: I spoke to the team.  
  
Q. What did you tell them?  
COACH STALEY: I told them I thought they were special. They executed the game
plan incredibly. I've said that a lot this particular year, but to do it on
this stage, a stage which they've never been, was incredible, because we
fought with them, they fought with us, and I think they finally get to see
when they stick to a game plan at this stage of the game, they find some
success. I know they're going to listen a little bit more, okay, they're going
to listen a little bit more because when you find success in something, it's
tangible, and they're tangible kids.  
  
Q. I asked the players about that 24 ‑hour rule we always talk about. Is it
going to get an extension?  
COACH STALEY: We're going to enjoy it. We are going to enjoy it from a
coaching standpoint. But we do have to turn a page. We have to prepare. I
think Stanford won. Stanford will be our opponent. We're already halfway
through the scouting report with that. We are going to enjoy it. We've enjoyed
the journey thus far, so we will continue to do that, but rules are rules.  
  
Q. Halfway through already?  
COACH STALEY: Meaning halfway through enjoying this moment.

_WEST LAFAYETTE, INDIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: The No.5 seed will play Purdue tomorrow evening. We are joined
on the dais by Head Coach Dawn Staley, also Charenee Stephens La'Keisha
Sutton.  
  
Q. After watching the game yesterday, looks like you have interchangeable
parts on defense, what's your approach, do you feel like you have a clear ‑cut
No.1 individual defender?   
COACH STALEY: I think collectively, we play defense as a team. We do have some
parts in which we feel comfortable on certain match‑ups, and we feel like
Keisha Sutton is the one that really is the player that we use to stop our
opponent's leading scorer. She's done it time and time again. She's done it
ever since she got to South Carolina four years ago and we are comfortable
with her having that duty.  
  
Q. How do you think going through the SEC season has prepared you for a game
against Purdue, a team that obviously will draw a lot of fans today and has
had a pretty good history in the NCAA?  
COACH STALEY: I think any time you're in an unfamiliar place, the NCAA
Tournament against this particular team and being in the second round, you
have to draw on some experience to keep it very familiar to you as much as
possible.  
We have talked to our players about playing Vanderbilt at Vanderbilt when they
were undefeated at home; knowing that they were going to draw a large crowd;
playing Tennessee in Knoxville, something that had not been done in a lot of
years, a lot of decades for us.  
And also playing in the semifinals in the SEC Tournament where we felt like
Tennessee had a home crowd and we fared fairly well in all of those games and
we'll draw on all of those experiences to help us with this situation.  
  
Q. For both players, you're taking on your 11th ‑ranked opponent this
season. Describe the mind‑set you have going into games of this magnitude and
against high‑level competition like a Purdue basketball team.   
CHARENEE STEPHENS: Well, I think we have been in this situation before. Coach
has said it best and we have said it; that we are going to prepare like we
prepared for everyone this season. We are going to go out starting today‑‑ we
watched them a little bit. We are going to go out today and I think our
coaches have really put something together where we can prepare and put
something out on the court that we'll get a win.  
LA'KEISHA SUTTON: I pretty much agree with Charenee. We have been in these
situations before against other basketball teams and we are going to prepare
the same way. Just different personnel. We have to get familiar with their
players, and we have done that a little bit last night and this morning, so we
are pretty confident.  
  
Q. A couple days ago, you talked about your offense's inconsistency. Can
there be any carryover from yesterday with how well you played offensively, or
is Purdue a different opponent and different defense?  
COACH STALEY: You know, obviously we scored the most points we scored all
season long. Hopefully we'll have some carryover from having scored the most
points we have scored in that basketball game and the least amount of point
the scored.  
We know Purdue. We are familiar with them a little bit. We watched their
championship. For us, we just take each opponent, we know they play man‑to‑man
primarily, so you know, we are prepared for the elbow; it's something we have
not seen in quite some time. So whatever defenses they throw out there,
hopefully our offense can knock down some shots.  
  
Q. What does man ‑to‑man present to you differently in how you guys might
operate?   
CHARENEE STEPHENS: Well, honestly, I like when teams play us in man‑to‑man,
because it gives us a chance to go out and show what we can do against one
person; it's like an iso‑type of situation.  
I feel like our guards, they really take on the challenge of man‑to‑man. And I
think I do a good job, and my fellow post players, we do a good job of sealing
the paint and stuff like that. So it takes a move and being confident and
getting into the paint and getting a score.  
LA'KEISHA SUTTON: I agree with Charenee. I like when teams play us man‑to‑man,
as well, because it gives us opportunity to spread the floor out and use the
one‑on‑one moves that we worked on in practice and that we've been taught to
try to create from offense and get some points in the paint whether it's from
our guards or our post players; so it's a good thing.  
  
Q. Last night Sharon Versyp said that they have got a lot of players that
can score 20 points, and you don't really know where it's going to come from.
What kind of challenges does that present to a defense when you don't have ‑‑
when you are facing that kind of a challenge?   
COACH STALEY: Well, you know, obviously Purdue has some very skilled players
and they are pretty much‑‑ they are a machine when it comes to offensively.
They do have some skills. They do have some players that they stretch you out
a little bit.  
I think that what has been our MO all season long is try to disrupt what they
are trying to do. So I'm very comfortable with the amount of ball pressure
that we exert on basketball teams and I don't think we are going to approach
it any differently. We are who we are at this point. I don't think we are
going to abandon how we play; how we play the game, according to, you know,
who they have as far as offensive power.  
LA'KEISHA SUTTON: Like I said before, we have been in situations playing SEC
against the best athletes or the best guards in the country, so like coach
said, we are pretty comfortable in our defense and we are just going to guard
them the same way. So nothing that we are going to do different defensively.
We just wanted to bring it the same way we have been bringing it all season.  
  
Q. I know we talked about it briefly yesterday. But knowing game time is
approaching, it's practice today; knowing you never have been past the second
round, is there anything in particular you're trying to do differently this
time around. Maybe that you learned from your mistakes at Temple going into
those type of games in a second round game?  
COACH STALEY: Nothing different. I think we have to seize the moment. I think,
you know, the law of averages, we are going to try (chuckling).  
For us, it's all about being familiar with and keeping the same mind‑set. I
don't think we would do anything differently at Temple as far as our approach
and how we prepare. You know, knocking down some shots really helps when it
comes to getting your team to the next round and playing in the second weekend
of the tournament.  
  
Q. Your impressions of what Courtney Moses did yesterday for Purdue.  
COACH STALEY: (Laughter) Well, I mean, you know, any time a player is that
hot, I think she was in the zone. I think any time you break NCAA records of
any sort, you know, it's an eye‑opener for you.  
I will have to revert back to looking at what we do against three‑point
shooters. I like what we have done the entire year. We don't allow you to get
up as many three‑point shooters. At some point‑‑ at some point you just have
to stick with it. You have to stay attached to it and you have to not let her
take those outside threes. And even when she's got it going on, maybe even
double her at times at the rate that she was shooting the basketball.  
  
Q. From a player's standpoint, is there a different kind of confidence
offensively today, knowing what you guys did yesterday on that end of the
floor?  
LA'KEISHA SUTTON: It's a huge confidence boost because we hit shots and were
able to score easy in transition. Just knowing that we were able to hit shots,
we are going to go and do the same thing on Monday and penetrate and kick it
out or go inside to our post players. So we are confident that we'll make the
same kind of shots.  
  
Q. You had referenced the three ‑point defense; you lead the country in
three‑point percentage defense. Purdue sets a lot of screens to free up those
shooters. Do you have a certain defensive philosophy you always use to defend
the three? Will you go under screens, over screens, or do you mix it up
depending on the opponent?  
COACH STALEY: Well, I'm not going to tell you (laughter).  
You know, for us, we like players that like to shoot three‑point shots and put
the ball on the floor. And I don't think there's any secret to that. It's just
not allowing them to take attempts. That's our motto. We like our chances and
you two‑ing us to win basketball games than three‑ing us.  
  
Q. Is that a philosophy that teams try to use against you when you were a
player, try to make you uncomfortable out on the three ‑point line?   
COACH STALEY: Yeah, I think teams do. You know, as far as my position, I
wasn't really a three‑point shooter. You know, they try to disrupt the point
guard and that's how you can disrupt most teams is you cut their head off and
the rest will follow.  
But for us, you know, we know that they have a couple players that they play
at the point, but you know, primarily, they usually play Houser at the point
guard position. We are going to try to get under her skin as we have done time
and time again throughout the season, and hopefully that will have some
lingering effect on those shooters.  
  
Q. South Carolina and Purdue have three common opponents, Illinois, Penn
State and Auburn. Do you draw anything out of those similarities, or is it too
far back in the season to go back?  
COACH STALEY: It's too far back. I think you do have to look at Penn State,
because Penn State did have some success against them. I think they split‑‑ or
was Purdue 2‑1? So they split. We did watch a little bit of that. But we know
Purdue is playing their best basketball at this time.  
So, you know, we have to be ready for them to play their best basketball
tomorrow night.  
  
Q. Besides the man ‑to‑man defense, what else did you notice about Purdue,
some of the traits that they have looking at them, and are they similar to any
teams you faced in the SEC?  
CHARENEE STEPHENS: Most definitely. They have big post players who are
effective with two feet in the paint. And we have seen that; I know time and
time again we have gone up against some really big post players who are really
effective down low. I think we are just going to try to push them out of paint
and keep them off of the boards. That's really the key thing by any means
necessary. No extra possessions.  
LA'KEISHA SUTTON: Well, as far as their guards, they have really good shooting
guards, so we need to make them uncomfortable and really pressure the ball.  
  
Q. Just talk about the mind ‑set defensively you guys like to play. You guys
like to maybe push teams around and be more physical, or do you see yourselves
as more of a full‑pressure, like‑to‑run‑teams‑out‑of‑the‑gym type of
mentality?   
CHARENEE STEPHENS: We like to mix it up. Of course we like to hit first and we
like to be the enforcers and we like to set the tone. And also, we do have a
lot of athleticism on the team, so we like to run and gun and we like to get
the ball up the floor; post players running rim‑to‑rim, sealing; just showing
that we are good athletes, but we are strong, as well.  
LA'KEISHA SUTTON: Well, I definitely think that we take pride in our defense,
and we are committed to being defenders. You have the best three‑point
shooter, and we are going to commit to try to limit her production, or lock
her down completely. And I'm just thinking about Vandy and Foggie, their best
three‑point shooter, and we did a pretty good job against her.  
I'm just thinking about my first couple of years with Angie Bjorklund from
Tennessee; so we are definitely used to it. So it's going to be 40 minutes of
battle tomorrow night.  
  
Q. Three out of past four games, 70 ‑plus from the free throw line, 11 for
14. Anything going differently, or have I just jinxed it?   
COACH STALEY: I did notice it. I think one of our coaches, Coach Boyer,
doesn't like for us to mention when we shoot well from the free throw line.  
I like to balance it because when we shoot a whopping 30percent from the free
throw line, I say, wow, this is how we lost the basketball game.  
But when we are shooting in the 70s, we increase our chances of winning. And
we definitely have to get to the cherry stripe tomorrow night in order for us
to win this basketball game, and shoot 70 percent or above.  
  
Q. How important of a win would it be for this program to get become to the
Sweet16 for the first time since 2002?  
COACH STALEY: Well, I think would be‑‑ you know, it's a tribute to our players
being committed to something. I think they really believe in one another, and
it will go to show that once you have an incredible belief in something, that
you know, it's tangible and it can take place.  
So I say to our team, it's been a tremendous ride, and why not the University
of South Carolina playing in the Sweet16.  
THE MODERATOR: South Carolina, ladies, thank you very much. Good luck tomorrow
evening.

### [Sharon Versyp](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16880)

  
_WEST LAFAYETTE, INDIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We welcome the Boilermakers. Coach Sharon Versyp, Antoinette
Howard and Brittany Rayburn.  
  
Q. Could you just talk about South Carolina's defense and what you've seen
from them? Obviously they are pretty good on that side of the ball.  
COACH VERSYP: Well, they have a lot of quickness. They have long arms. I think
down low, they are a very physical basketball team. They are a little
under‑sized, so they use their athleticism and their physicality exceptionally
well.  
They try to disrupt you, so when they take chances, you have to make sure that
you take care of the basketball and find the openings. And you cannot allow
them, obviously, to rally you and get turnovers to get in transition. They
love the transition baskets.  
  
Q. Just their three ‑point defense in particular is very good, I think just
No.1 in the country, and allowing just 21 percent. Why is it good and what do
you do, obviously you guys have hit some three‑pointers before. What do you do
to counteract that?  
COACH VERSYP: I think how we set screens. We are changing that a little bit
for this game, how they are setting greens. I think if they are switching on
on‑ball screens, obviously you don't have to take the 3s. You can have a lot
of slip‑cuts and look for other opportunities. They trap on ball screens, so
that's why they take away the 3s quite a bit. But if you can get a good
rotation, and allow that double‑team to be dragged out a little bit, you might
be able to have a wide open look.  
But, you know, they are very quick. They close out well. But again, we have
played against some pretty tough defenses.  
  
Q. The way your team screens, how does that all come together? Are players
coming out of high school like the best screeners in the world, or is it a
situation you take some time once they are in the college game to master that
art?  
COACH VERSYP: Well, I appreciate that you do think that we screen well
(laughing) because I don't think we screen. No, what we do, young kids,
fundamentals, they are not working on screening. They are working on handles
in their one‑on‑one game. They are working on their offense.  
It's just understanding and trusting the offenses and seeing where the good
shots are coming and where the rotation is for offensive rebounding and those
type of things. But you know, we have some very good screeners and we have
some that are just in an area (laughter).  
No, we have done a good job. We really spend a lot of time on it, and we
always try to get better at what we feel might be a strength.  
  
Q. I think Brittany would defend that some of your post players do screen
pretty well; you're getting some openings. How has that process evolved for a
shooter, working off those screens?  
BRITTANY RAYBURN: It's amazing, you come off a screen or a double screen and
you're wide open and you're like, oh, okay, somebody nailed somebody because
you can't see it when you're trailing behind it.  
But obviously we work on it a lot in practice. A lot of our plays have a lot
of screens in it, and the people that are setting screens are doing a great
job to get everybody open that's coming off of them.  
  
Q. Just wonder if you can talk about how far Brittany has come in her four
years here, because I remember seeing her start down at Indiana as a freshman,
I don't know if you remember that game or not.  
COACH VERSYP: Well, I think any player that comes in as a freshman, having an
opportunity to play as many minutes, they are just going to continue to grow
and develop. They are very hungry as a freshman to try to learn and try to do
whatever they can for their team.  
You know, everybody knew that Brittany was a scorer, but as she's grown
through her career, it's understanding the offenses, playing one through four,
being a better defender, taking charges, anticipating defensively and a
rotation or help side.  
Her growth of the game, but her leadership skills have obviously developed
this senior year all the way through.  
  
Q. What's the advantage of having the game here at Mackey?  
ANTIONETTE HOWARD: Playing at Mackey, like I said in many interviews before in
my three years here, it's like nothing I've ever experienced before. Just
having that sixth man is incredible. Our band is the top band in the country I
think.  
So being able to play in front of them I think motivates us a little bit more.
When we get a little tired, we look up at all of our fans and the band, and we
just get that extra push that we need. For me, playing in my last game of my
senior year, I couldn't ask for any better than that.  
BRITTANY RAYBURN: I think our band is amazing and our fans are amazing. We can
come out of the tunnel and you can hear them, the uproar that they bring. It's
a great feeling; it really gets you going and gets your team going entering
the game. As seniors, I think we both are excited to be able to play again in
the NCAA Tournament and to finish out the year playing at home and hopefully
push us farther in the tournament.  
  
Q. Can you talk about your guys's transition defense and how important that
might be tomorrow night against a team that's pretty athletic and would like
to get up ‑and‑down the court a little bit?   
ANTIONETTE HOWARD: Well, we have been working on transition a lot lately. We
just have to get back, find shooters in transition. I think that was really
important, especially the last game. But especially being able to stop the
post players in the paint because their post players do run the floor well.  
You just have to find somebody. You won't always find your own man, but as
long as you find somebody, I think we can slow them down a bit.  
  
Q. Your team has nine players who have been in the NCAAs and this is a first
for all of the players of South Carolina. What advantage does that give you
that most of your roster has been through this before?  
COACH VERSYP: Well, any time you have experience, just have a little bit more
confidence. Sometimes when it's your first time, you don't think about
anything, and sometimes that's a good result. But you know, when you have
experience, you have confidence. And again, playing at home, obviously that is
a big advantage for us. You know, so it's different every year because you
have a different team.  
  
Q. Where do you fall on the screening pyramid here?  
ANTIONETTE HOWARD: I might be in between. I mean, sometimes I nail them pretty
good and others, just slide right by me. I try my best but playing with
Brittany and C‑Mo and KK, you want to set good screens where you can get them
open, because you know they will knock down the open shot. So, it's a process.
It's a process. But I'm definitely working at it and‑‑  
COACH VERSYP: She does a good job.  
ANTIONETTE HOWARD: Well, there it is. (Laughter).  
  
Q. Brittany, before Senior Day, with those activities, you kind of knew
maybe it wouldn't be your last game at Mackey Arena, but this will be your
last game at Mackey Arena. Your thoughts and how important it is just to come
out and play well? Obviously you want to advance, but your long four years
playing here at Mackey.  
BRITTANY RAYBURN: I think it's exciting. You always want to play at home, and
to be the last game, we are blessed to be able to play two more games here.
Senior Night was awesome, and we did have that in the back of our mind I'm
sure that hopefully we would be able to play here a couple more games.  
For it to be realistically coming to an end, I think it just gives us that
much more incentive to want to play hard and get that win.  
  
Q. Have you had any interaction with any of the players since South Carolina
back in AAU ball? Do you have any experience against any of these players that
you'll be facing tomorrow?  
ANTIONETTE HOWARD: I've played with a few of them actually. Being in Georgia,
you play with a lot of different players. And so a few of them play for the
Metros and teams all around Georgia, and, so yes, I have played with them.  
They are very physical, competitive. I remember in AAU days where we stayed
after and played five‑on‑five. So I know where going to be really competitive.
Everybody wants to win. Everybody is going to get on the floor and get after
the ball, so it will be a good matchup for us.  
BRITTANY RAYBURN: I personally have not met any of them previous to this.  
  
Q. With 13 days between games, were you surprised how crisp your offense was
early yesterday?  
COACH VERSYP: I thought it started out crisp, but I also felt like we were a
little sluggish, as in just getting up‑and‑down and playing a game. When you
don't play for two weeks, you can't really simulate that in practice. So even
the players felt when we came in at halftime, just had to catch that second
breath.  
And then after the first four minutes of the second half, then I felt like we
were totally back to ourselves. But I thought that they totally understood the
game plan and executed it to a T; being able to score 16 points that quickly,
we did a fantastic job that way. But I think it was more getting their breath
back and their legs actually playing the game.  
  
Q. When you had a chance to watch South Carolina play and also watch a
little bit of some of them, what stood out about them?  
ANTIONETTE HOWARD: Like I said, they are very physical. They get up‑and‑down.
I think their on‑ball defense is really good and they are really scrappy. It's
postseason, so really anything can happen, but they played like a team that
wants to be in the tournament and they want to go far.  
BRITTANY RAYBURN: I think the biggest thing that I saw is they are mixing up
their defense, really throwing out a lot of different things, and that's
confusing to play against foremost team and I think that's the biggest thing
we are looking at, trying to get adjusted to how they play defense. And like
'Nette said, they are a very aggressive team and just something that we have
to look forward to.  
  
Q. Which of the Gamecocks did you play against when you were in AAU ball?  
ANTIONETTE HOWARD: Charenee and Markeshia, I played against those two. But
like I said, many of the other players, I played with them actually in
practice. Some of the other players I played against on the AAU circuit.  
  
Q. Are these two teams similar in a way where it's a defense ‑first
approach, and how do you feel about your defense going against their offense
tomorrow?   
COACH VERSYP: We feel pretty confident. I mean, both teams are defensive
teams. Both offenses have said they have been inconsistent throughout the
year, but I think ours has really picked up the last‑‑ over the last two,
three weeks. You know, so I think it's going to be a battle of defense, a
battle of the boards in transition defense. I think those are going to be the
big key, and if a couple people can knock down the 3s.  
  
Q. Three common opponents, Auburn, Penn State, Illinois; gain anything out
of watching those games, or too far back in the season to really gain
anything?  
COACH VERSYP: We looked at those games as a coaching staff. We showed them a
couple clips of things that we feel that we could be successful with. But you
know, they are a different style team. They have improved tremendously. We
have improved tremendously, changing little things defensively that they have
done. So at least we have seen what our other conference teams, especially
Illinois and Penn State, has been able to do.  
But right now, it's just playing the game.  
  
Q. When you're playing a team that plays defense from the 3 ‑point line as
well as they do, is it just a matter of taking advantage of the opportunities
that you might have a little bit of space when they present themselves?   
BRITTANY RAYBURN: Yeah, I think the key for us will be being patient, working
within our offense, letting things play out and really going to the shot clock
a little bit and really be patient enough to let the holes open up for us.  
THE MODERATOR: Good luck to the Boilermakers tomorrow evening.

_WEST LAFAYETTE, INDIANA_  
  

Purdue  80  
South Dakota State  68

  
COACH JOHNSTON: Congratulations to Purdue. It was a good day. The final score
got away from us there in the last five, six minutes. But I thought overall we
played well in a lot of areas. We didn't execute very well defensively,
especially in the second half. It's a lot of mental breakdowns I thought which
led to some really good looks on Purdue's side of things. And just didn't
break away a couple of times offensively when we had chances.  
I kind of felt going into the game this was going to be a half court
possession, possession, possession game, and in that style they're probably a
little bit better than we are and I think some of that showed. When they
needed some big shots they got the right people the ball and made a lot of big
ones. Moses was really good. We lost her a lot on a lot of screens along the
baseline, and that cost us.  
But overall very proud of our team, too. We did a lot of good things, just not
enough to keep moving forward in the tournament.  
  
Q. Jill, can you talk about trying to slow down their guards? Probably
needed to pay attention to a couple of them. Was that what happened tonight
perhaps?  
JILL YOUNG: Yeah, they just have really good guards, and they're all good
shooters, quick, athletic, and we just lost them on screens. Sometimes we
miscommunicated, and they're just really good at passing and screening and
just giving the person the ball when they're open.  
  
Q. She had those two back to back there after you got it within striking
distance in the second half. Did it just seem like every time you guys sort of
got close, she in particular came up with a shot?  
JILL YOUNG: Yeah, she shot really well for them and hit a lot of big shots
when they needed them, or when we kind of hit a few baskets, then she'd come
down and the crowd would react to that. So I guess that was tough.  
  
Q. Jennie, this was the closest in the second half you guys have been since
that win. How were you feeling at that point when you got within two in the
second half?  
JENNIE SUNNARBORG: Yeah, definitely. We had good momentum going into the
second half, and it was just hard when the other team, they're hitting big
shots and we're not scoring ourselves. It just kind of got away from us, and
we couldn't respond to it.  
  
Q. Jill, you've done what Moses did to a lot of teams before. Was it weird
being on the other side of that, watching a shooter kind of go crazy?  
JILL YOUNG: Well, it wasn't as fun, I guess. Yeah, you know, she's a really
good shooter, and like you said, we just lost her on screens.  
  
Q. Jennie, last go for you and Jill. You guys looked aggressive, though, and
not timid and like you were going down swinging. Did you feel that way
throughout?  
JENNIE SUNNARBORG: Yeah, I think Jill and I going into this game, we're
seniors, we're going to fight as much as we can and do everything we possibly
can to get a win, and that just didn't happen for us today, which is a
disappointment, but we hope Purdue goes further in the tournament.  
  
Q. Jill, how much did Houser's ball pressure and some of her being very
active on defense maybe take you guys out of a little bit of offensive rhythm
early on?  
JILL YOUNG: I guess we came into the game expecting them to pick up and
pressure the guards. I guess maybe that slowed us down at times, taking time
off the shot clock and trying to bring it up with a defender on us.  
  
Q. Jill, just talk about this run, getting back here for a fourth year in a
row and having the men do it, too, and what kind of benefits you think the
school and the two programs and everybody associated with it might have.  
JILL YOUNG: It was just really special to be a part of. We both had great
seasons, and to win the tournament in Sioux Falls, I know the state really got
behind us and supported us, so yeah, it was just really neat to be a part of,
and I think it drew more attention to South Dakota State.  
  
Q. Katie, was it hot on the floor? It was really hot in the press box.  
KATIE LINGLE: Yeah, it was pretty hot down on the floor.  
  
Q. Did that affect you?  
KATIE LINGLE: I don't think it affected things. We were aware that it was
going to be hot. We practiced in the heat yesterday, so I don't think it
affected anything.  
  
Q. What adjustments were you trying to make defensively on Moses?  
COACH JOHNSTON: Well, we went into it with a game plan to really ‑‑ not quite
base guard any of their perimeter players but not really help, either. I
thought the first three she hit in the first half, we helped on some
penetration and just let her kind of get going, but then from that point on,
she didn't need a lot of space to get shots off.  
Tried showing on some of their down screens from our post players, and I
thought that was effective at times. Other times our post just didn't get up.
I thought our guards were late coming around on screens. Just as a whole
between the screener and our person chasing, we just didn't get to her at
times.  
You know, she's a good player and just so efficient. There's no stat for it,
but they screen as well as any team that we play, and those post players are
excellent at doing that. They know how to get guards open, and it's hard to
get through. That's why they all make so many of those plays off of those
screens.  
  
Q. I saw you shaking your head as I was asking the question about the two
three ‑pointers Moses hit back to back there after you got it down to four.
Was that sort of the critical time?   
COACH JOHNSTON: Yeah, and it's even more critical because it's a home game for
them. Those are big momentum plays. It wasn't just six points, it was a big
momentum change in the game, and really, I think, kind of got us into a point
where we were trying to scramble to get back into it rather than feeling like
we were right there. So the points were obviously‑‑ that's what wins and
loses, but the momentum was the big part of that.  
  
Q. You said yesterday you thought your team had to be tenacious today. Your
thoughts on how they graded out there?  
COACH JOHNSTON: I thought we were pretty good. I didn't think we were great.
We did have a lot of mental lapses in the second half. I won't go into detail
on all of those. But we didn't have a great second half defensively, and when
they started to make some plays and the crowd got going a little bit, then I
think we got a little bit away from what we needed to do.  
But I think our effort level was really good. I thought we were aggressive. I
thought a lot of the things we talked about offensively that we needed to get,
we did get some of those things. So overall I feel like it was a very good
game for us, it's just Purdue played a little better game than we did. But I
was proud of our team.  
  
Q. How much do you think Houser maybe set the tone for them defensively?
This was your second game without stops, how you guys handled the perimeter
there.  
COACH JOHNSTON: Yeah, seems like you think she set the tone. Yeah, I think a
little bit. I don't feel like she just took us out of complete rhythm. There
was a couple times where I thought she had Gaby in trouble in the second half
there, and that's easy to look at that and say, boy, KK is really changing the
game. She's a very good player. I don't know that she completely took us away
from what we wanted to do. I don't know that I would say that. But she's a
good player. She had five steals in the game, so she obviously was a big part
of what they do. By I thought we were able to get into what we want enough to
be successful.  
  
Q. Your thoughts on how your two seniors played? It seemed like both of them
were very aggressive tonight.  
COACH JOHNSTON: I thought their effort level was really good, energy level was
really good, good leaders kind of going throughout the game. I just talked to
them when they came out there with a minute or two or whatever left and said
this game didn't go the way they wanted, but I said overall the reason we're
here playing today on that stage has a lot with those two seniors, not only
this year but throughout their career. They've continued to move us forward.
It wasn't quite enough to move forward in the NCAA Tournament, but we're
better today than we were four years ago because of Jennie and Jill.  
  
Q. Talk about your bench production. Rachel and Katie had very good games
off the bench. What does that make you think about your chances for next
year?  
COACH JOHNSTON: You know, it's interesting, we only graduated two seniors, so
you look at our roster today and think, boy, all those good players are back,
but it's still not really a complete roster because Steph is not on the floor
and then also Megan Waytashek wasn't on the floor. Then we add two really good
players, another point guard, which we've played really without for a while
here. I thought Gaby really progressed this year at the point, as well.  
So next year, even though there will be a lot of the same faces, I think we'll
very different team really because of that point guard position. We'll have a
lot more depth and be I think a lot more consistent. We were playing Jill out
of position a lot, we were playing Steph out of position a lot this year, so
just having more true point guards is going to change our team dramatically, I
think. We'll get back to being a little bit more up tempo and get back to
getting the pace we want out of our offense.  
But we also lose two 1,000‑point scorers in Jill and Jennie, two proven
players that can make big shots and have been in these kind of big moments.
It'll be fun to see how the team evolves over the spring, but we do have a
couple big losses here with Jill and Jennie.  
  
Q. Two ‑part question. Same thing I asked Jill. Talk about what you think
the impact of not only you guys getting a fourth year in a row and the men
doing it, too, and all the publicity brings to your school, and secondly your
thoughts on what, if anything, you need to add to take that next step in the
tournament aside from maybe getting a regional and somewhat closer.   
COACH JOHNSTON: Well, the jackrabbit logo has got to be the hottest logo out
there on the market. It's the best‑looking one that I've seen by far, and it
edges out the boilermaker logo, so hopefully on a national stage that'll
continue to get some play.  
You know, it's a little unmeasurable right now because it just happened, but
you want dividends to pay off in these kind of events. Basketball, especially
men's basketball has such a national presence with that NCAA Tournament. I
know more about Lehigh today than I did two days ago, and that's because of
that tournament and that event.  
So for both of our teams, the ultimate is to try and move forward. To answer
your second part, for us anyway, we just have to be a little bit better in
kind of all areas. In the NCAA Tournament we're going to have to figure out
ways to execute a little bit better against these kind of teams. We're able to
kind of get free flowing a little bit in our league and with our style and
also get in the tournament. They're different types of games, so we're going
to have to evaluate how we want to build our team offensively and defensively
for this time.  
For us, like I said earlier, I think it'll change dramatically when we add
point guards and add more experience to our team. That'll help us get to what
we want offensively, as well. We're just going to have to learn how to play
tougher in these environments.  
We're in a situation where the majority of our games on the women's side very
well could be at Purdue or at Xavier or at Oklahoma, and that's a whole
different animal than what the men face at neutral sites. So we're going to
have to get better at these kind of environments and learn how to get done
what we need to.  
We were better today I thought than we were the last two trips, Oklahoma and
Xavier, to be honest with you. We had some shots that could have made the game
a little bit closer. Still might have lost, but we had some chances in the
second half to keep moving forward, keep grinding it out. We had some really
good stops defensively. I think we gave up three offensive rebounds in a
ten‑minute stretch that they scored on, so there were some chances there but
we just didn't make all those plays, and that's hard, but that's what it takes
here to do it on the road.  
  
Q. Pretty broad question here, but looking at this year and the last four,
are you fairly happy with what's happened here?  
COACH JOHNSTON: Yeah, overall, I mean, it's 64 teams played in this event.
We're one of the 64. To do it four years in a row, I don't know how many teams
have played in it four years in a row. We're not the only one, but there's
certainly a much smaller number than 64 that have gone here four times in a
row. So I am really pleased with the progress of our program. I am a little
frustrated just in the sense that we haven't taken another step in the
tournament but not frustrated in our players or anything, just frustrated we
haven't quite gotten over that hump yet, but I think that's kind of where
we're at.  
We want more shelf life in this event. You need more people to talk about you.
People are talking about Lehigh because they won, not because they lost by
two. And for us, if we're going to take that next step, I know I've said this
the last couple years, we're going to have to figure out ways to win at this
event.

_WEST LAFAYETTE, INDIANA_  
  

Purdue  83  
South Dakota State  68

  
COACH VERSYP: Just knew it was going to be a very exciting match‑up. Not
having played for two weeks, it was difficult for us to really contain some
energy early. But I really feel that we had a very good game plan. South
Dakota State did a great job of knocking down shots and making us pay if we
obviously made a mistake. But I thought our defense and KK really set the tone
defensively and with her steals, and then obviously I thought we moved the
ball around and did some good things inside and outside.  
  
Q. Were you trying to one ‑up Brittany at some point tonight? Joking aside,
just your game and the shot. Did everything just come in rhythm for you today?
  
COURTNEY MOSES: Yeah, definitely. My teammates just were setting great
screens. Our team had so many assists today. We were just talking about it,
and it all just comes from your teammates, and you just have to knock down the
shot.  
  
Q. Courtney, at times this has been a frustrating year from a shooting
perspective for you. Was this a nice way to sort of remedy some of those
struggles throughout the year?  
COURTNEY MOSES: My team has always had confidence in me, I've always had
confidence in myself, so to go out and continue and be confident is definitely
a good feeling.  
  
Q. KK, to be able to get the ball as quickly as you did, once you hit one
and two, was it just a matter of finding her on the wing?  
KK HOUSER: Yeah, I knew Courtney was going to come in and have a good shooting
game today. She shot great all week long in practice, so getting her open and
just little things, and Courtney has a quick release, so she doesn't need much
time to get it down.  
  
Q. What do y'all know about South Carolina?  
KK HOUSER: Just from watching a little bit of their game, quick, defensive
guards, pressure to the perimeter, small.  
COURTNEY MOSES: They get after it, very high energy, very well‑coached team,
and they're definitely‑‑ it's tournament time, so they're getting after it.  
  
Q. Courtney, it looked like you guys were trying to go inside early and you
had some success there. Do you feel like that helped open things up for you a
little bit later because they had to pay so much attention to your interior
players?  
COURTNEY MOSES: Definitely. We were just running plays, going high‑low. I
remember Chelsea was‑‑ they kind of stopped Chelsea there at the beginning of
the game, and definitely scoring down low, they're going to start collapsing
in and it's going to get the perimeter open.  
  
Q. KK, the first four minutes of the game, how much did those steals get you
into the rhythm of the game, and then for this being your first NCAA
Tournament game, did that maybe settle you down a little bit?  
KK HOUSER: Yeah, I think it might have got me going a little more. My defense
is what gets me going and I just get confidence off my defense, so getting
steals early in the game was huge for me.  
  
Q. KK, did you feel like you couldn't quite put them away there until I
think early in the second half or whenever it was you had a little bit of a
run, including Courtney's two three ‑pointers there back to back? Was that a
pretty critical stretch in giving you guys some push?   
KK HOUSER: Yeah, they're a great team, and they just kept fighting. It was
hard, we'd go on runs and then they'd cut the lead. I was pretty confident the
whole way.  
  
Q. Courtney, just your thoughts on having the tournament record and hitting
those nine three ‑pointers?   
COURTNEY MOSES: I would sum it up in two ways: I would say that with Purdue
all things are possible and with God all things are possible.  
  
Q. Is there any team that you played this year that is similar to South
Carolina?  
KK HOUSER: Texas A&M.  
  
Q. Sharon, just that stretch there in the second half, they got within two
and then Courtney scored eight there in those back ‑to‑back threes. Was that
kind of the cushion you needed to maybe take control of the game a little
bit?  
COACH VERSYP: Definitely. They did a nice job coming back. We needed to settle
down, make a couple shots, try to attack the basket and try to set Courtney up
because she was knocking down shots. But again, I just think, just like when
Brittany knocked down those 12 threes, just the team really realized what was
happening, and we needed to make sure we did some key things, especially when
they came back.  
  
Q. It did look like you were trying to go inside early. How much do you
think that sort of opened things up for her and others later?  
COACH VERSYP: I think it was big. But then Chelsea and Alex got in foul
trouble. We had a big lead, and then those two got in foul trouble, and we
didn't go inside as much. Liza came in and gave us some great minutes again,
scored baskets, did some great things. But it always helps. There's no
question that that helps. But I think Courtney knocked down some shots over‑‑
some really contested shots, too, contested baskets.  
  
Q. Your scoring numbers were way up over the average, theirs were way down
over the average. Is that the case of you being hot or is some of that the Big
Ten difference? Does that skew the numbers a bit?  
COACH VERSYP: It could. I think not playing for two weeks makes a difference
for us, but it's something that we've been used to the last six years. But we
did shoot the ball well. I thought we distributed the ball well, took care of
the basketball. You know, defensively they just did a great job of‑‑ when we
made a mistake defensively, they knocked down shots, and they had open looks,
and they're a very dangerous team.  
  
Q. Just thoughts on the way KK played in her first NCAA Tournament game.  
COACH VERSYP: I thought she did a great job, obviously had a little scare and
made sure the two doctors looked at it, her knee.  
But she sets the tone. Her defense will just drive anybody crazy, and that
sets the tone for everyone, and when she can attack the basket as well as she
does, and then she just really has been running the offense exceptionally
well. I mean, her stat line, six assists, two turnovers, five steals and 12
points, I think that's an exceptionally good job by her.  
  
Q. This might be a pretty obvious answer, but it might be as simple as you
have two players who are capable of getting hot, but is there any common theme
between what Rayburn did earlier in the season and what Moses did tonight?  
COACH VERSYP: This team has really done a great job all year of someone is not
doing‑‑ maybe scoring as well or getting in foul trouble. That's why it's been
an ultimate team, and that's the thing, everybody is so high on Brittany,
everybody has been so high on Courtney because they're the ones that can
actually shoot that three and be that successful. But it's a total team
effort, and I'm just glad for our team and for Courtney that she's playing so
well the last three weeks.  
  
Q. What do you know about South Carolina, and again, what kind of team do
you think they're like that you've played this season?  
COACH VERSYP: Probably similar to Texas A&M because they have good defensive
pressure. They've got long arms. They're athletic, great rebounding team. They
have some players that can shoot the three. And then obviously down low they
can do some things, whether it's off the dribble. So we've got to be able to
take some pressure off our guards a little bit, and we've got to be able to
isolate a little bit down low.  
  
Q. Just to follow up, how important is it for the success of Purdue to have
those multiple players that can go off any given night throughout the
tournament?  
COACH VERSYP: I think it's huge. I mean, it's tournament time, and when you
have players that can step up and score in the 20s, then you have a good
chance of progressing on into the tournament. And I think that's very good,
and maybe tomorrow we have two different scorers. And that's what's good about
our team is you're not sure who's going to score the 20 points or the 10
points and rebound, and I think that's a huge advantage.  
  
Q. What kind of advantage is it to have these games here at Mackey Arena?  
COACH VERSYP: I think it really helps you with the crowd. It helps you with
obviously being familiar with just the whole timing and the whole atmosphere.
But it's tournament time, and South Carolina has done a great job. They've won
a lot of games on the road. Right now their focus is an us‑against‑the‑world
mentality, which we always try to have.  
  
Q. It seems like you might get lost in the shuffle with the great offensive
effort, but talk about how important your defense was in the second half
there. It seemed like you were forcing a lot more turnovers.  
COACH VERSYP: We talked about it. We're a defensive team, and if we're going
to allow people to shoot the ball as well as they did, then it's going to be
tight and they can lose the game, so I said it's a choice. So it was all about
setting the tone, playing defense, getting in the passing lanes, hedging hard
around screens, so we changed our defense in the second half, made
adjustments, and we did really well.  
  
Q. On Liza, is it getting to the point where you're pretty confident getting
her in here? There's been a couple games that she's been pretty productive
with limited minutes for you.  
COACH VERSYP: Yeah, Liza has stepped up in her role. She's done a great job of
going in, and she just has a feel for the game, and she knows how to lock out,
she posts up exceptionally well, she's got great hands, and what you saw
tonight, three for four, is normally what she does. She had a key block, she
had key rebounds. She's just exactly developing how we need her to develop
right now.  
  
Q. What was your thoughts as Courtney kept hitting shot after shot?
Obviously you knew she was on fire, but did you realize that she was hitting
as many as she was, or were you kind of more focused on other things?  
COACH VERSYP: I never realize. I'm just happy that they're making shots and
they're going in. I don't realize. I don't keep count. I'm never a stat person
as the game goes on until I look at it. We're just worried about winning a
basketball game and sharing the basketball and having her knock down shots,
and she had an opportunity to do something special today.

COACH STALEY: Well, I thought we came out ready to play. I thought we
represented our University extremely well. I thought our conference put us in
a position to play in an environment like this, which it's a big environment.
It's a big stage for our basketball team, and I thought we executed from the
very tip of the ball.  
  
Q. Charenee, this game you tied for most points in the paint scored this
season. What was the difference in that? It didn't seem to get going, but
after the first five minutes it seemed like it was clicking.  
CHARENEE STEPHENS: Well, I think we kind of recognized that our post kind of
had an advantage, and we just took it. We took it to head, and went out there
and just started to dominate. I think our guards did a great job of putting us
in the right position to give us the ball and give us opportunities to score.  
  
Q. Markeshia, just talk about the pressure you guys were able to put on the
Eagles after the first five minutes or so. It just seemed like you were
wearing them down, and it progressed as the game went on.  
MARKESHIA GRANT: Before the beginning of the game, I just talked in the huddle
about how Ieasia should start off the defense from an intensity standpoint and
it'll be a trickle‑down effect. And I think we carried that over into the
game, and it worked for us.  
  
Q. Charenee, the EMU coach was just saying how physical the game was, much
more physical than the style of play they're used to. They're the physical
team in their conference. Do you think the fact they weren't used to that, do
you think they were looking for calls that they would have gotten in their MAC
games that they weren't getting today?  
CHARENEE STEPHENS: I think they did play hard. I think the first few minutes
of the game it was something they kind of‑‑ they had a run. I thought their
post player, Reddick, I thought she did well. She was battling going up
against me and our other post players. But at the same time, like Coach Staley
said, I think our conference prepared us. We have played those big physical
post players, and I think the conference really got us ready for this type of
environment.  
  
Q. You guys forced 17 turnovers, 11 blocked shots. As a player, do you feel
more comfortable in the half court offense or do you feel more comfortable
scoring via transition offense from that pressure defense?  
MARKESHIA GRANT: I think we like to run and gun more. But we slow it down when
we need to and execute in half court sets if we need to. So I think either one
is fine.  
CHARENEE STEPHENS: I like us in transition a lot because we have some athletic
post players, myself included, and we do like to get out, and our guards look
for us. But at the same time I think we're really good in the half court set.
We get out and we do battle and we sit on people down low, and it's effective.  
  
Q. It's a big stage. What did you think of the big stage, and how did you
calm down your jitters a little bit?  
MARKESHIA GRANT: Well, we just came in here focused and ready to play. I don't
know if it was jitters, but I mean, we just came in here with a mindset that
we're going to play hard and we're going to play our type of basketball, which
is disciplined. We just went out there and played.  
CHARENEE STEPHENS: Same thing. We've seen a big stage before. We just left the
SEC tournament, and it was a nice crowd. It was a nice stadium. I think it
prepared us for this year. We haven't seen the NCAA Tournament before, but I
think we were ready. We had the mindset that we were going to go out and play
our game because just like we had to prepare for them, they had to prepare for
us, so we just executed.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the depth of your team? Within the first ten minutes I
think ten players rotated into the game. You have a lot of people you can turn
to at any time. Does that help you guys for a full 40 minutes?  
MARKESHIA GRANT: It just shows you how versatile we are. We can sub for
defense purposes for any player, and I think it works for us best.  
CHARENEE STEPHENS: I like our bench, and the girls coming off the bench there,
they work just as hard as we do. I think we really do emphasize continuing the
intensity. If the starters aren't or are really doing what we need to do, we
expect the same thing from the next rotation, and so on and so forth. I think
we practiced that way, subs in, subs out. We go at each other hard, and this
is what we put out on the floor.  
  
Q. You guys have already been to Thompson Boling and got the win on the road
at Tennessee. Now, you will more than likely play Purdue Monday night. How do
you combat being here in Mackey Arena with pretty much a Purdue ‑dominant
crowd?   
MARKESHIA GRANT: I mean, we're going to prepare like we do for any other team.
We're going to be disciplined. We're going to be defensive minded. I think
playing at Thompson Boling, it helped us prepare for this stage, so we're just
going to practice tomorrow and be prepared.  
CHARENEE STEPHENS: That win at Tennessee was unbelievable for me, and I know
my team, and we worked really hard for it. Just like Charenee said, we're
going to go out and we're going to prepare. We're going to do the same thing
that we do for every single team. We prepare for everyone the same, whether
we're playing on their home court or they're coming to see us or a neutral
site. So we're going to prepare. We're going to take this day, and tomorrow
we're going to practice and we're just going to come out and play our game.  
  
Q. The first five minutes of the game where they were dominating, what
happened with that a little bit, and how did you get them to turn it on for
the rest of the game?  
COACH STALEY: We all know that a marathon is not won in the first mile, and we
just had to transfer that information to our players. We knew over the course
of 40 minutes, I don't think they had the depth to deal with what we had,
starting the game with what we had coming off the bench. We knew the first
four minutes were going to be hard minutes because they're known as a team
that plays really hard in the first four minutes of the basketball game. So we
let our players know, and I thought they did a tremendous job of just holding
serve. They didn't get out to a really big lead. But we just relied on knowing
that we had a bench to come in and relieve our starters and not miss a beat
from a defensive standpoint.  
  
Q. What did you know about Tavelyn James coming into this game, and was she
a focal point for you guys? Was she the one that concerned you guys the
most?  
COACH STALEY: I mean, anytime a player scores, averages 24 points a game, no
matter what league they're in, that's an eye‑opening average, so she was a
highlight of our scouting report, but we also highlighted the point guard. We
felt like the point guard is key to engineering their offense and defense. So
what we wanted to do wascut the head off ‑‑ we call it cutting the head off
and the rest will go. If we can get to Thomas and wear her out a little bit
and make James work for every single touch, I think it worked in our favor.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the ability of you guys as the game progressed, you
went from settling for jumpers outside to being able to attack the paint with
relative ease. Could you talk about the progression of that throughout the
game?  
COACH STALEY: Well, I think sometimes we get a little focused on just taking
outside shots because the zone was pretty active, and it allows you to shoot a
lot of outside shots. But again, once the game settled down for us after the
first time‑out, I thought we made a conscious effort to get the ball inside. I
thought we did a tremendous job at turning them over and getting some easy
buckets in transition. For us we balanced the amount of outside shots we took
with going inside, and we executed.  
  
Q. The first five minutes it was kind of back and forth between you guys and
Eastern Michigan. What did you say to the team to get that defensive intensity
increased, and as we saw the result, 17 turnovers?  
COACH STALEY: Well, I think any time you play on this stage, no matter what it
is, it's the first time we've played in the NCAA Tournament, you're going to
have some nervousness. The adrenaline is flowing. You just have to kind of
calm down and get back to normal, playing basketball the way we're used to
playing. Basically I just told them that over the course of 40 minutes, you're
going to see them get really tired, and throughout the first half I thought we
kind of made them a little weary. The shots that James usually makes, she
wasn't making. I thought that was due to our pressure, due to us making her
work extremely hard, and due to giving her different looks on the floor.  
  
Q. Was this the kind of opening game that you wanted, a game that you
controlled? You were able to obviously bring in the bench and get yourself
ready for Monday.  
COACH STALEY: You know, we really aren't a team that lets the game get away,
either way. Either we're losing by a large amount or‑‑ we're not a team that
blows a team out. So I was really concerned coming into the game because I
wanted our players to play their best basketball. Win, lose or draw, we wanted
to play our best basketball, and I thought us getting out gave us some
confidence, and then we widened the lead throughout the beginning of the
second half, and I thought we just gained some confidence from that.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the depth of your basketball team? Today there didn't
seem like there was any dropoff from any substitution. Whoever stepped into
that spot seemed to play with the same level of intensity. Can you talk about
that?  
COACH STALEY: Well, I think all season long, our bench has been very
productive. Sometimes we shorten it, sometimes we play a full bench. But I can
honestly say they've always been ready. They've always been ready to give us a
boost, whether it's from an offensive standpoint, but mainly from a defensive
standpoint. They knew they were going to play, and I think when they know
they're going to play, they practice a little bit better, have a little bit of
pep in their step and have a little bit more focus. I thought we just executed
from Tuesday on, honestly.

_WEST LAFAYETTE, INDIANA_  
  

South Carolina  80  
Eastern Michigan  48

  
COACH GILBERT: Well, the first thing I'd like to say is that I'm really
thrilled that our players were able to fight hard enough throughout the
regular season to win our conference tournament and to be here. We certainly
wanted to do more than just make a showing here in this tournament, and we tip
our hat to the defense of the No.4 ranked defense in the country, South
Carolina Gamecocks. They played a tremendous defensive game, had us on our
heels most of the game.  
I thought we started out fairly well offensively. They scored, we answered
quickly. But I just think their defense proved to be more than we could
handle, and we certainly respect meeting a defense that was better than our
own. I'd like to say kudos to the job they did defensively.  
I'm very proud of my team, just the way that they tried to fight back a little
bit in the second half. We want man to man, got a few stops, not nearly
enough, but they didn't give up. They faced a team that was a little bit
bigger, a little bit more aggressive on the boards. We haven't played a team
that's been like South Carolina. So this was a true test for us, and I'm just
really proud that our kids hung in there until the end.  
My center, Paige Reddick, was able to get her 1,000th point in this game. She
was just very resilient, and our players could get her the ball down the
stretch knowing what was at stake for her as she ended her career. I'm really
proud of their overall effort.  
  
Q. Tavelyn, what was different about their defense that maybe you had not
seen from another team this year?  
TAVELYN JAMES: Their defense was a lot more aggressive than any defense we've
probably felt. But I still feel like as a team we don't get stymied by
pressure defense. We're a team that's about offense and transition, so
somebody playing hard defense on us shouldn't make us not make baskets. We
should still be able to play our game and make baskets.  
  
Q. Natachia, it seemed like you guys had the first five minutes of the game.
What were you guys doing that was succeeding against South Carolina and then
what did they do to adjust?  
NATACHIA WATKINS: We had a lot of transition baskets at the beginning of the
game when we was running with them, and we was actually stopping them on
defense and being physical.  
  
Q. Natachia, how difficult was it to keep them out of the paint? They seemed
to get a lot of easy baskets, a lot of penetration in there.  
NATACHIA WATKINS: I mean, we all knew that they were a driving team, so we all
had our game plans on which way to force them or to play under, but they just
kept finding a way to get into the paint.  
  
Q. Tavelyn, you talked about their defense. What adjustments did you try to
make so that maybe you could have gotten into a groove?  
TAVELYN JAMES: I noticed that they was forcing me less, which I tried to drive
less, and shots wasn't falling today for Eastern. It wasn't like we didn't get
any shots up, we just couldn't hit them.  
  
Q. Did they do anything different than what you saw from them on film this
week?  
TAVELYN JAMES: The film we watched, no, they basically did the same thing,
besides key on like the key players on our team and do what they were supposed
to do to try to shut us down. I mean, that's really it.  
NATACHIA WATKINS: From what we watched, they was the exact same, except I felt
like their post got a lot more touches and looks this game than they have
previous to what we watched.  
  
Q. Tavelyn, just kind of what's your hope for this program moving forward?
What do you want to see out of this program over the next couple years?  
TAVELYN JAMES: I mean, I want to see the program do the same exact thing that
we've done this year. I mean, no one can take this year away from us,
regardless of this game or not. But we wanted to make a statement in the NCAA
that there are MAC teams that can play. We didn't want to go out this way; I'm
sure no team wants to go out this way. But as long as this team plays hard and
plays as Eastern, they'll make it.  
  
Q. Tavelyn, if you had another game against South Carolina, what do you
think you would do differently, or if you were talking to the team that plays
them on Monday, what would you suggest to try to stop them?  
TAVELYN JAMES: Just play our game. It's about heart, I feel, around this time.
Everybody needs to dig in and play. I don't believe that even if a team was
prepared for us for seven weeks before we played this game, it's about heart
and will.  
  
Q. Tavelyn, how does this team take the next step?  
TAVELYN JAMES: I would say they would need a leader because the two leaders
are leaving, so somebody else on the team would have to step up to make sure
the things that me and Paige tried to get done get done.  
  
Q. Just the challenge of keeping them out of the paint, how difficult was
that, and how big of a concern was that going in, in your mind?  
COACH GILBERT: You know, we thought that our zone play would keep them out of
the paint a bit more than it did. They were able to hit a few outside shots
that really changed the game, made us expand a little bit, which opened the
paint up a little bit more.  
I was excited that you could see Page Reddick is someone no matter what the
level of team is, she's able to take charges against anyone. She may have four
or five charges that she took in this game, and she's sort of our inside
stopper. She's a kid that really has a lot of miles on her, and with the big
bodies she faced today they were able to lean on her.  
At the next level, it's hard to create for our players in our league the kind
of physicality that you face in teams in different conferences, bigger power
conferences, SEC. This wasn't the biggest SEC team but they were a physical
team, and they went as far as the referees would allow. In our league we get a
little bit more of those bumps and contact fouls. We didn't get them today.
And it's hard to create on the spot what they were going to face.  
And this was a first time for many of our players, or for all of our players,
in the NCAA Tournament. You can't create this experience for them to let them
know how physical the game will be. We've played a lot of tough opponents, but
they did a great job of getting that ball, forcing the ball inside and forcing
our bigs to guard.  
  
Q. What would be your suggestion to the team that plays South Carolina on
Monday to challenge them, again, sort of looking as if you had maybe a do
‑over to challenge them?   
COACH GILBERT: As I mentioned in my last interview regarding South Carolina,
they do a great job. They have just enough interior to keep you honest, and
their kids on the outside can shoot the ball. They're not pure shooters, but
they can stroke it. They move the ball well. They force you‑‑ they make extra
passes and force your defense to shift. They use skip passes. You're going to
have to contain their exterior and stay connected to their interior pieces.
They did a nice job on the offensive glass to get second chance points. Their
post didn't do anything magical. They played extremely hard, and that is‑‑
they're coached that way, and it reflected on the floor.  
But you're going to have to keep their guards from shooting threes and stay
close to their post players to keep them off the glass.  
  
Q. Was that what was working for you in those first five minutes when you
had a six ‑point lead?  
COACH GILBERT: That was our thought. Our thought was that we could possibly
jump out on them early. Even our pressure, I just felt like the toll of a long
season, we needed a lot more in the paint to be able to press this South
Carolina team the way we press. One thing I want to say, my heart goes out to
my kids because my kids are so much better than what they reflected today.
They just found a team that could push back. We usually push people around,
but we found a team today that can push back, and when they pushed back, they
pushed really hard. So they were looking over at me, and I'm saying, hey, I'm
not an official.  
But I feel bad for them. My heart hurts for them because they lost to a very
good team. We shouldn't have lost this way, but we lost to a very good team.  
  
Q. I guess now that a majority of teams got a taste of this, what's your
hope moving forward for your players coming back and all the new kids coming
in?  
COACH GILBERT: You know, the one thing that I like, that I read in the
transcript regarding South Carolina, they were committed to defense. I want to
see an investment in the things that win games, rebounding and defense, and
we've been committed. But this was a team that was committed at a higher level
than we were. Our defense has been good enough to beat the teams that we've
played and to really challenge some teams in some other conferences. We beat
Michigan, lost to Michigan State by one point in overtime. We've played some
strong teams. But this team was really ‑‑ this South Carolina team was
committed to defensive rebounding. Those are the two keys that I thought we
had to do better than South Carolina, and I'd just like to see our players
continue to grow, get better.  
In terms of their skill, I thought this team hit some great pull‑up jump shots
on the baseline, in the paint. I'd like to see our players just through our
recruiting get a little bit bigger so when we face bigger teams we've got
bigger bodies. But I'd just like to see more of a commitment, a true
commitment, that even when your offense isn't clicking, your defense never has
an off‑night.  
  
Q. If Tavelyn puts up the points that she typically does, what's different
in this game today?  
COACH GILBERT: You know, I think it would have opened things up a lot more
from some of our other players. We missed a lot of easy baskets inside, even
when our post got some baskets inside. They've got to make those baskets in
order to free Tavelyn up a little bit. We didn't make those and Tavelyn didn't
make hers on the outside, which made for a terrible combination. Natachia
Watkins was a little bit off balance. She's a kid that had 25 in the
championship game of our conference tournament. She's so much better than what
she reflected, but the players we faced today, they could jump to her level.
They could rebound to her level. Tavelyn James met players that could body up
on her, not let her run off staggers without being bumped with a strong
forearm.  
So I think if Tavelyn had been able to get her game off a little bit earlier,
it would have made for a much better ballgame, a closer ballgame.

_WEST LAFAYETTE, INDIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Like to welcome the Jackrabbits of South Dakota State. We'd
like to welcome South Dakota State obviously head Coach Aaron Johnston. We are
joined by Jennie Sunnarborg and Jill Young.  
I know you played Purdue at the start of last season in the preseason NIT, if
you would talk about how your team has evolved since that point.  
COACH JOHNSTON: Let's hope a lot. I think our team would agree that that was
not a very productive game for us. It's really hard to talk about that game
and then think about where we are at right now. We just played really poorly
in that game, and that has to do with Purdue being a very good team and us
just not having a very good day.  
This year I think we have played really good basketball. Jennie and Jill have
been very good seniors for us. We have had ups and downs this year, too, but
Jennie and Jill have done a great job of leading the team and being consistent
every day and when we have had a couple of bumps in the road, I think to their
credit, they have done a great job of getting back right away in the next
practice or next game and keep us going in the direction we need ti.  
This is our fourth trip to the NCAA Tournament. Jennie and Jill have been a
part of all four of those, which is quite a feat, considering it's the first
four chances we've had as a program. But it's exciting to see what these two
have done throughout their career, and it's exciting to see where they have
helped get our program.  
  
Q. How have you adjusted without Steph? Are you much different or what do
you anticipate tomorrow?  
COACH JOHNSTON: Good question, I think losing Steph Paluch in the semifinals
of the conference tournament was a big blow. I don't know that we are
different offensively or defensively in what we do or what we are trying to
get accomplished on court but we are different in our rotation.  
Steph was really playing well in the month of February at that off‑guard spot.
Earlier in the year, she started the point, would have played the point for us
here, was well in the preseason WNIT. But she really is more of a true
two‑guard. And as the season evolved, she got to be really, really good in
that position.  
So we lose her numbers. She hit a lot of big shots for us down the stretch at
particular times, very good defensive player. So really we lose that extra
person in the rotation. Really does not change our offense or defense that
much.  
  
Q. Coach mentioned this your fourth NCAA Tournament; what are your motions
knowing that this is your last NCAA Tournament?  
JENNIE SUNNARBORG: The most important thing that we have to think about is
that you have to keep going no matter what, and everything will‑‑ the game is
either win or loss, and you either keep playing or you're done. I know that's
been in the back of my mind, and we don't want our season to be over and we
are going to fight as much as we can to keep going.  
JILL YOUNG: I agree with Jennie. Like she said, it's either you win or you're
done. So we are definitely going to leave it all on the floor. This is our
last chance to help move our program forward. So we are going to be ready to
go.  
  
Q. Coach had mentioned the game last year, but did you take extra
motivation? It's the NCAA Tournament obviously so that would seem to be
plenty, but is there n extra motivation going into the game because of what
happened last year?  
JENNIE SUNNARBORG: I definitely think‑‑ I mean, you never want a loss on your
record and that one was not a great one, especially. And you know, I think we
are a better team than what we have been against Big Ten teams, and you know,
we just want to be a good team whether we are playing in the Summitt League or
we are playing nationally.  
Just something that we have, I guess not been focused on, but we want it back
and, you know, we are a better team than what we have been; that we have shown
so far.  
JILL YOUNG: Yeah, it definitely wasn't our prettiest game of the year last
year. I think we are a way different team than we were at that point. But
that's, I guess, not really our driving, motivating factor.  
  
Q. As you look at Purdue now, what do you see? Obviously they don't have
Drey who you saw last year and they could have KK Houser back. How much does
that change them, and how different are they this season than last?  
COACH JOHNSTON: Well, I think if you look at Purdue traditionally, excellent
team in the halfcourt. They really get the ball to who they want to take shots
and where they want them to take shots and when they want them to take shots.
It's a little more guard orientated now.  
All three of those perimeter players make a ton of plays for them offensively.
They use their posts in a really smart way. They are not necessarily primary
options offensively, but they still get them the ball when they need shots.  
But I think the thing that stands out in my mind, last year and this year, is
just how well they execute in the halfcourt. We really struggled with
defending them last year. We just didn't get through screens very well. We
didn't take away certain things we wanted to try and take away, and the game
kind of got away from us offensively.  
Defensively, I think they are really the same; they do a great job of
executing a half‑court plan. They try to take certain players or option as way
from what we will want to do. We really noticed that in watching last year's
film.  
So we have to be better in how we execute on our end of the ball especially in
the halfcourt especially.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the development of Sam Ostarello from what you've seen
previously?  
COACH JOHNSTON: That's what I talk about when they use their post players in a
smart way. Sam is an example of someone that fits very well with what Purdue
does. She doesn't necessarily start their offensive possessions. But she is a
great screener, great passer and can score when she needs to and score when
she has chances to and she rebounds really well within their offense and just
fits really well with those there perimeter players that are very aggressive
and can take a lot of shots.  
Sam is not the kind of player that has to have the ball in her hands all the
time to be effective in the game; because she passes it so well and rebounds
so well, she really complements what the perimeter players do.  
So it's really no surprise. We saw Sam play in high school more than any other
college program in the country by far. So we really thought this would be
something that she could do and accomplish. She's having a great year.  
  
Q. Your thoughts on just the matchup, you're getting a team that is willing
and likes to log it out in the halfcourt, which you have done this year, a
little different style than you've had in the past. Can that work to your
advantage? Is that almost better than playing a team that's going to run all
over and try to force 40 turnovers and that kind of thing?  
JILL YOUNG: Yeah, you know, I think so. Like you say, they are really good on
the halfcourt offensively, and we are going to have to play tough defense and
keep them off the o‑boards.  
And then offensively, we are still going to try and push it when we can and
run when we can. But you know, off the block, give them a half‑court offense
and just be aggressive at taking it to the basket and finishing.  
  
Q. Looking back for the summer League Championships, obviously we had it
right in Sioux Falls, calling the fans the sixth player, not having that
auditorium full of yellow and blue tomorrow; is that going to add any level of
difficulty to the game?  
COACH JOHNSTON: It definitely changes things. We had I think averaged 5,000
people for our conference tournament games in Sioux Falls, and that's quite an
advantage for us and that's pretty clear. Now you flip it around and you can
have that and then some here tomorrow rooting against us.  
But that's the model that works in the NCAA Tournament. We know that going
into it. There are a number of host sites and host seeds and they are going to
have that same advantage and that's what works right now in women's basketball
in the NCAA Tournament.  
It does make it a little bit more challenging, but it also makes it a good
atmosphere. It makes it what you want to feel like in the NCAA Tournament.
There's no value for any of our teams that are here going to an empty arena
just to have a neutral site so to speak. It does make it more difficult
without a doubt and does make Purdue a better team here at home, but it does
also add to the overall event, as well.  
JENNIE SUNNARBORG: It's going to be a challenge for us but our fans have been
great all year and we will have a good crowd all year. Just kind of create our
energy from our players and our players.  
JILL YOUNG: I guess I agree with everything they said. It's already a fun
atmosphere. We have been in these environments before, and even though it's
not our home floor and all of our fans, it's still a good atmosphere out on
the floor.  
Like Jennie said, we will be ready to bring our own energy on the bench and
out on the floor.  
  
Q. Fourth year in a row, how much does that give you guys to be able to
prepare for this? You know what you're getting yourself into; this isn't
anything new for you.  
COACH JOHNSTON: Well, I think it's helped us prepare for things like this. We
had all of these questions you've asked so far were well scripted and prepared
in advance; so our fourth year has paid off for us already.  
I just think all of the different, I would say logistics, that go into this
event. It is very different. You have to get here earlier. There's a bit more
security. There's more media. It's how the practices.  
So it's not like a road game, and you don't want it to be like a road game. If
that's the case, there's no reason to have an NCAA Tournament. So the fact
that it's different is good but having been in it enough we are just not
really surprised that, boy, I didn't expect this kind of thing.  
It really becomes more about the game, and I hope that it translates to having
some success out on the court. We can really focus on Purdue and make that be
the most important part of it.  
THE MODERATOR: Jennie or Jill, do you have a scripted reply for that question?
Players will pass. Go ahead, next question.  
  
Q. Jennie, the Purdue men play tonight in the tournament. Your guys played
last night. New experience. Did you guys watch the game? What were your
thoughts on just having that, probably a little fun distraction along your own
trip?  
JENNIE SUNNARBORG: It was. The fact that we got here yesterday was good. We
kind of got relaxed in the hotel and everything. Going out to watch the men
play, it was fun, and got to hang out with the team. You know, we would have
been doing that whether we were here or not.  
It was fun to watch and it was good for our program, and the emotions that
went through. And the fact that our men didn't win the game, you know, I guess
we want us to pull it off I guess. But it's good for our program either way.  
  
Q. Jill, if you can go back to the conference championship, at the free
throw line with seven seconds left, did you have any time to think about the
enormity of what you're doing, shooting free throws for what could be your
last NCAA Tournament berth, and since then, have you thought about if you had
missed the free throws?  
JILL YOUNG: I guess just try to keep it simple. Really I had no doubt, or I
guess no negative thinking; just knew that they were going to go in. I don't
know, like I said before, I shot a lot of free throws in my life, so I guess
it was just kind of in the flow (ph), I don't know.  
  
Q. What was going through your mind when you saw her at the free throw line
with seven seconds?  
COACH JOHNSTON: I actually thought about using your same line: Jill, if you
miss these, you realize you will not go back to the NCAA Tournament. But then
I think probably better judgment overcame.  
I really, honestly for not one second doubted that she would make them. Jill
is a very, very good shooter. I can't remember her record, 160‑some‑‑ I
probably shorted you a couple, is that right. There was really no doubt in
anybody's mind that she was going to make both of those. If you saw her body
language and been around Jill a lot, she looked very calm and very
comfortable. As a coach, you can always tell if someone is out of their
routine and she wasn't. I think we all knew she was going to make it.  
  
Q. Your free throw shooting, how many have you hit in a row at one point in
your life?  
JILL YOUNG: 21.  
  
Q. All these in games?  
JILL YOUNG: No, just in the gym.  
  
Q. When did the free throw shooting become the thing for you; at what age?  
JILL YOUNG: I guess I went to a lot of like free throw contests, like Elks
free throw contests and stuff, back when I was seven, eight years old. And so
was doing I guess pressure situations back then, state contests and regional
contests and stuff, way back when, probably when the form wasn't the best and
used two hands.  
  
Q. The fact that most of your team played in this arena last year, is there
a comfortable feeling with the surroundings? Does that help ease any nerves
that you might have to start the game?  
JENNIE SUNNARBORG: I think so. We know the atmosphere and we know who is going
to draw a pretty good crowd. Yeah, I think it's comfortable to say that we
have played on this court and are ready to go.  
  
Q. How difficult has it been to get DivisionI opponents to try to come up to
South Dakota and play a game? I think your program has risen to the national
level with some of the things you've done over the years?  
COACH JOHNSTON: It could be a challenge. I tell our staff the two most
important things we do as a staff are recruit and also schedule. I don't know
if all coaches put that in that order but we need to because of where we are
at. You really just have to find the right programs, and there are a group of
women's programs out there who are I think committed to challenging their
teams and also helping women's basketball grow at the same time.  
So for instance next year, we'll have Nebraska at our place and Marquette at
our place. This year we had Washington at our place and Kansas State at our
place. You know, we have had teams that have done that.  
But there are certainly a handful of teams in our Midwestern area that just
won't consider playing us at their place, or certainly coming back. So we just
have to be really proactive in trying to identify the teams that are willing
to do it. We do run into some walls that are difficult.  
  
Q. When Purdue was up earlier, they talked a lot about how much momentum
they felt they had for winning their conference tournament. For you guys, the
only way you get into the tournament to do that. That said, do you guys feel
like that, momentum from doing that or is it a different thing in a non ‑BCS
conference?  
JILL YOUNG: Yeah, I think so. Just I guess our last, I don't know how many
games, I think we have just been playing well together and definitely had to
overcome some things in the conference tournament that I think pulled us
together; just coming down from 17 and just fighting through that, I think it
added on and gave us good experience and also momentum coming into the
tournament.  
  
Q. On paper, you guys and Purdue, especially in things like bench scoring
and offensive output and defensive scoring average, very similar, and yet the
teams are not very similar. What do you see there in terms of differences or
why the teams get sort of the same results maybe in different manners?  
COACH JOHNSTON: You're asking me to compare our team to our past teams?  
  
Q. No. You guys and Purdue in terms of scoring defense and scoring offense,
pretty similar numbers and yet different styles.  
COACH JOHNSTON: Well, I just think, like I said at the beginning, the offense
is so efficient. So they can score 65 and 70 points in a game, and for us that
might mean a lot of possessions and for them that might mean very few
possessions. Just because they make so many shots, they don't turn it over.
They just get so much out of each possession I think.  
And then defensively, I think they are just really good at taking things away
from you. They really do go into a game plan and figure out, one, two, three,
four, they are not going to do. They have to do to five, six and seven.  
For us, we are very different than them. We don't go into a game and just say,
we need to take player a out. We have an overall scheme that we use, and then
we'll vary it based on the teams that we play a little bit. Same thing
offensively. We have got kind of a universal philosophy and we'll throw some
things in here or there that we think will be effective against our next
opponent, in this case Purdue.  
But I think they are very different styles. Not better, worse; just very
different styles. But they are just so efficient. They get so much out of each
possession on both ends, and I think they are deceiving. So they are not a
team that runs up‑and‑down but they score a lot of points, considering they
are very good on the halfcourts.  
  
Q. Of the national prominence that SDSU has garnered over the last couple of
years, and it ties into with Sam on the other side, it sounded like by all
inclusive accounts, she was about to sign with SDSU and spurned you for a Big
Ten team. Do you feel like you don't have to worry about that as much with the
area opponents because of how much success you've had in the last couple
years?  
COACH JOHNSTON: Area opponents or area recruits?  
  
Q. Area recruits. Just deciding to go with a bigger squad or stay with
you.  
COACH JOHNSTON: I think recruiting is always going to be a challenge for us.
You walk around the new facility here at Purdue you, and see what they have to
offer and if you put yourselves in the shoes of somebody who is 17 or 18, you
can kind of see how they are going to migrate towards some of these bells and
whistles.  
But we also have a lot of players that have come to South Dakota State because
of what we offer over some bells and whistles. Kind of like in scheduling, you
have to find the people that are really looking for what we offer and the kind
of game they are going to get.  
We have to be selective about the young people we recruit and that they have
to want something that South Dakota State offers over some of these other
schools.  
We don't change the type of player we want to recruit. We don't say, well, we
can't recruit her because she's too good. We have never taken that approach.
We have a lot of people on our team that were recruited by I think BCS‑level
schools and chose to come to South Dakota State for our reasons. It's about
being very selective and making sure we identify who is going to be excited
about us at an early time.  
  
Q. This time of year, there's a lot of focus on X's and O's, people say, if
you need motivation right now, you're in the wrong business. That said, is
this the motivation, or have you talked to teams about, time to get out of the
first round; has that idea come up?  
COACH JOHNSTON: Yeah, we have been out of the first round before. So it's not
as if we can't accomplish that.  
But we did talk about it this week; the importance of not being content. I
don't think anybody ever goes into an NCAA Tournament and says, oh, that's
great, let's see how it goes and go back about our lives.  
Really trying to hammer that point home; that if we want to go forward, it's
going to be based on something that we have to do in the game and not just
show up for the game and kid of hope things go well.  
That doesn't mean we came up with a Purdue package that's going to put us over
the hump because of the great X's and O's, but it's going to be hopefully
because of our approach and our last few practices and practice day approach
to the game. We just have to be far more tenacious than we have been the last
couple years. I think our team the last few years wanted to win, too. It's
tough to beat Oklahoma. They went to the Final Four, so I think they proved to
be‑‑ tough to beat Xavier and they were a top five team. Our opponents had
something to do with that.  
But we have to be really tenacious and approach this as if we are going to
figure out a way to win no matter what happens.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach and Ladies, thank you very much and good luck in your
game tomorrow afternoon.

## March 16, 2012

  

### [KK Houser](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23272)

### [Sam Ostarello](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23575)

### [Brittany Rayburn](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19283)

### [Sharon Versyp](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16880)

  
_WEST LAFAYETTE, INDIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Like to welcome the arrival of the Big Ten Champions, the
Purdue Boilermakers. First we'll open with a quick question for Coach Versyp.
If you would, talk about your opponent in tomorrow's game, what concerns might
you have most about their play.  
COACH VERSYP: South Dakota state is very well balanced team, very well
coached, very disciplined. They shoot the 3 exceptionally well. They do really
well on the offensive boards, so we need to make sure that we obviously box
out exceptionally well and be able to get up‑and‑down the floor.  
  
Q. Sam, just your e ‑mails and texts, have they blown up this week because
of the connection with South Dakota.   
SAM OSTARELLO: You know, not a whole lot which is kind of nice. It's just
another game for us. It's one step that we have got to get through. Try to
keep it at that.  
  
Q. KK nowadays, we learn everything on Twitter and you guys got some
popsicles the other day. Was that kind of a back ‑to‑summer‑camp‑type of mode?
  
KK HOUSER: Yeah, it was a little hot yesterday in Mackey. We were getting
water breaks like every five minutes, and all of a sudden coach says, goes,
okay, we are going to have a popsicle break real quick. So we got to take a
popsicle break and then back to work.  
  
Q. Brittany, can you talk about the approach that you guys have to this NCAA
Tournament compared to last year where you really sort of had to fight your
way in; you're a higher seed, playing on your home court, and sort of your
last go ‑around this year?   
BRITTANY RAYBURN: I think especially coming off a great victory, I think we
are going into this tournament a lot more confident than we were last year, a
lot more experienced. We are obviously not losing any from last year's team is
great for us, especially to come into the tournament this year and being on
your home floor playing with a lot of confidence.  
  
Q. Do you sense that your senior class has a lot of urgency knowing that
you're down to the last few games here, if not sooner than that?  
BRITTANY RAYBURN: Yeah, I think definitely our senior class as well as the
other players on this team, I think the whole team is feeling that sense of
urgency and every step of the way you have to feel that sense of urgency to be
able to play at your best, play your best basketball.  
  
Q. One for KK, third year here, first NCAA Tournament game, what are your
emotions going into tomorrow?  
KK HOUSER: The hype is so much different than other tournaments and games that
we've played. But I'm excited. I'm just going to continue to do what I've been
doing in the past.  
  
Q. For all three, how long did it take to get over the high of the Big Ten
tournament and get refocused for this?  
KK HOUSER: I honestly don't think we are over it yet. It's what's carrying us
over into this game and to have confidence and everything like that. We can't
dwell on it but I don't think I'm over it yet.  
SAM OSTARELLO: Going along with KK, I think we are using, you know, all of the
emotions and energy that we had from the Big Ten tournament and taking it into
this NCAA first‑round game. But we were refocused a couple days after. It
didn't take long for us to realize, hey, we have to get back at it and get our
other goals that we set down.  
BRITTANY RAYBURN: I think we are still energized from it. I think it's
something that we need to have the energy from; getting a big win like that
for the program and the University is great for us and I think it's something
that will catapult us into this tournament.  
  
Q. Sam, coming from South Dakota, did you ever think you would be playing a
team from your home state in a game of this magnitude?  
SAM OSTARELLO: It was a possibility. Anything can happen in March.  
  
Q. Sam, have you talked with maybe Katie or Stephanie or those you might
know from Fort Peter?  
SAM OSTARELLO: Only time I talked to Steph, I sent her a get‑well text after I
heard about her ACL injury. That was about a week or so ago. We have not
really talked. We know it's business but we know we are still friends. But
it's game time. It's about business right now.  
  
Q. Sam, talk about your season, it's kind of a breakout for you, you
obviously contributed a lot your first two years but your stats are doubled
and you've started every game. What's your key to your expanded role?  
SAM OSTARELLO: The team. The team having confidence in everything I do. I
would not be able to get rebounds if the whole team didn't box out.  
It goes back to everything we do in practice. We are not just focused on one
player or anything like that. It just kind of blossomed from that and I feed
off all of their confidence in me.  
  
Q. KK, both teams have lost multiple players now; talk about coming back
from that, trying to contribute when you can't be on the floor and how it
affects things, how you guys have seen it play out?  
KK HOUSER: You know, it's kind of a struggle coming back a little bit. Just
the turnovers and the pace of the game and being out a whole year, it takes a
while once you adjust. But I've had Coach V. have my back the whole year which
is awesome.  
Right now I would say I'm good where I'm at. My knees are feeling good. It
takes a while and about halfway through the season is when I started feeling
better.  
  
Q. KK, can you just talk about the group of seniors and how excited you guys
are to go out and play well sort of for them here in their last go around?  
KK HOUSER: I love playing for our seniors. Great group of girls. They want to
win and they just have this look in their eyes; it's all about business and
I'm excited to play my last games with them.  
  
Q. South Dakota has had about a game and a half to adjust to losing the
point guard; what have you seen out of the replacement and kind of evaluate
their team post knee injury with Steph.  
COACH VERSYP: Well, I think Erin does a great job, so when a player goes down,
it's a sister falling down. So the team usually rally ease around. I think how
Erin handled it, like how KK and Drey handled it, that actually helps your
team. If you stay positive, I think that's the biggest thing.  
You know, other players are stepping up and that's what they have done.
Players came in and knocking down the 3s and have a different role. So their
role has now changed. You know, they use a lot of depth, and obviously with
her having the most steals on the team and assists, that obviously is an
adjustment, but they have done a good job in the last game and a half without
here.  
  
Q. For Brittany, is there any added pressure to make sure and protect your
home court, being able to host those two games?  
BRITTANY RAYBURN: I don't think I would call it pressure. I think it's an
advantage for us to be able to be home and have our home crowd and we are
really excited to be able to host hopefully these first two rounds for us to
play in and it's a great opportunity for us to be able to play in front of our
home crowd and I don't think that it would be any added pressure. I think it
just adds on to the fun for us.  
  
Q. This is your last tournament game; what are your emotions going in?  
BRITTANY RAYBURN: I'm excited. Like I said, just coming off the big win in the
Big Ten tournament is huge. Being able to push it into the NCAA is great and
to be able to play hopefully two games at home is huge for us. I'm just really
excited.  
  
Q. If you are looking at the keys to tomorrow, but to have success in the
next couple of weeks, what's at the top of your black board right now?  
COACH VERSYP: It's always team defense and then the second thing is
rebounding. You have to do a great job on the boards. You have to dominate in
both areas. And when we have done that, then good things have happened for us.  
  
Q. Coach, statistically, you're pretty similar in terms of points scored and
allowed. You both get a lot from your bench. Are the teams somewhat similar or
is that just a numbers thing and not really true to the naked eye?  
COACH VERSYP: I think it's that they are similar and we are just playing two
different conferences. You know, our non‑conference and our Big Ten is
obviously a different style than theirs, and they have four out, one in more,
where we have three guards and two post players. So the styles are totally
different and I just think it's the numbers.  
  
Q. Sharon, do you get a different sense from this team than a year ago? Last
year you had to play your way in; I would imagine there's a little different
feel coming into this year.  
COACH VERSYP: Oh, the whole year it's been different. It has not just started
now at the NCAA. It started when we went to Europe. What went through last
year just brought us closer.  
So the bottom line is, we set high goals, and our team has responded and you
know, so the NCAA Tournament and any games that we are in, we always have a
sense of urgency and know that we want to do the best that we can. This year
should have been different and it definitely is.  
  
Q. Having gone up the team in the NIT preseason a while back, and then
having seen them play in Cancún earlier this year, how big of an advantage is
that just knowing your opponent a little bit more rather than going up against
some random team from Timbuktu?  
COACH VERSYP: It works both ways. But they pretty much had everybody returning
this year from last year and we do, too. Our teams are a little different. We
have KK back and we don't have Drey and they have had some injuries.  
You are used to maybe the style. You know what is going to be coming at you.
But it comes down to execution and it comes down to fundamentals. It comes
down to executing your offense and your defense. It's nice to know your
opponent, but sometimes when you don't, there's a different keenness to your
student athletes when they have to pay attention to even more detail.  
THE MODERATOR: Purdue, good luck tomorrow afternoon.

LAFAYETTE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+%26+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+WEST+LAFAYETTE)

  

## March 16, 2012

  

### [Markeshia Grant](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21774)

### [Dawn Staley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15625)

### [Ieasia Walker](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21773)

  
_WEST LAFAYETTE, INDIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We have with us from the University of South Carolina, Dawn
Staley, and our three players whose names are posted in front of them. We
would like you to ask any questions specific to any of the athletes and with
that first of all, we would like to open for questions.  
  
Q. Dawn, just reading up on your team, Sylvia Hatfield called your team
"street fighters." Is that a definition that you like associated with your
team or is that not a good definition for your team?   
COACH STALEY: Well, street fighters is a team that's a very physical
basketball team; a team that can come out and play the game the way it's
supposed to be played. I deem it as a pretty good name.  
  
Q. Coach, all season you've been known as a lock it down type of defense,
holding teams 31 times below their scoring average. What do you need to do
tomorrow to contain their leading scorer, James, who I'm sure you've been able
to watch some video of, and what does she do so well that allows her to get to
that bucket with ease?  
COACH STALEY: James, she's a scorer. She has a scorer's mentality. She likes
to put the ball up. She shoots a lot of baskets. But what we need to do is we
need to take discipline to the game plan. We need to make it very difficult
for her to get touches. We need to contest every shot she takes.  
Certainly we have to do some things that we have done in our conference. I
don't foresee us doing anything as far as out of the box, jump defenses or
anything. I think our players are really disciplined when it comes to sticking
to the game plan.  
  
Q. La'Keisha, talk about the trip over here yesterday, flying in, and
getting settled in. What's this experience been like for you so far and is it
hitting you that you are getting ready to partake in an NCAA Tournament
game?  
LA'KEISHA SUTTON: We had our Gamescocks' fans meet us as practice and a lot of
people from Columbia came out to see us off; a lot of cheering, hugs and
smiles and a lot of pictures were taken. It was an exciting trip for myself
personally, and my teammates and the whole coaching staff.  
  
Q. I feel like you all are extensions of each other a little bit. Just talk
a little bit about the rapport all three of you guys have and how well you've
worked all season offensively being able to find each other in transition
really well.  
MARKESHIA GRANT: I think we all bring something different to the table. I
think Ieasia is our leader of this group of guards. She's our point guard. And
I think Keisha is very dynamic in what she does. She can do everything. She
can shoot; she can drive; she can defend. And I bring our three‑point
shooting. So I think we just bring a lot of different things to the table, and
it's hard to guard us.  
  
Q. Curious of the players, has Coach Staley or Coach McCray shared any
stories with you about their experiences?  
COACH STALEY: No, we haven't. It's been over 20 years, so I think our players
are more tangible in the here and the now. And for them, I want them to
experience it for themselves, because they have been part of this program
since year one for La'Keisha and Ieasia has been here for three years, and
Markeshia, this is her second year. For them, they have seen the program go
through some growth and we know with growth, it doesn't always feel good. But
you know, it's their experience, so you know, we rarely share some of the
things we have done in our lives from a coaching standpoint because we are a
little out of touch.  
  
Q. I haven't seen your team a whole lot this year, could you describe
through your defensive style what you hang your hat on, some of your
fundamentals that have allowed you to play so well defensively?  
COACH STALEY: Well, we are committed; we are a committed defensive basketball
team, where as we know, what butters our broad. From an offensive standpoint
we are not very consistent and if you look at us on paper, it's not very
pretty. So we can't bank on something that we do probably a third of the time
well, which is shoot the basketball.  
From a defensive standpoint, you know, we don't allow teams to get up as many
shots as they would like to get up. We don't take the air out of them, but we
certainly shrink the game as far as possessions are concerned and our players
are committed to it.  
You can't really coach a team that's not committed to something, but they
really see ‑‑ they are tangible. What they have been able to do to opponents
as far as how many points they score, how many ‑‑ stopping from teams from
doing what they like to do.  
  
Q. Aleighsa Welch, how is she doing? Is she going to play tomorrow with the
knee?  
COACH STALEY: Aleighsa is back. She played a little in the SEC Tournament.
She's a resilient player. We are looking to get her a little bit more minutes
than we did in the SEC Tournament. She's practiced well for the past week and
a half, and hopefully we'll have her at full strength tomorrow morning.  
  
Q. You talk about the depth of your team; you have a bunchof people you can
rotate off the bench, and if you look at the numbers your bench contributes
heavily to the scoring and rebounds. Talk about the depth of your team this
year.  
COACH STALEY: I think coming into the season, we knew we were bringing in a
lot of players who could contribute in one area or another.  
I think probably the backbone of what we have been able to do is because we
have had a lot of players who can come off the bench and do a lot of different
things. Aleighsa Welch, she leads us in rebounding. We got Ebony Wilson, as
well, and Sancheon White and Tina Roy, they all come off the bench to give us
a little bit something different, whether it's defense or offense.  
We feel real good about having these guys maybe get a blow during the course
of the game and not miss a beat.  
  
Q. Who is the floor general of this team for you?  
COACH STALEY: The floor general is Ieasia Walker. She's done a tremendous job
at running our basketball team. She's probably sacrificed some of her offense,
just so some of our other players can get shots that they normally get. But
hopefully she'll pick up her offensive prowess as we take the floor tomorrow
morning.  
  
Q. Seems that your focus is here and now; I know your players have gone on
YouTube and see you play; have you guys done that yet ‑‑ look at the laughs
(players laughing). You guys haven't seen your coach play on YouTube or
anything like that? So you don't share your experience with them in this
special situation.  
COACH STALEY: You have to know your personnel. You have to know what they are
listening to. Usually if you are telling them something that's going to help
them, they are listening pretty deeply. But when we talk about something like
myself or Coach McCray, they have this running, like, joke, where they will
bang on the table, wall, anything that they can hit; that means be quiet.
(Laughter) we have heard that a number of times.  
  
Q. Ieasia, Coach talked about you guys being committed to defense, but when
you first came into the program, did you come in committed to defense, or did
Dawn have to make you guys committed to defense?  
IEASIA WALKER: I think I was more committed to defense because my offense was
not there immediately and so I had my mind set on being an energy player and a
defensive stop my freshman year. As I progressed along, I started playing both
sides and that's what she always emphasized; to play defense, so I just stayed
with it.  
  
Q. When you first got in the program, did you realize that defense would
come first in this program?  
LA'KEISHA SUTTON: To be honest, no, I didn't. I thought it was all about
offense and stuff like that but coach emphasized defense and being able to be
discipline a lot, and just taking part with your teammates and competing
night‑in and night‑out, I kind of locked in on defense with my teammates.  
  
Q. At what point were you really committed to defense?  
LA'KEISHA SUTTON: I think my freshman year because I was thrown into the game
to stop the other team's best player. I guess I was good at it, so every time
I'm always guarding best player.  
  
Q. Dawn, some battles when you first got the to battle as far as the style
you wanted to play and the commitment to defense that you wanted out of your
program?  
COACH STALEY: Well, you know, I mean, we have just‑‑ the very beginning, you
know, of coaching, when I was at Temple, something that we can always bank on
was being a very good defensive team and that stuck with me throughout my
career, because offense, you know, it's great to have skills from an offensive
standpoint, but you know, you can't keep trading back.  
We knew the strength of our team would be defense. We knew we had the type of
athletes that could, you know, pretty much play 94 feet, and we also knew it
was an asset, from an offensive standpoint. We shoot‑‑ most of our players
shoot 30 to 40 percent, which isn't a great percentage, but a percentage of us
getting stops is a lot greater than the percentage of us hitting baskets
night‑in and night‑out.  
  
Q. How have you seen Coach's personality, or how has she handled the team
change ‑‑ you're already starting to smile‑‑ over the last four years and why
do you think it's been so successful the last four years?   
LA'KEISHA SUTTON: I think her personality‑‑ well not just her personality but
her coaching style because she let's us hold each other accountable and kind
of correct each other before she steps in to stay something. Pretty much she's
always been easy to talk to and like a silly person. So it's not hard.  
You know, if you make a mistake you don't just dwell on that mistake because
she finds a way to bring us out of it. She's always been intense and really
competitive, and just, you know, if you make a mistake, she won't tell you
about it; but at the same time, if you are doing good, she won't tell, you,
too. So she's not that hard to play for.  
  
Q. Have you had to take a step back occasionally?  
LA'KEISHA SUTTON: Freshman year, we were knew to her, she was knew to us and
it was an adjustment, getting used to each other. I think we bought into her
system and trust in the process, and helped us win a lot of games this career.  
  
Q. How much have you learned in terms of being the floor general?  
IEASIA WALKER: A whole lot. You just have to be a leader on and off the court.
It really never stops. You just always have to set an example and be very
vocal, which is something that I had to get used to when I came in, because I
was not very vocal. I was more of a lead‑by‑example; so I learned to add the
vocal ability and also the leading by example to my game.  
  
Q. How will you manage the nerves? You've played in big games, so it's not
like it's your first big game but certainly a different stage in the NCAA
Tournament.  
MARKESHIA GRANT: I think we are all excited and we have seen games of this
calibre, so I think we are just going to be focused and ready and we are going
to stick to what we do best, and that's be disciplined on defense.  
  
Q. Coach, you addressed the team after the selection show on Monday, that
you'll know what type of cereal Eastern Michigan will be eating in the
morning; have you figured that out or do you think you'll be comfortable?  
COACH STALEY: I haven't gotten to that one yet, but we do know. I think we
have got a pretty good handle on the type of thing that Eastern Michigan is,
and we have got a battle ahead of us.  
But certainly we feel like we like who we are bringing into the game. We like
the style of play that we are taking into the game, and I like the approach
and the focus of our players.  
So you know, it's going to be a battle, and it's one that, you know, we accept
the challenge because we are here at the NCAA Tournament.  
  
Q. Coach, can you just talk about the relationship that you've got with
Coach McCray and how you convinced her to come here and what she's done for
this program?  
COACH STALEY: Well, with Coach McCray we battle. We battled together. We have
been in the foxhole together. She's one that she's a tireless worker. She
recruits. She does an excellent job preparing our team. It's got to be taught
just like the rest of our staff. But she's pretty easy to convince. You've
just got to stroke her ego a little bit (laughing) and she's easy to, you
know‑‑ I think she understands what the task at hand and coming to South
Carolina, she knew that we wanted to turn the program around. She wanted to be
a part of, you know, that process.  
It's been a long, hard‑fought battle. I think for us to do it once again,
being able to overcome some challenges as coaches now instead of being
players, it's a beautiful thing.  
  
Q. Why do you struggle so much at the free throw line?  
COACH STALEY: Why do we struggle so much at the free throw line? It's a good
question. It really is a good question.  
We have tried to change up the way we practice shooting free throws. We
actually consulted with a specialist when it comes to free throw shooting. And
quite honestly, I think it's a little bit better than it was at the beginning
and midway through the season. And in particular, it's probably actually
Boomer. She's shooting it a little bit better. She's probably the one that's
bringing that thing way down, the average way down.  
But over the past couple of weeks, she's been shooting it a lot better in the
SEC tournament. She shot a lot better. But if I knew, we probably would have
more wins or probably less losses than we do at this stage of the game.  
  
Q. Through your WNBA career, you're like an 85 percent free throw shooter;
how frustrating is it to watch your team, knowing the level of free throw
shooting that you achieved?  
COACH STALEY: It is frustrating at times, but you know, it is what it is. I
think it probably just puts pressure on our defense to get stops. You know,
for us, we are going to knock‑on‑wood and hopefully we can get them to fall,
because when we do get them to fall, we end up victorious in closely‑matched
basketball games.  
  
Q. Obviously you had success getting Temple to the NCAA Tournament. What do
you take away from those experiences and what may you do differently this time
trying to get this team prepared going into Game1 against Eastern Michigan?  
COACH STALEY: For us, it's pretty much the same thing. We are not going to
change the approach. We are going to try to stay as normal as possible in how
we prepare. I think the more familiar you are with your approach to the game,
the better off you're going to play.  
Of course, I do think our players are going to have some jitters at the
beginning of the game. That's only right for them to feel that way. But you
know, once the game settles down, I think we'll get into doing the things that
we have done all season long, which is defend and hopefully knock down some
shots within our offense and maybe create some easy opportunities from our
defense.  
  
Q. To any of the players, specifically Grant and Sutton, knowing this is
your final run, that this is it, what's it like knowing this is do ‑or‑die
mode and this is where your career at USC comes to an end?   
MARKESHIA GRANT: It just shows how much, like, our hard work has paid off and
what our sacrifice to be at this point; and it just shows like how much my
teammates and my coaching staff has believed in me.  
I'm just thankful though come to the NCAA Tournament and be able to play with
these great people. So it's just a blessing.  
LA'KEISHA SUTTON: I pretty much agree with Markeshia, just being thankful and
just it's a blessing really, because to see where we started out at my
freshman year in particular, the belief that the coaches had in us and the
belief my teammates had in me and the amount of belief that we had in each
other, we finally got to where we wanted to be since day one.  
I'm not too much focused on it being my last time, my last time in a Gamecock
uniform. Just trying to focus on getting a win and trying to do as much as I
can to help my team.

_WEST LAFAYETTE, INDIANA_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'd like to welcome the Mid‑American Conference champions
Eastern Michigan University. We'd like to welcome AnnMarie Gilbert, the head
coach from Eastern Michigan, as well as players Tavelyn James and Paige
Redditt.  
Questions for Coach or players.  
  
Q. Coach, a couple of years ago you were here in the NIT. Does this bring
back some memories, other than I guess the final outcome, familiar place for
you guys?  
COACH GILBERT: It's a very familiar place for us. I'm really excited to be
back. It's a great place to play. We fared pretty well in that game with the
exception of the final outcome. We led for most of that game. And then there
was a Brittany Rayburn who hit a couple of shots on us late. Can't forget
Brittany Rayburn.  
But it certainly brings back great memories. I used to coach in the Big Ten as
well. And I'm certainly happy to showcase these fine student‑athletes, because
they are really a big part of the reason why we're here.  
  
Q. Tavelyn and Paige, if each of you could talk about being in the NCAA
Tournament at this stage of your career and just how much have you guys
enjoyed the attention and the moments that have come with something like
this?  
TAVELYN JAMES: We never experienced anything like this ever since we've been
at Eastern. So to have the chance to make it to the NCAA, it shows that we
worked so hard our four years to make it here, and we've done it.  
So the experience right now is a little overwhelming, just to see I've never‑‑
I probably could never picture myself sitting right here thinking before our
first game in the NCAA tournament.  
PAIGE REDDITT: Just like she said. It is overwhelming. It's something we've
worked for for our careers, especially to make it our senior year it's the
biggest accomplishment for us, and it's the best way we can go out.  
  
Q. The more you guys were able to win those really close games in the MAC
Tournament to get here, what does that do for your confidence going forward?  
TAVELYN JAMES: I think for me it keeps my confidence the same. I don't try to
overthink the situation or say like I'm any better than anybody else because
everybody has to put their shoes on the same way I do. We just come off and
play hard.  
And I mean the experience in those two games, which I relive every day in my
head, is Paige hitting that layup. I think about it every time, everybody come
to me, say you're a tremendous player. And I say Paige is an All‑American. She
hit the shot. It's wonderful.  
PAIGE REDDITT: I don't know what to say. I mean, it is something that you
relive over and over. And I think that through our careers here we have had a
lot to pull from. We've been through a lot of adversity in our careers. So we
have a lot to pull from.  
We have a lot of heart in our team. So pulling out close games is what we have
been built to do.  
  
Q. Coach, you've had a chance now to look at South Carolina on film. Talk
about South Carolina, what stands out?  
COACH GILBERT: South Carolina is a well‑coached team. They play very much like
their fierce and fearless leader Dawn Staley, but they have very good guard
play, Sutton and Grant and Roy off the bench. Those kids are solid guards.
They play up‑tempo.  
They have no reservation about shooting the 3. You know, they're not stellar
3‑point shooters, but they're gamers. They knock shots down when their team
needs them to.  
And they've got a nice inside presence. And I think that they've got enough on
the interior with Stephens and Bruner and Welch to really keep people honest.
So their guards can get gaps and openings. So we're used to playing up‑tempo
style teams. But this is a very good team.  
It presents some interesting matchups for us. But we feel we match up well
with this basketball team. And we're excited about the opportunity.  
  
Q. Is there anybody that you played this year either in the MAC or in the
nonconference that are similar to this South Carolina team?  
COACH GILBERT: You know, there's nobody that directly reflects this team, but
there are some pieces of guards. You know, Michigan State has some nice guards
that resemble some of the kids that we'll face. Central Michigan has some
athletic players that jump up to the net, to the level of the rim, to get
rebounds.  
This is a team that has some nice athletes, just some nice pieces. I like what
Sutton is doing at the point for them. She plays multiple positions, but she's
a pretty savvy kid, and we've got our work cut out for us.  
But we feel like we have some nice guards, and we can match their interior
play with Paige Redditt and Olivia Fouty, India Hairston. So we hope that we
can keep this South Carolina team off balance a little bit. Change things up a
little bit, not let them get comfortable in any rhythm or groove and try to
win every four‑minute period.  
  
Q. If Tavelyn and Paige could comment on Coach Gilbert and talk about her
coaching style and what it's been like to play for her for four years?  
TAVELYN JAMES: I think she coaches everyone different. Everybody can handle
different situations a different way. I can say for me she's been a coach that
has driven me to be the person that I am, mainly off the court, because when I
came to Eastern, I could play. So her objective was to help me become a better
person off the court. And she has.  
So it's like she was a coach that never let up. She always rolled me every
single year. And I always wondered why. And now I can see why.  
PAIGE REDDITT: The same thing for me. Coach Gilbert is a tough coach. You
can't be a soft player to play for her. And she coaches us to play in the NCAA
tournament. So she coaches us at the same level every day. And either we play
up to it or we don't. But she always coaches the same way.  
She's always pushed me to be a better person, a better player. I mean, when I
came to Eastern I wasn't the scorer, and she has formed me to get better each
year. And I've gotten better every year, up until now.  
So I think I can see to get better this year, too.  
  
Q. Tavelyn, when you saw in the brackets that you were coming back to Mackey
Arena, the game you had a couple of years ago, just kind of relive that a
little bit and what comes to mind when you think about that?  
TAVELYN JAMES: The first thing that comes to mind is I had the flu that day. I
can remember running to the sideline as we were playing getting medicine from
our trainers to continue playing.  
But I feel like my first game here was good. And usually when I have good
games at certain arenas, I always have good games if we go back.  
So I feel like I should be able to play my game and feel like I'm at home.  
  
Q. Why Eastern Michigan for you, what about that school was a good
destination for you?  
TAVELYN JAMES: It really was Coach Gilbert's go get'em attitude. Because I
remember I was coming back from a trip to Chicago, and there was like so: Are
you coming to Eastern or not?  
And I was like: Yeah. So I came‑‑ my family lives in Detroit, so that helped
me a lot. And plus my niece had just been born. So I didn't have to leave. It
ended up working very well for me.  
  
Q. Coach, was it that easy?  
COACH GILBERT: We had to put in a little work for Tavelyn. She wasn't‑‑ the
thing I appreciate about Tavelyn is people don't know how underrecruited she
was. There were other teams in our conference that skipped on Tavelyn. There
were some Big East teams and bigger teams that looked at her, thought she was
too small.  
And the moment I saw her I wanted her at Eastern, and as I found her, other
people started to get interested. And I knew I had to try to expedite the
process.  
But I can't say enough about both of these young ladies, because they were so
raw coming in. People don't realize, Tavelyn James didn't start for us as a
freshman until the conference season. She had to learn how to be a part of
something bigger than herself. She had to learn that the world revolved around
more than Tavelyn James.  
And what you see and hear up here is an unselfish well‑rounded mature young
lady very different than what I inherited. But we've been able to build a lot
of what we do around here, and the unselfishness of Paige Redditt, a kid that
came in able to get 15, 16 rebounds in a game with very little scoring, now
has the confidence to hit the game winner.  
And one thing I said about being in Cleveland, Paige Redditt came over with
35seconds left in that game. We were down a point. And Paige said: Coach, it
doesn't matter what the score reflects. We got this.  
I'm thinking there's 35seconds left, do you know something I don't know,
because I have no more tricks. She had the savvy and poise and confidence.
She's a center that hits all her free throws down the stretch with just so
much poise, and I'm so blessed and thankful to coach both of them.  
  
Q. Tavelyn, at what point in your career did you move past Tavelyn and move
into that next mature phase of your life?  
COACH GILBERT: I would say my junior year I did, because I believed I already
knew my freshman year I didn't. And my sophomore year was the year that she
was getting me to change.  
And then my junior year I think I realized it a lot more when we had six
seniors that I knew were leaving. So I knew that everything would be put on me
and Paige. So as that time started to come around, I realized that I was the
leader and people would follow, and I started to lead.  
  
Q. What's it meant to win the Frances Pomeroy Award and have that
distinction?  
TAVELYN JAMES: Everything is a surprise to me. I didn't know anything about
it. And she called me and she said: You know you're a recipient for the
Francis Pomeroy Naismith Award. And I said what is that?  
Even though I know James Mason, because I took Basketball 101. But when she
called me and I was like, you know‑‑ and I remember I was in the office
because I was trying to do some stuff for class and stuff like that. And I
left.  
As soon as I walked into my house, Kalli called me and said come back. I said
why. Just come back. Coach needs you.  
I guess she hadn't told the coaches and everyone was looking at me. And I said
what did I do. The whole time I was thinking‑‑ she was like come to my office.
So I couldn't think about nothing. Else but what did I do, I didn't know what
I did wrong.  
So we sat down, and it was a heart‑to‑heart moment, because I know that the
reason I made it this far is because of her. So I know‑‑ I remember she told
me when I was a freshman that I would be on the U.S.A. Basketball Team. Same
question, what is that. I didn't know what that was.  
So it just shows me that all the hard work and the change that I've made to
myself have paid off from the help of Coach Gilbert.  
  
Q. Tavelyn, No. 2 scorer in the country, and you and Paige will go up
against the No. 4 defense in the country, talk about the challenge and how
exciting it is to play against a team like South Carolina?  
TAVELYN JAMES: It's exciting, because all teams have their strategies to stop
us, to stop me, to stop Paige. And sometimes it is tough. Some teams have made
it tough. But I feel like because a lot of teams have played us with tough
defense, we're more accustomed to it.  
So you plan up on us, I feel like it helps us.  
PAIGE REDDITT: I feel the same way. And they are a good defensive team. But I
think our defense is pretty underrated, too. They have to play against our
defense just like we have to play against theirs.  
  
Q. Coach, your players obviously are happy to be here, and they want to
enjoy the moment. How do you get them past happy to be here and now a chance
to compete in this tournament and maybe advance?  
COACH GILBERT: Well, as you heard from these two young ladies, I'm pretty
direct. But I feel like I have a good just a sense of balance about what this
means.  
As coaches, my entire coaching staff has been here. And the way we walk, the
way we talk and execute and carry things out, we're preparing them for this
day since day one. Tavelyn James I thought as a small player would be one of
the most exciting guards to play DivisionI basketball as she learned the game
and grew. She's been a sponge.  
And as a result she's played for U.S.A. Basketball. She's the Francis Pomeroy
Naismith Award winner, and she's not by accident in the NCAA Tournament.  
But I do believe that we're going to have to get through the first few minutes
because this tournament is very different than the MAC Tournament. In the MAC
knows you; you've played them two or three times. This is an opportunity for
us to play a team that doesn't know us.  
I think that plays to our strength. We have watched and played against‑‑ we
played against the players Dawn Staley left at Temple. We beat Temple at
Eastern Michigan. So we know her style. We know the kind of player she likes
to recruit.  
And as they mentioned, we're a defensive rebounding‑oriented team. Anytime you
do that, no matter what stage you play on, I thin you have a chance to be
successful. And we're excited. And I don't think they'll be overly nervous. I
think they'll be ready to come out and make a statement, play our best
basketball and leave it on the floor.  
  
Q. Coach, you played UNC Wilmington in the WNIT against Cynthia Cooper,
former U.S. Olympian, you beat her 1 ‑0\. Now you're playing against Dawn
Staley. Talk about the excitement of doing that.   
COACH GILBERT: The great thing for us is ignorance is bliss to young people
who aren't old enough to know any of us who were.  
They don't know who Cynthia Cooper was. It was only after the game when I
shared her history‑‑ I didn't overplay her before the game. But they all got
her autograph and picture after the game. I think they'll be doing that with
Dawn. And I hope the outcome is the same.  
But we're excited because Cynthia Cooper, Dawn Staley, they're good coaches.
And I think I'm a good young, emerging coach. Young is relative, depends on
what the cut‑off is.  
However, I'm just thrilled because our players don't know the magnitude of who
Cynthia Cooper was. She's one of the best ever, ever to wear a women's
basketball uniform. Dawn Staley is not too far behind.  
Because they don't know that, they believe they're supposed to be here.
They've earned the right to be here. And those coaches and Cynthia Cooper
realize she had a lead at half and we won in a hostile environment. Several
thousand fans.  
But we went down there and stole a game that we weren't picked to win. We're
not picked to win this game. But I'm not a betting person, but I like our
chances. And hopefully we'll make it as exciting as you hear the confidence of
us sitting before you today.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

Baylor  80  
Notre Dame  61

  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us now are student‑athletes Odyssey Sims, Brittney
Griner and Destiny Williams and Head Coach Kim Mulkey.  
We'll start right off with questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Brittney, this is what you guys have been pushing for, striving for all
season long. Now that you've accomplished it, what's the feeling?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: Feeling's great. Only thing would have made it better was if
my mom was here. But I know she's home with my little nephew watching.  
  
Q. Odyssey, there was a play when you were up 3 where you got knocked down
flat, you're mid ‑court and you got up and nailed a 3‑pointer. How big a deal
was that, do you think, for the team and what motivated you‑‑ did that
motivate you, that foul?  
ODYSSEY SIMS: I've been getting hit by trains all year. And when I get hit, I
just pop back up. I didn't know I was going to hit a 3. But I tried to get
back into the play as quick as possible and not give up on my team.  
  
Q. Brittney, there was a moment ‑‑ I think about nine minutes left‑‑ where
you put in a hook shot. And then it kind of sparked‑‑ I think it was a 15‑to‑2
run, but you pumped your fist and you get the whistle. You looked pretty
emphatic. Could you talk about what you were feeling at that moment?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: When I hit that little hook, it just got me energized. I was
kind of shocked it went in, but it definitely got me going.  
Then I got that and‑one‑on‑one and I just kind of lost it for a minute and
just celebrating.  
  
Q. Brittney, can you talk about getting ‑‑ people said you had to get a
championship to validate your career as one of the greatest players ever. You
got it and you fulfilled your pledge to win a title.   
BRITTNEY GRINER: National championship, I wanted it because this is what we've
been‑‑ this is what our team wanted, and this is what we promised Coach when
we got here. It had nothing to validate what type of player I am.  
That was the last thing in the back of my mind. It's the team and just getting
the national championship for Coach and for Baylor.  
  
Q. Odyssey, Brittney talks about getting the championship for Coach. You
guys go 40 ‑0 this year. You dominated pretty much the entire season. What can
you say about the job that Coach did with you guys this season, the degree to
which she motivated you and kept you guys focused?  
ODYSSEY SIMS: She did a great job. She did a great job all year keeping us
motivated, big game. She would talk trash to us to keep us motivated, make us
play harder.  
This entire year she's been great. She's one of the best coaches I've ever
had. And toward the end of the season just going through what she's going
through now, she did an even better job. Made her coach harder than what she
did and made us play harder and made us want it more.  
To win this national championship, we're probably more happier for her than we
are for ourselves right now.  
  
Q. Brittney, could you take us into your mind when the clock finally hit all
the 0s? What was the first thing that you were thinking about? What were you
thinking about?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: I was just hugging my teammates. I had tears in my eyes. We
finally did it. Unfinished business was over. And I was just ready to be with
my team and hug them all.  
  
Q. Brittney, Coach McGraw was just now talking about you, she said you're
one of a kind. She said you're like a guy playing with women. Do you take that
as a compliment or how do you take that?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: Definitely, I take it as a compliment. Take it as a
compliment.  
  
Q. The pump fist notwithstanding, it appeared most of the game you were very
calm, cool, collected on the outside at least. Are you that way inside as
well?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: I'm fired up on the inside. I tried to stay cool and mellow
and never really let the defender see if I'm rattled or just try to stay calm.  
  
Q. Destiny, can you talk about just how important it was to win the
rebounding battle and maybe even getting Devereaux in foul trouble?  
DESTINY WILLIAMS: I thought we did a great job getting her in foul trouble
because she helped Notre Dame out with rebounds and blocking shots. We had to
rebound. We couldn't allow them to get second‑chance points. If so, it would
have kept them in the game, and we had to limit them to one shot. A couple
times they did and they'd score off it. And it's something that we had to do
in order to win.  
  
Q. Destiny, you guys played Notre Dame earlier in the year, played Tennessee
twice, Stanford, St. John's, all these teams. How much did that experience of
playing tough teams and sort of taking their best shot maybe come into play
again tonight?  
DESTINY WILLIAMS: It helps us out tremendously. There are times when we are
down and we have to learn how to build back up and take the lead over again
and finish out strong. I thought that a lot of those games prepared us for
this playoff time when‑‑ a couple games that we were down, and we didn't get
frustrated and not thinking correctly.  
We've been in situations like that before that allow us to come out smart and
take better shots and do a better job and finish strong.  
  
Q. Brittney, Notre Dame was pretty happy with their defense on you in the
first half. They said it was pretty effective. What did you do and your
teammates do to get you the ball to get you more success in the second half?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: We just really kept working. We started posting up harder and
stronger and calling for the ball. And Coach made a couple of adjustments on
the offense and just got the ball, was able to get the ball in.  
  
Q. Destiny, could you just talk about the defense tonight and just how
important it's been to y'all all year?  
DESTINY WILLIAMS: Our defense led us throughout the whole year. We frustrated
our opponents, made every shot that they took‑‑ made it a hard one, and we had
to play team ball. I thought we really as a team just denied the ball, getting
blocks and just rotated correctly. And that helped us out a lot.  
Our offense, they didn't flow the last game, and our defense picked it up and
helped us get the win. And I think our defense is one of a kind.  
  
Q. Brittney, I know it's a little early right now, but what do you guys do
for an encore next year? Went undefeated this year, won your title. What do
you do for an encore next year?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: Right now we're just going to celebrate this, and when the
season comes next year, we'll start thinking about that. Right now it's just
celebrating.  
  
Q. Can you talk about your relationship with Coach Mulkey. Up there she said
you played hard for her because you know she has your back. Could you
elaborate on that a little bit?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: Like she said, we know Coach fights for us on and off the
court. She's there for us.  
And just the long relationship between me and her and just‑‑ I know she's
there and I got her back and she's got mine.  
  
Q. Destiny, could you talk a little bit about just what the championship
means for you and what it will mean for you going back home, the fact that it
was over Notre Dame?  
DESTINY WILLIAMS: Dedication that we put in. We put in a lot throughout the
summer and for these games we played, it prepared us for this championship
game. And we're excited to finally‑‑ all the workouts, to finally get that
championship. And we're just ready to celebrate it and enjoy it with our
families and with our teammates and just ready to go home.  
  
Q. Destiny, Brittney is real humble when she speaks about herself. Can you
put into words how much she means to not just your team but the whole school,
and especially with all the pressure that she has to go through?  
DESTINY WILLIAMS: A lot of people look up to her. They respect her. And off
the court the kid is‑‑  
COACH MULKEY: She calls her a kid.  
BRITTNEY GRINER: Like she's 30 or something. You're my age. I told myself‑‑ it
slipped.  
DESTINY WILLIAMS: They enjoy being around her. She's funny. She's well‑liked
off the court. She's like a regular student. She's not one of those who "I
don't want to be messed with" or anything like that.  
So on the court, she's just Brittney. She's here to play ball and she can care
less about other things. And it's something that you need in players like
that, because they will always help you out with a win.  
  
Q. Destiny, I think you said you dreamed of this. Is the reality better than
the dream?  
DESTINY WILLIAMS: What? Are you serious? You're really going to ask me that?
Oh, of course it is. The trophy is kind of heavy. It's heavier than my dream,
but I like it.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Kim, I know you do not like to compare teams. But because of the
historical nature of this, a lot of people are going to be looking at this 40
‑0 with your history of the game. How do you want this team remembered?   
COACH MULKEY: I thought the'05 team, we just came in the back door. We didn't
have expectations placed on us. I think we were a 3 seed that year and we beat
three No.1 seeds to win the national championship. So we were the underdog.  
The difference in that team and this team is that we didn't come in the back
door. From day one the expectations were placed on us, we embraced it, and we
lived up to it.  
Sports is an interesting profession. You can embrace being thought about as
being a dominant team, or you can shy away from it. Most of the time I'll try
to protect them from you guys and from the public.  
But we couldn't do that this year. You can't hide the talent in that locker
room that I get to coach. So we embraced it. And that's a little bold on my
part and it's a little uncomfortable for me because that's not my personality.  
But I think they sense Coach is always brutally honest with us. I couldn't
walk in the locker room and hoodwink them and tell them we don't have those
expectations; you're not that good, you're one of many, because, truthfully,
we're pretty special.  
And that's the difference in the two teams.  
  
Q. Is any part of this ‑‑ do you feel any relief tonight at all?  
COACH MULKEY: My relief is for those players. I want to make sure you
understand when I say this: I've done this since I was 18years old. I've
played for national championships. Won Olympic gold medals. I know what it
feels like.  
My joy now with coaching is I want my players to feel what I have been blessed
to feel for years. The joy for me is to watch all those Baylor people out
there on the big stage and feel good and feel important, and that makes me
happy.  
My joy is to watch a Brittney Griner and an Odyssey Sims and a Jordan Madden,
who never even won a state championship, win a national championship.  
It's not about me. I've been around some of the best in the business. But my
joy in coaching is for the people who have never had the opportunity to
experience what I have.  
  
Q. Kim, how satisfying is it when the game's most talked about player has a
game where she lives up to all the billing?  
COACH MULKEY: If Brittney didn't score a point, she would have lived up to the
billing, because she's so dominant on the defensive end of the floor.  
You just held‑‑ correct me if I'm wrong, is Notre Dame not the highest scoring
team in the country, points scored? Second? They're up there. You just held
them to 61points.  
Brittney Griner's presence on the defensive end of the floor, you have to make
adjustments. Shots that they were making they were having to release it
quicker before she could get over there. They got a lot of layups because they
brought Brittney away from the basket.  
I'll go back to the original question to Brittney. It's sad in athletics when
people feel you have to validate your talent by winning a championship. But,
you know what, that's society and that's the world we live in.  
Brittney Griner, whether she won today or not, will go down in the history of
the women's game if not the greatest post player, one of the greatest.  
I'm so glad that she has that ring now.  
  
Q. With about a minute to go, you brought everyone out and put the subs in,
and you had these big hugs at your bench with Brittney and some of the other
players. You're so good at describing things, could you tell us at that moment
what you were thinking and saying and how great that must have felt?  
COACH MULKEY: Just hugged them and told them I'm so happy for you guys. I'm so
happy for you. Thank you for letting me coach you. Thank you for letting me
challenge you. And I think I said it to all of them, not just Brittney and
Jordan, but just every one of them.  
There were many tears on that bench, but they're tears of joy. And I think
that's what I said. Bell's palsy kicks in, I don't know if there was more than
that, there could have been.  
  
Q. What is the significance you attach to being the only team to go 40 ‑0?  
COACH MULKEY: No significance, honestly, right now, today, because the only
words that are coming out of our mouth are national champions. 40‑0 will mean
something to me and to all of them when they're through with their collegiate
year and we'll think back on what we accomplished, who we played to go 40‑0\.
That may be the story, is who you played to be 40‑0\. You didn't play a bunch
of patsies.  
But that was never a goal of ours. It had to be when the NCAA brackets were
announced. But it was never a goal of ours.  
  
Q. You had a 14 ‑point lead in that first half, got down to 6, what was the
message at halftime and did you make any adjustments to get the ball more
inside to Brittney?  
COACH MULKEY: We made adjustments, but, again, I didn't think the whole night
we took a bad shot. Maybe when the shot clock was winding down we forced up on
some things.  
But I thought a key to their run to cut it to 6 was they put their kids back
in that had the two fouls, and I just thought just keep your composure. We've
been here before. We've done this before. You've been in the locker room
behind. You've been in the locker room with big leads, small leads, you've
been in the locker room when you've had great momentum. You've been in the
locker room when you lost momentum.  
I didn't sense anything in that locker room except that we were still in
control of the game.  
We made some adjustments on ball reversal, screening the zone. I just felt
that we were very composed. We took very few bad shots. I thought we took care
of the ball. You want to have an assist‑to‑turnover ratio 2 to 1; we almost
did that. You had 20 and 11.  
And I just felt Odyssey Sims's ability to know when to shoot, know when to run
and know who needs to touch the ball, give up the ball quicker to the I
formation 2‑3, I just felt she ran the show out there. I thought she was the
point guard I envisioned her to continue to be.  
  
Q. 40 and 0, all these players coming back, there's going to be high
expectations next year. How do you top perfection?  
COACH MULKEY: Well, see you're already starting. You're making me embrace it
now instead of letting me enjoy this. Yes, we have everybody back that plays a
majority of the minutes except for Terran Condrey. We think we have one of the
best recruiting classes in the country. One of our players was MVP of the
McDonald's All‑American game.  
We're going to embrace it. I don't think you guys are going to let me hide it.
You all keep trying as best you can to encourage Brittney to leave. That's not
happening either. Where is Jerry with the New York Times? His article, I loved
it, but that's not happening. She's not going anywhere. She'll be worth the
same millions next year as she's worth this year.  
We have to embrace it. If we lose two, three, four, five, and we go 30 and 10,
I don't care. I want to be in New Orleans. That's my home state. And I won't
have enough tickets for family, but I'll do something to get them in the
arena.  
But that's what we want, another national championship.  
I saw Calipari wants to go undefeated. Good luck to him.  
  
Q. I don't know if there's a turning point, but you were up 3 and Odyssey
takes a hard foul right in front of you, and she gets up and hits a 3 and it
just looked like that's when things started to roll. Did you sense that as a
big deal at the time?  
COACH MULKEY: No, I didn't sense it as a big deal. I'm so engaged in what are
they doing defensively, computing with my coaches, do I need to run this.  
At the moment you don't realize where the turning point may be. I just know
the kid, she harasses the ball so hard that she gets hit and popped all the
time because you have to relieve pressure by having somebody out there to
screen for it, to help the point guard.  
And she's aware of it. And she just bounces right back up.  
  
Q. Kim, great Baylor contingent here in attendance to celebrate it.
Obviously there was a big watch party at the Ferrell Center. What do you think
the party back in Waco is going to be like?  
COACH MULKEY: Well, you know, at Baylor, they used to not let the Baptists
dance. I bet they're dancing now. It's fun. Look, it's been a great year for
Baylor. Robert Griffin being here. I don't know what other coaches from Baylor
were here.  
It's just a fun time. And I look forward to going back. I know they're
planning a celebration at the Ferrell Center when we arrive back tomorrow.
Let's enjoy. This is a memory. This is a memory and that's all we have in our
life. We have our family and we have memories.  
And this is for Baylor. This is for everything that you can do for a
university, is play at the highest level. And Baylor is doing that, not just
in women's basketball but in all sports.  
  
Q. I know that you've said that until you got to the Final Four and had to
win the 40 and out, that that wasn't a goal in itself. But last year when we
were preparing the schedule for this year and you put 40 games on the
schedule, was there any awareness at that point that was setting you up for a
possible place in history?  
COACH MULKEY: Not at all. I think our media relations person, Julie Bennett,
maybe somewhere in February, somewhere in there, just casually mentioned it.
Maybe coming home from a trip. She said: You know, if we win it all, we could
go 40 and 0 and undefeated.  
Nobody felt that. We didn't plan that. Didn't know anything about it really
until she brought it to our attention.  
  
Q. I think you've just made a lot of people in Los Angeles very unhappy. But
is that like take it to the bank, Brittney's not coming out next year ‑‑ this
year?  
COACH MULKEY: No, she's not going anywhere. I don't know what part of that
y'all don't understand. She's not going anywhere. She is not even going to be
able to go do a lot of things because she wants to graduate in four years. She
wants to get her degree. And Brittney Griner is not going anywhere. She said
it; I've said it. I don't know what else we can say. She's not going anywhere.  
This kid is‑‑ she's a jewel. She enjoys Baylor. Come see her. Watch her long
board across campus, paint her body at a football game. Watch her do
cartwheels and roll down the halls. She's a kid. She enjoys her college life.  
She knows she's going to make money some day. She's not in a hurry to go into
that crude, rude, crazy real world. She likes her little comfort there in
Waco, Texas.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_DENVER, COLORADO_  
  

Baylor  80  
Notre Dame  61

  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us at the podium are Head Coach Muffet McGraw and
student‑athletes Skylar Diggins and Natalie Achonwa.  
We'll start with the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Skylar, can you talk about, seemed like you had to come back and come
back and come back, and just what happened that second half that it got away
from you.  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: Yeah, in the first half we had foul troubles and things like
that. We had to go deep into our bench early, and we had to make adjustments
and things like that.  
And they made a couple of baskets and got up 7, 9, and then we just kept
digging ourselves in the hole by not taking our shots. I don't think that we
were taking the shots that we had. And when we were, we weren't shooting it
confidently. And so that dug us in a hole a little bit. So we were chasing,
chasing. I think we spent a lot of energy chasing.  
And I think in the second half we‑‑ we hit some shots in the first half to
kind of cushion the blow. In the second half those shots just weren't falling.
And they were hitting a lot of theirs.  
  
Q. Skylar, is there any point in the game that you would say was the turning
point for you?  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: They went on the run there, and I just remember we had cut it
down to 5 or 3, and then they went on a run. And I saw 10, 12, 14, 16, 19.
They just went on a run. We couldn't get stops.  
We couldn't get rebounds when we did make them miss shots.  
  
Q. Natalie, seemed at times tonight you and your teammates were in perfect
defensive position, arms up, and you just couldn't stop Brittney. How
frustrating was that?  
NATALIE ACHONWA: Very frustrating. I think Brittney Griner had a great game,
and she was hitting those shots.  
And I think personally I could have done a better job on executing our game
plan. I think I gave her the baseline a couple times.  
But as far as that, she had a great game. She was making her shots.  
  
Q. Skylar, can you talk a little bit about the legacy the four seniors
leave?  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: This is a great senior class. And I know me watching their
whole careers, even on the sidelines, just amazing what they've been able to
do and bring this program back to an elite program, and being able to lead
this team to back‑to‑back national championship games is amazing.  
And I hate that it ends on a game like this, because you fail to see
everything they did to get to this point.  
But it's amazing and the best team I've been a part of ever. Never been a part
of anything like this. And we'll all keep in touch. They're like my sisters.
And it's amazing and we're going to miss them.  
But very proud of them, and I know the Irish fans are proud as well.  
  
Q. Natalie, of all the things that Brittney does well, what's the hardest to
stop?  
NATALIE ACHONWA: She keeps the ball high. She's 6'8". She keeps it up there. A
lot of posts bring it down, and that would give us the advantage, but she
keeps the ball up and she fights for position.  
  
Q. Are you convinced that Baylor is the best team this year in the
country?  
NATALIE ACHONWA: Obviously.  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: They're a great team. They're a hardworking team. They've got
players that can‑‑ multiple players that can score 20. Every player knows
their role and they play it to a T. And they showed they're the best team in
the country.  
  
Q. Skylar, now that you are a senior leader, can you talk about how this
game fuels hunger and what you take from it going into the offseason building
for next year?  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: Gotta do a better job being a leader. I thought I didn't have
good leadership out there tonight as far as keeping our fire. But I'll do
better. I promise.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.  
Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. What was your game plan against Brittney and how did you adjust during
the game?  
COACH McGRAW: Our plan was to double. We were going to play mostly zone and
bring the double team. And I thought it was fairly effective in the first
half. I thought the zone looked pretty good. And the second half, when we got
into the foul trouble that destroyed our game plan, we really needed
Devereaux. She was a big part of the plan. And we didn't have her.  
We came in with Markisha Wright, who I thought played well as a freshman. But
in the second half we were afraid to foul. Every time Brittney got the ball,
even when we brought the double team, we didn't really lean on her. And I
thought she got really close to the basket almost all of her shots, and she
shot it over us.  
There really wasn't anything we could do. We brought the double team. And she
just‑‑ she made great shots. She's a great player. She was unstoppable, I
thought, for the size and the players that we had in. It would have been great
to see Devereaux play for 39minutes.  
But I'm not sure it would have changed a lot. She just‑‑ she's so big. She's
hard to stop.  
  
Q. Muffet, have you ever seen anyone who has ever been able to impact the
game at least down low as Brittney did and obviously as she did tonight?  
COACH McGRAW: No. I think she's one of a kind. I think she's like a guy
playing with women. It's just there's so many things that she can do that I've
not seen a lot of women‑‑ well, really, you know, there's been some guards
that had some skill like that. But as a post player she's the best I've ever
seen.  
  
Q. Even though you had foul trouble and some other things going wrong, you
cut it to 6 at halftime and cut it to 3 and had the ball. Could you talk about
the way your team was able to fight back?  
COACH McGRAW: I was proud of that. And I think Markisha was in there for some.
I think when we brought Dev back in‑‑ it was really disappointing that she got
the third foul in the first half. That really was disappointing. Because she
was why we made that run, having her back in.  
And Skylar getting two fouls, that didn't affect it quite as much because she
was able to stay out of foul trouble the rest of the game. And the second half
Dev got a fairly quick one.  
And we just weren't big enough. We just needed a little more size, and we
just, we missed so many shots that they‑‑ their defense is really good, but we
missed a lot of just a lot of open shots, too.  
  
Q. When Dev got in foul trouble, Markisha Wright and Natalie Achonwa played
a lot of solid minutes. Could you talk about their play a little bit more and
what that means for the future of your program?  
COACH McGRAW: Ace is really talented, and I think she's got a great future. I
think the way she played against Maryland I thought was a great start for her
to move into next year.  
And Markisha Wright, I like her. I wish I would have played her more
throughout the year. Because she's strong and she's a really good low block
player, which we don't really have. So I think the two of them will be really
good next year.  
  
Q. Obviously a championship game loss is going to be rough no matter what.
But I wonder if you're more emotional tonight because of this senior class
that you've grown so fond of?  
COACH McGRAW: I was hoping nobody would ask that question. The waterworks will
begin now.  
It's such a tough way for their career to end.  
  
Q. In a situation like this, one wonders, if you had anything to change
about your game plan or the execution, if you could have a do ‑over on it,
what would you change and why?   
COACH McGRAW: I would‑‑ I'd have Dev play more. I think that was‑‑ that's
really‑‑ we didn't have any control over that.  
I thought our game plan was sound. We didn't‑‑ we didn't score. I think we got
really frustrated with our inability to score, and they were scoring so
easily, 40points in the paint. And we were struggling to make a basket.  
  
Q. Did you think Skylar was a little tough on herself tonight? And then what
do you see from her in terms of being your senior leader for next year?  
COACH McGRAW: I mean, she played a great game. She didn't have any turnovers.
We only had seven turnovers as a team. We did do a few things well.  
She's just such a big‑time player and she just didn't get a lot of help today.
But she did everything I thought she could possibly do.  
  
Q. I'm wondering how you help players who have had such a great year all
year but there's such a hunger for this national championship, especially
after last year. How do you help them process this in a way that they can
actually learn from the loss and still not be overwhelmed by it and be able to
come back and move on next year?  
COACH McGRAW: I think it will be toughest for the seniors not having that
opportunity to come back. They're the ones that carried it so hard last time
also.  
We've got a lot of new faces now with Kayla and Skylar and Ace, really kind of
the three main players returning. So I think for them it will be good
motivation.  
And for the freshmen, we've got to improve a lot to get ready for next year,
and I think them seeing what it's like even from the bench I think will help
them.  
But I think we'll be able to process that. I think it will take some time, but
eventually we'll remember what a great season this was.  
  
Q. Is the feeling in the locker room any different than last year? Is there
more of a feeling that Baylor really just kind of outplayed you the whole game
or maybe more so than Texas A &M?  
COACH McGRAW: I think it hurts no matter how much you lose by. But I think the
feeling last year was a little different, I think more of we kind of let it
slip away a little bit, but this game got out of hand. So I think there was
some frustration that everybody didn't play as well as they wanted to. But
it's still pretty much the same. Everybody's pretty emotional.  
  
Q. Baylor has everybody back next year. What is the future of this program
going to be like? Can anybody stop them next year?  
COACH McGRAW: I think‑‑ no, I think they'll be preseason No.1. And we're still
going to work at getting Brittney to leave early.  
  
Q. You talked about double teaming out of the zone. To my observation, it
looked more like the primary defender was frumping Brittney and the help was
coming over from the other side. Was that part of the game plan, or is that
when she got moving on you?  
COACH McGRAW: We did three different things. The most‑‑ most of the time we
played behind and brought the help. We also fronted for a spell. That was
fairly successful, actually.  
And then we played a box and one on Sims for a while. Tried to put the box on
Brittney. So we were trying to play behind her then also.  
  
Q. At this Final Four, one thing that was successful against Baylor was the
backdoors, sort of the UC Davis patent backdoor. Did you pick up on what
Stanford was doing, and next season do you think there's something that could
be expanded on that?  
COACH McGRAW: We run the Princeton offense which involves a lot of backdoors,
and I think when we started the game you saw at the beginning of the game we
were game planned to a T: Use the screen, engage Griner, and hit the roll.  
And I think Dev got two quick baskets before she got her two quick fouls.
That's what we were trying to do really most of the game, was to engage her in
the ball screen and get the roll.  
And then we had some backdoor opportunities that‑‑ I think they learned
something, too. I think they got off a little bit. We got a couple. But I
think they started playing a little softer.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_DENVER, COLORADO_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us now from Baylor we have student‑athletes Odyssey
Sims, Kimetria Hayden, Jordan Madden, Destiny Williams and Brittney Griner and
head coach Kim Mulkey.  
We will take questions for anyone on the dais.  
  
Q. Coach, I wondered what stands out in your mind most about the game with
Notre Dame early in the season, and then how different is your team now than
it was then.  
COACH MULKEY: I can't remember a whole lot other than what Sims brings back to
my memory. I remember an outstanding basketball team. I remember senior
basketball team. I remember a talented basketball team.  
Specifics of the game? We had too many games between then and now, and as we
watched film, we just to break down again the scouting report that we had on
them then and how they've changed. I would just say they're a different team,
we're a different team, but the system is not different.  
I remember they pressed as they did last night against Connecticut some. I
remember that their depth is about like our depth. They play about the same
number of people. And great back court.  
  
Q. Odyssey, you've played with Skylar Diggins on the U.S.A. team. Played
against her. What makes her such a tough player, and do you welcome that kind
of challenge of going up against a player like that?  
ODYSSEY SIMS: She's great all around, she has great vision she can take it off
the dribble and pull up 2, and that's what makes her so great. And she makes
everyone around her better.  
And we play U.S.A. team ball together. Played on one team. She's a great
teammate‑‑ was a great teammate, and I look for a challenge on Tuesday.  
  
Q. Kim, you've talked about Brittney a lot I know and I'm sure it's a joy
and pleasure to discuss all the things she does. I'm curious about if you can
put in perspective with all that you know about women's basketball her place
in this game? I know it's been talked about as the first female ‑‑ female Wilt
Chamberlain or Bill Russell or Kareem‑‑ Lew Alcindor. How would you place her
in the history and the importance of the women's game? Thanks.   
COACH MULKEY: I've challenged her as her coach to motivate her into‑‑ I'm
going to answer your question to lead in with this response first. I've
challenged both Brittney and Odyssey to win a national championship. At the
same time I don't think they need it to validate being the greatest in the
game.  
With or without a game it starts what she does on the defensive end of the
floor. I've said it many times: There have been players before her that dunk,
there have been players before her that block shots, but there's never been a
player before her that intimidates you on the defensive end of the floor.  
She has a presence in the paint on the defensive end of the floor like none
other. I've played with 6'9". I've watched 6'9" dunk the ball. I've dunked the
ball. I've been on an Olympic team. I've played in a National. I've been
against the Ulyana Semenovas. Brittney Griner's presence on the defensive end
of the floor separates her from any player that has ever played the game.  
She doesn't need a national championship to validate her place in this sport.
Would it be nice? Absolutely. Does it motivate her? Absolutely.  
  
Q. Kim, I noticed you're shielding your eyes a little bit.  
COACH MULKEY: Turn those lights off.  
  
Q. How are you feeling right now? And is the complications from the Bell's
palsy more than you expected, or what's your situation right now?  
COACH MULKEY: I don't know what I expected other than facial paralysis. The
eyes and the ears irritate and frustrate me, but I'm not in any pain. It's
just I see you over there, but it's the bright light that kind of irritates
you. The voice, when I raise my voice or you talk real loud, my ear feels like
a blown speaker.  
But pain, I'm not in any pain. I don't care what I look like. I'd love to wear
this tomorrow night with no makeup on and then go win a championship. But I
feel frustrated because I want to say things as quickly as I normally say them
without spitting and all that stuff.  
But it's more frustration. But as Odyssey told me, Coach, we hear you loud and
clear. And that's what I don't realize because I can only hear my ears
ringing. It feels like they can't hear my message. And they told me: We hear
ya, we hear ya.  
It's the frustration of my eyes. They're red and irritable. But I see the
scoreboard.  
  
Q. Brittney, all year you've been trying to get to this point, and now
you're here one day before, what are your thoughts tomorrow night the
excitement, the last game to win a national championship and go undefeated all
the stuff that comes along with it?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: Excited, definitely excited. This is the game we've been
waiting for all year. And we're finally here and just got one more game. Gotta
lay it all on the line. So afterwards we can celebrate.  
  
Q. Jordan, you had some open shots early in that game yesterday. Was there
any sense of frustration on your part? And, if so, how did you overcome that
as the game progressed?  
JORDAN MADDEN: Yeah, it was a lot of frustration because I see a lot and I
just gotta go in and practice and knock down shots. And like I shot a little
bit and I missed. And I stopped shooting and I just started driving
(indiscernible) and find somebody open and throw it to them.  
  
Q. Brittney and Odyssey, can you talk about if it's an advantage to ‑‑ it
probably is an advantage to have already played Notre Dame. What do you guys
remember about that first game, and, of course, they've already played you.
Does one team have an advantage here? You're coming off a game where you
hadn't played your opponent last night before, and I don't know how different
is it when you've already had a good look at them in just a couple of months
ago.   
BRITTNEY GRINER: I wouldn't say it's an advantage. We played them and they
know us and we know them. Just gotta go back, look at the game, look at where
we messed up and just correct it.  
ODYSSEY SIMS: Like she said, it's really no advantage. They play four guards
and they have one post inside. So we're going to have to do a better job of
defending and have good help side.  
As far as us, we're just going to play better basketball and try to come out
with a win tomorrow.  
  
Q. Destiny, they don't have the size that Stanford did. What do you see from
their inside game, particularly Devereaux Peters?  
DESTINY WILLIAMS: We have a size advantage like Stanford had on us, and we can
try and kill them on the boards. That's one thing. Allow our post players to
get touches early to get our game rolling. But they have a small guard. So
they'll be able to push the ball in transition and try and get some layups or
some quick shots in transition.  
So there's just two different styles right there that's going to separate the
game.  
  
Q. How often do you guys think about the last time you lost the game against
Texas A &M and have any of you watched that game this year?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: I don't remember it. I remember that ride back to Waco. I
remember how I felt after that loss. I feel we all remember it. That was our
motivation this year, that loss, to get us back here and to get us through.  
  
Q. Kim, how does Odyssey match up against Skylar offensively and
defensively?  
COACH MULKEY: I think very well. They played together with U.S.A. Basketball
this summer. Odyssey was the youngest on the team. She had an opportunity to
make the younger team and they didn't want her on that team. They moved her up
to play with Skylar Diggins and that age group.  
So that probably tells you what they think of Odyssey Sims. I think you'll see
two of the finest point guards in the country. And I anticipate that it won't
be any different than when Odyssey guarded her and played against her at our
place.  
I thought Odyssey was outstanding in that game. I thought she held her own,
and I'm sure glad she's on my team.  
  
Q. Destiny, can you take that question as well? Because you played with
Skylar on a U.S.A. team and you played with Odyssey. Can you describe how
they're alike and how they're different as point guards?  
DESTINY WILLIAMS: Playing with Skylar, she had more experience over Odyssey. I
know she played U.S.A. ball longer than Odyssey did. Skylar had people to help
her become a better player and playing with Odyssey she's growing and maturing
into a fine basketball player. I think Odyssey's defense is amazing, and when
she picks it up I think the whole team picks it up.  
Their IQs are about the same. Just two point guards that are great players
going at it. I enjoy playing with both of them. But I'd rather have Odyssey,
too.  
  
Q. Brittney, growing up so tall, I'm curious if you could tell us a story or
two of how tough that was or when you realized that sports would be a home for
you, that you might not get teased or whatever in sports the way maybe some
kids might when you were a kid. And if I could ask also along with that: Size
17 shoes, how hard is it to find shoes?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: Well, growing up, I was always active. Sports really didn't
come in until later on. But I love being tall. There really wasn't any
teasing. I guess they were smart enough not to tease the big kid (laughter).
But I loved it. I like being different. I like being tall. The only thing that
sucks: Can't get that little sports car (laughter).  
And the size 17 shoe, just go online, really. Can't really go in the store:
Hey, I need a 17. But I can go online. More options, more colors, different
styles. It's not bad.  
  
Q. Odyssey, is it easier for a left ‑handed guard to go against another
left‑hander, as far as Skylar, or is it a little more challenging because you
don't go against that many left‑handers?  
ODYSSEY SIMS: I wouldn't say it's easier. I guess it's the same because I
pressure the ball the same whether you're right‑handed or left‑handed. So
there's really no difference.  
I just go out there and try to do what I can and try to create turnovers, and
that's pretty much it.  
  
Q. Odyssey, how would you say your personality is similar to Coach Mulkey
and how would you say it's different?  
ODYSSEY SIMS: Similar on the court. Different off the court. Because she
played point guard position, so she kind of knows when I get frustrated, she
knows me very well. I feed off of what she does and she kind of feeds off what
I do on the court.  
I try to call the plays as much as possible, try to be the floor general on
the court and lead my team so she doesn't have to talk as much.  
Off the court, I'm a lot different. I talk a lot. I'm goofy. I just love being
with my teammates.  
  
Q. Coach, in the first game, 175 points scored, your most offensive game of
the year, the most points you gave up all year. Was there a reason for that
and do you expect a similar game tomorrow night?  
COACH MULKEY: I'd say neither team played very good defense, did we? I don't
know that I anticipate it to be a high‑scoring game. I think you'll see two
teams that will buckle down and guard each other. If it is high scoring, I
just hope we're the one that has the most points.  
But that was a lot of points being scored. Early in the year, I'm not sure we
were committed defensively to some things in that game as we are today. And
that's understandable.  
I mean, when you're in November and December, we're still in football season
in Texas. We're probably thinking about where the next football game is on
Friday and Saturday night.  
But we're better, they're better. And if there are that many points scored, it
will be entertaining, I guess you'd say, for the fans. I don't know about the
coaches.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Kim, is it my understanding that Trace Adkins will be here tomorrow
night? And, also, any other special guests that will be here?  
COACH MULKEY: It's my understanding that Trace will be here. It's my
understanding Art Briles, our Football Coach of the Year, will be here. Scott
Drew, our men's basketball coach will be here. And Judge Starr is here with
his wife, Alice. And I don't know who else. Probably 19,000 more, I hope.  
My family, which is most important. My son Kramer, missing his baseball game
tomorrow, will be here. He was here last night. And my mother. Not that any of
you care, but those are more important to me than anybody else. So my
immediate family is here and lots of people from Louisiana Tech, where I came
from, those people near and dear to me. There's probably 25 of them here.  
  
Q. Kim, I just wanted to clarify something. When you felt something strange
on your tongue prior to the diagnosis, what was that feeling? And what was
that?  
COACH MULKEY: We were in Des Moines, and I forgot my toothpaste. So in my
night bag I had a little box of Colgate. Props to Colgate. Probably been in my
bag five years. I open the box, brush my teeth. And I go down to breakfast. I
thought it was a change in toothpaste. My tongue felt weird. I don't know what
weird meant. Just weird.  
I asked the trainer can you be allergic to toothpaste, can it become outdated.
He looked at me like: She's stressed again.  
And I guess we won, got back home, Tuesday. I was doing the NCAA
teleconference at my desk eating a sandwich. As I was eating, it felt like it
does when you leave the dentist office and you're numb. But I couldn't see
myself. So after the teleconference I brushed my teeth, headed out to
practice. When I was walking out the door of my bathroom, I looked in the
mirror and I thought, Gol, and I looked again and my smile was crooked and my
eyebrows were weird.  
So I wouldn't normally think anything of it. But you pretty much can diagnose
yourself if you know your body well. I diagnosed the kidney stones when those
happened three years ago.  
I went to our trainer and I thought, you know, look at this. And I said: What
do you think? He said: I think you need to leave now. You need to go rule out
a stroke, tumor, and we think it's probably something like Bell's palsy.  
And that's what I did. And fortunate to live in a community that physicians
got me in and out quickly.  
I went in and told the team first when I wasn't going to be at practice.
Because our practices are open, and I didn't want people coming in there
wondering where I was.  
So I told the team, and then told them what I thought it was, and came back
and the next day. And that's the extent of it.  
  
Q. You mentioned LA Tech. So the question is this: Your'82 LA Tech national
champions versus your 2012 Baylor Bears, you lose by 5, 30?  
COACH MULKEY: We kick their butt. I'm on that team. I'll take Odyssey Sims on
any day.  
No. Listen, I don't compare teams. I don't compare generations. I know this:
Back in the early'80s we were the dominant women's basketball team. And our
First and Second team could have been ranked in the top five. And you don't
compare teams. You don't compare generations. Because things change. I know
this: That there was‑‑ the Cheryl Miller was the face of women's basketball
during the'80s, just as Brittney Griner is.  
But Cheryl Miller did not have the defensive presence that Brittney Griner
does. Cheryl Miller was great and one of the great ones of all time. Cheryl
Miller has a ring, too, and Brittney doesn't. So you can compare and say all
those things, but, look, I wouldn't want to bring the ball up against Odyssey
Sims. She just is a gnat out there. She worries you to death.  
  
Q. And the game?  
COACH MULKEY: I'm extremely proud in a lot of sense. I think the exposure and
television coverage is great. With that comes things I don't like. I don't
like to be interviewed during the game. But we're required to do that. I don't
like having the cameras in the locker room. That's a sacred place. And I
struggle with that.  
But I understand to grow the game and make the game better that's what we do.
That's the generation we live in. But, truthfully, I'm from the old school.
What is said in the locker room should stay in the locker room and don't put
coaches in a position during the game in the heat of the moment for them to
say something bad.  
Because I coach with passion. I don't like to pretend and set up a‑‑ you don't
see me in the locker room giving my pregame speech. To me that's sacred.
That's for show.  
But yet I understand the TV coverage is so much greater today than it was
then, and that is good. And I just wish we could balance it a little bit more.  
  
Q. I know you're obviously a historian of the game. You guys are one win
away from achieving the seventh perfect season and such. Just 24 hours before
what your sense is and where you think you guys are right now as far as a
place in history, and if you do win tomorrow night, where things go as far as
this team and the run you've had this season.  
COACH MULKEY: Win or lose tomorrow, we're going to head back to Waco and we're
going to have a disappointing feeling. Unfortunately, we're 39‑0 and you don't
want to lose that last game. But if we were 30 and 10 we wouldn't want to lose
the last game.  
We know this: That whoever beats us‑‑ and we've said this all year long,
whoever beats us just make sure that you didn't beat yourself. You make sure
that team was better than you that night. And if you do that, you can't fault
your effort. And Notre Dame was here last year. They played for the national
championship and lost. They have as bitter a taste in their mouth as we do
losing to A&M when we played them the fourth time in the Regional Finals.  
It's going to be players making plays. It's not going to be anything that
Muffet does or I do. It's going to be those guys on the floor making plays,
and whoever makes the most plays will win the basketball game.  
  
Q. From what areas would you like to see Brittney improve next year?  
COACH MULKEY: I always want Brittney to be a little bit more aggressive with
her being vocal. She's such just a tender little giant out there. She demands
the ball with just her presence. But sometimes it's okay to get on a teammate
in a constructive way. I don't know that I'll ever get her to do that, because
she just‑‑ that's not Brittney.  
But I would love to see her lead more vocally than she does. I think offensive
rebounding because she gets blocked out, so many people are in front of her,
man, if she could get in there and really crash the offensive boards more than
she does, I think that's an area of her game that really could be scary.  
Every other area of her game that she's been challenged by me or anybody
that's helping coach her, she's improved from free‑throw shooting her freshman
year to being more physical, to getting in the weight room, challenged her to
shoot 62percent from the field. She's done that through the course of the
year.  
I still think there's a lot of growth left to her game and not just one more
year in college. I think beyond college you'll continue to see her grow.  
  
Q. What about her becoming more sort of comfortable as a public speaker?
Maybe that's not your role, but is there anything you could do? Because
obviously you're comfortable doing that, too.  
COACH MULKEY: She's comfortable doing it, but what the problem is is every one
of you want her. She's worn out. They want her to be here at 3:00, 3:30, there
at 4:00, 4:30. She understands she's the face of women's basketball. And she
understands that's required of her. But at some point she has to step back and
go: That's not why I'm here; I'm here to win a national championship. That
stuff can happen afterwards.  
She is very comfortable publicly speaking. She doesn't elaborate. She doesn't
try to say too much to make you think she's a summa cum laude. She answers the
question and moves on to the next question. She's very comfortable in who she
is and in her own skin at being a tall kid. She runs around campus on her long
board and her body painted at football games, doing back flips on the sideline
before football games.  
She can do all that. Brittney, she stays until the last kid gets an autograph
at camp.  
I think what happens to us, and I have to protect her a little bit, you want
her everywhere and you want her to please everybody, because she's a
people‑pleaser, but at some point she's got to reluctantly say no. Because she
can't do it all. And she's tired. But it's part of it.  
She's comfortable. She's fine interviewing.  
  
Q. Either you or Coach McGraw are going to win her second national
championship as a coach, and that is ‑‑ especially in this era, the last 10,
15 years of UConn winning so many. Your program and Notre Dame's program,
they've become more consistent competitors, at the very top level. Can you
talk about that and maybe the different ways you guys have done that?   
COACH MULKEY: Well, I can't speak for Muffet. I can speak just for my program.
This is my 12th year at Baylor. We were bottom of the Big 12 when I was hired.  
We've gradually just grown the program. And the hardest part is not growing
the program but the hardest part is maintaining it.  
We'll continue to try to recruit good players that will keep Baylor up there
in the spotlight. I guess if you want to call us an elite program I
reluctantly for years have fought that. We just want to win a national
championship because it means so much to these players and to our fans and our
school and our community.  
And Tennessee and Connecticut have pretty much dominated like Louisiana Tech
did in the early'80s. I've been a part of those dominant teams and programs,
and if Baylor can maintain it and keep it rolling, we'll be just as proud as
any other school in the country.  
  
Q. Last night at halftime your game Pat Summitt made an appearance on the
court and everybody went crazy. Have you had her on your mind the whole year,
and what did that appearance last night mean to everybody here and the game?  
COACH MULKEY: Well, I heard about it after the game. And she's our John
Wooden. She's the John Wooden of basketball.  
I've said it many times, I don't care who wins more championships than her,
there will never be another Pat Summitt.  
Now, on a personal note, I have spoken to her. She called me when I was
diagnosed with Bell's palsy. The same ovation she received last night she
received it when she came to our gym and walked on the Ferrell Center floor
and everybody gave her a standing ovation prior to our game.  
So people get it. They understand Pat Summitt has done so much for our game,
and she did it graciously.  
I'll never forgot in the early'80s we played them all the time at Louisiana
Tech, and she told Leon Barmore after a game, she said: I'm going to keep
playing you until I beat ya.  
And, boy, did she keep playing us. And then she developed, and look at the
product she's put together at Tennessee. And now everybody wants to emulate
her program.  
  
Q. You touched on this a little bit earlier, the two programs here have kind
of shared a mantra this season of unfinished business because of last year's
disappointment. Could you talk about that? It's one thing to have that, but
then to actually be able to work and get to this stage to try and finish that
business?  
COACH MULKEY: I think it's a testament to the players. Coaches can come up
with mottos and we can come up with motivational tactics, but it boils down to
those players, those players have to have a hunger about them and a sense
about that feeling I had last year. I don't want to have it again. And put
yourself in a position to have a shot at it. And I think both programs and
both teams have done that. And you're absolutely right. They have more seniors
than we do.  
They did make it to the national championship game last year. Our team has not
done that. Not even the freshman team with Griner her freshman year. We didn't
make it to the championship. So I guess you'd say they have a little bit more
experience getting to the championship game and playing in it than we do.  
But, on the other hand, we played them this year. So there's a lot of things
that I'm sure Muffet will use and we'll use in our film sessions to motivate
our players, but it's going to come down to those kids on the floor.  
  
Q. If you wouldn't mind, could you talk about what it's like to see the
recruiting process as a parent now regarding your son's baseball recruiting,
and could you have an anecdote you could share about him going to one of your
rivals, LSU or somebody?  
COACH MULKEY: It was very interesting to me as a parent. Kramer is a junior,
and he wanted to get his decision out of the way, which I encourage all
parents to do. But we took trips, unofficial visits at the end of the season
last year, and he chose the four, five schools he wanted to visit, and he
chose LSU.  
Now, I don't look at LSU as a rival. That's our home. If you remember, that's
where he was born. That's where my mother still lives. Our family is
Louisiana. And I've always told people many times, I don't care where my
career takes me; I'm still just a country girl from Louisiana.  
And so when he went to visit there, eight hours from Waco‑‑ and we have an
outstanding baseball program at Baylor. What mother wouldn't want their kid to
stay at Baylor just as Mackenzie has stayed there and allowed me to be a part
of her life in playing in our program?  
But I've also taught my kids that you go where you're comfortable and where
you think you can win a championship. And he told me: Mom, to me LSU baseball
is the equivalent of the New York Yankees. I said: Why do you say that,
Kramer? He said: They expect to be in the World Series. They've been in the
World Series more than any program. They've won those national championships.
I want that pressure. And he goes: I want to do what you and Mackenzie are
doing. And I said: What are we doing, buddy? He said: You're playing at the
highest level. And he said: I want to play at the highest level.  
I hugged his neck and told him I'd be there as much as I can, and I will be.
We talked about the benefits and the stresses of being my child and knowing
people will be disappointed that he didn't stay and play at Baylor, and I
thought that Steve Smith, our baseball coach at Baylor, as well as myself
handled that as graciously with Kramer as I thought we could.  
I thought Steve was a gentleman. I thought he was a fine, fine coach in
understanding Kramer wants to get away from his mom and his sister and, as
Kramer said, go develop his own legacy. And I laughed, and I said: Boy, you
don't know what a legacy is. But that's kind of his approach. And he wants to
go and do his thing at the highest level.  
But there's not a rivalry there. That's our home. It will be a good fit for
Kramer, and he's excited. And what's really interesting about Kramer is every
time somebody calls Mom about leaving Baylor for a new job, Kramer is the
first one in my bed at night going: Momma, you can't leave Baylor. These
people love you and these people are good to you. They're good to our family.
Don't you ever leave Baylor.  
So that tells you about his sense of logic and doing what he thinks is
necessary for his career and his mom as well. And he loves Baylor. He loves
it. His sister is playing for a national championship. But he realized that he
needed to do what he felt was right.  
  
Q. You've been in the women's game for so long. I know you've seen it grow
and you talked about that growth a little earlier. Along with that growth has
come a lot of new fans, and I think fans are a lot different than they used to
be in terms of the way they treat players and even attack them, and I know
Brittney got a lot of it in high school and a lot of it earlier. How has that
changed and how has she dealt with the ugliness that she still gets?  
COACH MULKEY: I appreciate you asking that. Social media is the worst thing
that's happened to you guys as well, because everybody thinks you're part of
social media, and that takes the respect away from your job and what you do as
journalists.  
And I don't‑‑ I made a commitment about my fourth year at Baylor. I'll never
read a message board. I don't want to see any of that garbage. I don't want to
hear about it, because it's just not right. It's not healthy.  
And this is someone's child. This is a human being, people. She didn't wake up
and say: God, make me look like this; make me be 6'8"; make me have the
ability to dunk. This child is as precious as they come when it comes to being
a good person, a sweet kid, a coachable‑‑ one of the greatest players I've
ever coached, probably the greatest, and the easiest to coach. I love going to
work and seeing Brittney Griner's face. She just makes me happy.  
But yet the stuff she's had to read about, the stuff she's had to hear, the
stuff people say about her, the stuff people write about her, it's gotta stop.
That stuff's gotta stop.  
And 20 years ago, to go back to your question, you didn't have the access to
all that mess that's out there now. Sure, people probably said it, but it went
as far as the next conversation or the next beauty gossip thing. And it's
constant, and for her to handle it as well as she does, I just love the kid. I
love the kid.  
I sit and I think: Why? Why do people do that this day and time? My son, he
gets two perspectives here. He's got the male ego, so I live in a household
with a female and male, and I get the male ego from that end that kid says it
best. He said: Mom, they do it to Brittney because they're jealous. They do it
in a harmful way because they really want to be what she is.  
And he's just her biggest fan. And that's coming from an egotistical boy who
is probably going to play in the Major Leagues some day. He gets it.  
And I just‑‑ I can't tell you‑‑ I'm going to say this because I appreciate you
asking the question. There are players you coach that bring drama and are high
maintenance to your program. When they graduate, you go: God, thank God
they're gone. They brought so much attention for whatever, negative good.  
This kid has had so much thrown at her that I wonder sometimes if she goes: Is
it really worth it to keep putting up with all this? But she never does. She
never does. Because what she has, she has a home that is lovable.  
And I want you to write this. We had this conversation today. She said: Coach,
they keep pointing to my daddy in the stands during the game. I want everybody
to know that my mom's back at home and they need to talk about my mother who
couldn't be here. I said: I'll make that point clear.  
You get her mom's name and you write about her mother. Because, see, that's
the sensitivity of this child. While she loves her dad and he's done much for
her, her mom's done just as much, and she needs to be talked about.  
Now, how many kids in this big stage would think about their mother at that
moment? That's what's changed, is the social media junk. It's ridiculous. I
tell my kid don't read about that stuff. Half the stuff you read about is
about your mom and it's not that good. Of course, they have a sense of humor
and they're tough and they laugh about it.  
But it's not right about what people say about her. And the nerve, they say it
to her face, to her face.  
And that's the part that's just disgusting to me.  
  
Q. You joked around on Saturday with Brittney about how she's emphatically
staying with Baylor next year and you made her say it loud and clear so
everyone heard it and such. On the men's side tonight, probably five of the
players are going to go pro after the freshman or sophomore year. But on the
women's side, I don't know how long the conversation was with you and her to
say that she's staying for this year, but it seems that in the women's game
it's good for the game having players stay, you get to know them, it's another
story versus being a one ‑and‑done or two‑and‑done. If you could talk about
that and how the whole ‑‑ it's good for the women's game to have these players
stick around and obviously for you to have Brittney be here for another
season?  
COACH MULKEY: Brittney Griner wants to get her college degree. We all know,
once you leave college it's so hard to go back. It's so hard to go back
because you start making money. Your priorities change. If you stay the course
and get that degree‑‑ I've never known anybody that got a college degree and
said I regret it. But I've known lots of athletes who say, gosh, I wish I
would have stayed because now I don't know if I'll go back and get it.  
Brittney and I have not had an in‑depth conversation about her staying. You've
all asked her, and she's answered it. And so I take what she told me when she
signed to come to Baylor, she said coach: I'm there until I get my degree.
It's not something we have to sit down like the men's side does and go, okay,
you're going to go in the first round and make X amount of dollars. We don't
have to go there with that.  
But for the most part women just don't do that. They don't leave early. I can
think of maybe one recently that has done that. And sometimes you don't know
the reasons why they do it. Brittney doesn't have to do it for financial
reasons.  
Her family, her dad, they're well off. She doesn't have to‑‑ she's not running
to leave anything that's bad in her life. She's enjoying her college life. And
that's what's so good about Robert Griffin. That's what's so good about
Brittney Griner. That's what's so good about athletes that actually enjoy the
college experience, because it's a rarity. It's a rarity in today's time.  
  
Q. Opposite of what Jerome asked you, Brittney Griner, you talked about how
she's changed the game, how she's changed the face of the game. You also
talked about how college basketball, women's basketball has changed over time.
How do you think Brittney Griner makes the game even more appealing to fans
who aren't die ‑hard women's basketball fans, just your outside fan who is
like I want to see the dunk, I want to see this or that?  
COACH MULKEY: That's it. That's what it is. The average fan‑‑ and I'll even go
so far as to say the male fans, all they want to see is the dunk. And they
can't believe a girl can do what she can do. So they may turn the TV on and
watch the highlights and go "wow," where before they never had any interest in
the game because it was played below the rim.  
Brittney has been able to pull in those stragglers that don't want to give the
women credit that it's a pretty good game below the rim. And when they see her
dunk, then she gets those fans that normally wouldn't watch the game. We're
attracting those types of fans. And it's the dunk.  
The shot block‑‑ the shot blocking would be another one. They'll watch just an
unbelievable throw‑it‑in‑the‑stands blocking of the shot, and that will grab
your attention if you don't watch the women's game.  
Our game is just‑‑ it's an interesting game because, if you go to most
universities, you have the families that bring their children. You have the
older people that are fans. Where the women's game lacks the support that the
men get is the students. That's the same way at Connecticut. The same way at
Tennessee, Notre Dame, and Baylor.  
Betcha if you took a poll, the students are the ones that fill the stands up
in the men's games in college, and that's where we're still not pulling them
in on the women's side.  
  
Q. Do you think it's good for the game or do you think it gives a false
perception of what the game is?  
COACH MULKEY: No, dunking is good for the game. It's a game of entertainment
somewhat. The dunk is good for the game. The moves are good for the game, all
that's entertainment.  
I still say the women's game and the men's game is somewhat different other
than playing below the rim, but we have made it different somewhat. The 360
move is not a walk on the men's side; you make the 360 move, the same move,
and they come over and play under our rules, it's a traveling violation.  
I struggle with that. I don't think you should have the difference in that.
But the game is the same. My son asked me. He goes: Mom, would you ever coach
a men's team? I said: I could. Wouldn't bother me.  
So that tells you the game is the same. The difference is the guys can play
above the rim.  
  
Q. Obviously you're one of the last schools that still uses "Lady" in the
nickname. Pat does it. Vivian Stringer, when she went to Rutgers, immediately
got rid of Lady Knights, whatever. Big Ten, none except I guess Penn State.
And pretty much there's 15 or 20. You're also such a proponent of Title IX and
an advocate, and I applaud you and thank you for what you've done for girls
and women as a role model. To some, to me, and I know the Women's Sports
Foundation has said this, too, the term "Lady," as if it's‑‑ from another era,
as if it's not the whole. You know, you don't see the Gentlemen Bears, of
course. And I'm curious how and why you stick with Lady when it is seen as a‑‑
it can be‑‑ as Nancy Hogshead of the Women's Sports Foundation said last week,
it's demeaning. If you go to Baylor, you're a Bear, end of conversation. Your
response? Thanks.   
COACH MULKEY: And I appreciate that viewpoint as well. And I have read your
articles and I wish you'd give Baylor a big pub because I love reading your
articles.  
I think without knowing‑‑ let me answer this. We're from the South. We still
say yes, ma'am and no, ma'am. And I have to honestly tell you I've been told
by people don't do that to me; that offends me.  
I played with kids from the West Coast when I was a player and kids from the
East Coast. And I would say yes, ma'am. And they would go: Stop that. That's‑‑
where we come from, it's respect.  
And Lady is not offensive to anybody who lives in our area of the country. I'm
not going to speak for Pat, but I think it's a tradition of respect, believe
it or not, than it is disrespect viewed from people on the outside.  
We don't make an issue of things that are really not disrespectful in our
eyes. We have shirts that say Bears. In fact, I may have one on somewhere.
It's more of a thing that things started a long time ago, like yes, ma'am and
no, ma'am.  
And I still have a hard time with people who don't say yes, ma'am and no,
ma'am, but I understand in some parts of the country that's viewed as
demeaning. And I don't view it that way.  
I think too much is made of it. But just look at the tradition of the program
and the coaches that run those programs. There's nobody that fights for Title
IX more than Pat Summitt and more than me. And I can tell you this: I'm a
product of Title IX more than I am a fighter of Title IX. I reaped the
benefits from those who came before me.  
But in no way, shape, or form do I not understand the viewpoint from those
that you mentioned. But I want them to also understand our viewpoint. And I
don't think there's a right and a wrong. I just think it's kind of tradition,
maybe, in where we live.  
  
Q. You just mentioned your son asking could you coach the men; it would be
no big deal to you. Could the men handle you (laughter)?  
COACH MULKEY: Well, I think that Coach Grant Teaff, who's the president of the
Football Coaches Association, former Baylor coach, he probably paid me one of
the highest compliments. And, again, I won't ever forget it. He said: You
could coach our sport.  
I take it as a compliment in that, one, he respected my knowledge of sports,
he respected that I get the most out of athletes, and I think guys would
respect you if you know what the hell you're talking about.  
  
Q. (Question of microphone).  
COACH MULKEY: Really, I'm not tough. That's what's so funny. You see me on the
sideline, and that's what I do. When you guys go to work at your computer, you
don't have your kids running in your ears or you're not going to write a good
story.  
When I go on that floor, my focus is on that basketball team and my assistants
giving me feedback and me getting on them. And when we leave that floor, I'm
not like that. I'm not like that. You couldn't get players to come play for
you if you didn't have an all‑around personality to where you knew when to
laugh, cry, hug, to be serious.  
The advantage I do have, seriously, is that I'm a mother. And I do think
that's an advantage. Now, does that mean you can't be a good coach if you
don't have children? No. But I get a little bit of advantage because I have to
deal with my own children and their problems and what motivates them, and they
give me some insight and some feedback because they're the same age as the
athletes I get to coach. But, yeah, I could coach them.  
In fact, I could make some of them a little bit tougher than they are.  
  
Q. Just the thought on what you said earlier, about people coming to pursue
you for other coaching jobs. That's been the last few years. You have one of
the most desirable jobs in the country at Baylor. I think it would take a lot
of ‑‑ a lot of things for you to even consider leaving there.   
COACH MULKEY: Baylor takes good care of me. It's flattering when people come.
The thing that you'll always know about me, I don't take my private issues
into the public unless it's something I can't hide. Couldn't hide the Bell's
palsy. Might as well tell it up front.  
When schools come after me, I'm not a coach that uses you guys to get a pay
raise. If a school goes after me, I go straight to the administration, we
talk, we make sure I feel comfortable, they feel comfortable. Take care of me
and I'll take care of you.  
But, yes, I have a great job. I have a great job.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_DENVER, COLORADO_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us now from Notre Dame, head coach Muffet McGraw,
student‑athletes Skylar Diggins, Devereaux Peters, Natalie Novosel and
Brittany Mallory and Kayla McBride.  
Questions for anyone on the dais.  
  
Q. Coach, what sticks out in your memory most about the game with Baylor
early in the season, and how has your team changed, if at all, since then?  
COACH McGRAW: You know, I just watched that game. So I think we've gotten a
lot better. I think we're a lot smarter. I think our shot selection is much
improved, and I think defensively we're a lot better.  
  
Q. Natalie, could you just revisit last night just for one second in terms
of the intensity of that game and how do you reassemble your thoughts so
quickly for the next battle? Last year, I assume, was quite similar going into
the Texas A &M game. But how difficult is that?   
NATALIE NOVOSEL: You know, yesterday being on the biggest stage, it's like a
mix of emotions going from high to low and everything. So coming down from
last night's win, it's an amazing win, but we're still not done.  
We're right here where we were last year; we didn't get it done. So there's
definitely a new attitude going into today's practice and just knowing what we
have to do to get things done for tomorrow.  
  
Q. Skylar, in the first game with Baylor, Odyssey Sims had 25points. I think
12 of them were from the free ‑throw line. Could you talk about what you guys
have to do differently tomorrow night in regards to Odyssey?  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: I think she's a key to the game. We'll throw different things
at Brittney and stuff like that. But Odyssey is what makes them go. She's a
great point guard. She does a great job getting to the line. She's 40percent
from the 3‑point line, so you have to honor that, and she's also good at
getting to the basket.  
So she's a terrific defender. She gets out. She gets steals. She's going to be
aggressive. I think we need to make sure we pay attention to her. We have to
shade her side. We definitely have to be up and try to pressure her, too, and
not give her as easy looks to pass and things like that, and just approach
her.  
  
Q. You're going to get to all the way of the last game of your last season.
I'm wondering, A, how are you feeling and, B, can you talk about what your
defense is going to be charged with tomorrow?  
BRITTANY MALLORY: It's a great feeling. We, us seniors and the whole team,
really, just wanted to get back here. We had this chance last year, and we
didn't come up‑‑ we came up short. And we're just excited to be here and we're
looking forward to the chance to get that back.  
And tomorrow defensively we just really have to play team defense, get out on
the shooters, find Griner, shade to her. Just the things we have been doing
all year long that's been helping us get to this point.  
  
Q. Devereaux and Skylar and Coach, can you talk about Natalie's clutch play
and kind of her mental toughness, not just last night, but I guess she had
that buzzer beater against Duke earlier in the year and what you've come to
expect from her late in the game like that?  
DEVEREAUX PETERS: I felt it was really huge for us. Me and Sky were joking
about it last night, how easy it looked for her; she was just so calm and
collected shooting that shot like it was the first play of the game or
something like that.  
It's just great that we could expect that from our seniors. Natalie's done a
great job stepping up when we needed her to. You knew she was going to go to
the basket and box out, and she really applied herself at that point in the
game and came up big for us.  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: Natalie has been clutch all year for us. She's a player that
we can go to if we need a bucket. That's who we go to, Natalie.  
She's great at finding her shot, she's great at coming off of screens, she can
create her own shot, she can shoot the 3 and she can attack the basket and she
can pull up.  
So Natalie is like‑‑ like Dev was saying, shot the most nonchalantly I've
ever‑‑ last night. But she's been clutch all year for us. So that's kind of
what we expect out of Nat. It was no surprise there.  
COACH McGRAW: I agree with that. Since the Duke game‑‑ that was a huge win for
us and I think really propelled us forward. We didn't lose again for a while
after that game. I think it gave us a great confidence and for her to make
that last shot gave her even more confidence.  
She's somebody who would like the ball in her hands. At different times in the
game when we feel like we really needed to score, and she is ‑‑ it's in her
veins. She's not bothered at all by the pressure or the moment.  
  
Q. Brittany and Skylar, you just talked up here and you've talked throughout
the year about getting back to this game. So that's obviously a strong
motivation, but that also can be very stressful. I mean, at what point did it
become fun again and how did it become fun again?  
BRITTANY MALLORY: I think after that first practice that we had after the
championship game last year, that was a tough practice. We were going real
hard. And after that it became our motivation. We weren't stressed about it
and it pushed us to work hard and kind of give our all every time we stepped
on the court and just to really take every game game by game and not to look
forward.  
We knew we couldn't win last year's game by winning a game this year, and we
knew if we played hard and played together and ran our stuff we would get back
here.  
  
Q. Brittany, this group of seniors has been together for so long, been
through so much, redshirt years, everything, if things don't work out the way
you hope tomorrow, is that going to color your experience at Notre Dame? Is it
going to leave you feeling somewhat empty? Are you going to be able to carry
away all the good things?  
BRITTANY MALLORY: I don't think any one of us are going to feel that we were a
failure here. We have‑‑ I personally have had a great five years. I wouldn't
trade any of it for the world. A great five years. And I wouldn't trade any of
it.  
I've been through a lot, my ups and downs. My teammates, these are my best
friends. They're like my sisters. And whatever the outcome tomorrow, I think,
looking back on my career, it's been everything I could ask for.  
  
Q. How do you game plan for a 6'8 " athletic long post player?  
COACH McGRAW: Well, it's gotta be different than the last game because we
didn't do so well that time. She's an extraordinary player. I think she
changes the game. She changes a lot of things.  
For us, we're kind of perimeter oriented, we like our guards to score a lot. I
don't think it changes a lot for us. We don't jam the ball inside as much as
some other teams do.  
So I think we'll be able to run the stuff we have and really maybe have to
make that extra pass, which we've been pretty good at all year long.  
So I think that's going to be the theme for us, is just getting her engaged
and then trying to make a few extra passes.  
  
Q. Brittany, can you talk about the way the perimeter defense has improved
since that Baylor game? And also offensively are you guys going to have to
shoot a lot of long 3s in order to beat Baylor?  
BRITTANY MALLORY: Our defense on the perimeter has definitely improved since
that game. We've been really aware of 3‑point shooters, how to approach, who
to run out, who not to, who's drivers. And I think we matured a lot this year.
I don't think we need to shoot a lot of 3s.  
Like Coach said, we just have to engage. If we just play our‑‑ engage Griner.
If we just play our game and drive, and hopefully get her up on her feet and
dish over, we've been well ‑‑ we've been working well together and doing a
pretty good job of getting easy baskets and just making that extra pass.  
  
Q. Coach, how does Skylar match up with Sims both offensively and
defensively?  
COACH McGRAW: I think Skylar's a great player. I think she's the best guard in
the country. I think it's an interesting matchup both being left‑handed. I
think Skylar is a great defender, great passer. She can score. She does
everything well. And I think Sims is a great player also. I think she's a huge
key to their team. She has really, really done a lot of great things this
year.  
It's not just because she can throw the ball to Griner; I think she can do a
lot on her own as well.  
  
Q. Skylar, Destiny Williams from Benton Harbor, what do you remember about
her from the high school days way back when and how have you seen her develop
now over the years?  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: She was great in high school. Great offensive rebounder,
that's what carried over to college. She's still a great offensive rebounder.
Destiny led her high school and she scored a lot of points. She can score in
bunches. They gave her the ball a lot. And she scored. And I think that she
still scores.  
And what translated from high school to college is her aggressiveness to
attack the boards offensively. She could block shots to get in there and get
rebounds. And she's kind of‑‑ she's not the tallest, but she can get in there
and she can still rebound it and score well.  
And I think she does a great job working off Griner when the double team
comes. She finds her open spots and she finishes around the rim.  
  
Q. (Question off microphone)?  
COACH McGRAW: She had already graduated, had some opportunities to pursue. And
really, for us, I thought she was essential to this team because of all the
intangible things she gives as well as being a best lock‑down defender and
3‑point specialist. I think just her attitude and personality really affects
the whole team. I think she's been a great leader for us.  
So I do. I think getting her to come back for this year‑‑ I don't know that
we'd be here without her.  
  
Q. Devereaux, you guys have talked about the motivation of last year and the
way that ended. Is there motivation also in playing Baylor again and having
another shot at them after that game earlier this year?  
DEVEREAUX PETERS: Yeah, it's always nice to play a team that you lost to early
on, especially at this point in the season, whenever your team is at their
peak and playing their best game. So it would be nice to get that game back.
And we were a completely different team back then. It's just going to show how
much we've grown since then.  
  
Q. Devereaux and Natalie, if you could answer this. Griner is a pretty
incredible shot blocker, but sometimes what happens in games she blocks so
many shots early people shy away. You guys aren't known for shying away from
the basket. But how do you not let that shot ‑blocking intimidation kind of
get into your head after she might have swatted a few?  
DEVEREAUX PETERS: I think we have to use our judgment. Going in there, you
know, we can't shy away at the beginning of the game. But we're going to
attack. We're fighters. We're going to attack the basket. I think being
relentless.  
She's a game changer on the defensive end, so we just have to be smarter and
engaging her and dishing off and just to not go in there and go right up into
her. It's easy block for her, just easy turnover. We've just got to be a
little smarter on the offensive‑‑  
DEVEREAUX PETERS: Yeah, I think‑‑ excuse me. I'm sorry. I think this is a team
that's never been fearful of any team in that sense. And, I mean, she's 6'8"
with a 7'4" wing span. She's going to block shots. I don't think anybody takes
that person on. She's huge. If she didn't block a shot, there would probably
be something wrong. You just gotta keep going at her.  
I think we're pretty smart with our shot selection, where we should be able to
get them off as well.  
  
Q. Kayla, are you glad that you guys have the experience of playing against
Baylor this season and how or why not would that be helpful?  
KAYLA McBRIDE: I think it's good that we played them. But, like they said,
we're a completely different team. That's about the fourth game of the season.
I think we've grown a lot defensively and offensively since then.  
  
Q. Muffet, last game was played in high 80s, 90s. I wonder if you expect
this came we'll see that much scoring, or because it's the title game maybe
points go down a little bit?  
COACH McGRAW: I think you're going to see a lot of scoring. When we met
earlier this year, it was a pretty high‑scoring game also. I think both teams
are pretty comfortable right now with being in the spotlight. So I expect it's
going to be a pretty high‑scoring game.  
  
Q. Muffet, I don't know if coaches think in these terms, but your team is
going to change obviously next year when the seniors go, and you haven't won a
championship since 2001. Do you see this as a window that you personally need
to take advantage of before the team moves on next season?  
COACH McGRAW: I would love for them to go out national champions. It's really
special. There's such a huge difference between losing the last game and
winning it. But for this group, as Brittany said, this has been a special
group for as long as they've been here.  
And I've treasured every moment of this year, and I'm going to be sad to see
them go, whether we win or lose.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. We'll continue with questions for Coach McGraw.  
  
Q. Coach, are you glad that your team has been on the court with Baylor this
season, and how can that be helpful?  
COACH McGRAW: Yeah, I think until you see her close up in a game, you really
can't even appreciate how big she is. I think for us having had that
experience and knowing what to expect, I think it does definitely make going
into the game a little less of a surprise factor. We know what she's going to
do, and we can look at that film and see the few things that did work. There
weren't that many. But we can try to look‑‑ we're running some different stuff
now, it will be interesting to see how that works.  
  
Q. Everyone up on the dais seems to think this is a very different team now.
When you looked at the tapes, how different is Baylor and in what ways?  
COACH McGRAW: I think Baylor's gotten a lot better. I think that their other
players have really improved. I think in the beginning of the season Griner
was having to get 35 or 40. And Sims would chip in with 15 or so. And the rest
of their players really weren't looked at. They were the ones everybody left
open. And now I think they've figured out ways to win and I think you saw that
last night when Griner only had three field goals, Sims I think one field
goal, and they still won the game with their other players. So I think they've
improved a lot, too.  
  
Q. All season long you guys used the unfinished business mantra. It's rare
that teams have a thought and actually get to live it out and get back to
where they want to be. Can you talk about the season and what it takes to
getting to that point and to this point, how one of you will not be able to
finish off the goals of the year?  
COACH McGRAW: It's been inspirational and motivational for us all year long to
look at that. It was written on the board by one of the players at some point
in the summer. Every time they come in the locker room they look at that. And
I think it has‑‑ they really embraced the pressure. We didn't talk about it a
lot. But I think they knew it. And I think they handled it so well to get back
to this point.  
It's really difficult. I think last year was a little bit of an upset to get
here, and now we feel like we were the higher seed. So we should have gotten
here.  
I think just the way they played all year long, focusing one game at a time,
was great. And if we come into this game somebody's going to win, somebody's
going to lose, we're going to do everything we can to win.  
  
Q. If I can just ask you a question about something off topic. Draft is
coming up. You've got the three seniors. Have you had any conversations with
the personnel people, especially about Natalie Novosel, and how do you see her
as equipped for a professional career?  
COACH McGRAW: Haven't had a lot of conversations with too many people except
the ones who came to Notre Dame to watch them play. We've seen the scouts at a
lot of the games on the road too.  
But I think they're both getting a lot of interest. And I think with Natalie,
I think she's a great scorer, and I think she can really, really play in the
WNBA. I think she's probably got a little work to do. They may want her to
handle the ball a little more, but overall I think she's going to be a great
WNBA player.  
  
Q. If I read my history correctly, and I might not, but in 1982, the same
calendar, Mulkey wins the NCAA title as a player and you take the job at
Lehigh. What do you remember as a player and how would that translate into
today's game 30years later?  
COACH McGRAW: I think she's exactly the same now as she was then. I admired
her as a player. Louisiana Tech was the team to the beat at the time. She was
the point guard. Loved the way she played. She was the floor general and bossy
and she's probably doing the same thing now. I think really nothing has
changed much. She's doing a phenomenal job there.  
  
Q. (Question off microphone)?  
COACH McGRAW: I don't know. A lot of people from the past always look at that
and say what would our team be like now. And the game has changed, but for
her, yeah, I think she could. I think she's got all those intangibles that
make a great player.  
  
Q. (Question off microphone)?  
COACH McGRAW: Yeah, well, we only played six people. So we try to rest all the
guards and give them a little break with Natalie coming in, and Dev's capable
of guarding on the perimeter. So we have enough of team to play the full
guards. We could still guard them. I like that lineup with the two bigs. I
think we can do a lot more things and generally we rebound a little bit better
with them.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about the mindset of having to play an undefeated
team in the national championship game? You faced UConn before when they went
through undefeated seasons. Can you use that as a bit to your advantage? Or
just the fact that they have that momentum that they haven't lost all season,
how tough is that to go against?  
COACH McGRAW: I think when you're undefeated you have a lot of confidence that
you're playing with, but at the same time it's just a little bit of pressure
of knowing that you've never lost. And when it gets down to the end of the
game, you hope they feel that pressure.  
I think they have had a great season. They have one thing they want to do,
same goal we have. And we're back to being the underdog. Finally. It's taken
us a long time to get our green jerseys on. And we can now even be more loose
and the pressure is all on them.  
  
Q. Last night Pat Summitt made an appearance at halftime of the Baylor game.
And it's been quite a year regarding that. Looking back on your career, have
you changed things as a coach because of her impact on the game, anything this
year that you thought about when you were coaching, anything like that?  
COACH McGRAW: I think she's impacted the game. I think she's impacted every
coach that coaches. I think she's a role model that whether you're just
starting out or been in it for a while look up to and would love to emulate.  
I think she's done so many things with class and integrity. She's so well
respected by everybody in the profession that I think you just look and you
go, boy, I would love to be like her. I read some things and they said how she
treated people. No matter who came up to her she would just give them the time
to speak with them. And things like that are so important. And that'swhen I
read things like that and I think to myself: Hmm, I wonder if people would say
that about me. Maybe I need to work on that a little bit more.  
  
Q. I know you talked a little bit about the other day, could you reiterate
on the women's team no one goes early. No one leaves. Brittany and Skylar both
said they're staying. Potentially you could have had four players go to the
WNBA. The men's side could have gone as well. Just talk about the women's
game, how everyone sticks around and the fans actually learn about players
instead of one and done?  
COACH McGRAW: I think it's great they stay. It helps your team development. I
don't know how men do it because you're constantly playing freshmen because
your upperclassmen are leaving.  
So I think in the women's game that's probably why we have all the No. 1 seeds
advancing and maybe why we have a little less parity, because the teams who
get the good players keep them for four years.  
I think it's great that they don't leave early. And the education. You have to
look at the graduation rates between men's and women's basketball. I think
probably women's are higher. I think that's a really important stat, too. But,
like I said, if somebody's giving them a million dollars, somebody would
probably have a lawsuit and try to change that.  
  
Q. In 2001 you lost to Connecticut in the Big East finals, then you beat
them in the national semifinals on route to the title. Is that something
you've dropped out there with the players? Are they aware of that?  
COACH McGRAW: We talk about that a lot with Niele on the bench and in
practice. She gets to talk about her championship quite a bit. So I think we
did draw a lot of parallels with this. We actually went through Denver to get
to St. Louis for the finals.  
So I think there's a lot of things that we look at and say, boy, there's a lot
of similarities. I'm not that superstitious, but my team is, so I think it's a
good thing.  
  
Q. You're going against another Southerner, like last year. I wonder if you
could just talk about personality ‑wise you and Kim. Over the years you guys
have crossed paths a lot. Just maybe a little bit of contrast in personality.
And then also just she sort of has this fiery temper on the sidelines, maybe
sometimes you're more subdued. Could you talk about the contrast a little
bit?  
COACH McGRAW: I think there's a contrast starting with the outfits and going
through the game. I think she really has a lot of emotion on the sideline, a
lot of fire on the sideline, and I think that's how she coaches because that's
the kind of person that she is. I think over the years I've gotten less‑‑ I've
gotten more patient with every single play that happens and try not to react
to that. But it works for us. That's just her personality. And it's an
interesting contrast.  
  
Q. Coach, you talked about it a little bit earlier, but with Baylor do you
have to kind of pick your poison? Because that's kind of what happened last
night.  
COACH McGRAW: Yeah, you know, you really do. I think you can't let Griner just
get 50. And you can't just let her go and try to guard her one on one. So you
have to do something. You have to hope they shoot poorly. That's what it comes
down.  
The team that makes the most shots is going to win the game. Sounds so
simplistic, but you get open looks, but they're not going to be around the
basket. They're going to get open looks, they're going to be around the
basket.  
I think if we can force other people to shoot the ball and hope they shoot it
poorly and we shoot it well, that's got to be the big key to the game. And you
have absolutely no control over how you shoot the ball, so it's a little
scary.  
  
Q. In this whole last 10, 15years of UConn ‑Tennessee, Notre Dame and Baylor
are two teams that are‑‑ one of you two is going to win two titles during
that. Can you just talk about those two programs being able to be as
consistently good at the top level with the two titans, the way they've
been?  
COACH McGRAW: Yeah, it's a refreshing change, I think, to see two different
teams in the finals. I think that both of us have built our programs in
different ways.  
I think we're just happy to be in that conversation now of being an elite
program that can get to the Final Four, and certainly we're there a lot
because of Skylar and the chemistry we have on our team. And Griner has
certainly done that for Baylor as well.  
So I think we've both kind of built around some pretty good players. We look a
little bit more at team chemistry and how we're going to fill the other roles
maybe than they do.  
  
Q. A lot of focus on Griner, obviously, but can you talk about what Destiny
Williams gives them at the other post?  
COACH McGRAW: I think she's been the X factor for them. In a lot of games
you'll see she's really doing great things to offset the defense on Griner,
and then a lot of games they're bringing Griner high and giving it to her on
the block.  
So I think she really is the unsung hero of their team. She's played well all
year, rebounded well, scores, can shoot the jumper, can score on the block.
Rebounds. And that's what makes them dangerous, when that other‑‑ that other
player.  
  
Q. Ruth and Griner are different types of personalities, but I remember
Ruth's freshman year she got frustrated a lot, was in foul trouble, kind of
adjusting to the physicality. Certainly by the time she was a senior, no
matter what you did to her, you couldn't get her rattled. Brittney as a junior
now has gotten that calmness. How do post players do that when they take as
much physical abuse as they do?  
A.I admire that, because I think when you're tall you don't get a lot of
calls. We watch high school kids play, you feel like you're watching the game
wondering when the ref is going to make the call. But most of the refs are
pretty short. And I think there's a little bit of a bias there, like, well,
you're 6'5", you ought to be able to make that shot with somebody hanging on
your arm.  
I think they do put up with a lot. If they have that kind of personality and
that poise that Ruth had, I think it does make it a lot easier for them to
handle it.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_DENVER, COLORADO_  
  

Baylor  59  
Stanford  47

  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us now, head coach Tara VanDerveer from Stanford and
student‑athletes Neka Ogwumike and Toni Kokenis.  
Coach, an opening statement.  
COACH VANDERVEER: I'd like to congratulate Baylor. They have an excellent
team. We worked very hard. We prepared really hard. But at the end of the day
they outplayed us, and they have some great players and really outstanding
coach in Kim Mulkey.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Neka, can you talk about how you're feeling right at this moment and was
it a matter of you guys not knocking down shots? Do you feel you'll walk away
and say we didn't hit enough shots?  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: Obviously no one feels good after a loss, especially if
it's in the Final Four. But I just kind of look back and reflect on what it
took for us to get here, and I would have rather gone down with my team than
up with any other team.  
But when it comes down to the game, if you look at it, yeah, we were 20 for
60, that's a lot. And I know I didn't make one 3, and I shot five of them.  
And I think in the first half‑‑ Tara made a really good point at halftime. She
said I was settling for my shot. Because during the week we worked on kicking
it out, kicking it out, kicking it out. But when I started attacking in the
second half, I was able to go one‑on‑one against.  
But ultimately I think also it was kind of difficult for us to really figure
out what we wanted to do on offense. I think we were too worried about her.  
But in reality attacking her wasn't as hard as we thought it would be. And
hitting shots is always what it comes down to. We were 2 for 17 from the 3.
Granted, five of those were mine.  
But I think it's a good thing for our youngsters to look back and reflect on
what it really takes to get over this hump.  
  
Q. Toni and Neka, did you guys feel that you came close to executing the
game plan that you wanted to do, but when you missed that many 3 ‑pointers
it's tough?  
TONI KOKENIS: I think we were really well prepared for this game. We had a
great game plan, and we were executing it. We just struggled a little bit
offensively and missed some shots that would have definitely helped us, like a
few 3s that we stepped out of bounds a few times.  
And I think also their offensive boards kind of hurt us, and we needed to box
out better and get more rebounds because they got too many second‑chance
points.  
  
Q. Did you feel that the strategy of bringing each possession down to the
end of the shot clock? I mean, although it worked, in terms of shortening the
game, it forced you into some difficult shots, more than you probably would
have wanted. Is that accurate?  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: Yeah, we weren't trying to run the clock down.  
  
Q. (Off microphone) the end of the shot clock repeatedly.  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: If we could score earlier, we would. But their defense
was‑‑ it's tough. Having in the paint, it completely changes everyone's game.
Not just the inside players' game. Attacking the basket is a little more
difficult, as you saw. Toni and Amber were trying to get in there, and you
kind of have to think about making an extra pass. Your first instinct is to
shoot.  
But, besides that, Odyssey's pressure, obviously she got some steals. Destiny
Williams got a steal. And it's not‑‑ it's not like we were trying to run the
clock down. It just kind of happened, and obviously those aren't the shots you
want, but I think we tried our best to really compose ourselves on offense,
even though it was really difficult.  
  
Q. Neka, you kind of talked about settling for your shot in the first half.
I don't know if it was the plan or if what you saw was open, but looked like
you were attacking more in the second half.  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: Definitely. I think I‑‑ when Tara mentioned, I realized
yeah, I am settling, because this whole week we talked about driving the
baseline, kicking across the baseline or kicking behind you. And so the
pick‑and‑roll, we didn't think, would work as well. Because 's in there. I
thought if I start hitting some outside shots, they will come out on me.  
But they were flying out on me regardless. My coaches helped me realize that.
In the second half I started attacking. When I realized it wasn't that hard to
score against her, I was like: Give me the ball, give me the ball.  
But also we needed to try and get offensive rebounds so we could kick it out
to our shooters.  
  
Q. Neka, can you expand on what you said about attacking her wasn't as hard
as you thought it would be? How much of playing is a psychological thing where
it's really scary to think about doing it and talk about what the reality of
it was like; that it wasn't as difficult?  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: I think it actually was kind of‑‑ I was definitely psyching
myself out. I think I was kind of too into myself in the first half, feeling I
needed to fire, fire, fire, but Tara's always told me if I'm shooting, who is
rebounding.  
When they told me at halftime just attack‑‑ because first play of the game I
think I got the ball and I attacked I missed the layup, but I was able to get
a shot off. And in the second half I just started attacking. I was like, okay,
this isn't that bad.  
And I think it is mostly psychological. Granted, Griner, she has over 200
blocked shots, more than our whole team combined, on her career. That's
amazing.  
But I think if you put your mind to it, and I think I did a really good job of
not being scared of going in there. And my teammates had my back. I think
Chiney did a good job of rebounding, even Amber, you saw Amber get a tip back,
that's awesome.  
It's the Final Four. Even if it wasn't the Final Four, when you go out there
you want to leave it all on the court. And I tried my best to play as hard as
I could in whatever situation I was.  
  
Q. Toni there was a sequence, Bonnie hit the 3 but she stepped out of bounds
and Chiney with the offensive foul and Neka fouled on the other end. It was an
11 ‑1 swing. Did that feel like a pretty tough sequence for you?  
TONI KOKENIS: Yeah, that hurt us because those were plays if it had gone the
other way it would have been at least a little more momentum or kept the game
closer, especially like a 3 or a fastbreak layup. Those are both momentum
plays and to be right there and obviously not be able to finish or have them
taken away was difficult, and we just weren't able to overcome the hump of
that stretch of plays later in the game.  
  
Q. Notre Dame doesn't have nearly the size that you have. Is there any way
that they can stay with Baylor on Tuesday?  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: I mean, they may not have the size, but I think Devereux is
one of the best post players I've played‑‑ I can only say "with" because I
played with her in U.S.A. And Kayla McBride, she's a brute. When we were
watching tape‑‑ was it on West Virginia? ‑‑ she was guarding Bussie and
Dunning, and I don't doubt it will be a good game on Tuesday.  
And just regarding the fact it's and then they don't really have as strong of
an outside, you have Skylar Diggins, you have Natalie Novosel, you have
Brittany Mallory, and obviously Natalie Anchonwa and everyone that comes off
the bench.  
I look forward to watching it. I'm going to watch it. I think it's going to be
a great matchup on Tuesday. I think it's going to be interesting to see‑‑ it's
a rematch as well. I think it will be interesting to see‑‑ Baylor's a great
team; Notre Dame's a great team‑‑ to see them match up.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. In the end, why do you think you guys didn't win this game?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Well, in just looking at the stats, as an example, we shot
one more field goal, made one more field goal than them. We sent them to
free‑throw line.  
If you look at everything else, I mean, our assists are the same, turnovers
the same. We had more blocks than they did.  
I think there were some momentum plays. The big momentum play was the foul on
Chiney driving in there.  
Honestly, you never know what's going to happen in games, but the game before
ours seemed to be extremely physical. And this game was just the opposite to
me.  
But I think the main thing was we sent them to the free‑throw line. And I
don't think we should have with the game plan we had. We're totally off of
either No.3 or 20. And 20 hit some big shots. She hit one 3. She's made ten
all year. She had a couple of shots for them that she stepped up nicely. I
think she gave them some momentum. But the free throws, that was a big thing.  
  
Q. Neka just said it wasn't part of the game plan to run the clock. But the
other day you said that you wanted to slow the tempo of the game.  
COACH VANDERVEER: No, I didn't ever say that. The question was put to me like
did you learn from what other people did, and I said yes.  
We wanted to run on them, but we really didn't get out and go as well as we
wanted to. They make things hard in terms of running your offense, so they
take you out of doing your normal thing. So to try to get into alignment, to
try to get to do things, it took us that long to get the floor organized and
to be able to run our offense.  
And I thought we got some‑‑ the first half we had some turnovers I didn't
like. We had some fouls I didn't like. But we really‑‑ we had some nice open
looks and didn't knock down shots.  
  
Q. You talked about No.3 and 20, Condrey and Madden, knocking down shots.
With Baylor do you almost have to pick your poison, try to stop inside and
maybe let them take some outside shots?  
COACH VANDERVEER: That was‑‑ if I were to do it again, I would probably do it
the same way. I think there was‑‑ like the first play of the game Madden just
drives in for a right‑hand layup. That was not part of the game plan.  
That was we're guarding her going to the rim. There were other possessions
where some of the turnovers that led to baskets. You have to keep them in
front.  
And I think our team‑‑ it took a lot of focus, and I think our team did a good
job, but we had to do a better job. I think Neka‑‑ just I was happy with our
defense. They shot, what, 30 something percent. But except for our fouling.  
And I just‑‑ honestly I just didn't see it. We're not that a physical a team.
We've never had anyone foul out all year. And I was just like‑‑ it's just
different.  
  
Q. I want to make sure I understand this correctly. You were not trying to
take the full 30seconds?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Correct.  
  
Q. But your team just couldn't find the shots; it seemed very deliberate, a
lot more deliberate than normal.  
COACH VANDERVEER: I think they force you that way. We tried to get out and go.
We tried to push the tempo a little bit. Honestly I think Amber got a little
tired. And we just‑‑ we weren't able to run our offense the same way. You just
can't make passes that you usually make. You can't attack in the same way
you're used to attacking.  
Although, I think finally I just said to Neka: You've got to get the ball and
take it at. She did and drew some fouls and scored. But we didn't really get
much‑‑ Neka didn't get much help. Usually it's been Neka and Chiney. We needed
more help for Neka.  
People needed to pick up offensively. Amber going 1 for 9; Jos, 1 for 6. We
had some good looks. We needed to knock them down. But we're not trying to
hold the ball on them.  
  
Q. It's easy to see you were double ‑teaming , but can you describe in some
detail exactly what the strategy was with her? Was it just as simple as
muscling her and fronting her sticking two people on her?  
A.It was always the person that was guarding either 3 or 20 was leaving them
and just sagging in front or doubling in on her. We knew we didn't want to
leave‑‑ other teams had left‑‑ most teams always put two people on her. And
other people had left Odyssey Sims and she would light them up. They'd leave
Hayden and she would light them up.  
We said we're going to leave those two and gamble off Madden. Besides her
first layup, basically she was like 3 for 10. So that was‑‑ I thought that was
a good gamble, 0 for 2 from 3. But Condrey came in and hit a couple of shots.
And Griner doubling her was a focus and staying on other people.  
We did not do a good enough job on Destiny Williams. I thought she got a
couple of O boards on us. But defensively to me it wasn't the problem except
for our fouling. And I just‑‑ I don't know. I mean, it was different.  
  
Q. Neka mentioned that she was getting psyched out over the Griner mystique.
Was that something you were concerned with at the beginning when you were game
planning for this game?  
COACH VANDERVEER: You know, I think that in some ways‑‑ I think that we had
really‑‑ we watched block and block and block and block, but she didn't‑‑ Neka
could get by her, Neka's quickness. And probably waited a little too long but
Neka probably needed to attack her more earlier.  
But I thought she did a good job in the second half of attacking, going at her
a little bit better. But we needed‑‑ I just felt like we needed other people
besides Neka. If 's going to guard Neka, then other people have to take
advantage of playing against either Williams or Pope, or come off a screen and
knock down a shot, either Amber or Toni or Jos open for a 3.  
I'm not faulting Neka at all. I mean, if anything, maybe we should have said:
You go at Griner and other people be ready to spot up and knock down some
shots.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_DENVER, COLORADO_  
  

Notre Dame  83  
Connecticut  75

  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us head coach Muffet McGraw, and student‑athletes
Skylar Diggins, Brittany Mallory, and Devereaux Peters.  
COACH McGRAW: I am just so proud of our team right now, because at the end of
regulation we had the game won with about 1:13 to go, and we simply gave it
back to them. Then we had to make some spectacular plays to claw our way out,
Brittany hitting the 3 and Natalie hitting the shot at the end of the
regulation. Sky had some game‑saving defensive plays and made the 3 down the
stretch. We really earned that one.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Skylar, can you talk about the play you made on Hartley on the breakaway
where you blocked the shot and then found you Brittany for the 3, just the
impact that had on the game?  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: We were set up to play, and Brit looked away as soon as I‑‑
and I let go. It was a two on one, and I had to dodge and fake. She passed it,
and I was standing right there.  
So just had to keep the ball in play, trying to tip it or just keep her from
scoring without fouling. And then with them being back there, we had an
advantage. I sprinted. Nobody found Brittany. Everybody ran the lane and she
had a lot of time to set up for that shot. And I told Brit at the end of
regulation: Brit, I'm going to keep throwing it to you, so keep spotting up.
She knocked it down.  
  
Q. Brittany, looked like a really eerie calm in the overtime. Go through
both the 3s and what you were feeling. And obviously seems like after you let
the release you knew they were good.  
BRITTANY MALLORY: Yeah, it was‑‑ I was thinking about it a little bit in
regulation, not hitting the 3, and it's been a while. But like Sky said, she
told me to keep shooting. My whole team was telling me keep shooting, they're
going to fall, they're going to fall.  
And Sky hit me for the pass and I lined up, I just had‑‑ took a deep breath
and let it go and was thinking to myself this one's going in. And finally they
both went in and I was so happy. I couldn't believe it. I was so happy.  
DEVEREAUX PETERS: She almost cried.  
BRITTANY MALLORY: I was so excited.  
  
Q. Brittany, can you talk about the defense on Hartley in the second half,
just what you guys changed after she had that first half?  
BRITTANY MALLORY: We tried to focus in on not letting her get touches‑‑ we
didn't really talk about it as much. Our defense just came alive and we were
talking about team defense. It's been one of our like mottos all year, just
play together, play hard, and we just tried to make her uncomfortable a little
bit. We were always there on the catch.  
I think we did that with almost all their players tonight.  
  
Q. Skylar, could you talk about the defense that they played against you in
the first half and why it was so successful and the adjustments you made in
the second half to get yourself going?  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: They were the aggressors in the first half. They were up,
aggressive. We were passive. We were back on our heels. And we were settling
for jump shots. Credit their defense. They were up on us tight.  
In the second half‑‑ we came in at halftime. We made adjustments in the second
half. We came out, made sure we were the aggressors and we understood they
were in some foul trouble. Attacked the basket. Got them in more foul trouble.
And just continued to play our game and at our pace.  
DEVEREAUX PETERS: At my pace, I tried to move as the team goes‑‑ just trying
to push, I think. I wasn't doing a good job of really pushing and getting out.
I was kind of passive.  
Like I said, Coach just told me keep attacking. She told us to keep attacking.
I got good teammates around me that move off me and we play off each other.  
At the end I think our defense kind of led to our offense. We got a couple
steals, got out in transition, got some points. And it was good for us to get
our momentum going.  
  
Q. Skylar, with about 22seconds to go and you guys were up eight, looked
like you had sealed the win. You ran over to your coach, and looked like you
said something to her and you both kind of smiled. Could you share what that
was?  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: It's a secret. I just said: We got you, Coach. I hugged her.
It means a lot. We play this game for her. And this team, we want to get it.
We're hungry.  
We told her at the beginning of the game: We didn't have you in the last game
in the Big East Tournament; we're going to have you this time.  
I thought the team bought in and did a good job backing Coach up.  
  
Q. Devereux, how tough was it inside, especially in that first half where it
seemed like there weren't many whistles and it seemed like a pretty physical
game?  
DEVEREAUX PETERS: I think in the first half they were getting a lot of easy
layups. We were staying too long on screens and giving them wide open cuts to
the basket.  
And so in the second half we really tried to get over the screens and the
guards so they could guard the guards and we can get back in the post and they
weren't getting easy shots.  
  
Q. Devereux, can you talk about the rebounding, the battle there? And, also,
could you just talk about in general the fight this team has with what you did
tonight?  
DEVEREAUX PETERS: The rebounding was really important. I think the guards came
in and crashed, tipped some balls and got real key rebounds towards the end of
the game. We weren't rebounding, really let them do what they wanted in the
first half.  
We tried to focus on them in the second half. And I think the guards did a
great job getting in there, getting rebounds as well.  
This is a team that never quits. We've never been like that as long as I can
remember. We're going to keep fighting no matter how much we're down, if the
game is over, whatever it is, we're going to keep fighting.  
And that's one thing I love about this team, is that no matter what point in
the game it is, we're going to fight it out until the end. And it showed
today.  
  
Q. I was hoping you could take us back through those final really crazy last
90seconds. Obviously they had a couple of steals, couple of big baskets and
free throws, but then to Natalie's last final shot?  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: Oh, man. You want me to start? We're in the same predicament
as we were at the end of regulation. And this time I think we went in the
huddle up 4 with 1:20. We've got to finish. Leave it all on the court.  
And I think this team did that. And, man, turned it over, and I was like, oh,
my gosh, I gotta get back in. Brit knocks a 3 down, and we were talking about
our stops in the huddle, how we just needed to get three more stops, three
more stops. We were on a clock. We knew they were going to be pressuring us.  
We did a good job at the end and let out a sigh of relief when we got up three
possessions, and we knew we were going to switch everything and not foul. If
it was a 2, just try to stay in front.  
DEVEREAUX PETERS: I think one of the best things about our team right now is
we can hold our composure in situations like that. We've been in a lot of
tough situations. Like Sky said, when she turned it over and they went on the
2‑on‑1 fastbreak, she could have easily fouled and not been in the right spot
and given up. But she ran back and got a huge play and got a huge block and
got the ball back.  
Shows how composed we can be even in those situations where it seems like
things aren't going our way.  
  
Q. Brittany, I think it was the first three you had ‑‑  
BRITTANY MALLORY: First game.  
  
Q. You've had really good passing all year, a lot of high assist percentage.
I think it fed through both of your post players. If it was a like hockey
assist, they both would have gotten assists. When you guys have been
performing well this season, that's been the case. Could you discuss that and
how important that was to you guys playing your brand of ball at that point?  
BRITTANY MALLORY: Yeah, our team loves to share the ball. We have confidence
in each other, and even though I wasn't hitting 3s most of the tournament,
they kept feeding me the ball. They kept telling me to shoot. And Sky. She
gave me the most confidence today when she said they're going to go in. And it
was just a big sigh of relief when that first one finally went in.  
Our team loves to share the ball and we're going to help each other out. When
someone's open, we're not going to be selfish and move the ball and that's
when we're at our best.  
  
Q. Is it sweeter because it was UConn here?  
BRITTANY MALLORY: Yeah.  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: Yes.  
DEVEREAUX PETERS: Yes.  
BRITTANY MALLORY: It's great getting to the championship game and it's the
exact thing that happened last year. But we've had a battle with them all
year. We played them three times before this game.  
And they won the last game that we had, that we faced each other. And it
couldn't be a better way to go to the championship.  
DEVEREAUX PETERS: I think it's great for the Big East, though, two straight
years, two Final Four teams. What a game like this for fans to watch. I know
basketball fans all around the country were foaming at the mouth seeing this
and when it went into overtime, you could see‑‑ even the Stanford‑Baylor crowd
got into it.  
But this is great. Yes, it's that much sweeter because it's UConn.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about your team's character, the way they came back
from that let ‑down at the end of regulation?  
COACH McGRAW: It was a huge let‑down. It was important that we went into the
huddle with a positive attitude. And I thought my staff did a really good job
of stopping me before I got there, to make sure we did go in on a positive
note.  
And the players, they were great. They were pumping each other up. And we had
seen them in overtime in South Bend. So we had kind of a little bit the same
idea going into the overtime. But, yeah, it was huge for them to not put their
heads down and say: God, we just kind of blew it. They were just ready to go.  
  
Q. Can you talk about what it means to you when the players say they've got
your back?  
COACH McGRAW: Yeah, it's very emotional for me with this group. I don't think
I've ever had a group like this. They take such ownership. We play for each
other.  
I feel the same way about them. I want them to experience a national
championship. Every time I look at them, all I can think is how much I love
them. It's like a little bit like being a mom and watching your daughters do
some great things. And it's always a proud moment for me.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Skylar's play, the block, and then the feed for
Mallory to get that 3, just the impact it had on the game?  
COACH McGRAW: That was game‑saving. That was huge. You can't even‑‑ that would
have turned the game around had they made that layup. So it was just so
important.  
And as Dev said, a lot of times you turn the ball over, you tend to put your
head down and kind of jog back and hope somebody gets there. But she sprinted
the floor, made that huge play.  
I think when she came out of there, I don't think anybody saw where she was,
all of a sudden she came dribbling out of the pack. And I think it just gave
us such a big momentum lift, and then Brittany hitting the 3 just topped it
off.  
  
Q. You said the players were going to approach it as a business trip. Now
that it's been a couple of days, what's their psyche been like and how would
you evaluate them, how they've been here in Denver?  
COACH McGRAW: They've really been great. I think in fact they probably haven't
had enough fun. We went out to the Broncos stadium, had dinner out there and a
tour of the stadium. That was nice. But I think they really want to have some
time off to themselves to kind of experience the city.  
So I think they've been great in terms of their attitude and their approach,
and we kind of kept telling them if we win you're going to get more free time.
We'll have a lot fun if we go win this one.  
  
Q. Earlier in the first half it seemed like Connecticut was beating you
backdoor and they were getting a lot of easy buckets with Dolson inside. Was
it simply the fact that Dolson was in foul trouble early on in the second
half, or what did you adjust to eliminate that?  
COACH McGRAW: You know, she really played well. And we were really happy when
she got that third foul and had to go out of the game, because we were having
trouble guarding. We were supposed to be fronting her. We never quite got
there. She was setting a lot of ball screens. We hedged a little bit too long.
We didn't get back in time. Our next plan was to double team her.  
She had a couple of times where she dribbled and we forgot to go down and
double. She played well. That's one of the best games she's had against us,
and certainly having her out of the game for seven, eight minutes was
important for us.  
  
Q. Can you talk about what it means to you and what it means to the program,
you're now 3 ‑0 against Connecticut, national semifinal games?   
COACH McGRAW: I don't really look at it that way because it's over such a long
span of time and they're a program that's here so often. It's nice to be able
to be a team that can actually beat them here.  
  
Q. I realize we're right after this game, but have you had any chance to
look at tape of the Baylor or Stanford? I know you've played Baylor this year.
We don't know who the outcome is going to be. But you're going to be playing a
good team regardless.  
COACH McGRAW: We're going to be playing a good rebounding team with good post
players. So we probably will have a similar game plan.  
But I've seen a little more of Baylor. Feel like they've been on TV a lot
more. Don't get to really see the West Coast games, can't stay up that late
during the tournament to watch them. So I'll be cramming, I'll be cramming
tonight for Stanford if they win.  
And just know that both of them, with Neka, Chiney and then Griner and Destiny
Williams, so many bigs inside. Our posts are going to have to be ready.  
  
Q. Coach, you know UConn so well at this point in the season. And you know
each other so well. Maybe there was an edge there with Skylar possibly
compared to UConn this year. Kind of abnormal for them not having that Maya
Moore or that player that you know when it's crunch time it's going in their
hands. It wasn't kind of that obvious person this year for UConn, but for you
guys, you have Skylar who was creating even when she wasn't scoring. Do you
think maybe that was kind of the edge in this game?  
COACH McGRAW: Oh, absolutely. I definitely think Skylar's the difference‑maker
for us. I think she does that. When you look at their team late in the game,
you wonder who they're going to go to.  
There was no question today it was going to be Dolson. I thought that was
pretty obvious from the way they were looking inside to her. And she really
stepped up.  
But I think when you have a team and you're not sure who is going to be the
one, it is a little bit difficult at the end of the game. So I think that was
an edge for us.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the fighting character in your team, because you've
come back before from halftime deficits?  
COACH McGRAW: We have. We were down a few games this year, probably at
Hartford, came back in the last game of regulation.  
But they just don't quit. I think they just keep on going. They know they have
the confidence, they have the maturity, the poise, and that calm, that calm
that Brittany brings.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_DENVER, COLORADO_  
  

Baylor  59  
Stanford  47

  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us from Baylor, head coach Kim Mulkey, student‑athletes
Brittney Griner, Odyssey Sims, and Terran Condrey.  
Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Odyssey, can you talk about the contributions from Terran and how
important that was for someone to step up and hit some outside jumpers?  
ODYSSEY SIMS: She's been hitting big shots all year. She's been key to us
winning big games, and she stepped up like a senior should and she hit big
shots for us.  
  
Q. Terran, Coach yesterday said something like if you guys win the national
championship, it's not going to be because of Brittney Griner, it's going to
be because of the team effort. Do you think under ‑‑ this was like exhibit A,
because you got so many contributions from so many different players today?  
TERRAN CONDREY: Yeah, I think so, because most teams double‑team Griner, so
they'll leave most people open, and we had to be ready to knock down the shots
in the game.  
  
Q. Brittney, to see Terran do that in that kind of moment, and also Jordan
Madden had some big shots in that second half, were you proud of them to see
them delivered like that?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: Definitely. I was very proud to see Terran and all of them
step up and knock down shots. It's not the first time she had done this. She's
silent, but you hear her on the court.  
  
Q. Brittney, can you talk about what Stanford did against you and they kept
you to your lowest field ‑goal output or‑‑ or tied with for the season, and
just was it a difficult night for you?   
BRITTNEY GRINER: I give credit to Stanford. They're a good team. They always
had two people on me or second offender come in try to double me. They stuck
with their plan the whole game. Frustrating. You get frustrated when your shot
doesn't go in.  
But I had all the confidence in my team. Like Coach said, it's not the
Brittney Griner show at all. My team stepped up and knocked down shots.  
  
Q. Odyssey, can you talk about just the overall frustration that whole first
half? Seemed like nothing was going right either team, both having trouble on
the offensive end and how you guys broke out of it about five minutes into the
second half?  
ODYSSEY SIMS: Just like we came out not as strong as usual. I felt like some
of us were a little nervous trying to get all the jitters out. But we didn't
come out strong. But going into halftime we knew we had to pick it up.  
  
Q. Odyssey, at the end of the game you threw the ball to the rafters. This
is where you guys have been pointed towards all year long to finally get to
this national championship game. What's the feeling?  
ODYSSEY SIMS: It feels great that we're going to play on Tuesday. But, then
again, we haven't done that yet.  
  
Q. Can the athletes talk about whether you felt any effects from the
altitude up here? Does it make it harder for you or are you already so well
conditioned it doesn't really matter that much?  
TERRAN CONDREY: In my opinion, I think the altitude is terrible (laughter).
But I think that we are in good shape, though, as a team.  
ODYSSEY SIMS: Altitude is very different from what we're used to. But I feel
like we're adjusting very well and we're not trying to show them that we're
tired on the court.  
BRITTNEY GRINER: I'm with Terran on the altitude. But, I mean, we're in shape.
You just gotta push through it.  
  
Q. Brittney, there late in the game I saw you look over at the ref and it
was like kind of shaking your head, like: When are you going to call a foul?
Was this any more physical, though, than some of the games you've seen all
year?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: No, not really. Just the ref was laughing, I was laughing.
Found it funny at the time.  
  
Q. Brittney, can you just talk a little bit about the matchup with Neka? And
you guys haven't played against each other in college at least. It's been a
long time. Can you talk about what that was like for you?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: I enjoyed it. It was a good matchup. She's a great player.
And it's been a while. We've both improved. And had to work on‑‑ first time
I've really had to work the whole night.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. You said all year long that you can't win a national title with just
Brittney and Odyssey. This kind of proved it tonight?  
COACH MULKEY: Yes, it did. We've seen multiple defenses throughout the year.
And I just thought Terran Condrey, she's a great shooter, a senior, and I
didn't hesitate to quickly insert her in the lineup. She can nail that shot
down. Jordan Madden can, too.  
But what we did better in the second half was we turned down the first look.
We were rushing the shot. We'd make one pass and we'd play right into
Stanford's hands and shoot the first shot that was open. And all you gotta do
is reverse the ball, be patient, let Griner still get touches, and you're
going to get the same shot next time across the floor.  
I thought we did a better job. But Griner does what she does. She draws a lot
of attention, and we're not a one‑dimensional team. Brittney Griner is the
face of women's basketball right now. And we embrace that. She deserves that
and it's great recognition for Baylor. But our team is not just Brittney
Griner.  
  
Q. You mentioned Jordan's ability to hit that shot, too. In the first half,
though, it wasn't really going down for her, but you did insert her back in
the game. What did you tell her?  
COACH MULKEY: Just keep shooting. Just keep shooting. If you're a shooter, you
gotta keep shooting. She made some and ones there late and didn't lose her
confidence. She got frustrated a little bit coming in and out of the game, and
competitors want to play and just keep playing. It's going to fall for you.  
And at the end I decided to go offense/defense with her and with Terran and I
just felt that they were challenged and they stepped up. Maybe not early in
the game. But it's going to fall for you. Just keep shooting it.  
  
Q. How is Destiny? Is she okay and will she be able to play on Tuesday?  
COACH MULKEY: Destiny?  
  
Q. Odyssey.  
COACH MULKEY: Odyssey, you're talking about the layup there when the trainer
went out on the floor? No one's hurt to my knowledge.  
  
Q. I had heard ‑‑ someone told me that Destiny had been injured too.   
COACH MULKEY: No. If she is, they haven't told me. Odyssey had a little cramp
there. I called a timeout so I didn't have to take her out of the game because
the trainer was on the floor. Had I not called the timeout, I would have had
to insert somebody to shoot the free throws for her.  
  
Q. Neka mentioned that Griner ‑‑ maybe psychologically playing Griner kind
of psyched her out a little bit. Do you think that's part of what Brittney's
built up over time, the fact that she's so good that it's almost a mental game
as well as a physical game?  
COACH MULKEY: I do. I do. Because the women's game we haven't seen the likes
of a Brittney Griner before. We've seen 6'8" and 6'9" players. We've seen
players that dunk it. But her presence on the defensive end‑‑ I've been around
the game since I was 18years old at this level. And I've never seen anybody
dominate on the defensive end, just her wing span and her presence.  
  
Q. I think the score was tied 31 ‑31, and then you went on a 15‑3 run. Was
there anything in particular that you were doing different during that one
span that kind of gave you the big lead?  
COACH MULKEY: No, we didn't change‑‑ well, we changed our defense a little
bit. We played a 2‑2‑1 zone back to a man, and one possession or two, I don't
know the time period, we went back to a 2‑3 zone. But we probably got some
easier baskets in transition through that period and just had some defensive
stops, got to the foul line.  
But it wasn't a magical thing that I did or called on either end of the floor.
I think just our patience paid off. I thought‑‑ one of the things that we
really stressed against Stanford that we did well is we kept them off the
offensive boards.  
When you have a Neka and Chiney, they're such athletes, if they don't score on
their first shot, they're usually getting putbacks, getting their team an
opportunity to score again. And I thought we battled with them and made sure
we eliminated their second chance points.  
Thought our defense was good. We held them late in the shot clock many times.
And I thought we got to the foul line.  
  
Q. Kim, on a night when Destiny was not shooting her best, just battled on
the boards, ten rebounds for her, can you talk about what she gave you?  
COACH MULKEY: I thought Destiny had one of her better defensive games.
Honestly, you tried to keep Griner inside. You may assign‑‑ you have Neka, you
have Chiney, but the truth is keep Griner in the paint as much as you can. And
I thought Destiny was active on who she was guarding, whether it was Neka or
Chiney.  
I thought she didn't let her offense or her inability to get many shots affect
what she was trying to do to help her team win. If that was blocking out and
getting the defensive rebound, she missed some free throws. And she never let
that affect her.  
So she makes her free throws, Destiny does what she's been doing, and that's a
double‑double.  
  
Q. I asked Odyssey about reaching the national championship game. Of course
she said it's great, we haven't accomplished anything yet. Did you love
hearing her say that?  
COACH MULKEY: Sure. You do. We're 39 and 0 and you're going to play for the
national championship. And they deserved to play for the national
championship. They've taken everybody's best shot. They've got a gimpy coach
up here that can hardly hear, see, or talk, yet they pull me through and pull
me along. And we'll be out there come Tuesday and we'll give it our best shot
again.  
  
Q. You said before that there's nobody that's come up with a new defense for
Brittney Griner. But it looked to me double teaming is certainly not novel.
But they were doing it a little bit differently tonight for the first half at
least, in that they had one player playing behind her and one in front to deny
her the entry pass, where Tennessee was playing to help the defender between
her and the post. Was that different and was that part of what held her
down?  
COACH MULKEY: No, it's not different. We have seen that. Jordan and Terran and
NaeNae have been challenged and they have seen that before. St. John's was
outstanding doing that to us. So it's not anything we haven't seen. And when
you think about it, if you knock those shots down early you take a big lead
quickly. And they've got to make some adjustments. But when you don't knock
those shots down early, you need to be more patient and make sure we continue
to get Griner touches.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## April 1, 2012

  

### [Geno Auriemma](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14072)

### [Stefanie Dolson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21811)

### [Bria Hartley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21837)

  
_DENVER, COLORADO_  
  

Notre Dame  83  
Connecticut  75

  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us is head coach Geno Auriemma and student‑athletes
Bria Hartley and Stefanie Dolson.  
Coach, an opening statement.  
COACH AURIEMMA: Really not much that I can say. We put ourselves in the
position to win the game. That last two minutes, minute and a half of
regulation was pretty amazing.  
And as most games do, it turned on the one great play by a great player. And
then when we got into overtime, we just didn't have enough. They just made
some huge shots. We took a chance on making it difficult. But Brittany Mallory
made two huge shots, and that's who we wanted to shoot the ball. And, God
bless her, she stepped up and made shots.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Stefanie, you played the last (indiscernible) of overtime with four
fouls. Can you talk about your mindset of how you had to play that stretch?  
STEFANIE DOLSON: I just know I had to stay as aggressive as I could without
fouling and just be smart, because I knew the team needed me in there to get
rebounds and make shots.  
And they did a pretty good job just staying aggressive but not fouling.  
  
Q. Bria, you guys are 0 ‑3 this year when you've given up 70 plus and Notre
Dame has done that twice. What do they do so well on offense?  
BRIA HARTLEY: They stay moving on offense. I think, even though we're familiar
with them, they stay active and they set a lot of screens. It's just us having
to talk to each other. They hit some tough shots.  
They were able to score. And they played a really good game tonight.  
  
Q. I was hoping you could just take us through the emotions of those final
two minutes. Coach Auriemma was kind of telling us about it already, but from
your guys' perspective as Kelly got those two steals and hit all those free
throws, what was it like from your guys' perspective?  
BRIA HARTLEY: I thought it was great. I thought we definitely had a lot of
momentum going for us. God bless Kelly, she was able to get that steal after I
turned the ball over. And I think it was just a lot of excitement, and we felt
really good going into that first overtime or whatever, but it didn't turn out
the way we wanted it to in the end.  
  
Q. Stefanie, could you talk about your offensive mindset, especially the
first half, you did a large part in carrying the team?  
STEFANIE DOLSON: Well, I think Notre Dame did such a good job of being overly
aggressive with our guards that they had a lot of tough shots that they had to
make and knock down. So I just had to do a good job screening for them.  
That left me open to roll to the basket and got me easy layups. And towards
the end I knew I had to be as aggressive as I could to get our team points,
because we gotta give Notre Dame their defense a lot of credit; they did a
great job taking away a lot of things. And we didn't move around enough.  
  
Q. Bria, you guys have had great defense all year, team defense. You guys
held Skylar with only two points till late in the first half. And your
teammates were backing you up well, it seemed like. If she tried to drive,
they were there to stop her. Can you talk about how important it was in that
first half to not only how you were playing against her but the team in
general?  
BRIA HARTLEY: I think a lot of it is our help when someone gets beat or
whatever, someone steps up and someone's able to stop them, and a lot of it is
just us talking and communicating on defense. Everyone did a really good job
of that in the first half.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, I think 19 turnovers in regulation time tonight, Notre Dame's
defense or just sloppy ball handling today?  
COACH AURIEMMA: It's always a combination of both. Anytime you have that many
turnovers, the defense has a lot to do with it and you have a lot to do with
it yourself.  
We just were not very good offensively. And I can't tell you why, because
maybe the emotions of the game or maybe for some of our younger guys the game
was just too big for them, I don't know, but there was a lot of standing
around, and that's not like us. That's not how we play.  
  
Q. It seemed like the upperclassmen who all wanted to play well struggled
but the younger kids, like Stefanie, Bria, and Kiah, all played great. Could
you talk about what the younger kids brought to the table tonight?  
COACH AURIEMMA: It's awfully difficult. And a lot of the teams that have been
here before find that out that you're not going to come here and your freshmen
and sophomores are going to necessarily win national championships for you.
It's very difficult.  
And Kelly and Caroline and Tiffany struggled a lot. And it wasn't until the
last minute, minute and a half, that Kelly started making the plays that Kelly
normally makes.  
At the end of regulation, I think it was 67, right? Something like that? So,
again, you're not going to hold Notre Dame to much less than that, generally
speaking. So our defense was fine for the regulation for the first 40minutes.  
We just passed up too many opportunities. You can't do that against Notre
Dame. You can't come away empty handed. They're just too good. You can't give
them that many chances.  
  
Q. Your teams are so familiar with each other after playing so much this
year, last year. How do you think that affected this game and maybe ultimately
affected the outcome?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, what can I say? It was tough for them to get open shots.
It was tough for us to get open shots. There were stretches where our defense
dominated them. There were stretches where our defense let us down, or our
offense was clicking and then theirs was. It's basically the way all the games
have gone that we played them.  
We said going into this game somebody's going to make a couple of plays and
that's going to be the difference in the game. And if we had won in
regulation, the play that Kelly Faris made would have won the game. Instead
the play Natalie Novosel made maybe won the game for them.  
  
Q. Coach, you were down 4 in overtime. You called a timeout; come out of
that, you get a 30 ‑second violation, looked a little tentative. What were you
trying to do there? Did you think your team looked tentative at that point?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, that's another issue that popped up. That was a struggle
for most of the season. When we called that timeout, we knew we were going to
get a good shot, because we knew Kaleena or Bria was going to get a good shot.
The only problem is once we inbounded the ball and started dribbling,
dribbling and dribbling, then it just kind of deteriorated from there.  
And why? I don't know. We did things tonight that we haven't done in a long,
long time. And I don't have an explanation for it.  
  
Q. Geno, the rivalry will go on. But is there one thing right now, one play,
one moment, something that's really like kicking your butt right now that's
really eating at you about any one thing tonight that you're taking home with
you right now?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah, I would say probably the last play of regulation because
the game sometimes hangs on one play. Kelly steals the ball, misses the layup,
and then gets two free throws. If Kelly missed the layup and makes the one
free throw, we're up three instead of two. And that changes everything.  
I made a huge mistake of taking Kiah Stokes out of the game at that point. We
went with five guards so that we could switch all their screens. And in the
end a defensive rebound would have won it for us. That's the part I'm going
home with.  
  
Q. Can you take us through your mindset in the second half with Stefanie and
the foul troubles, when to take her out, when to put her back in, what you
were thinking there?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah, I thought Stefanie played great. And there was a lot of
talk on the bench among the coaching staff about when to bring her in, how
long to keep her out. But I felt as long as the game was within reach and it
wasn't more than four or five points either way that we could buy some more
time for her.  
And I figured somewhere around the six‑minute mark, seven‑minute mark we'd be
good to go. I thought Kiah Stokes was really good tonight. I thought she did a
lot of really nice things. And as long as she kept doing that we would be
okay. I'm really proud of our freshmen and sophomores. I thought they had
really, really good days today. And they learned a lot. This will be good for
them.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_DENVER, COLORADO_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us from Stanford, Tara VanDerveer and student‑athletes
Neka Ogwumike and Chiney Ogwumike and Toni Kokenis.  
COACH VANDERVEER: We're thrilled to be here. Our team has worked really hard.
We have I think some outstanding talent on our team, but we have a specially
good leadership and I think team camaraderie. Everyone is working hard to have
a great game tomorrow night.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Neka, I didn't get a chance to grab you to ask you this the other day, so
I'll ask it now. Can you just articulate your emotions and feelings about the
final days of playing with Chiney in college?  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: I think it's‑‑ right now everything is happening fast but
at the same time slow because I'm trying to soak in every moment. Not
everybody can say they played with their sister, and it's been a lot of fun.
Definitely some ups and some downs, but mostly ups.  
And I'm just really‑‑ I think it's kind of a bittersweet moment. We want to
play two more games, and I want to have two more games with my sister and also
my teammates.  
But I think it's also kind of‑‑ I'm kind of passing the torch on. It's her
turn to do her two years on her own like I did my first two years. I think
she'll do fine, just like all my other teammates. I look forward watching her
in the future. It's been a lot of fun, and I'm ready to have fun on Sunday.  
  
Q. Chiney, what kind of inspiration has your sister been for you and what
has she meant to this team?  
CHINEY OGWUMIKE: In everything that's been done she set the bar extremely
high. Growing up I was like, How am I going to compare? In high school she was
doing great things, winning Gatorade Awards and College Player of the Year.  
She's setting the bar super high, but what I learned in this process is just
to work as hard as she does and try and fill in her footsteps, I'm going to be
in a good place.  
I'm excited for her. It's pretty bittersweet that this could be the last few
games of our run. It's been a long run. But it also has been a little too
long, you know what I mean?  
But I'm just excited. We've had so many memories. They stack up. And I'm
excited to see where her journey will go and where ours will, because I have
sisters on the side too.  
  
Q. What have you guys learned from the past Final Fours and the
disappointment that you can apply here this weekend?  
TONI KOKENIS: I think last year we learned that like we need to play for all
40minutes. We kind of let the game slip away from us at the end.  
Just really picking up our defense is something we're focusing on, and we've
kind of let down a little bit in the second half in our past Final Four games,
and teams have scored more than they should in the second half, which kind of
hurt us.  
So we're definitely focusing on defense and just finishing games and focusing
for all 40minutes.  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: I totally agree with Toni. I think also it kind of has a
lot to do with having fun, and our team is really good at having fun. And
we're also good at staying poised. We don't panic. I think that's a really
good quality for our team. But, most importantly, playing for 40minutes is
really what it's down to.  
  
Q. Neka, the other day you used words ‑‑ you talked about the last couple of
experiences here at the Final Four. You said two years ago you were
devastated. Last year it was really annoying, I think was the word that you
used, the way you guys finished up. So you're here now again and this is your
last chance at it. What is your‑‑ what is your feeling kind of going into
these last‑‑ potentially last two games, and how much do you want to get this
done?  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: Surprisingly enough, I'm very calm. I've been calm‑‑ I was
probably the most stressed maybe against South Carolina, I think. I don't
know. And I was also pretty nervous for the Hampton game.  
But coming into the Final Four, I'm kind of taking it one day at a time, one
minute at a time, enjoying the times I have with my coaches and my team.  
I'm not trying to go overboard and be too ecstatic, but I'm very happy. I'm so
grateful that I'm here. Grateful for the awards that have been given to me and
Chiney and all the girls participating in the Final Four, and I'm just
enjoying every moment. I got to catch up with friends at the banquet
yesterday.  
And it's kind of tranquil for me right now. I'm not even worried. And I know
when it comes down to it, when I step on to the court, I just go out there and
have fun and I play as hard as I can.  
  
Q. Brittney Griner mentioned something that she called sister instinct; she
sees you guys have an on ‑court connection, and I'm sure you do, which
supersedes what you might have with your other teammates. And can you talk
about that? And, Toni, can you talk about what you see with them on the court?
Thank you.   
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: I'm repeating myself, but I talk about playing on the court
with Chiney is like playing with three teammates, not four. We kind of
understand each other's games. And when it comes to constructive criticism,
things are a little different when we communicate between each other.  
CHINEY OGWUMIKE: On her end.  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: But she's responsive. And it's also mutual. She helps me
out as well on the court. And a lot of times‑‑ sometimes Tara doesn't need to
say anything to her because I've already said it to her. Kate jokes around and
says I should have a whistle.  
But it's been a lot of fun. And I know Chiney can attest to me yelling at her.  
CHINEY OGWUMIKE: It's not that big of a deal. It's more than the yelling. She
knows I hear her. I may not listen, but I hear her.  
No, all jokes aside, it's been great. I think the best example was last game,
coming down to the wire a team will be pressing us, and I take the ball out
and I know she will work her butt off to catch the ball. Little things like
that; that she's not looking to make herself look good, she's looking to help
me out.  
And it's just something like that that we've sort of spread that kind of
intuition with our entire team. We're very close. That's one of the things I
say the best quality of our team is our chemistry. And it's not even just on
the court, it's off the court.  
We don't really argue that much. We all understand each other. People's
viewpoints get out. I think that really helps us a lot just being able to
understand each other and to push each other.  
And it starts with Coach Tara. She's really helped us. She gives us criticism,
and we soak it in. She tells us what to do, and we try to do it to the best of
our abilities.  
And that's the sister instinct I think Brittney was talking about.  
TONI KOKENIS: Well, I can definitely tell as like a teammate, when we'll like
go to a huddle or something, and either somebody might have made a mistake,
and they'll kind of just look at each other, and like someone will start to
say something, and then the other one is like, I know. So they have a little
like silent kind of conversation.  
But it's more like just‑‑ like they said, the whole like sisterhood has kind
of infiltrated our whole team and we're all sisters, and it's from watching
them and seeing how helpful they are to each other.  
  
Q. The question of playing at Denver's altitude always comes up for teams
coming in here. The fact that you played in Boulder this year, does that give
you any indications of how difficult it is to play here?  
TONI KOKENIS: We definitely think it's to our advantage that we played here
earlier in the year. And it really didn't bother us the first time. So we're
very confident and comfortable playing at the altitude, however high up it is.  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: About 280.  
TONI KOKENIS: The Mile High City. Doesn't bother us at all and we feel pretty
good.  
  
Q. Neka and Chiney, how would you describe Brittney Griner's development
over the last few years, and how difficult exactly is it to guard somebody
like that without getting in foul trouble?  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: I can't say that I've been watching every one of her games,
but I definitely think that since she came out in high school she's definitely
gotten better.  
I just mentioned this to someone earlier. She's not just big, she's athletic,
and she has skills, which makes that kind of a triple dagger. But it's going
to be a challenge, and I'm excited. I'm stepping up to it, and I know our
entire team is as well.  
It's going to be a collaborative effort. But I think that with the belief in
ourselves that we'll be just fine. If we follow our rules, Tara and the
coaching staff has done a really great job of helping us figure out our
defensive plan, but at this point I'm just‑‑ I was excited from Selection
Monday that Baylor was on our side, and I'm so happy we get to play them,
especially with me being a senior. I don't want to say that I didn't get to
play her before I left, so I'm looking forward to tomorrow.  
CHINEY OGWUMIKE: I think growing up in Houston we were miles apart, Nimitz,
Cy‑Fair, and even Dulles with Kelsey Bone. So we grew up together. We played
in the same basketball tournaments. Funny we never ever played Nimitz High
School, but I always saw her play against Dulles and Kelsey. It was a nice
little circle we had supporting each other knowing that we had hopes of
playing DI.  
But just seeing how far she's come, I remember the first time I saw the
YouTube video, it was on the local news, I went to sleep that night and it was
like, The phenom that can dunk, and it was just dunking, but then to see her
game evolve and expand and going right, left, finishing outside of the paint,
it's been great because it shows how much people can develop in basketball.  
And it's going to be a challenge, definitely. And I think we're all excited.
The only way you can approach something like this is you're all in, we're all
in, and we're going to do to counter what she brings.  
  
Q. Neka, following up on the Griner question, one, are you still tranquil
when you look at film of what you're going to face tomorrow? And also what's
the bigger challenge, on the offensive end or defensive end, or are they
equal?  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: I mean, I'm pretty calm. I mean, because it's film. I've
been doing this for four years. I know how film is. Granted at this point
we've been watching a lot of it. But it's still film. And I think the coaching
staff does a really good job putting together tape reels of what we need to be
focusing on.  
We don't just look at Baylor; we look at things we've done well in different
situations. And, I mean, watching the tape, it's going to be a challenge. But
I'm really excited.  
What was your second question?  
  
Q. Offense and defense.  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: I think it's going to be‑‑ it's going to be more of a
challenge for us to focus on offense really. If you don't follow your rules on
defense, then things don't go your way. But I think our team is really good at
following our rules. We have to make sure we play hard and defend for
40minutes.  
It's actually funny that you ask that, because Coach Donnie Dawkins, our men's
team, they just won the NIT, congrats, and he was talking to us before we left
about how it's going to be all about defense, defense, defense.  
And I think our defense is something that a lot of people kind of look over.
We do a really good job following our rules, and our coaches do a great job
scouting and letting us know what we have to do, but offensively, especially
for a team like us where we're versatile, we can score inside and out‑‑ inside
game is obviously going to be very different. It's different for every team
that plays against Baylor.  
But I think the challenges that are posed on offense are going to prove that
our team knows how to concentrate and focus and we can play together and kind
of adjust and strategize against Baylor.  
  
Q. Coach Mulkey said she really recruited you hard. Did you consider Baylor?
And what made you decide on Stanford?  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: I definitely did consider Baylor. Coach Mulkey, she's a
great coach. It was really fun getting recruited by her. I made a lot of, you
know, I guess you could say‑‑ not really unofficial visits, I would always go
up and watch the games because our high school team‑‑ it's only about a
three‑hour drive from my house.  
And ultimately I chose Stanford because I felt that‑‑ as hard as it was,
because Baylor's a good school and a drive away from my home‑‑ and I think my
mom really wanted me to go there, but she's happy I'm at Stanford now. Because
my mom likes being so close.  
But it was all about I think just the academics and the athletic demands that
the Stanford community really demands from different players and athletes and
students.  
But, most importantly, when I went there I couldn't think of another place to
go after meeting all the people that I had met. Whether it was Tara and the
coaches or my teammates, or even just students that came to greet me at the
football game. And I can say right now that was probably the one reason why I
went to Stanford. And I've met so many people.  
I can say I'm friends with Andrew Luck. Like that's really cool. And I know
Chiney really likes that, too. The students there are superstars. The
professors are superstars. The coaches are superstars, even though Tara
probably doesn't want me to say that. But it's just worldly people there, and
I'm very happy I made the choice to go to Stanford.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. If I could ask the same thing of you about the sister instinct and the on
‑court connection between them and I guess how it's been infiltrated
throughout the team and what's your observations of that.   
COACH VANDERVEER: I think that first you have when they play together, they
have played together so long that they can anticipate what the other person is
going to do. So you do have that sister factor on the court, just Xs and Os,
passes, screens, things like that. Like Chiney said, throwing a long pass to
Neka; she knew she was going and she was going to catch it.  
I think off the court‑‑ I noticed this right away when Chiney was on our team
with Neka‑‑ that other people look at them and you have a great player like
Neka and now a rising star like Chiney and you see how they treat each other,
how they talk about each other, and they have a great relationship. And that
sisterhood does permeate our team.  
And I think it's a wonderful thing and it's something that everyone on our
team‑‑ I've talked to Amber about‑‑ she's from Houston‑‑ being little sister.  
It's just a really, really fun group to be around, and the leadership and the
maturity that Neka provides and then Chiney and Jos and all the way down, it's
something really special.  
  
Q. A couple teams have come through here and they out ‑and‑out said up there
today: We're here to win a national championship. I feel like you guys are
downplaying that a little bit. Would that be accurate?  
COACH VANDERVEER: We're all here for that. That seems kind of obvious. But
it's always one step at a time. It's always doing the little things right. So
we're working as hard as we can preparing our team for Game No.1, which is
Baylor. And there's no national championship without beating them.  
  
Q. Tara, Baylor has really had only three nailbiters all year. You've had
considerably more than that. Is there a problem for a team if this does get to
be a close game, not having had that experience and going down to the end, is
that a problem? Can that be a problem for a team that's got such great
expectations as Baylor?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I don't really know how to figure out‑‑ I concentrate on
Stanford. For us, we just‑‑ we try to prepare. We haven't had‑‑ we did have an
overtime game, which I'm thankful for, but not at the time, but I am now.  
But I just really try to focus on what we will have to do. And they present so
many challenges. There's a reason that they haven't had a lot of close games
because of all the great things they do.  
But if you're‑‑ I think our team coming in being confident, being loose,
knowing what we need to do and then just applying themselves to doing what
their job is, then that's all I'm going to ask for.  
  
Q. Tara, how do you compare your personal desire to win a third national
title compared to the one ‑‑ the desire to win your first one way back when?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I think I realize how much harder it is. When we went the
first time in 1990 and won the Regional, I was happy. I just thought: This is
it; I don't need anything more. Then when we got to the Final Four, I'm like:
Wow, who knows if you're ever coming back and let's try and get it.  
We did win the first time, and then we've gone back several times, and it's
really, really demanding. A lot of things have to go right. And I look at
years that we've been with the last five years, and really getting to the
championship game in 2008 and we didn't really play that well in the second
half especially against Tennessee. But they took it to us.  
I think that we realized kind of there's a whole big difference between the
semifinal game and the final game, and then the next year we didn't have
really‑‑ I don't think we matched up really well with Connecticut that year
and they were on a mission.  
'10 was playing Connecticut in the championship game, and I think that game,
again, had‑‑ we had a good shot at halftime, and then they just had a little
run that got away from us. And then last year not getting the championship
game, we had an opportunity and just didn't‑‑ we didn't do what we needed to
do.  
So I think that the experience that all of our players have had, our staff has
had, you know, we want it as bad as anyone this year. Our team wants it as
bad. Our staff wants it as bad. We're working as hard or harder than anyone.
So we know we just have to do the right things.  
  
Q. Robert Griffin, III, is going to be here to support Baylor. I'm wondering
if you've been able to convince Andrew Luck to come?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I haven't made the effort. Maybe John Elway. He might be in
town. I'd take him.  
  
Q. Would you agree with Neka's assessment that defense is the key to the
game in terms of that that's going to be ‑‑ that offense is going to be more
of a challenge that you guys are going to be locked down on, do you think?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I think it's an equal challenge. I think it's an equal
challenge of how to defend them. And then she, Brittney Griner, is a
game‑changer. There's no two ways about it. She impacts the game at both ends
of the court. She's a phenomenal player. And she has improved so much.  
And they just‑‑ and they know‑‑ they know how to use her. So I think it's
going to be equally challenging for us at both ends of the court.  
  
Q. You sort of just started to touch on this, but in terms of attacking
them, where would you try to attack them offensively? Because they really are
athletic and long in almost every position.  
COACH VANDERVEER: I think you're going to have to wait and watch tomorrow. But
we do have an idea. Our team is focused on specific things, what to do and
what not to do. And we have the benefit of watching, for the most part, 30 of
their games and really watching and seeing what things work and what things
don't work.  
  
Q. Can you put into words, Coach, what Neka has meant to this program?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I could put them in words, but you don't have enough paper
and ink to print them all. I'll give you an idea. When we signed Neka, I had
two new assistants, Bobbie Kelsey and Kate Paye and then Amy Tucker had been
at Stanford. And I bought each one of them a GPS. I said, We're going in the
right direction.  
It's like she is an amazing young woman. She's improved so much from her
freshman year until now, and she will continue to improve. But more than that,
she's a solid person. How many coaches can say they've coached someone for
four years and they've never had one minute of getting upset with them, being
mad at them, having to have a parent‑‑ or coach/player or daughter word with
them.  
She's just outstanding. And it's why you coach. Everyone's out there looking
for a player like Neka, and she's sitting right next to me.  
  
Q. GPS, you bought one for Neka or ‑‑  
COACH VANDERVEER: The coaches. Neka, I'd be in trouble with. For Amy, Kate,
and Bobbie. That was in the old days before they had them on your phone.  
  
Q. Knowing you, assuming that you've got a plan that you're comfortable
with, and I'm wondering if that's the case, and how confident you are that the
guys can go out there and execute it?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I was asked this already maybe by some that might be in this
room. But, yes, we do have a plan. And now the question is will we be able to
execute the plan. Thinking of the plan is a lot easier than executing the
plan.  
But I have a lot of confidence in our team. And I feel the same way Neka does.
We're very excited about this game. We love the challenge. We love to put the
puzzle together. This is a really, really different puzzle to put together,
playing against someone that's 6'8" that has 199blocks or against Odyssey Sims
who has 114 turnovers.  
I don't know that we've‑‑ we've played against a team one year that had three
All‑Americans, which was Connecticut. We played against talent before. But
this is a very talented team, top to bottom.  
And we know we're going to have to do the right things, and that's‑‑ I think
that that's what we've worked hard for all year. This is what we work hard all
summer and all fall to, who is going to box out tomorrow? Who is going to get
on the floor? Who is going to take a charge?  
So this will be the questions that, if I'm sitting up here happy, two days,
it's because we did those things. And if I'm not, then we didn't do those
things.  
  
Q. Baylor's favored tomorrow. And you're not underdogs very often and you're
probably underdogs in at least three of the four previous Final Fours.
Psychologically, do you do anything with the kids to kind of prepare them to
play a team that is considered superior than you guys?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Yes. I mean, I think it's true. I don't think we go into so
many games where we're expected to win, and as Baylor does and as Connecticut
does and as Tennessee or Notre Dame, but we go into games where we're expected
to win and then even if we win by 20, that wasn't good enough.  
But this game, there might not be anyone in this room besides me that thinks
we are going to win. So we do some special things.  
  
Q. To ask the question about strategy in a different way. The teams who have
had relative success against Baylor, what have they been able to do?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Well, I think they've controlled the tempo. The scores are
low. They understand if your 5'7'' guard goes in against Brittney Griner she's
going to need a toothpick to pick out the leather from her teeth. They
understand certain things they're not going to change.  
I told our team: This is not a game to show me your macho move to the basket
against Brittney Griner. I don't need it.  
I told our team: We have to do what we're good at. Don't show me something
I've not seen before. Don't come out with if you've not made a 3 all year I'll
need to see it now.  
But I do think we study‑‑ I mean, it's really fun, I love it, we study what
people do against us, we study what they do against them. And if there are
things, there might be just things that maybe Odyssey Sims doesn't get as many
steals, maybe Brittney doesn't get as many blocks. And we try to look and see
tendencies. And with the technology that we have now, we can watch a lot of
stuff, and I do.  
  
Q. Texas Tech played them twice within 10 and seemed to sort of press out
the floor ‑‑  
COACH VANDERVEER: In fact, beat them last year.  
  
Q. They seem to try to sort of milk the clock before the ball could get
inside to ‑‑ I'm not sure if I'm saying that correctly.   
COACH VANDERVEER: I've watched that. That didn't get lost on me. We have to
study. And I'm sure they've studied games that were close for us, too. But we
have to play within ourselves. We have to have a plan that fits Stanford. We
can't say, well, Texas Tech did this and now we're going to do that. We have
to look at what they did, and we have to say, well, what do they do that fits
us and our personnel.  
As much as it's hard‑‑ who has Baylor played against that's like Neka? As hard
as it is to play against someone like Brittney Griner, and it is, who is going
to guard Neka? She's got a pretty versatile game.  
  
Q. Been doing it for a long time. You've gone against a lot of great
players, and Neka mentioned it several times, the rule that you guys have told
her to follow. Are you in a different page of the rule book in dealing with
Brittney Griner? And she kind of downplays if she's changing the game, but I
know the game has changed, in general, but is she changing it even more so?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Neka is talking about things like our team gets the fact
that we aren't here unless people do what they're supposed to do. We're not a
roll‑the‑ball‑out team where you can go out and take any shots you want or
decide if you want to sprint back on defense.  
What Neka means by following rules: We have to sprint back on defense. Box
out. We have to do the little things. If you're going to set a screen, set a
screen. Can't be ships passing in the night.  
So for us to be successful, to me, it's everyone being, as kind of Chiney
said, all in. It's not being a weak link. Not someone not doing what they're
supposed to do. Not knowing the scouting report. We do like written quizzes of
scouting reports in walkthroughs. So maybe our approach is a little bit
academic, because that's why I'm coaching the kids I do.  
I think that's all Neka meant by following the rules. Because we talk about
things: This is where you need to be on this play; these are the things you
need to do.  
And we're being‑‑ basketball to me is not rocket science. We have to defend
well. We have to score well. We have to rebound well. And through all that,
you know, I can't be blowing my top at people, and our kids have to have fun.  
And we're thrilled to be here, and we're really looking forward to tomorrow
night.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_DENVER, COLORADO_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us is head coach Kim Mulkey, student‑athletes Destiny
Williams, Odyssey Sims and Brittney Griner.  
Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Brittney, obviously you were here two years ago, and you guys have
maintained a very intense focus all year. Is it hard once you get in this
environment to keep that going?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: No, because you see the prize at the end. It's right there.
So it's not hard at all.  
  
Q. If you could each take this one on, can you just talk about the sisters
over at Stanford and what kind of matchup they present? And, Brittney,
specifically can you talk about how remarkable that you and Neka have not
really met in college basketball and how much you're looking forward to that
matchup?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: Looking forward to it a lot. I haven't seen Neka or Chiney
since high school, since summer ball. They play remarkable together. That
sister instinct for each other on the floor at high/low. We're going to have
to guard them and keep them off the guards.  
DESTINY WILLIAMS: We expect a good matchup. They have two outstanding post
players; we have a bunch of outstanding post players. It's going to be a great
matchup. I think it's going to come down to who rebounds the ball well. Both
posts will get great touches and finish around the rim. It's going to be an
exciting game.  
  
Q. Brittney, Neka told us that you had played against her in an AAU game
somewhere around her junior year, and she said that her team ‑‑ that your team
won. What are your recollections of that game?   
BRITTNEY GRINER: It was a good game. I mean, it was just a good matchup. Me
and her going back and forth. I can't wait to do it again.  
  
Q. Brittney, how much are you aware that you are changing the game of
basketball and so many people before you, post players in particular, said
nobody's been like you before and you're changing the way the game's being
played?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: I mean, I wouldn't really say I'm changing it. I'm just
adding on to what great players before me have added on. And I know there will
be somebody there that comes along and do something I couldn't do and add on.
And that's the thing about it. Just keep adding on to the game.  
  
Q. Brittney, several coaches, particularly Coach Blair at Texas A &M says he
thinks you're the greatest woman's player of all time. You would need rings
and championships to validate that. Do you feel that kind of pressure in terms
of already being listed as one of the best ever and winning a championship?
How important is that to solidify you?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: I don't feel any pressure really. I kind of tune out
everything. And I know this year that's been the main focus, though, winning
the national championship. That's just what's driving me right now.  
  
Q. Destiny, can you talk about is it a little more exciting ‑‑ you're at the
Final Four; it's plenty exciting, but is it more exciting to play a Stanford
team you guys don't know? It's a new matchup for both teams from the past few
years.   
DESTINY WILLIAMS: It's exciting to play against a team you haven't seen all
year. It will be a great matchup. Stanford will do some things to try to
score, and we're going to do some things to score and turn out a defensive
rebounding.  
They are coached by a great coach, and we have a fantastic coach. So it's like
an even matchup. And it's going to be an exciting game for women's basketball,
for people to watch, and go out for a win.  
  
Q. Destiny, do you see much difference in the two sisters' game and on
Stanford? Are they pretty similar? Do you see many differences in them?  
DESTINY WILLIAMS: Neka has more experience than the younger sister. She's the
leader on that team. She's just helping her sister out to become a phenomenal
player like she is. And Neka has improved her shooting to her skills, and
Chiney is just more of an offensive rebounder, close‑to‑the‑basket‑type post,
and Neka extending her game, working on her 3 shooting.  
It's a little different, but pretty much hustle plays. They're the same about
that.  
  
Q. Destiny and Odyssey. Destiny, everybody's asking Brittney a lot of
things, but you have to ‑‑ you guys practice together. How would you stop her
and how difficult is the play against her in practice?  
DESTINY WILLIAMS: Well, she has a very, very, very, very long arm. So‑‑
(laughter)‑‑ so it is hard to get a shot off over her. But she helps us out a
lot to get our shots off quicker, to go around her and try to finish the
contact.  
There's a lot of things. You have to take off the dribble, because you're not
going to post up and score over her. Just things like that. And being more
physical towards her.  
She helped us out a lot in our game only to make us better players.  
  
Q. Odyssey, you're considered one of the best point guards in the country.
And Stanford been considered having trouble with the speed of somebody like
you. What do you expect from them and can they do anything to slow you down?  
ODYSSEY SIMS: I just expect it to be a very physical game. It's going to be
battles for the boards for our post players. As far as guard player. And use
our speed and quickness and score and get the ball inside as much as possible.  
  
Q. Destiny and Odyssey, how do you guys turn out the 40 ‑0, the chasing that
and just concentrating on one game? You guys are chasing this 40‑0, this
pinnacle there. How do you tune that out and just go after one game at a
time?  
DESTINY WILLIAMS: We haven't accomplished anything yet. Our goal throughout
the year was to win the championship. And once we get that, I think that we
all will be satisfied. 38 ballgames are great to have, and not to have our
loss is an honor and accomplishment to have along the way, but they're just
wins. And we have the trophy, something we can enjoy bigger and better.  
ODYSSEY SIMS: As far as what she said, it's the main thing to have a national
championship. And I see here we're 0‑0, we haven't won anything, nobody's won
anything, and we're all here‑‑ we all have the same goal, and hopefully we'll
just come out on top.  
  
Q. Odyssey, what's your mindset on the defensive end, especially when it
comes to on ball defending, can you take us inside what you're thinking about
when you're defending?  
ODYSSEY SIMS: Pressure to the ball, that's pretty much it. I don't really have
anything that goes through my mind. I just try to pressure my defender as much
as possible and create a turnover.  
  
Q. Brittney, I don't believe you fouled out of a game since early in your
freshman year. With all your blocked shots, with all the physical play you
have inside, how have you managed to avoid foul trouble on a consistent basis?
What have you learned along the way?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: Just playing smart, trying to keep my body away. Really don't
need to body them up and block a shot. Like Destiny just said, I have very,
very, very, very long arms and I can reach around to block shots.  
  
Q. Brittney, you've always maintained that you wanted to go back to Baylor
for your fourth year. Why was that so important to you? And, secondly, not too
many college players make the U.S. Olympic Basketball Team. How much would it
mean to you to be part of the Olympics this year if you're chosen?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: Well, as far as me leaving, I'm staying. I made a commitment.
I said I was coming here, and I'm going to stay here until my time's up. So
all the speculations of me leaving early are false. I'm staying here right
here at Baylor.  
COACH MULKEY: Could you say that a little louder? Because some of these keep
wanting to keep talking about it. Some want to keep writing about it. Would
you just repeat that slowly.  
BRITTNEY GRINER: Baylor is my home. I'm staying here. I made a commitment. All
the speculations are false. I'm not going anywhere. I'm staying right here.  
  
Q. Brittney, if you could talk a little bit about how Destiny Williams has
fit in with the program and what she contributes.  
BRITTNEY GRINER: Destiny is, based on the boards, double‑doubles all the time
and there's always rebounds. I know if I don't get a rebound I can always
count on Destiny. She works well in the post with me and finding me and
letting me find her. She's knocking down shots at the top which help get the
defender off, second or third defender off me, and she's my other post player.  
  
Q. What would it mean to you to represent the country in the Olympics, being
a college player?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: As any basketball player, it's a dream to represent your
country, put on the U.S.A. jersey. So it would mean a lot, you know?  
  
Q. Odyssey, when we were still in Waco, you said you don't think you'll
really get excited for the Final Four until you get here. Now that you're
here, what's the experience been like thus far? What's been the coolest thing
that you've been able to do?  
ODYSSEY SIMS: Well, it's been fun. We had a busy day yesterday. I can say the
Salute Dinner thing that was really fun. And that was like an experience many
people don't get to experience.  
And having fun. It's great for my team. We've been bonding. So we just are
getting ready for tomorrow.  
  
Q. Brittney, does the sisters ‑‑ does their leaping ability make this maybe
a unique matchup for you this year in terms of who you match up with inside,
their ability to jump?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: Like you said, they've got a great leaping ability. Gotta box
them out. When the shot goes up, you gotta find them. And we got leapers on
our team, too. So it will be a good matchup.  
  
Q. Odyssey, I'm not sure how many other sophomores were out there, maybe one
other one. What was it like to be part of that 10 ‑personteam, to stand out
there with those 10 players? And also Destiny talked about it, but being this
close to the end, how exciting is that?   
ODYSSEY SIMS: To be out there with the older girls, it's something special.
I'm one of the top 10 players in the country, it's a great experience, but
that's not my main focus. I'm here to win two basketball games. And we are
very close.  
And, like I said, just trying to stay focused and prepare as much as possible
and go in tomorrow with one mindset, and that's to win.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. You have a lot of ex ‑players here today watching and enjoying the
moment. One in particular, Jessika Stratton. She's going to be coaching here
in Colorado Springs or in Colorado, actually, at Colorado Christian. Is there
any advice you would give to her as far as her future of pursuing coaching?  
COACH MULKEY: I don't need to give Jessika any advice. Jessika played for me
when I was first hired at Baylor, and Jessika was just an all‑out gutsy
gym‑type player. Gym rat. She was always in the gym.  
She's one of the finest Christian kids you'll ever be around. She will be a
great role model for her student‑athletes. And she was involved in a very
difficult game. She had the turnover when we lost to Tennessee with 2/10 of a
second on the clock. And I learned more from Jessika Stratton in that locker
room not being a very good coach toward her at the end of that game, and I've
written about it in my book and the type of person she is, she never took it
personal.  
So I have the utmost respect and admiration for her, and she will be great.  
  
Q. I just wanted to ‑‑ if you could give us an update on how your health is
and how the inflammation is at the moment?  
COACH MULKEY: Don't ask me to smile. And I think the distortion of the face is
mild compared to cases I have seen before.  
The biggest problem I'm having is my eyes. The light bothers me. The tears and
the dryness and itchiness they say is all a part of it. And my ears. I feel
like one ear is blown out and I can't tell if the other one is hearing or if
it's just off balance.  
As far as the distortion or whatever you want to call it of the face, hell,
I'm just another ugly coach (laughter). It is what it is. And I'm not vain, so
it doesn't matter.  
  
Q. Along the lines of what I asked Destiny, a lot of people might be excited
about this matchup with Stanford because it's something new, not something
we've seen this season or in the last few years. Are you excited about a
matchup against a team you haven't seen very often?  
COACH MULKEY: I have something to compare it to. I guarantee you Notre Dame
and Connecticut don't enjoy playing each other four times, but the good thing
is they're doing it at the Final Four. Yes, I would much rather play teams
that you don't know so much about.  
It's exciting for us because I don't think we've played Stanford since Neka
was a freshman. I'd have to go back and make sure I'm not overmedicated and
forgotten something here.  
But, yeah, it's exciting to play somebody different. We are familiar with
Stanford. I recruited all three of those Houston kids. And these kids, Odyssey
and Brittney and Brooklyn Pope, they've gone head to head in some serious
competition in the summer between the two organizations. So they're all
familiar with each other.  
  
Q. On the health thing. You said the lights. When you're ‑‑  
COACH MULKEY: Like right now it bothers me.  
  
Q. On the court, how is it?  
COACH MULKEY: It's not as bright. The only thing that bothered me on the court
was the band when I was on that end. My ears feel like they're about to
explode. I'm sure some referees feel that way when I get in their ear.
(Laughter).  
  
Q. Are you going to ask the band not to play as much?  
COACH MULKEY: Are you kidding me? I'm going to let that band rip it. Go for
it.  
  
Q. The same question asked Brittney: Do you feel the same pressure coaching
a player with such national/international acclaim in terms of her greatness?  
COACH MULKEY: Not at all. Not at all. And I want to say this to all of you:
Don't ask her about the Olympics when you go talk to her. That's a non‑issue.
She's kind of surprised that the Olympic team was even announced at the
college Final Four. Her focus is a national championship.  
Brittney is a blessing every day I go to work. Because so many great ones that
are as good as she is and have done more than she has done, you don't enjoy
coaching them sometimes because they know they're good and they don't work
hard and they have an attitude about them that they're better than everybody
else.  
When I'm done with Brittney Griner, the thing I'll tell people is: That child
brought her workpail to work every day. She brought it every day to practice.
She never had a bad day in practice.  
Her worst days were just missed shots or she thought she should have done
something better. But she brought her game to the floor every day.  
  
Q. Brittney mentioned a sister instinct that she sees. Do you see that they
have a communication on the court that maybe supersedes what you usually see
between teammates?  
COACH MULKEY: Well, she may be referring to the fact that the longer you play
with someone, you instinctively know things about each other and where they
want the ball, what their next move is.  
And obviously when you're sisters, you probably have played lots of basketball
together. And I would think that they do have that sisterly instinct in that
they played together all their lives.  
  
Q. That focus that has marked the season for you guys, have you seen it
sustained through this time since getting to Denver?  
COACH MULKEY: I just told them at half court that that hour of practice was‑‑
of course you're not out there showing your hand on anything. It's more for
the fans. But I saw a focused basketball team. I saw a team that came and
they're enjoying being out there. But at the same time, they focused on
finishing, shooting.  
Look, it's beyond coaches now. The coaches have gotten each of their teams
here. It's now in the players' hands. It's now players making plays.  
The big stage is when the big‑time players surface. It's not about coaching at
this point.  
  
Q. Kim, with as much focus on the post area with Neka and Brittney and them,
could it be a game decided by the back court? And then kind of off that
question, because of the type of post players they have, could Brooklyn play
even more in that rotation?  
COACH MULKEY: I think Brooklyn Pope's game is very similar to the Ogwumike
sisters. Brooklyn is our‑‑ you call it highest leaper, or she jumps higher
than anybody on our team.  
Brooklyn could dunk the basketball if her hands weren't so small. Yes, she
could be a factor in the game. But she's been a factor in the last several
games for us. So I anticipate her to be able to help Destiny and B.G. down
there.  
As far as the back court is concerned, I think our strengths, honestly, other
than Brittney Griner covering a lot of space down low, it's our perimeter
defense. I think our perimeter defense is pretty special. And it starts with
Odyssey Sims, NaeNae Hayden and Jordan Madden.  
  
Q. When evaluating the season and looking back up to this point, are there
any moments that stand out for you where had they gone a different way you
either may not be here or the season would have gone differently?  
COACH MULKEY: That moment was not this year. It was when we lost in the
Regional Finals in Dallas last year and those kids came back to summer school.
And obviously we can't be with them during the summer. But I just felt that
our strength and conditioning coach, who was with them all summer, and the
leadership that came back, the disappointment, the hunger, all that was taken
care of this summer.  
I thought team chemistry was a missing link last year, not that we didn't have
a team that didn't get along, but we had a freshman trying to lead a
basketball team to a Final Four. We had our best player just a sophomore. We
had our senior, our captain, our leader, our glue, playing with one eye.  
The timing of Melissa Jones' injury honestly cost us. And that's not to take
anything away from Texas A&M, because they just beat us. But I sure can't
afford to go into a big game like that when your glue and really your leader
is struggling to even stay on the floor because of her injury, let alone worry
about leading a basketball team.  
I thought last year's game just is the only game that I could tell you sent a
message to themselves. You can go one direction or you can go the other.  
  
Q. Shanay Washington obviously not going to play with her fourth ACL. What
has she added to the team in the time since the injury a month or so ago? And
I noticed she's here. Does her spirit help the guys in any way?  
COACH MULKEY: Well, Shanay Washington was a starter for us as a freshman. She
and Griner were two of our players that started. That's how much I think of
her talent. And for her to have another knee injury. She has a decision to
make at the end of the year to either give up the game, medically have the
surgery, do I even have the surgery if I'm going to give up the game. There's
lots of things that I'm sure she's thinking about.  
But here's what I do know: She's a part of this team. She'll always be a part
of this team whether she can play again or not. She'll travel with us. And
whatever she's allowed to do, she will do. We have brought her along, and if
she's got a uniform on and we're playing for that championship and we're way
ahead and there's an opportunity to put her on that floor, I'm going to look
at her and say: Do you want to go step out there? That's how much I think of
Shanay Washington.  
  
Q. It's great to hear you sound so positive about what you're going through.
Can you talk about how important that is to maintain a positive attitude with
everything that's going on?  
COACH MULKEY: Listen, the alternatives are worse. Bell's palsy is fixable.
Bells palsy with time will get better. This is just a‑‑ I guess you call it a
little bump in the road.  
I can assure you the spit that will fly out of my face in a timeout won't faze
them. Or the spit that will come out of my mouth, they'll understand what I'm
saying.  
It's really nothing. It hasn't affected them. It hasn't affected me. It
aggravates me. It aggravates me, but there are worse things in life. And you
just deal with it. Kidney stone would hurt a lot worse than this. Having a
baby didn't hurt near as bad as a kidney stone. You deal with it.  
Every male in here needs to have a kidney stone. It's the closest thing to
child birth for y'all, so y'all need a kidney stone.  
Go ahead. Didn't mean to distract you.  
  
Q. How did Odyssey play in that game against A &M in that Regional Final?
And if she didn't play well, how does that sort of affect this season by
coming back and playing?  
COACH MULKEY: Odyssey Sims didn't play well at all. She will be the first one
to tell you. But you have to have a short memory in this business, but yet
inside you you have to have that competitive spirit that drives you.  
And I can assure you she's a different basketball player today than she was a
year ago. The talent was there a year ago. But she's more experienced. She has
really grown both in her mental makeup of how to handle it at this level, both
constructive criticism, both the understanding of what's on your shoulders as
a point guard on a basketball team, but she was awful in that game. And she
would tell you that.  
  
Q. Are you pretty confident in your ability of your team's ability to handle
a close game if it's tight down the stretch?  
COACH MULKEY: What choice do I have? You know, we've all been in tight games,
all four teams have been in blowouts to get here. I just feel like every day
in practice our competition within the team makes us better. There are many
days when Brooklyn Pope's on the other team and Terran Condrey is on the other
team with the other players that don't get as many minutes, they beat our
first team.  
And they don't like that. It becomes real heated and sometimes I have to call
it off, because it really gets physical and sometimes you like that and
sometimes you don't want it to be blown out of proportion.  
But I don't know that I'm going to coach any better if it's tied or if I'm not
going to coach good or make the wrong call.  
Everybody here is trying to win a national championship. And those that make
plays are going to win it.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_DENVER, COLORADO_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us is head coach Muffet McGraw and student‑athletes
Skylar Diggins and Brittany Mallory.  
Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. Brittany, after eight times in 14months, is there anything about UConn
that you don't know, and do you think there's anything about them about you
guys that they don't know?  
BRITTANY MALLORY: Not really. Like Coach said, there's no mystery left.
There's not going to be any surprises. It's all about heart, who is going to
play the hardest, who is going to execute and play well.  
  
Q. Skylar, along those lines, is it good or bad that you know this team
inside out; they know you guys inside out? Maybe for the Final Four you come
in prepared, but you already know everything about them?  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: Like Brittany said, it's a matter of execution now. We watched
them over and over, and I'm sure they have done the same, and now it's just a
matter of can we stop those plays that we know they're going to run, can they
stop our plays, who is going to get more hustle‑back plays, 50/50 balls,
rebounding, stopping them in transition, and just executing our offensive and
defensive game plan.  
  
Q. Skylar and Brittany, because of the frequency that you played UConn,
would you consider them your biggest rival?  
BRITTANY MALLORY: Within the Big East, I would say so. We've played each other
so many times, it's been No.8 in the past two years. I mean, there's a lot of
heart between these two teams, when we go out, we just want to play hard and
win and come out on top. And every time you match up with them, you know it's
always going to be a battle.  
So it's become a rivalry.  
  
Q. Skylar, can you talk about what the focus of the deciding factor was the
last time you guys played Connecticut?  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: Hustle plays. Those hustle plays. They kept balls alive. They
got offensive rebounds. Second‑chance points. Transition. Just hustle plays
for them. They outhustled us.  
  
Q. Can you speak about what it would mean to have Kayla McBride playing this
time around?  
BRITTANY MALLORY: It's been great having her back in the NCAA Tournament. Last
year we could have used her, and this year it's just been great. She's
contributing so much offensively, defensively. She does whatever Coach or the
team needs. And she's just really become a great player this year, and she's
really matured a lot. And we're glad to have her back.  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: Like Brittany said, she brings a lot to the team. Offensively,
her ability to create her own shot, her ability to guard the 4. And like
Brittany said, she does whatever the team needs.  
It's going to be good having her because I feel like she's the X factor.  
  
Q. What would you guys say has been the most important moment this year
where maybe if things would have gone a different way you wouldn't have been
here?  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: I don't know. I have to say when we lost to West Virginia. It
kind of was an eye‑opener for us. Definitely humbled us a lot. We've been on a
roll. In the Big East, I think it shows that you can't overlook anybody or
underestimate anybody. And that's what happens.  
We played a lot of good teams, a lot of tough games. I think that one really
made us turn it up. And we had close games. I think a lot of games do that. So
I think we had more drive after we lost to Baylor. I think we had close games
with Duke and just a lot of good teams that we played.  
  
Q. Have you guys ever experienced playing one team so many times like in
high school or AAU? And, if you have, how did that inform you as to what
you're going to experience tomorrow?  
BRITTANY MALLORY: I personally haven't played a team that many times in any
season or AAU or anything. And it's just something that it's going to happen
when you play them twice in regular season and then you play them again in the
Big East Tournament.  
We just so happen to be on their side in the NCAA Tournament. So there's not
really much to expect. Just you gotta go out and play hard and just kind of
hope for the best outcome.  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: Brittany said it all.  
  
Q. How do you explain the success that you've had against UConn over the
last two seasons?  
BRITTANY MALLORY: I think in previous years it was almost like they had Maya
Moore, and it was a lot‑‑ they were a great team. And once we beat them last
year in the Final Four, we kind of realized‑‑ it was an eye‑opener for us‑‑
that we can play with this team.  
We have just as many good players as them. And we can play with them. And
after we won last year, just kind of opened our eyes for us this year and just
realized that we're not playing anybody special. It's just another game,
another team, and we can really play with them.  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: I think sometimes a lot of people get lost in the history of
the program and the jersey and that can intimidate you right away. I think
this team, the past previous games especially, we haven't been intimidated.
And no Maya Moore helps that out too.  
  
Q. A couple of days ago Kalana Greene was saying when UConn players come to
Connecticut they come with an inherent dislike for Notre Dame and playing
against Notre Dame. Do you guys come to Notre Dame with the same feeling about
playing Connecticut, and how necessary is that to ensure inspiration and
competitiveness in a game?  
BRITTANY MALLORY: I think you come to any school you go to wanting to beat any
other school. You don't necessarily have to like the school, because you go to
beat them. That's your goal. You go to win a season, a regular season, Big
East championship.  
So I don't really know how else to say that. But you're not going to go and be
best friends with them on the court. And afterwards, like Sky and them, they
played U.S.A. ball together, and they're going to have friendships.  
But when it comes down to it, you're there to beat the other team.  
  
Q. What kind of community service do you do and how do you manage your time
between basketball and community service? And as a coach, how are you involved
in your community?  
BRITTANY MALLORY: We do a lot of community service. Our team‑‑ we're out at
the homeless shelters at elementary schools reading to the kids, trying to get
out there as much as possible, because our fans really give a lot to us and
they support us so much so we're trying to give back to them.  
And with schoolwork, it's tough being on the road and practice and trying to
get out in the community. It's a lot to handle. But you have great advisors
and a support staff that will help you kind of manage your time.  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: I think it's important, especially being from South Bend, just
to get out there. And with women, I think we're so much more available than
men, if that makes sense to you. Just being able to get out there and just let
them know, look, you have role models, you have people that want to help you
out.  
And just being involved in the community is important, and Notre Dame has
always done that, when I was young and Coach McGraw would bring the team
around, till now.  
  
Q. When is the last time you guys either collectively or individually
watched footage of the last year's title game?  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: Never.  
BRITTANY MALLORY: I haven't. I only watched the game personally once.  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: I watched the game last week, played it last week or something
like that. Me and Dev caught the beginning of it. But I haven't watched the
full game either.  
  
Q. What classes are you taking?  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: Brit doesn't take class anymore. She's a seventh‑year senior
(laughter).  
BRITTANY MALLORY: I graduated already. I was a management entrepreneurship
major. I'm just taking some‑‑ a light class load.  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: I'm the same major as Brittany. Graduated in business
management with a focus on entrepreneurship. So strategic management, process
analytics classes, like the fun classes.  
  
Q. I was wondering, what advice would you give a 13 ‑year‑old if she wanted
to become a basketball player?  
BRITTANY MALLORY: First and foremost you've got to focus on school. You can't
get to any college really without good grades. You've got to stay in school
and really study and just try to get as many camps and play with as many
people as you can all the time, day and night. It's really about repetition
and practicing.  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: I agree with Brittany. Practice makes perfect. If you're
serious about it, get in the gym. Don't have to go to the gym with somebody.
Get to the gym. Get a basketball, dribble outside; get a tennis ball, dribble
in the house. That's what I did. My mom didn't like it too much.  
But you just practice. And you set your mind to it, and you can do it.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. It seems when UConn lost to you guys in the last game of the regular
season, they were disoriented and sort of lost. But then they found themselves
and they've been on a run ever since. You guys lost to them in the Big East
Tournament Final, and then that was sort of running through and got refocused.
Did that game help you guys? A loss is never good, obviously, but did it help
you get the team ready and make the run back at the NCAAs?  
COACH MCGRAW: I think it did help us in some ways. I don't think refocus is
maybe the word with this group, because I think they're pretty focused.  
But I think coming off a loss, you just get a little hungrier. I think it
definitely motivated us to get back in the gym, work hard, and just prepare
for the NCAA Tournament.  
  
Q. Having seen all three games, Natalie Novosel got to the line like 10
times, 11 times the first two games, and only twice in the third game. And I
know she initiates contact so often as she brings it into the lane. What do
you see there? Because there's such a free ‑throw disparity to that third
game. What do you tell her or what does she expect of herself as far as
getting the calls? It seems to be such a key part tomorrow night.   
COACH MCGRAW: It's a big part of her game. And she's really good at it. She's
been good at it in just about every game. In that last game she was in foul
trouble. And she didn't play quite as much and that probably had some impact
on it, because when you get two fouls in the first half you get a little
tentative. I'm guessing that's what happened to her in the third game.  
But it is her game. She can really drive the ball. She can shoot it. And
getting to the line is a big part of how she scores.  
  
Q. Would you focus, in particular, on any of the three games this year and
can you give us a sense of just how much game tape you will have watched of
those three games knowing obviously that you know their roster very well
already?  
COACH MCGRAW: We focused on the last one. It was the best one to see. I would
watch clips of it right before practice, just so I was in practice in a good
frame of mind, to really get out what we could from the team. And we showed
them a lot of clips about that, too.  
The assistants watch a lot more film of other games. I focused on ours and was
able to watch a few of those games. But really I didn't watch the game at
home. That was too long ago. I think they're a much different team now. So
really focused on the last two.  
  
Q. Being here for the second year, how is this team different than the team
that you brought to the Final Four and the championship game last year, and in
what ways?  
COACH MCGRAW: You know, I think we're really similar to that team. We returned
four starters, and I think the veteran core group that we had, along with
Natalie Achonwa, really was well prepared.  
I think last year coming in to the Final Four as the underdog and the upset
coming in, it was like a Cinderella story. And I think there was a completely
different mindset.  
This year, coming in as the No.1 seed, I think it's a little more
businesslike. So I think that's the biggest difference.  
Kayla McBride, of course, for Becca Bruszewski is the trade we mailed. Kayla's
having a fantastic year. She brings the excitement. This is the first
tournament for her, so it's different looking through her eyes.  
  
Q. What do you see as the biggest difference in UConn the way they're
playing now as opposed to the February27th game?  
COACH MCGRAW: I think Tiffany Hayes is playing better. I think Bria Hartley‑‑
you know, I think Faris is looking to score more in the NCAA Tournament than
she did before, a little more aggressive.  
Bria Hartley to me is just‑‑ she's really good. I really like her. I think she
really runs the team and does so many things well. And I think she's a huge
key to their success.  
  
Q. Just wondering your relationship with Geno, how it has evolved and how
you deal with some of the things like when he questions about the score
against Pittsburgh and some of the things at the Media Day when he talked
about Notre Dame football being the reason for the dissolution of the Big East
Conference and those sort of things.  
COACH MCGRAW: I've known Geno for a long time. I was the assistant coach at
St. Joe's for Jim Foster back in the'80s, and he was the previous assistant
coach who had just moved on to Virginia.  
So we've known each other for a long time. And people from Philly have a
different way of looking at things. And I think we understand each other,
where we're coming from.  
He likes to engage and try to get in people's heads, but I don't. And I
don't‑‑ I don't read a lot. I don't get online. I don't look for reasons to
get involved in that. So I just‑‑ I really just try to stay away from that.
And we continue to have a pretty good relationship.  
  
Q. How has your team evolved in the last couple of weeks through this
tournament?  
COACH MCGRAW: We're playing really well. I think we've been challenged. I
think we've really been questioned a lot. When the brackets came out, a lot of
people had Maryland in the Final Four. The other three teams were solid. But
we were the No.1 seed that was going to lose first. I think we played Liberty
and Cal, who were in the both top five in nation in rebounding, and our
rebounding numbers were questioned. Then we played Maryland and the size and
rebounding were questioned.  
So I think we've answered a lot of challenges. And I think it's made us a
really strong team. I think we've come out with a little bit of a chip on our
shoulder, having seen some of those things. So I think it's made us better.  
  
Q. What would be a good early indication on Sunday that things are going
well for you, systems running well? What will you be focused on, at least in
the first five minutes?  
COACH MCGRAW: I think most people feel like when you make your first shot it's
going to be a good day. So I think when you can score. When you get a really
good look and you make it, I think that kind of gives everybody a chance to
breathe a little bit.  
Defensively, I think when you can stop them. I think you get a couple of
stops. That gives you confidence. So I think the first few minutes really kind
of‑‑ you could take some motivation from either end, if you can get some stops
and you get good shots. We can say we're getting good shots, they're going to
drop. But it's always a lot better when they do fall early.  
  
Q. I've lived in Philly for 30years. And I just wanted to ask you, in
Philadelphia, there's always a flamboyance to all the basketball coaches.
There's hardly anybody there who is a wallflower. So does that make it easier
‑‑ first I would ask you: What's the mindset do you think of a Philadelphia
coach? And, second, because you've heard this kind of bluster from every other
coach who has been in Philadelphia, is it easier for you to just let it roll
off your shoulder?  
COACH MCGRAW: For people who don't know Philly, the saying is when they don't
have anything better to do, they go to the airport and do bad landings
(laughter).  
I think the Philadelphia coaches are brash and outspoken. I think there's a
lot of sarcasm used. I think they are right to the point.  
I think that's something that even with my team had to deal with: I'm going to
be honest and I'm going to tell you. And I think that's how most of those
coaches are.  
I forget part two of your question.  
  
Q. Because you grew up in that environment, is it easier to let the bluster
roll off?  
COACH MCGRAW: Yes, it's so easy to let that go, because I think initially you
kind of want to get into a fight. But it is easy to let it go. Especially
being‑‑ I'm a Midwesterner now. So I'm so much more laid back than I used to
be.  
  
Q. First of all, why haven't you allowed yourself to be the quintessential
Philadelphia coach? Why have you kept your personality in the background?
Secondly, did you and Skylar sit down before the season and talk about a
strategy in terms of all the national opportunities she might have for
publicity and other things that might come her way this year? And has there
been a lot of stuff that you've had to sort of counsel her to stay away and
wait until April or May or whenever?  
COACH MCGRAW: I'll take part two first. You know, I did not. We sat down with
Chris Masters and‑‑ and ‑‑ Chris and Sky right at the beginning of the year to
try to talk about how to help her navigate through the amazingly high number
of requests that she would get to do things.  
So we talked more from a trying to shelter her a little bit. We talked about
her Twitter account. She has goals for Player of the Year. We have the same.  
But we really didn't talk about how we're going to publicize you, how we're
going to do things for you. We kind of felt like you're going to play and
that's what's going to get you the attention.  
So I don't think we have a strategy coming in to how to promote her. I think
we just let her promote herself by playing and for everything that she does.
And certainly agreeing to give her those opportunities to go to ESPN Science
and do some things like that, we thought that was really important, and to do
the blogs for espnW, I think that was important, too.  
I think her Twitter account is really‑‑ that's an important thing for her to
do. And I feel like I still am the same person. I'm just an introvert, which
is a very different person to be as a head coach.  
  
Q. As a competitor, do you have an appreciation how this rivalry has really
escalated over the last two seasons because how many times you've played?  
COACH MCGRAW: Yeah, I'm excited it's a rivalry. I think when you lose to a
team as often as we did for a number of years, I think it's kind of an
exercise in futility more than a rivalry.  
So I'm happy that now it is a game that when we go in we look forward to it. I
think the challenge of it and‑‑ and I think in the Big East having two great
teams going at it like that with national attention all the time, I think that
says great things for the Big East Conference as well.  
  
Q. Wanted to follow up on the Twitter thing, in New York in October I
remember asking you about Twitter and nail polish, because Connecticut's got
all these rules about things that their players can't do, they can't wear.
Notre Dame seems to be a lot more relaxed in those areas. And I'm wondering
why you feel so differently than Connecticut and how necessary you think some
of these things are for team comportment.  
COACH MCGRAW: I think nail polish is essential (laughter). I think that‑‑ I
have a girly team and they love to get dressed up, as you saw last night. I
think it's important to have that kind of image off the court as well.  
I like to treat them like adults until they abuse the privilege. And so far
nobody's abused it. I've got great kids. They're really, really good citizens.
We don't have a lot of problems. And so as long as that stays the same, I'm
willing to give them whatever they want.  
  
Q. Curious what you think ‑‑ you turn around and there are men who leave
college after their freshman or sophomore year, they jump to the NBA. But,
yet, in the women's game, you're not eligible to go to the WNBA until you're
either 22 or you've played four years. One, is that fair for women? And, two,
just your overall thoughts of players that you have had that could have done
the same thing.   
COACH MCGRAW: I think it's a great rule. I think getting your education is the
reason you go to college. I think that you want to come out with that degree
so after your career ends at the old age of 30 or so you're ready to go into
the world and do something else.  
I think it's a really good rule. I think the money is so small that there
isn't the attraction that the men have to leave college and make that kind of
money.  
So I think that's a big part of it as well. And if I was Brittney Griner I
would definitely go (laughter). And I think Elena Delle Donne, too, I think
both of them should leave (laughter).  
  
Q. What has made them so tough defensively this year? Tough for coaches, and
they can contest 2s, they're a tough team to score against. Why is that?  
COACH MCGRAW: They really are. I think Geno is just a really good coach and
their game plan is so sound. They look at your strengths and try to take them
away. I think they have some personnel‑driven rules, just have some general
rules. They do a lot in the half court.  
They don't have to come up and play a lot of full court. They don't play a lot
of zone. They just have really good fundamentals and man to man. And that's
hard to teach. And that's something that you have to really buy into as a
player. And clearly they have bought into that.  
  
Q. What was the team's biggest distraction, so to speak?  
COACH MCGRAW: The media. I think there's so many extra things that you have to
do when you get here that you feel like you don't really get to enjoy the time
with your team and your family. There's so many things that you have to go to
and so many people you have to talk to, and it would be really fun for them to
be here and just play the game.  
  
Q. Have you ever wanted to get involved in U.S.A. Basketball at a higher
level? And I don't know in the past if you were involved at all, but a lot of
major coaches participate. And like obviously Geno is going to coach the
Olympic team. Do you have those aspirations at some point?  
COACH MCGRAW: I don't. I was asked a few times over the years, I was on the
committee, which I really enjoyed being on the Selection Committee for four
years, but I really don't. I enjoy the summer off with family.  
I think the job is a 12‑month job as it is. And I'm pretty happy giving all my
attention to my team.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_DENVER, COLORADO_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll begin with an opening statement from Coach Geno Auriemma.  
COACH AURIEMMA: We got here Thursday night, and we still have to wait another
24hours or something to play, and I think the hardest thing about‑‑ the only
hard thing about being at the Final Four is how long you have to wait to play
the actual game.  
After we won Tuesday night, I wished we could have played Thursday, because
we're playing so well and we have such a good feeling about our team.  
But at this point I'm sure all four teams feel the same way and are anxious to
get going tomorrow. And as I told the players, it may not happen this way, but
I know they do and I know I do, I think we're about as prepared, we're about
as ready to play tomorrow as we've ever been. So I'm really anxious to get
going.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student‑athletes.  
  
Q. What were the things that you did differently as a team in the last time
you played Notre Dame that you didn't do the first two games?  
KELLY FARIS: I think one of the big things is that we had a bunch of
individuals step up at different times. And I think we've been doing that a
lot more recently in the last few games.  
But, specifically, I think it started in that last Notre Dame game, we just
had‑‑ like I said, it was just each individual at different pivotal points in
the game just stepped up and we didn't rely on just one person.  
TIFFANY HAYES: I agree with Kelly. I also think we just wanted it more. We
were tired of losing to the same team over and over again.  
And I definitely think we hustled a lot more in that game, a lot more hustle
plays, a lot of togetherness in that game. So I think that definitely helped
us out a lot.  
  
Q. Kelly, Notre Dame said about 25minutes ago how you guys know each other
inside and out and the biggest thing is the hustle plays, and that really
tomorrow night will probably come down to that because you know the plays, you
know the personnel. But the thing that you can control more than anything else
is how much you guys hustle and make the loose balls and whatever it may be.
Can you talk about how important that's going to be and how the familiarity ‑‑
there's probably not much you don't already know about each other.   
KELLY FARIS: I definitely agree. When you play a team that many times, like
you said, you start to know every player in and out, the plays, their
tendencies, that type of thing. So it does‑‑ it will come down to effort and
the hustle plays.  
And I think, like Tiffany said, we've been doing a lot better job of that
recently. So if we can keep that up, it will be good.  
  
Q. Connecticut, the UConn brand is so huge. This is my fifth Final Four and
this is your fifth for the school. But it's not the same team this year. It's
been a little bit more vulnerable than it has when Maya's been there. How has
that been as far as the mindset, not ‑‑ maybe Baylor is the big dog now and
you guys aren't?  
TIFFANY HAYES: I think it's good for us that all of us are able to step up in
one night and we don't just have one person doing everything. So there's no
superstars on our teams. We're all superstars, because any given night one of
us could score 20 if need be.  
So I think it works out in our favor.  
KELLY FARIS: I agree. I think it took us a little bit to kind of grasp that
concept that we don't have the superstar on our team that we can rely on. I
think we've been kind of used to that the last few years.  
So it's good, though. I think it's all coming together at the right time. And,
like Tiffany said, it definitely works out to our advantage, I think.  
  
Q. Has it been easier with this team because of the kind of tenacious
defense that you play, that that starts, that ignites everything else that
goes on with the rhythm of the game?  
KELLY FARIS: Well, ever since I got here, defense is obviously what we take
most pride in. So I think that's every year day in, day out we work on
defense. And especially this year, I think a lot of our offense we try to get
it to stem from our defense, whether we get a lot of pressure and turnovers
and get out in fastbreak.  
So it's good because we play‑‑ obviously we play a lot of 4 guards, and we can
be a faster team, get up and down the floor a lot quicker.  
  
Q. It seems like a different role for you guys this year. The underdog, so
to speak. You're No.1 seed, but you weren't the team that everyone's talking
about coming in here: Baylor, Baylor, Baylor, Notre Dame winning the Big East
regular season. Is it a little bit easier in a sense that there isn't that
overwhelming pressure of UConn is supposed to win this year? I mean, I know at
this school you're supposed to win every year, but there isn't that coming in,
that, wow, UConn is the favorite and if you don't win it's a terrible year for
UConn basketball?  
TIFFANY HAYES: I don't know, being the underdog, it's okay, because it's not
as much‑‑ like you said, you don't have a target on your back. That was cool
and everything the first two years, but I guess now we gotta take on another
role with being the underdog.  
Like I said, it's fine with us. It just gives us a chance to prove people
wrong.  
KELLY FARIS: Basketball's basketball in my mind. So whether you're the top dog
or the underdog, it's still going to be the same game. When you come to
Connecticut, there's always going to be expectations. And we have them of
ourselves. Our fan base has them. It's not easy to live up to them, but that's
what you come here for.  
So I don't know that we're going to necessarily go into the game thinking that
we're the underdog or all that type of stuff. In the end, it's just another
basketball game.  
  
Q. How important are these guard matchups, especially since you guys do,
like you said, play four guards sometimes, how hard are the matchups going to
be tomorrow? And, Tiffany, what have you specifically learned against the last
two games against Brittany?  
TIFFANY HAYES: I definitely think it's important. Like she said, we run four
guards. So it's big on the defensive end and leads to more scoring on the
other end. And, I mean, I've learned a lot from everybody on that team. You
just know that the whole team is a fighting team.  
And she's definitely a great player. She puts the team on her back sometimes
and carries them. So we definitely gotta watch out for everybody.  
We just can't focus on one person.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. So much to talk about familiarity and how you guys know each other inside
and out and eight times in two years and whatever it may be. But what's the
biggest thing for you guys to win tomorrow night? Because it's probably not
going to be the plays, because you know what you run; you know what they run.
But what's the biggest thing you guys have to do to be successful and get to
the championship again?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Notre Dame has three losses this year. And I don't know the
other two, the box score. But I know in a game where we played at their place,
in the game we played in the Big East championship game, we rebounded the ball
and we kept them off the free‑throw line. And I think if we do those two
things well tomorrow night, then we'll be in good shape.  
Notre Dame is maybe the best team in the country at getting to the free‑throw
line. And I would think that more than anything else that might be the key to
the game; to make sure that they have to make shots rather than just give them
free throws.  
And offensive rebounding and shooting free throws go hand in hand, because
every time you give up an offensive rebound, you end up fouling the guy who is
going back up with it.  
So those two things in my mind are going to be the keys for us anyway.  
  
Q. Looking back at the box scores, Natalie Novosel went to the line 11
times, nine in the second. I know she had some foul trouble the last game, but
it was also caused by a couple of charges by her, and she ended up with only a
couple of free throws. What do you hope to happen? Because she initiates
contact just about every time she has the ball. What, from your standpoint, do
you hope happens tomorrow night?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I hope the referees don't show up (laughter) and just let the
kids play basketball for 40minutes and don't blow the whistle at all. If the
game is a parade to the free‑throw line, like the Kentucky game, it's going to
sting for everybody.  
I think there's a fine line between knowing how to draw a foul and just
mindless blowing of the whistle because you just anticipate that somebody's
going to draw a foul.  
And I know what it's like to be on the other end of that, because Shea Ralph
was the same way. If Shea Ralph had a wide‑open layup, she'd wait until you
got near her and then punch you and shoot a layup and go to the free‑throw
line. It's just the way it was with Shea. And I think Natalie is a lot
similar. Very similar to Shea.  
So we've got to be smart enough to make sure that every shot that Notre Dame
makes is contested. But, at the same time, you can't not play hard. You can't
not be aggressive.  
And really, really good offensive players, they're just hard to stop. I mean,
it's not like we're going to keep them from getting some of the shots they
want. But the way you get a really good offensive player out of their rhythm
is you make them play defense and you turn whatever they're using against you
against them.  
So depending on how the game's being called, we're going to have to do as good
a job as they do at getting to the free‑throw line.  
We're just not as good at it as they are. That's the biggest problem.  
  
Q. How confident or not confident were you through the course of the season
that you guys would end up here?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, before the season, at Connecticut, it's kind of
tantamount to treason if you say we're not going to win a national
championship. And it's something even worse than that if you say I don't think
we can get to the Final Four.  
So I actually thought when the season started, that when practice started,
anyway, that a lot of things would have to go right for us to get to this
point where we are right now.  
And in November I thought we had a chance. And in December I thought we had a
chance. And as January and February came around, I thought we had no chance,
because our immaturity just kept popping up.  
I mean, every time we had a chance to prove how mature we were, we were
immature. But, unlike other places, we just kept winning. So it added to the
frustration. I knew we were immature, I knew we were doing lots of things
we're not used to seeing at Connecticut, but we were was winning, and it took
a couple of losses for us to finally understand that we needed to grow up and
we needed to grow up quickly.  
So it wasn't until the Big East tournament that I really, really thought we
had a shot at this thing. And once the Big East tournament ended, I thought
we've got as good a shot as anybody of winning this thing.  
  
Q. Just wanted to see about talking about your relationship with Muffet and
even in the face of some of the things ‑‑ I know in the Media Day you talked
about Notre Dame football kind of imploding the Big East and how many points
they scored against Pittsburgh this year and that sort of thing, and how that
all fits in the relationship.   
COACH AURIEMMA: My relationship with Muffet goes back to the mid‑'70s when I
left St.Joseph's University to go coach on the men's side and she took my
place at St. Joe's. And I've had a great relationship with Muffet all this
time. And that hasn't changed. That hasn't changed one bit. And the people on
her staff as well. Love every one of them. Have tremendous respect for all of
them, as friends and as professionals, as colleagues.  
My relationship with the University of Notre Dame, that's a different story.
Goes back to when I was a kid, probably, going to Catholic school all my life.
And not being able to get into Notre Dame, that probably missed me off, too.
And it just escalated from there (laughter). Because I had a couple of friends
that went to school there and played there, and you want to kill yourself
every time you came home for vacation.  
  
Q. Wanted to follow up with what Michel was asking you. Since the Big East
Tournament, in the last three weeks, what have you really liked about how the
team has responded to what you wanted all season?  
COACH AURIEMMA: The number one thing that a player has to have to be
successful is confidence. And the one thing this team lacked was confidence.
They pretended and they acted like they had it, but it was fake. And every
chance I got in practice I wanted to kind of try to shake their confidence.
And I always kept winning. And it bothered me that this year more than other
years I kept winning more than I normally win, and I usually win all the time
in practice.  
But at least the other teams got sick and tired of me winning and would fight
back. This team just kind of took it on the chin and just said, okay, Coach
you win, fine. The more they did that, the more I got pissed. I'm like, How
are we ever going to get beyond just being mediocre, just being good? We can't
operate like this.  
These guys just‑‑ they take getting beat at practice. They take it way too
casually. There isn't this‑‑ they're not incensed about losing. And I've had
teams in the last four, five, 15, 20years that if they didn't get a question
right on a crossword puzzle before you did, they want to choke you.  
So I wasn't used to this. And it wasn't until, again, that last week of the
season that it started to affect them. And after we won the Big East
Tournament, they don't react that way anymore. Something clicked that week
between the last regular season game and the start of the tournament.  
And what we did during that week was we went to practice and I made them force
the issue, so that for the next five days everything we did was about building
confidence in ourselves and in each other to the point where we could trust
ourselves and trust each other.  
When you had this many young players‑‑ I don't know how many sophomores are
starting tomorrow for either team. We have two. And I don't know how many
freshmen are coming off the bench and playing huge roles tomorrow. We have
two, maybe three.  
So we're counting on people that haven't done all the things that they hope to
do. And with that comes, as I said, a lot of immaturity and a lot of mistrust.
If you're Kelly Faris and you operate at a certain level from having won a
national championship and being undefeated and now you're having to deal with
players who just don't understand what it takes to do that, I think it creates
a little bit of doubt in your mind about whether you can trust your teammates.  
And, like Kelly said, ever since the first game of the Big East Tournament,
that's gone. And I think you'll see that tomorrow.  
  
Q. You've played both Baylor and Stanford; want to offer a little expert
analysis on the second game tomorrow?  
COACH AURIEMMA: The big kid at Baylor is really good. She's really good. I
don't know why, but I think this is a good matchup for Stanford.  
And I think it's good because they haven't played each other. So Brittney and
Odyssey Sims and Baylor, they don't know anything about how to defend
Stanford. And Stanford's big kids don't know anything about playing against
somebody like Brittney Griner.  
So I really like this matchup. I really do. And all the people that are saying
this is a walk for Baylor, I don't think they're right. I'm not saying they're
not going to win. I don't know who is going to win. But those people that say
Baylor's got an 80percent chance of winning tomorrow night, I think they're
dead wrong. They might, but it's not going to be as easy as they think.  
  
Q. When you're talking about building the team's confidence during that five
‑day stretch, I wonder if you can offer a specific example of what you or the
coaches did to do that. How do you do that in practicality?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, think about this. I'll go back to my father, God rest
his soul. He only knew how to drive‑‑ he got his license, I think, when he was
60 because all the guys who used to drive him around died, I think. So he
needed a way to get around, and I left home, so he was stuck. And he only knew
how to drive from my house to where he worked and my house to where he went to
hang out with the guys on Friday nights and drink coffee.  
So when my mother would ask him to take him someplace, he would refuse, and
then she would make him because it was someplace where he didn't know how to
get to. So he would eventually get to an intersection, stop, three or four
lights would go by, people were honking, everything, he would turn around and
go home.  
When you're scared and you don't know what to do, you just stop and stand
there and you don't want to make any moves. You don't want to make any
decisions because you're afraid to make the wrong one. So you go back to what
is safe for you.  
And that's what my team had become during the whole month of February. During
the whole month of February we were a team that stood around and waited for
something to happen because we started to be afraid.  
So those five days of practice, every practice was about us attacking things
rather than waiting. So the way you saw us play in the Big East Tournament,
first couple of rounds of the NCAA Tournament, the Regionals, we were
constantly on the attack. We were constantly the aggressor.  
So what we did as a coaching staff, we took the thought process out of it and
just put the action back into our team instead of the thinking.  
And I'm hoping that tomorrow we can carry through on that. Because the worst
thing for a young kid to do, all the young kids we have on our team, is to be
thinking about what to do. And I thought that's where we were.  
  
Q. Every time you look up there's different men's basketball players who
leave after their freshman or sophomore years to go to the NBA. In the WNBA,
you either have to be 22 or play four years. One, do you think that's fair for
women? And, two, with all the All ‑Americans that you've had over the years,
has that ever been an issue with some of the players that may have wanted to
turn pro early?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah. Is it fair? I'm on both sides of that fence. If you go
to college, supposedly you're going to college to prepare yourself for a
career. So if you go to college and your career presents itself to you after
your first year and you have an opportunity to start a career that you've
always wanted and it's something that's going to be financially and other ways
rewarding, why shouldn't you go ahead and do it?  
I always use this example: If you're a music major and you go to college and
you play the guitar and the E Street Band and Bruce Springsteen shows up on
campus and the guy says, Oh, man, you're pretty good, do you want to travel
with us? No, I'm sorry, I want to finish my college education. Yeah, right.  
So from a basketball standpoint, I think it hurts the college game that kids
can come for one year and leave, because I don't think they put their heart
and soul into going to that school. They're just drive‑bys, you know? And I
hate that. I hate it with a passion.  
It hurts those kids. They leave after one year and they think they've got it
all figured out. And maybe 2 out of every 200 make it. The other ones end up
regretting it.  
I wish on the men's and women's side we had the baseball thing; either go
right from high school, God bless you, don't set foot on our campus because
you don't want to be there. Or if you make a commitment, you're there for
three years. Then after your third year, God bless you, you're free to go.  
But‑‑ there's always a but‑‑ but, on the other side, you wouldn't have the
four best teams in the country playing in the national championship in women's
basketball almost every year. So that's the plus side of it.  
  
Q. Muffet was asked earlier about her relationship with you and whether you
got under her skin and she said no, because having grown up in the Philly area
as a coach you're supposed to be flamboyant and sarcastic, so for her it's
easy to let it roll.  
COACH AURIEMMA: Was she talking about herself?  
  
Q. She's talking about every coach in Philadelphia.  
COACH AURIEMMA: About being flamboyant and sarcastic? Is she talking about
Tara?  
  
Q. She said it's easy to let it roll off her back because you're supposed to
be like that if you're from Philadelphia. Do you notice you can't get under
her skin because she's from that area and she knows, you know, no coach from
Philly is going to be a wallflower?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Come on. You know, Muffet and Kim Mulkey are pretty much of
the same era, I think, and they're what women's basketball coaches are
supposed to be like.  
They're tough. They're competitive. They have a unique style about them. They
can give it right back to you as well as take it.  
I don't think I've ever consciously tried to get under Muffet's skin. I do
that at the meetings, I do that privately, where we have fun with it. But I
don't think publicly I've ever tried. I bet you if she wasn't at Notre Dame I
probably wouldn't try as hard to get under her skin, but the fact she's at
Notre Dame it's easy.  
And I think that goes with the territory. It's like I'm the coach at
Connecticut. So there's a lot of things that go along with that. If I wasn't
the coach at Connecticut and we weren't this successful, nobody would care,
nobody would say a word.  
But the fact that Muffet's from Philly and I've known her for 35years and
she's at Notre Dame, and if they keep beating us, we're in for it. She's in
for it, big time. She's going to need more than a leather skirt. She's going
to have to wear body armor. I'm coming after her.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA_  
  

Stanford  77  
California  62

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, some opening remarks, please.  
COACH VANDERVEER: First, I want to congratulate Cal on a great season, and we
wish them the very best in the NCAA Tournament. Hope they get a great draw and
they play really well. They were an excellent opponent for us. Today we kind
of had to go with something different. Nnemkadi shooting her threes.  
I thought our team worked really hard defensively. We got out and got some
transition. For us, I think the big difference, we got great games from
Nnemkadi and Chiney, but the big difference for us is how Amber played. I
thought she really stepped up big on the big stage, knocked down her free
throws, took the ball to the basket, ran our team, and worked hard
defensively. Different people came in. So we got more contributions from more
people, and that's what we need.  
The usual kind of day at the office for Nnemkadi and Chiney, double‑doubles.
They're outstanding teammates and team leaders.  
  
Q. Tara, what does Nnemkadi's face ‑up game allow you to do?   
COACH VANDERVEER: I think Nnemkadi as a freshman, I don't know that I could
have seen this coming. But she's worked really hard on her perimeter shot and
we saw it as a sophomore. When we were at Connecticut she was really killing
it in the pinch.  
Earlier on this year I told her you'll be shooting threes this year, and she
did. She has great touch. Shot, high‑arcing shot. I think it gives us more
flexibility. We can move people around, take advantage of match‑ups a little
bit better. But Nnemkadi's such an intelligent player. You can put her in
different spots. She did stuff today that we've never gone over, never
practiced. I said, Nnemkadi, can you do this, and she said yes.  
  
Q. You've been developing more range with your shot all year, and now, if I
read the stat sheet right, these are your first threes of the season made?  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: Made, yes (laughing).  
  
Q. Is this something that you've been consciously working on with an eye
toward moving to the professional level next year?  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: I mean, at this point I'm still focusing on our season.
I've definitely worked on my three. It's not necessarily that we run plays for
my three. But when I do shoot my outside shots, it's pretty far out there. It
might as well be a three. It's good that I kind of built confidence in myself.  
Tara's always known all along that she thinks I can shoot out there. But
Chiney always says there is a psychological barrier when I see the line. Today
it was more so we just need to score. So when I was in the rhythm things kind
of fell through.  
In the first half it was also easier to shoot because I had made some outside
shots and the basket is more comfortable for me to look at. We were
recognizing what we needed on offense. My teammate his confidence in me, and I
had confidence, obviously.  
  
Q. Tara, what is the case that you would make for Nnemkadi as "Player of the
Year" at this point over Brittney Griner a lot of people, including ESPN have
anointed Griner as the "Player of the Year". What is the case that you would
make on her behalf?   
COACH VANDERVEER: Well, I guess, maybe I just look at kind of what the
qualifications of the "Player of the Year" are. For me, a "Player of the Year"
would be a great teammate, a great leader, which Nnemkadi is. She has the
numbers to back it up. She can score in a lot of different ways, and you saw
it today. She rebounds. She scores. She place defense. She blocks shots. I
think she does everything. She gets steals.  
So she physically backs things up. But I think she brings intangibles to the
game that are really special.  
I think she also is playing with, in some ways maybe a less experienced cast
in terms of her guards and perimeter people. But that's for people to vote on.
She's got my vote.  
What she wants to do is something that would be great. She'll be an
All‑American. But I think she wants to just keep her season going and keep
playing with her sister and her teammates as long as she can.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about Susan's effect on the team in terms of
conditioning? Three games in three days, you guys held up beautifully. Where
is this team in terms of conditioning, as you look back to some of your other
teams?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I think that's a great observation. The players could
address it better than me. But as a player, she was a player. She really
understands kind of what it takes. I think she's done an absolutely fabulous
job for us.  
But maybe Nnemkadi and Chiney, especially, because this is the first year
they've had her, they could address that.  
CHINEY OGWUMIKE: I think Nnemkadi knows the effects a little bit more than me.  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: I think having Susan on the team has really changed the
mentality of our team. She pushes us to our limits. We work hard for each
other. We worked hard in the summer and preseason. We still work hard even to
this day. It's not just about playing and recovering and laying down. She's
huge on actively getting better with every step of the way.  
I'd definitely have to say she's a huge contribution to our performance on the
court because we're able to have more stamina. We're able to run up and down,
and eventually tire teams out.  
I tell her every day she's a big reason why I have developed into the player I
am this year. Obviously, along with Tara and the coaching staff, but
physically, she's really added to my game. I'm very thankful for Susan and I'm
sure that the youngsters are going to look forward to a really fun spring.  
CHINEY OGWUMIKE: Let's just finish this season first.  
  
Q. How sweet was it to go against your rival for the actual championship in
the Pac ‑12, and what does that mean to you guys?   
COACH VANDERVEER: I mean, for me, it doesn't matter who we're playing for a
championship. But any time you get a chance to cut down nets, whoever the
opponent is, you want to bring your A‑game. I think that's what we did today.  
  
Q. With a successful 28 ‑game winning streak, how high up on the one line do
you think your team should be come March?   
COACH VANDERVEER: Are you saying in terms of like seed?  
  
Q. Yes, seed.  
COACH VANDERVEER: 1, 2.  
  
Q. Nnemkadi, can you talk about you guys are done with the Pac ‑12 now.
You've been to four straight Final Fours, and I know that's your next goal.
Can you talk about the postseason and what you'd like to achieve?   
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: I think at this point it's very obvious what we'd like to
achieve. However, it takes one game at a time. I know it sounds cliche, but
it's really our mindset. We're just excited for today. We went undefeated in
the regular season‑‑ or, sorry, the Pac‑12 season. We won the tournament.
There have been a few bumps, but we learned. I think that's what's best about
this whole Pac‑12 experience. We've had great competition. A lot of people may
not‑‑ may think otherwise, but the teams out here are very hard to beat,
especially twice and three times with Cal. That was not a cake walk. We're
very thankful for everything that we've achieved.  
But the postseason is here now, and we're very excited about it, and we're
going to find out on Monday where we're going to be. Doesn't matter where we
are. We're going to go there and play and have fun and win.  
  
Q. Chiney, what exactly happened early on in the game when they called a
flagrant foul on Gray? What exactly happened?  
CHINEY OGWUMIKE: Well, it was the first play of the game Gray always likes to
get in deep position, and she was‑‑ she had her hands and she was trying to
post up. I think she just got kind of confused my face for my arm or
something. But just got a few elbows to the face in different places, but it
happens. Obviously, you saw I got a foul too in the game. We're two physical
teams.  
I think the great thing about the Pac‑12, and this season in particular, we're
playing and they're allowing us to play physical and push through. I think
that really helps us when we think about come later times in March.  
There are bumps and bruises. My face probably won't look the same tomorrow,
but I'll take it.  
  
Q. Is it cheek or nose?  
CHINEY OGWUMIKE: Little bit of both. But, I mean, it's okay.  
  
Q. Nnemkadi, you got clouded too, and it looked like you were having some
contact lens problems or something. What was going on?  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: Same story as Chiney, elbow to the face. Everything was
okay though. I was seeing double vision for two possessions, but I pushed
through that kind of stuff.  
CHINEY OGWUMIKE: That's why she could make her threes (laughing).  
  
Q. Amber, you had 13 points today. Very nice game. Does the game come any
easier with the excellent post teammates that you have?  
AMBER ORRANGE: I think it helps a lot. They get a lot of attention, so if they
can help off of me, I can look to be more aggressive defensively and look for
my shots. It's all about them.  
  
Q. Can you elaborate what it's been like? I know your season's not over, but
the last couple seasons being able to play with your sister and what you two
have been able to help the program do?  
CHINEY OGWUMIKE: I think her senior leadership is really special. That's what
I was saying. Someone asked me how does it feel to win a conference
championship tournament in the tournament? I said I think it's great. I think
the thing that really helps us is we have consistent senior leadership. When
your senior is playing as hard as she can, it's contagious. We had that last
year with Kayla and Jeanette, and the legacy started with Candice and those
before us.  
It's just really great, and to be able to say my sister is the one that's out
there, it's a really neat experience. I cherish it. I can't ask for a better
two seasons with her.  
So I know when we're old and sitting together and looking back, I'm going to
be like, man, that was perfect. We still have things to work on, but I'm
really enjoying this journey.  
  
Q. Were you really pushing her to shoot those threes?  
CHINEY OGWUMIKE: Oh, yeah. Oh, my gosh. I have to tell you guys this story. So
yesterday we were talking to Nnemkadi, and Nnemkadi shoots some pretty long
range shots. She air balled early in the game, but it doesn't matter to her.
She has quick memory whatever.  
But I told her yesterday, Nnemkadi, your foot's on the line sometimes, and
you're still trying the shot. When you realize your foot's behind the line
it's like, oh, it's a three. Oh, man. I said, okay, your three's going to
come. When it's low regulation, you're just going to have to shoot it, and
that's what she did. And I said, oh, the irony. I told you, I told you.  
Next play down she was looking calm and collected. And she was like, we ran a
play, and I had it on the wing, and she was like, ball. And I was like okay,
okay, and she shot it. I'm excited. She worked so hard in the off‑season.
Every day after practice she gets extra shots up.  
It shows how much‑‑ even some of the girls on Cal, everyone's game is
developing. That is the special thing about the Pac‑12, we keep working to get
better and better. The competition is getting higher and higher. It's a
testament to the great players and coaches and facilities and the people we
have.  
  
Q. We were wondering, do you think that Nnemkadi and Chiney are the best
post ‑tandem ever in women's college basketball? Who are they comparable to?
  
COACH VANDERVEER: We've had some great post players at Stanford. I don't
really like to compare. I would just say today I love coaching them. They're
doing a great job for us. I do think they have a special connection being
sisters.  
So even if had you two other great post players together, but if you just look
at the Pac‑12 at Pam and Paula McGee. I think they were pretty awesome.  
There have been great players over the past, and we're really fortunate to
have watched an excellent exhibition today from them. I enjoy coaching them,
but I'm not really good at comparing that stuff.  
We'll go back to the gym and have more to work on Monday. They're doing a
great job for us, but there is always more.  
  
Q. You played Connecticut this season. The other teams that are being
mentioned as presumptive 1 seeds would be Notre Dame and Baylor. You haven't
played them this season, but you did spend a fair amount of time with those
players with USA basketball this summer. Could you talk about basically how
you feel your team stacks up to those teams?  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: Every team has a different style. Obviously, come March
Madness, there is always talk about who should deserve what seed depending on
who they played or how they play or who they've lost to. I think we do a
really good job, and I'm not just saying this to say it. I think we do a
really good job of focusing on us. Granted there are standout teams.  
Baylor has Brittney Griner, Odyssey Sims. Notre Dame has Sky, Dev and Nat. As
Stanford women's basketball, we do a really good job of focusing on us.  
It's difficult for people to include us because of how far away we are. We're
three time zones away. But we try our best to take care of business here come
the tournament. Wherever we go, we'll play there. We'll play whoever. It's all
about having fun and living in the moment and enjoying ourselves on the court
and leaving it all on the floor.  
I think it's just about the Stanford culture tradition about what we're really
fighting for here together as a team.

_LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA_  
  

Stanford  77  
California  62

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, some opening remarks, please.  
COACH GOTTLIEB: Thanks all of you for being here and covering us. First thing
I'd like to do is congratulate Stanford. Such a terrific basketball program.
They do things the right way. They have great players. They're well coached,
and they deserve, obviously, this Pac‑12 Championship tonight. I said to
anyone who will listen, recently, the more film I watch, I'm more impressed
with Chiney and Nnemkadi. I think they may be the best on court ever in terms
of what they are relied on to do. And that's before Nnemkadi started hitting
threes from 30 feet. So obviously, all credit to them, we wish them well in
the NCAA Tournament.  
The second thing I'd like to thank the Pac‑12\. This has been a first‑class
event, and I really wanted our young women to come into this championship
game, which is something you earn. You don't get that opportunity very well
and really compete and give ourselves a chance to win and cut down nets. I
couldn't be more proud of our effort today. I thought that we did that.  
I think we represented ourselves and our university well. I have really
passionate players and talented players, and they're disappointed because they
want to win, and we didn't come here for second place. But I think the future
of our program is bright. I think we've got a really exciting couple weeks in
front of us. And I know this group will be back here and maybe we can do some
really special things down the road. We leave with our heads really high.  
  
Q. Can we talk about Nnemkadi in the face ‑up game? There were threes and
there were also shots that were inside the line. Talk about, did you expect
that from her? She's been hinting toward that, but she brought this out big
guns today.   
COACH GOTTLIEB: Yeah, as such a basketball junky, I've been following for
years. We played them in the NCAA Tournament her freshman year, my first year
in Santa Barbara, and I've been watching them since. The thing that's so
impressive is she's kept improving every single year. This year her face‑up
game has been really dynamic all along, and that allows Tara to do some things
with her.  
The first game at Maples, we got hit on that ball screen on the perimeter. Now
we learned to switch that and take that away, now they're bringing off her
stagger screens and almost playing her at the three, when they had Tinkle and
Chiney in there.  
So I think when you have the combination of sort of ridiculous athleticism,
skill, and then a will to get better, that's just a credit to her. Then
obviously, her coaching staff puts her in position to take away mismatches.  
I think it also speaks to their respect for our postgame, that they know their
best weapon with her against us is to face her up a little bit, maybe against
somebody else. To leave her on the block all game is a nice option to have
anyway.  
  
Q. Lindsay, I know you are a basketball junky. I'm curious about something.
ESPN and a lot of people have anointed Brittany Griner as the "Player of the
Year" in the United States. What do you think of Nnemkadi's chances of being
"Player of the Year"?   
COACH GOTTLIEB: I think if there's no Brittany Griner, it's a runaway, no
question about it. Obviously, the three of them, Nnemkadi and Brittany Griner.
They're all incredibly brilliant. They all have winning teams and they're all
transcendant in terms of their ability.  
So it's a pretty neat year for women's basketball in that sense. Having faced
Nnemkadi all these times, it's hard to say if there's anyone better. But I
also think Brittany Griner changes the game of basketball on the defensive end
and offensive end. So that's a really difficult question, so maybe I would
split my vote three ways.  
  
Q. Coach, what do you feel you're going to need to get over the hump to be
back on the championship side next year?  
COACH GOTTLIEB: We can be a lot better, which is fun. It's encouraging. The
first thing is obviously, sometimes we miss free throws and sometimes we turn
the ball over. I think the more chances we give ourselves to put points on the
board, the better we're going to be. We can play in that tempo.  
Stanford's a particularly tough match‑up for us because we score through the
post so much and we have an advantage there that kind of negates that a little
bit further. But I think as our players mature a little bit and take that next
step, I think our competitive fire is there.  
It's at an elite level. I think our depth and versatility is at an elite
level. I think the next step, talk about beating Top 10 teams is having all of
that come together on a consistent basis and maybe shoring up some of our
weaknesses.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about Sunday's ‑‑ last Sunday's game in relation to
today? Were you guys able to put that away or did any of that carry over?   
LAYSHIA CLARENDON: We definitely had to put it away or we wouldn't have to
then to where we are today. We put it in the back of our minds and scored it
in our bank a little bit as we went through the tournament knowing we've got
to beat Colorado. But if we want to get to Stanford, we have to beat
Washington State. Want to get back to Stanford and get this chance. I think
the biggest difference was just our fight and our toughness. Knowing that
we're going out with the fight we're going out with. No matter what, we're
going to hang our heads high. I don't think we could hang our head that's high
after last Sunday. We just kind of knew we didn't bring it all. So we just
brought all we could, and that's the way it goes.  
  
Q. Layshia, can you talk about the disappointing start you guys had? They
jumped on you 17 ‑4, and that's about the final margin of the game. You were
pretty competitive after that, but it put you in a hole.   
LAYSHIA CLARENDON: How exactly did they score? How were they scoring?  
COACH GOTTLIEB: They made a lot of shots early. We talked about getting stops
because I thought when we could get stops, we could play the way we wanted to
play. But we just didn't get enough stops early.  
LAYSHIA CLARENDON: I think any time you put yourself in a hole, it's hard to
dig yourself out. Even if you play even, you've already put yourself down. So
that was a tough start. But we solved that problem.  
COACH GOTTLIEB: The thing I'm proud of, if you look at the toughness category,
we had 23 offensive rebounds. We went to the free‑throw line 25 times. I think
it took‑‑ they had just an unbelievable super human performance from a player,
and the rest of them played the roles and that's what they do so well in their
program.  
But we thought the key was stops. We just didn't get any stops. I felt like
today we really wanted to focus on that, because we thought if we could grind
it out on the defensive end, we could play the way we wanted to play on the
offensive end. We didn't get enough stops.  
  
Q. Reshanda, Coach, can you talk about the wall they built in the paint?
Reshanda, you were going against it all day. Twenty three offensive rebounds,
you didn't get a lot out of it. But you stayed in character. You always talk
about being in character. You guys got in there in the paint, but it just
didn't pay off.  
RESHANDA GRAY: We just had to fight through it. We just had to be strong and
not worry about any calls or anything. Just do us and do what we do best.  
COACH GOTTLIEB: We made a conscious effort. I don't think any other two games
we made them work hard on defense. And we didn't want to be afraid of getting
the ball inside. They do a good job. I think Chiney and Nnemkadi can't foul.
They can't because they rely on them so much. They do a great job of staying
straight up. They allow a lot of contact sometimes, and our players are used
to having an advantage because we do against 95% of teams in the country
inside. I think that's where you'll see our growth and development.  
We have young post players that are so talented, and they're just continually
adding pieces to their game. You've got to do some things differently when you
have those two in there. So I credit their defensive effort.  
We knew to beat them we had to get easy post touches where we could in
transition and hit shots from the outside.  
  
Q. At the end of the game, particularly you two were especially energetic
and there was a lot of energy from the bench as far as we can do it. We can do
it. Let's go. Let's go. You guys never gave up one time. Where's that come
from?  
RESHANDA GRAY: Just us. Just us being together. We're a family. When we have
our heads down low we pick each other up. It's not the end for us. We've still
got the dance. We're going to go dancing, so we've just got to finish strong.  
LAYSHIA CLARENDON: If you watched us play all year, I was still believing.
With the last 3:00 minutes, you've seen us come back. Ohio State, Stanford the
first time. I was still like we just need something. Something to get us
going.  
You've got to fight till the end. Like Coach said, we're competitors. We're
going to go to the end. That's just who we are.  
  
Q. To clarify an early quote you had, "I think they might have the best
front court ever." Just want to clarify if you meant in the nation ever?
Pac‑12 ever? And if you could just talk about the two sisters?  
COACH GOTTLIEB: I'd love to actually engage someone in a debate with that. I'm
talking with my friends and stuff and saying let's go all the way back. Some
people have a better basketball history than I do. But who did Chamique play
with at Tennessee and that was that combination like?  
Even going back earlier to Katrina McClain, back in her day. But Charmin and I
were sitting at a high school recruiting event and saw Jenna Fraser, and we
asked her. She said Lisa Leslie and Katrina McClain were the Olympic team
posts. I said that's the Olympic team. I know Lisa Leslie and Tina Thompson
played together. I'm just kind of throwing that out there. But I'd of love for
someone to say these two were better. Some of that is circumstance. Some of
that is Chiney and Nnemkadi play 40 minutes most games when needed. They have
good guards, but they play through the post, so maybe that has something to do
with it.  
In other years, when you have Jane and say Nnemkadi when she's young, you also
had Candace and other people. I just think the way the performance, I'd like
to look at numbers of other front courts.  
I think they're really, really good. They're incredibly well‑coached. They're
relied on, and they've stepped up in those situations. It's not that my
statement is not to be a be all, end all, but it's fun to debate it and put it
out there.  
  
Q. How does this tournament prepare you for the NCAA coming up?  
COACH GOTTLIEB: Well, I think Tara says it all the time, the Pac‑12 you know
your opponents so well, it should prepare you for what you're going to face
next. I think we give them challenge that's make them better.  
On the flip side, I absolutely feel like the way we competed today should make
us even more dangerous in that tournament next weekend than we were coming
into this.  
We're not often faced with that type of post play, a team that's so well
prepared, a team that plays really hard. You want to raise each other up.  
I talked when I got the job about making Cal women's basketball one of the
elite programs in the country. I think there are a lot of pieces that go into
that. I think we're on the cusp of that. Absolutely having Stanford in our
backyard or across the bay is something that helps us from a mental standpoint
and a physical standpoint.  
If we bring this type of intensity and focus against whoever we're matched up
with, I think we can do some special things because Stanford poses problems
for us that we have to deal with that makes us better.  
LAYSHIA CLARENDON: Well said.  
  
Q. I know you can't read the selection committee's minds. But how high a
seed do you think you're going to get?  
COACH GOTTLIEB: Do I think we're going to get? Do I think we should get?  
  
Q. Both.  
COACH GOTTLIEB: First of all, our RPI is in the 20s. I hope it still is after
this. I haven't looked in a little while. I think the thing that's good about
the women's committee is they watch a lot of film and do the eye test thing. I
think we're a team that they should put, I don't know, six, seven. We want to
be off that eight, nine line because that's harder to deal with. And I think
we've earned that.  
We've clearly set ourselves as the second best team in the Pac‑12\. We've
challenged some of the top, top teams. We're going to be excited to go
wherever. It's so much about match‑ups. I'm not going to be too upset about it
if we're somewhere or a number that I didn't pick. But I think we've earned
something in that mid 20's RPI kind of range.  
  
Q. The season isn't over, but you have a lot of young players on your team.
How do you feel about your chances next year and in the conference and in the
tournament?  
COACH GOTTLIEB: Yeah, we're really looking forward to next weekend. We still
can do some special things this year. It's really neat to think that we have
everybody coming back, and we're only going to get better. I think the sky's
the limit for this group. They're so coachable. They want to be good. They're
committed to Cal basketball. They're committed to each other. I think that,
gosh, what we can do is really up to us, and that's a very, very fun prospect
to have in our heads.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=PACIFIC-12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 9, 2012

  

### [Chiney Ogwumike](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21930)

### [Nnemkadi Ogwumike](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20864)

### [Tara VanDerveer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14565)

  
_LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA_  
  

Stanford  52  
Arizona State  43

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, an opening statement, please?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I'm glad we're playing tomorrow. We really had to work hard.
We had to battle. I'm really proud of our whole team for staying with things
when it was very tough. When you shoot the way we shot, it makes it very
challenging. But I'm especially proud of Nnemkadi and Chiney because they
wouldn't let it slip through their fingers in anyway. They rebounded, both
have a double‑double. They scored. Their leadership was outstanding.  
Arizona State is an experienced, physical, and big team. They gave us all we
can handle, and I was really proud of how our team stepped up. We did a really
nice job from the free‑throw line.  
  
Q. Tara, you shot 4 for 26 in the second half.  
COACH VANDERVEER: I didn't take a shot. Yeah, our team.  
  
Q. Your players shot 4 for 26. The non ‑sisters shot 4 for 29 in the game.
Was it their defense? Entirely their defense, or what did you think? A bad
shooting night?   
COACH VANDERVEER: I think it was just chalk it up to a bad shooting game. You
could look at any number of different reasons. Sometimes you're not used to
playing in maybe an arena like this, and this is why it's great for us to have
a tournament here, being in an arena like this.  
I can't tell you if it was something in the waffles this morning or whatever
it could be.  
But some days you have games like that. And thankfully we were able to
overcome that with great rebounding. I thought excellent defense, kind of just
not getting discouraged. That is the leadership that we have next to me.  
  
Q. Are you concerned about the fact that you had to play three of the
players virtually then entire game and how that sets you up for the
championship tomorrow?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Maybe it's not ideal, but we have to do whatever it takes,
and that's what it took today. So you could have more people rested tomorrow
and you might not be playing tomorrow if that had happened.  
I feel that maybe we have to go to the bench a little earlier tomorrow. Give
Nnemkadi and Chiney a little more of a blow, get Sarah Boothe in there. I
thought she did really well in our first game. But when people come in, we
need them to contribute more.  
But I don't think Nnemkadi's not ever saying to me I need a rest. Chiney
doesn't say I need a rest. I try to give it to them. But they're big‑time
players and they can go. They're young. I can't do it, but they can do it.  
CHINEY OGWUMIKE: This is the fun time of the year.  
  
Q. It always sort of looks this way. Can you sort of talk about what it was
like out there today? They cut the lead and you guys being in a spot you
haven't been in in a few weeks, at least?  
CHINEY OGWUMIKE: I think ASU always plays aggressively. I'm really excited to
come out of this game with a W, because it taught us a lot of things. Being
able to communicate today was key, us being on the same page from the start to
the end. They're a very talented team. They're very athletic. Us being able to
handle that pressure is something that I don't think we could have done as
well last year, and we're just learning how to develop that this year too.  
I think it was a gritty game, but I'm proud of how Nnemkadi especially stepped
up with us and kept her poise. And how Amber and Toni really maintained the
leadership in the point guard position.  
Yeah, not too many turnovers, so that's great when you're playing against an
aggressive team. It was a good experience for us, especially this time in
March.  
  
Q. Nnemkadi, just talk about what led to the shooting woes. Obviously you
guys were 0 for 10 from three as well?  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: I think kind of the frenetic defense that ASU has might
kind of create a shoot it, shoot it, shoot it atmosphere when you do get the
ball. But we know what we're capable of from beyond the arc. This isn't a
typical day. But their defense definitely caused us to really figure out what
we needed to do on offense.  
I think taking it to the hole today was more effective than shooting on the
outside. However, when we do get those open shots, we've got to knock them
down. I have complete and total faith in all our guards.  
Lindy had a couple shots that both rolled out. I'm pretty sure Bonnie had
shots that rolled out too. So we're not concerned about that. We know what we
can do.  
  
Q. The year you were gone doing the Olympic team, you had to turn your team
over to other people, and that's a difficult thing to do. Can you comment a
little bit about how they were able to win 20 wins in this situation? Because
you've been through this before.  
COACH VANDERVEER: Well, you mean, as far as‑‑ I think Joseph and their staff
has done an excellent job. It's probably been hard for Charli to watch
sometimes. But I think she'll be refreshed and ready to come back.  
ASU has an excellent program. Just to have a head coach that has the
experience and the success that Charli's had, I think it's great their
administration gave her that leave of absence. I think she'll come back doing
it double time.  
We've always had a great rivalry with ASU, and this is no exception.

_LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA_  
  

California  64  
Washington State  49

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, a few opening comments, please.  
COACH DAUGHERTY: Just congratulations to the University of California. A great
year. Lindsay's really to be commended, taking over the program. Obviously her
players have really bought in. We wish them a long and very successful run in
the NCAA Tournament.  
Just really proud of our program. We took enormous steps. We've arrived as a
program in women's basketball again at Washington State. I couldn't be more
proud of my seniors, and obviously, my underclassmen here.  
I thought with about eight minutes to go, we kind of ran out of gas a little
bit, three games in three days. That's not anything against Cal. They have a
tremendous front line. They just keep coming at you with their five different
post players.  
But it was an exciting week. We learned a lot about ourselves, and we're just
going to build on this. But this was a great statement about Washington State
basketball and where we're at.  
  
Q. I know yesterday we talked about the three ‑point shots. But my question
to you, do you think because of the different arena settings from the Galen to
Staples kind of affected the shooting tonight as far as your three‑point
shots?   
COACH DAUGHERTY: You never know. If we could have gotten in and practiced a
little bit longer, could have, would have, should have. I think it's more of a
residual of three games in three nights for us. The fact that we had lost
three guard this is year. Early on we had the depth to keep rotating and keep
them a little bit fresher. You know, we didn't have that luxury here at the
tournament.  
Obviously without Ireti Amojo and Tia Presley being able to go. But our
players that were able to go, so amazing to watch them give every ounce that
they had.  
  
Q. Sage, what's it like trying to battle this Cal team on the boards? They
obviously excelled in rebounding. What is that experience like?  
SAGE ROMBERG: Obviously they're great rebounders. It was our big focus going
into the game. You just had to work hard and try to get them off. But they're
very athletic and can jump really high, so it was tough.  
  
Q. What was the biggest difference between this game and the game that you
played which you lost by five? And April, the kind of attacking defense and
your team's quickness, how did that affect Cal from what you could tell?  
APRIL COOK: I think we just tried to go out there and drive and kick and get
them moving around. That was our game plan going into it, so we can get open
for threes and just get to the basket and get fouled. So it was good in the
first half to us, but we just tried to get it done again in the second half,
but it was a little more difficult.  
COACH DAUGHERTY: I think playing Cal the second time around, the difference,
because you're right, it was a five‑point ballgame in Berkeley, and we
certainly felt like we had control of that game for a long period of time.  
But tonight I thought they really got out and challenged our shooters. They
were really up in Sage's grill. Same thing with Brandi Thomas, April Cook.  
I think that we could have maybe put it down and got to the hole a little bit
more, got to the free‑throw line.  
But to their credit, they made some very, very good adjustments, defensively,
according to our personnel. That's a little bit different than it was the
first time they played them just because of the emergence of our younger
players of the season.  
So great job by Lindsay. I thought our match‑up, you know, we turned them over
20‑some times and we gave ourselves an opportunity. But unfortunately, I think
that they were a lot more tenacious on the glass than maybe the first time we
played them, if that could be possible. They lead the country in offensive‑‑
defensive rebounding differential. That's going to win them a lot of
ballgames. It will continue to.  
Like I said earlier, I wish them all the best in the tournament.  
  
Q. Do you think Cal has a shot at Stanford? And what do they have to do to
be in that game and have a chance to win?  
COACH DAUGHERTY: Yeah, that's a great question. It's always that third time
game too. Playing someone for the third time. I think it's for Cal.  
But I think that they're going to have to play a lot harder on the glass
earlier. I think for 32 minutes we were right there. It seemed like the
high‑lows, they were really effective with the high‑low, and the isolation a
little bit with Boyd going to the basket. It just seemed like they just keep
bringing new fresh bodies in with their five front line players and keep it
fresh.  
But if they can rebound the way they did tonight with a plus‑25 differential,
they've got a chance. They've definitely got a chance, because they've
perimeter shooters that didn't shoot it tonight. That was a little bit of a
credit to us getting out on the shooters and playing the personnel that way.
We allowed them to get to the line off penetration more.  
But Lindsay's got some real good three‑point shooters over in the wings that
didn't get a lot of looks tonight that might be getting some good looks
tomorrow night.  
  
Q. What do you think this kind of a run maybe could do, if anything, as far
as more postseason play for you guys?  
COACH DAUGHERTY: I think that it's more the confidence that we have now that
we know that we can play at a very, very high level. We knew that in the
preseason, playing the strength of schedule that we played and all the road
games that we played, and now they're conference winners, whether it's San
Diego State, Penn State, the list goes on and on. Louisville was a tough game,
Gonzaga. I don't think they won their league or maybe won their league but
lost the tournament, and Ohio State and all of those.  
So we knew early on we could play with anybody in the country, and we knew we
were very, very close. Obviously, we went through some adversity with the
injuries. But to our kids' credit, our seniors kept leading, and our young
kids kept stepping up, accepting the new responsibility, the new roles of the
playing time that they had, and that's the big reason, that combination and
leadership with the seniors and the underclassmen improving, why we were where
we were at today.  
It's a great motivator. They're already talking in the locker room about next
year, and that's a great sign.  
  
Q. April, can you talk about what it means to you to have gone through the
adversity after the injuries and everything and then to come back and make
this kind of run with your team at the end of the season?  
APRIL COOK: It was hard when Ireti and Tia got hurt, and then I was out for a
couple days with my back. But I'm just proud to be part of a group who really
changed the program. We came in here. We had a job to do, and we got as far as
we could.  
Even through the adversity, like June was saying, our underclassmen stepped up
big time like Sage and Brandi Thomas. Everybody just played their role, and we
got all the way here.  
  
Q. What is different today now as you guys leave this arena after a couple
games into this tournament now? What is different?  
COACH DAUGHERTY: Cougs are here. We're back in women's basketball. It's going
to help us, obviously, with the super motivation, the confidence for the
returners. We have six very, very good signees coming into the program. I know
from the text messages and phone calls I got in the last three days and a
couple were here, they're really proud to be joining this program. They want
to take it to the next step. They want to be in that final game. It's
obviously going to continue to help us in recruiting.  
Being on national TV and playing as well as we did at times, it's a great
statement of the style of play, and what kind of neat teammates you'd have
coming to Washington State to play with. It's all really, really positive.
Like I said, a great statement for our program, and a great motivator.  
  
Q. April and Sage, what kind of feedback have you and your teammates
received from other players in the conference or maybe back home from what you
guys have been doing the last couple of days?  
SAGE ROMBERG: The Cougs are always supporting us, but I think they're very
excited for us that we got this far and made it to the Staples Center. I mean,
the Cougs are always there to support us either way.  
APRIL COOK: We've gotten a lot of support back at home. I heard that they put
our game on the big screen in Beasley for everybody to watch. So everybody's
really proud of us at home. And a lot of the other teams in the Pac‑12
congratulated us and showed us a lot of respect.  
  
Q. April, they had a ton of Southern California players on the team. Did you
know many of them or play against them?  
APRIL COOK: Oh, yeah, yeah. I've been playing against Eliza Pierre, and
Layshia Clarendon and some of the big kids for a long time, since AAU. We all
know each other. Before we were all buddy, buddy, but during the game, it's a
war. They already know. But everything's good with them. We're all friends
(smiling).  
  
Q. I heard that you guys went swimming last night? Can you talk a little bit
about that?  
COACH DAUGHERTY: I wasn't in the pool. I was in the film room. You guys have
to fess up.  
SAGE ROMBERG: We were in there. After ten minutes we were supposed to get in
the pool, and our staff decided they wanted to jump in.  
  
Q. They had no suits on?  
APRIL COOK: No.  
  
Q. Was that a bet or anything?  
SAGE ROMBERG: No, we were just excited.  
COACH DAUGHERTY: Thank you to the Pac‑12 and the media. We've really
appreciated all the hospitality. It's been a wonderful experience. Thanks for
your coverage as well.

_LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA_  
  

California  64  
Washington State  49

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, some opening remarks, please?  
COACH GOTTLIEB: Thank you. Thank you all for being here. Your coverage is
really important to us. First thing I'd like to do is credit a Washington
State team that not only gave us an absolute battle today but has had a
terrific run in the tournament.  
June Daugherty is one of the people in coaching that's reached out to me
personally and been a mentor, but also does so many good things for the
women's game. I think that group of seniors that went to Washington State
maybe before that was something that you were supposed to do is pretty
impressive.  
Jazmine Perkins is a Berkeley kid and April Cook. I just really commend them
on finishing their careers. And their impact that they're going to have on
that program is really lasting. So just wanted to say that first.  
Very excited to be coaching our group tomorrow in the championship game. I
thought we responded really well coming out of the halftime. I asked them to
get a little tougher or a lot tougher on the defensive end and to be more
patient at the same time on the offensive end. I thought shooting 58% in the
second half and getting some critical stops, they really did that.  
We're really good when we're playing with a lot of energy, and I thought in a
very short prep for Washington State, we were able to take away some of their
looks. Our big players made plays. Brittany and Gen in particular really like
space. They like to make plays in space, and they found those gaps.  
When I see a look in both of their eyes, sometimes it's a toughness look, and
sometimes it's a smile. But when I know they're right there locked in, we're
tough to beat.  
So I thought it was a really good team effort today. Second day in a row, we
had four people in double figures, and just excited to be representing the
University of California in the championship game tomorrow.  
  
Q. Lindsay, can you talk about the match ‑up with Stanford? You've led them
twice this year, and you took them to overtime once, and they got you pretty
good the other time. What do you have to do to be in that game tomorrow?   
COACH GOTTLIEB: I don't get to enjoy it for 30 seconds before talking about
Stanford? They're so good. They're really a terrific basketball team. I
thought at their place I thought we were able to kind of control the tempo and
maybe at times get them back on their heels and be the aggressors.  
At our place, they came out and shot the ball so well. When you have the best
post players in the country and then you're going to knock down shots, it gave
them some separation that kind of put us in desperation mode a little bit.  
So hopefully, we can come out, get stops early, and control the tempo of the
game a little bit better. I certainly have some good film to look at from a
week ago, and we will be better. I just think they're a terrific team, but I
think our players are real competitors and we're going to make some
adjustments and hopefully come out and do a lot of things better tomorrow.  
  
Q. What does your rebounding differential equate to in this game? Did that
margin enable you to cancel out the 25 turnovers? Did the rebounding advantage
please you as much as the turnovers displeased you?  
COACH GOTTLIEB: I think it's a real luxury as a coach to be able to look at
them in March and say the rebounding thing is part of our identity. That
people aren't going to be able to game plan for that. When you come into a
win‑or‑go‑home game and say do what we do on the boards, that's a real factor
for us.  
Obviously, making a lot of shots on our end and holding them to a low
percentage is going to help that differential. They only had 17 defensive
rebounds partly that's because we shot a high percentage, but partly because
we're giving 17 offensive rebounds, giving ourselves second chances.  
That's become part of what we do. If you break down and analyze our team, it's
one of the reasons that we win a lot of games. I don't think any of us,
especially not Brittany over there, is happy about the 25 turnovers. But I
think you can handle something like that when we're able to limit them to one
shot and get multiple attempts on the other end.  
  
Q. Talia, for some reason it seemed like Washington was making a run and all
of the sudden you started going to her and she threw three baskets in a row.
Tell me about that?  
COACH GOTTLIEB: Yeah, Talia, we really trust our entire post group. When you
can bring in four different people, sometimes they match up differently,
sometimes can you put them in different situations, but we made a concerted
effort in the second half to get the ball inside until they did a great job of
keeping them on her high side. Brittany found her a couple times on those lob
plays and she finished.  
It's not something that we don't expect, and that's a good feeling. But she
really finished it, and I thought Reshanda came in and made some critical ones
as well. But we want to go inside.  
Obviously Washington State's defense tries to extend you, and you can do that
off the bounce. Brittany and Layshia and Eliza are picking them apart that
way, or you can do it straight off post‑entry passes; and we just look to do
that in a concerted‑effort kind of way coming out of the locker room at
halftime.  
  
Q. Coach, you more than doubled them in rebounds and then there were the
turnovers and they doubled you in steals. A lot of that can be fixed
emotionally. Do you have one or two emotional leaders, or was there one today,
if you didn't have one? And what is that single season rebounding record that
Gennifer just broke?  
COACH GOTTLIEB: What are the numbers? Ashley Walker had 317 a couple years
back, and Gen got 319. Just to speak to that for a minute, Ashley, I still
talk to Ashley all the time. She's one of my favorite people and players of
all time. But she probably played 38 minutes a game that year. I think it
speaks to the depth of our team. Our players just want to win games.  
Gen plays 25 minutes and she's going to try to be as productive in those
minutes. She's an absolute monster on the glass. When she wants to do that, I
don't know if there's anyone that can keep her away from doing that. So I
think it's a pretty remarkable stat given the depth that we have, and that
everyone's willingness to play whatever role we ask them to play.  
The emotional leader thing, I think we have a really neat balance on our team
of youthful energy, swagger, sometimes not knowing exactly what's supposed to
happen next, in a good way and veteran calmer players.  
So I think at different times we need different things. No one on our team
wants to turn the ball over there. They're really competitive. And Washington
State, that's their defense. They do that. I think it was really collective
thing that we decided we have to be more patient on offense, but be tougher
and not turn the ball over anymore.  
Obviously, Brittany kick starts that with us. This is the type of game we need
the ball in her hands because of her decision making ability. And other people
play different defenses and we want Layshia because she's a kind of steady
presence as well. So we feel like we have multiple people with the ball in
their hands that we feel very confident with.  
  
Q. Gennifer, what makes a good rebounder and why do you excel so much in
that aspect of your game?  
GENNIFER BRANDON: I would say the main thing that makes me a good rebounder is
a person's determination to want the ball for their team. Yeah, that's about
it. Just determination to go get the ball. Like some people are good with just
jumping and snatching it, and some people use techniques like boxing out. So
it's determination and hard working to after the ball in any way you can.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little more about Washington State team that you faced
today? They came in after making an incredible run this weekend. Did you see
that they had more confidence than when you played with them during the season
or were they the same team?  
BRITTANY BOYD: I think they were kind of more the same team. But as they got
into the tournament, I feel like their confidence went up a little because
they were a winning team. And their energy level, I have to respect their
energy level and how they came out at halftime and before the game. So I just
think that their confidence was really high.  
GENNIFER BRANDON: Piggy backing off what she said, Pac‑12, the Tournament, I
don't think any team would be the same team because they're more determined
and they know they only get one chance. If they don't get it, then they're
knocked out.  
So every team comes in with this fiery determination to want to win something,
I guess, bigger than the Pac‑12 conference, regular season conference.  
  
Q. There were great expectations for your junior and senior class, one of
the top recruiting classes in the country. To some degree they underperformed
expectations for a couple years. Not that they did badly, just not as well as
they could. Now you've gone through a coaching change. You're first year as
head coach of this program, lost one of your key players, and you've brought
them to a whole new level in terms of performance being here in the finals.
Can you talk about what, if you were to point to two or three things that were
the dynamic that caused this team to gel and perform at this level?  
COACH GOTTLIEB: Yeah, when I was hired in the spring, I met with each of them
individually, not really talking about skill sets or X's and O's, just to
spend time with them. Almost to a person in their different ways with
different personalities, they said we want to cheer for each other. We want to
be great. We want to do things that special teams do. I knew right then that
my job was just to take an incredibly talented and passionate group of
individuals and hopefully get them to where they want to be as a collective
unit.  
And we did work on that. In the fall we spent a lot of time on what we call
our core foundation. Who we are, what we do, how we go about doing it, so that
when January and February came, we could say‑‑ let's say we lost the game, we
need to play better transition defense, or we need to set better screens. Not
who are we and what are we about?  
They have bought into that. They love each other. They love being around each
other. They have great energy. They play really hard. I think sometimes that
kind of thing maybe transcends just a group of talented players.  
In addition to that, and I was very aware of how they did in the past. We have
more depth this year. We have a true point guard. Eliza and Layshia were
playing a lot on the ball last year. Now I can move them off the ball from a
technical standpoint. And Gennifer Brandon didn't play last year and there
wasn't a four post presentation.  
So from a tactical spot I like our pieces. From an emotional spot, this team
was ready to gel and just be better than what they might be able to show with
accolades from high school.  
  
Q. Brittany, Gen had her stat and record, but you were one assist away from
a triple ‑double. So across the line there, which of those categories were you
most proud of for this game?   
BRITTANY BOYD: I would have to say my assists because I like feeding the ball
to the post and the wings. But the ratio right now, the 9 to 8 is not really
what I'm happy about. But I would have to say my assists overall. So, yeah.  
COACH GOTTLIEB: We're going to look through that film and find the one assist
that should have been, and feel have Brittany duke it out with that person.  
  
Q. Brittany and Gennifer, can you talk about what you guys feel like you
need to do better than the last time you played Stanford to get over the hump
against them?  
BRITTANY BOYD: Yeah, I just think it's focusing in and doing the coach's game
plan and following and trusting in their game plan. Just playing hard. It's
the championship, and I believe that we're going to bring it and Stanford's
going to bring it. So just play hard. Yeah, go on with the game plan and
focusing in.  
GENNIFER BRANDON: Yeah, I would say we need to stay together and work hard,
like Brittany was saying and follow the scouting report that the coaches give
us, because they're obviously intelligent or they wouldn't have the job that
they have. So, yeah, just stay together and work hard for the common goal.  
  
Q. Do you have confidence that you can beat them?  
GENNIFER BRANDON: Heck, yeah. I don't know about the Lakers, but, yeah.  
  
Q. Gennifer, can you explain why you make those little alterations to your
uniform, what that means, the shoulder and the tag?  
GENNIFER BRANDON: It's a fashion statement. Just kidding. I do it just to be
comfortable in my uniform. Yeah, I don't know. It's just to be comfortable. I
roll my shorts because I don't like them to touch my knees. I roll my‑‑ I just
don't like to feel clothes, if that doesn't sound weird, but, yeah. I try to
fold it tight as I can to feel like I'm running with the wind.  
  
Q. Running with the wind?  
GENNIFER BRANDON: Yeah (laughing).  
  
Q. Your coach talked about one of the first things you did was finding your
identity. I'd like to ask the players, who is or are Cal basketball?  
BRITTANY BOYD: Who is? We are.  
COACH GOTTLIEB: Like some characteristics, maybe.  
BRITTANY BOYD: Confident. I would say we're a very confident team. Relentless.
It's a lot to describe. It's hard to choose one word or a couple words. There
are a lot of things to describe us, because we all bring in different things
and we all share different personalities. So it's a lot. But it's all
positive, yes.  
GENNIFER BRANDON: Yeah, I would say relentlessness, like Brittany. Just
staying as a family, working together. Never back down or give up. That's
about it, yeah.

_LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA_  
  

Stanford  52  
Arizona State  43

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, an opening statement, please?  
COACH ANDERS: Great ballgame. Very, very proud of my team. To battle the
number two team in the nation to the last two minutes of the ballgame and just
allowed them to be able to get far too many rebounds through the course of the
ballgame.  
But if there was a championship given for heart and for courage, then this
basketball team would absolutely get that championship. I could not be more
proud of a group of young ladies for the way in which they have embraced me in
the interim capacity and allowed us to go for our dreams and to step up to
this particular stage and to represent themselves, represent their families,
represent our university and our brand in the way that they did.  
  
Q. Coach, I know it's small consolation, but you nearly held Stanford to the
lowest points in a victory that they've ever had. Can you talk a little bit
about what your game plan was on the defense and exactly how you felt the team
executed it?  
COACH ANDERS: Well, what we wanted to do was to pressure the basketball and to
make it difficult for them to be able to get the ball to the two sisters. We
were able to do that and actually put their guards back on their heels. They
were able to get a little bit more dribble penetration than we wanted them to.  
But, again, there were different phases of the ballgame where we actually went
to a kind of a desert‑swarm type of a defense where we wanted to go after
every pass that went into Nnemkadi. We were able to get her somewhat into a
little disjointed with that.  
But as we did that and they were able to slip other players to the basket for
those rebounds. But, again, my guards, my posts, Kali in particular, being
able to step out when people were able to break us down and just continue to
play our brand of defense. Great effort.  
  
Q. In a bigger sense, how much did you feel a sense of transition with Coach
Anders, and how much do you have to transition back when Coach Thorne comes
back that few weeks?  
JANAE FULCHER: Joe's been on our staff since the time we've been here, so it
wasn't too big of a transition. I guess for the new players it would be more
of a transition to go back. But in regards to me, I've been under Charli, and
Joseph as a post coach has been overseeing the post.  
So I've been with him since I've been here. So I don't think it's going to be
too hard to transition back.  
  
Q. What were they doing to Kimberly to hold her scoreless?  
COACH ANDERS: Well, physical. Kimberly just being sleight of build, whenever
we've had a physical ballgame, then it's been really difficult for her to
match‑up just with the physicality of the game, and they were able to get in
her head in terms of just the mentality, and it kind of took us out of what we
wanted to do.  
Again, very grateful for Jada Blackwell as well as Janae being able to come in
at that particular time and just continue to push her effort forward. But it
was the physicality of the game that was the difference for Kim.  
  
Q. When you were down by 14 at halftime, can you talk about what you
discussed at halftime and how you were able to kind of stay composed in that
period until you got it down under 10 points?  
COACH ANDERS: I talked about the movie, The Replacements, and Coach McGinty
and heart‑‑ (laughing). Just joking. No, we talked about, again, taking it one
possession at a time. We talked about making sure that we put everything into
every tick that we absolutely could possibly do.  
We talked about making sure that for the next 20 minutes, that we made as much
noise as we could with our effort, with our courage, and with our heart. And I
would say that we did that.  
  
Q. Coach, you held Stanford to four field goals in the second half, which I
think is quite remarkable. If you have any comment on that, I'd be interested.
I'd also be interested to know what your thoughts are in the postseason for
the team?  
COACH ANDERS: Our identity has always been wrapped into our defensive side of
the ball. This year we've been able to hold seven teams below 20 points below
what they have averaged over the course of this year. We were able today to
hold Stanford 25 points below what they averaged this year.  
Absolutely, I believe that this team belongs in the dance. I believe that from
the beginning of the season to now, we've represented what it means to be one
of those premier teams, one of those teams that have worked to position
themselves for postseason play. I just feel like we've earned that
opportunity.  
  
Q. You had some success knocking the sisters around. Kind of talk about
getting in there and mixing it up with them?  
KALI BENNETT: I mean they're both very physical players. I think I'm a very
strong person, so I take that to my advantage. Our goal in the game was if we
couldn't get the rebound, make sure they didn't get the rebound.  
So I really tried to focus on that and get box outs. Clearly I didn't get that
many rebounds. But I think I held them from getting some opportunities, sa I
took what I could get.  
  
Q. I'm wondering whether Coach Turner Thorne had any messages or words for
the team before this game or whether she just wanted to leave it completely to
you at this point?  
COACH ANDERS: I always hear from her after a ballgame. She text me yesterday
to say good luck. Now you've got a chance to go for the big ticket game.  
  
Q. Joseph was just saying that he feels like you guys are deserving of an
NCAA berth. How do you feel about that? How difficult will it be to do WNIT if
that doesn't come?  
JANAE FULCHER: Obviously want to get to the big dance, but we're happy with‑‑
not necessarily ecstatic, but we still want to be playing in the postseason.
So if it's not the NCAA Tournament, then we'll take the NIT. We just want to
continue playing after season. So we just want to take it out for the long
ride.  
KALI BENNETT: I think that we've shown that we can play with any team. I mean,
preseason we were neck and neck with Rutgers the whole time. Stanford, we
always played them close. We dropped a couple games this year, but I feel like
overall we're a team that's defense separates us from most. So I feel like if
we could bring that to the tournament, it would be beneficial to all.

_NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE_  
  

Tennessee  70  
LSU  58

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Tennessee coach Holly Warlick, Shekinna
Stricklen and Glory Johnson.  
Coach, if you could start us off.  
COACH WARLICK: It's just an awesome feeling. I'm so happy for these young
ladies and our entire team. About two, three weeks ago we went back to work.
We went to work and worked pretty hard. These young ladies bought into what we
needed to do.  
It was a great win for us today. My hat's off to Nikki and her team. They
didn't go away, they just wouldn't go away. You know, as excited as I am for
us, I felt bad for Nikki because of our friendship. But she's done a heck of a
job.  
Elated and proud. These guys, they're awesome. They deserve all the credit.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Glory and Shekinna, this is a routine for you guys, winning a third
straight SEC tournament championship. Does this one mean a little more because
of what you've gone through this year?  
GLORY JOHNSON: Yeah, a lot of people don't expect a lot out of us just because
of how many losses we have and who we lost to. We want to show people we
haven't stopped working, work on the little things, trying to make a statement
really.  
SHEKINNA STRICKLEN: Like what she said. We had our ups and downs and
struggles. But this tournament proved a point, that this team is still
together and we're going to keep working hard. We're not giving up.  
We know a lot of people is down on us, not thinking we're going to make it
far. I think we're just going to go back to work and then go back to work.  
  
Q. Coach and Shekinna, could either of you explain the difference in halves
for Shekinna?  
COACH WARLICK: Nikki coaches the first half, I coach the second (laughter).  
I would love for her to show up for 40 minutes. I don't know. You answer that.
I can't answer that.  
SHEKINNA STRICKLEN: I think I'm just thinking too much starting the first
half. I think I always start the game tense. I overthink because I want to
come out strong. I think I'm overthinking, overdoing it. It takes me a while
to relax. Once I relax, I get it going in the second half.  
  
Q. Glory, y'all kind of held onto the boards, didn't convert as many second
chances as you might have wanted.  
GLORY JOHNSON: Coach always emphasizes crashing the boards on the offensive
and defensive end. LSU does a great job of crashing the boards and their
defense is amazing. We just tried to keep up with them, making sure if they're
going to play good defense, we're going play good defense. If they're going to
crash the boards, we're going to crash.  
That was our mentality and we held that throughout the game. It was huge for
us.  
  
Q. For the players, can you describe how cool it was, just the atmosphere,
watching Coach Summitt cut down the net, everyone in the crowd yelling?  
GLORY JOHNSON: It's great. It's one thing doing it for ourselves, our
families, our fans, for God. But Pat has been through so much. We want to let
her know we're willing to work for her, go to bat for her.  
To see her cut that down is amazing. That's what we've been working for. She
deserves it.  
SHEKINNA STRICKLEN: I totally agree with her. I mean, we was so excited when I
saw her get up there and cut the net.  
Did she cut it last year? I don't think she did last year.  
We just all looked at each other and started screaming thinking, Wow, she's
about to cut it! Nobody deserves it better than our coach. We just gonna keep
working hard every day for her.  
  
Q. In the three tournament games, do you think this was the best stretch of
games in terms of both defense and toughness that your team demonstrated?  
COACH WARLICK: I think the key word for us is 'toughness'. We've lacked that
throughout the year. To play three hard games, and we battled. When we needed
stops, when we needed rebounds, we got 'em.  
It was a great team effort. I know these two had great tournament play. But I
was proud of Vicki Baugh, how she played. I was proud of Kamiko today with her
defensive stops.  
It has been a mental toughness for us. We've been trying to really focus and
take one game at a time. I thought in this tournament we did that. We didn't
look ahead and we just took play‑by‑play. We wanted to get each possession. We
didn't want to have a wasted possession, especially on the offensive end, and
we needed defensive stops.  
I think when our back is against the wall, these ladies had a toughness that
we haven't had in a long time. It showed in the three games we played.  
  
Q. Holly, you mentioned Kamiko. She looks like a defensive specialist. She
hadn't played very much the last couple games in this tournament, then she
comes in today cold and got some big stops. How crucial was that? Is it unique
she's able to step in there when you need her like that?  
COACH WARLICK: I think it's the strength of our team, what type of players we
have. We started so many different lineups this year. Tonight we needed
Kamiko. We needed her on the defensive end. We weren't getting stops.  
I think she was the only one that didn't play the first half. I'm not sure, I
haven't seen the stats. But she has such ability to take over the game on the
defensive end. So she had two crucial stops, as you said. That's what is so
unique about this team: anybody can step up and contribute.  
That's what we're trying for them to buy into. It's a team effort. I think
this tournament, they did that.  
  
Q. Holly, when the buzzer sounded, Glory was on the floor fighting for a
loose ball. Talk about the irony associated with that.  
COACH WARLICK: I keep saying, every game, I don't think she can take it to
another level, and she keeps taking it to another level. That's just her
nature. She's competitive. I absolutely love that about Glory. It's in her
spirit, it's in her DNA. It is what makes her game special.  
I wasn't surprised. I was not surprised. I probably didn't want her to do that
because I was afraid she might get hurt. It's hard to hold back.  
We're trying to get 'em to move forward, and it's really hard to pull 'em
back. I'm not going to pull Glory back at all (laughter).  
  
Q. Glory, every year seniors talk about this thing kicking in, the reality
that there's not that many games left. It seems like it's kicked in for you.
Talk about that.  
GLORY JOHNSON: I try to remind the rest of the seniors that every day we get
on the floor it might be our last. We never know when our last game is going
to be. We always emphasize playing as hard as you can whenever you step on the
floor. That's huge for us, especially now that we're seniors.  
You should see a whole new mentality when we get out there. We have a whole
new mindset. You should see it in our faces every time we step on the floor.  
  
Q. Holly, every time LSU made a late charge towards the end of the game, it
seemed Shekinna or Glory made the big shots. Is that something you've come to
expect?  
COACH WARLICK: Absolutely. Great players make great plays. The timeout we
called, we ran the play to Shekinna, and she made the basket. I mean, you can
draw up all you want, but, as I say, great players make great plays.  
She hit the three. That's what they do. Glory comes up with the big rebounds.
That's what we have to have at the end. It's through their leadership that we
keep getting better and better. Our younger players and the players who may
not play a lot understand what hard work is all about, what we need to come up
with big stops, make big plays.  
Absolutely, we count on these young ladies to do that. They've been in that
situation time after time again and they keep coming up with big plays. As
coaches, we'd be kind of crazy not to go to who got you there. That's what we
wanted to do today.  
  
Q. Holly, the players shared their thoughts with seeing Coach Summitt at the
end. You're in a unique position. What are your emotions when you see
everything going on from the spot you're in?  
COACH WARLICK: Well, Coach Summitt is still my boss. She still contributes
every day. I told these ladies, it's an honor to coach them and it's an honor
to coach beside Pat Summitt because of what she's done.  
We just approach every day and every practice and every game as it's a group
effort. It's a group effort from our staff. Our entire staff, Dean, Mickie,
Pat. I've been fortunate enough to have them behind me helping me make
decisions.  
It continues to be an honor to coach with Coach Summitt. The only thing I'll
tell you is she's got to learn to cut nets down a little bit better. She
chewed the net up so bad, I don't think we can put it around the trophy
(laughter).  
But Pat is Pat. She wanted us to go up there. See, this year I broke my hand
coming downstairs off a plane. Pat is the only healthy one that can climb up
on a ladder. We told her to have at it.  
Just proud of Pat and how she stayed focused and what she's meant to this
team.  
  
Q. Holly, did you get a chance to talk to Nikki after the game?  
COACH WARLICK: Last night I texted her and I told her I hope her water broke
last night so she wouldn't be on the court. She texted me that it did and she
had a little point guard ready to play (laughter).  
No, Nikki and I have a great friendship. We just saw each other out there and
said, you know, we loved each other and that I will help do anything to help
her, and she'll help Tennessee, as well, as we go down this process.  
As you're great friends, for 40 minutes you're competing. Nikki and I are both
competitors. That's the nature of this game. We coach against a lot of people.
But obviously Nikki is one of my best friends. So excited for us. Sorry for
her. There's going to be a lot more of those to come, so...  
  
Q. This tournament just ended, but have you thought at any time about
possible seeding in the tournament to come, as to where you might stand?  
COACH WARLICK: You know, I'm just happy we won tonight. I haven't even thought
past that today. I would think it would help our seeding as we went through
and people had gotten upset.  
We just wanted to make sure that we had a great showing for us. We played
Tennessee basketball. I think we did that.  
It's out of our hands. We can't do anything about the seeding. I don't know.
We've been seeded No.1 and I thought we've not got a good seeding. I just hope
that, you know, we get matched up against some teams that we match up well
against.  
I'm proud of these young ladies and I think they've put themselves in a great
position for the tournament.  
  
Q. Glory, did you get any sense when the injury happened to LaSondra, did
you get a sense that was happening?  
GLORY JOHNSON: I think me and Shekinna both realized. I think she caught my
knee. She was laying down. I think she missed a layup when Vicki blocked it.
Right when she was getting up, I tried to run past and Alicia Manning slid
this way and I slid that way. I think she caught the outside of my knee.  
But she's a great player. I grew up playing with her. Me and Shekinna grew up
playing with her. I think she'll be all right. But we'll keep praying for her.
I'll probably text her or call her later on, but I hope she's okay.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. Congratulations.

_NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE_  
  

Tennessee  70  
LSU  58

  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by LSU head coach Nikki Caldwell, Courtney Jones
and Adrienne Webb.  
Coach, if you could start us off.  
COACH CALDWELL: Well, first off, I'm proud of this group. I can't tell you
enough how much this group has been hit with adversity, and even tonight they
were hit with a little adversity.  
I saw fight in them. I saw a team that stuck together. Even though the outcome
didn't come out our way, much credit to the Tennessee team. But this team has
grown a lot over the last couple days. It's going to only help them in
post‑season.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Can you give us an update on what you know about LaSondra's condition?  
COACH CALDWELL: All I know is that we're going to make sure that our trainer
is with her. They're going to monitor her and make sure she's okay. I know she
went down pretty hard. We're just going to, you know, keep playing and making
sure that everything is going to be okay.  
But we're definitely going to take every necessary precaution to make sure
that she is okay.  
  
Q. For the players, you guys are in a really tough fight out there,
everything is real competitive, then something like that happens. How hard is
it to come back, especially after you have to stand in the huddle for five or
ten minutes?  
ADRIENNE WEBB: We could have easily folded after LaSondra went down. But we
took it as a challenge, to not go out there and quit, but give it our all, put
our hearts into the game.  
Even though we fell short, we still played a hundred percent and gave our all
out there on the floor.  
  
Q. Courtney, yesterday we were asking you about filling in for LaSondra when
she went out with foul trouble. Talk about filling in for her. Were you
distracted? Was your concentration affected for a time period at all?  
COURTNEY JONES: I don't think so. Of course, LaSondra, you're always going to
worry about her health, if she's going to be able to get back with us. We just
took a little grace period to get ourself, evaluated what we needed to do on
defense and offense, tried to execute coach's plan as great as we could, so...  
  
Q. Can you put in perspective what you have done, especially over the course
of the last nine to ten games, the way this team came together, how well you
feel you can play in the NCAA tournament?  
COACH CALDWELL: I feel like this team has shown that they cannot only play
with some of the best teams in the country, but we've beaten some of the
top‑ranked teams in this country.  
This team has a uniqueness about them. We talk about whenever there's a
setback, there's a comeback. This group has shown it time and time again. We
got a lot more basketball in us. We got a team that is starving to advance one
game at a time.  
But as we reflect over the last month, six to eight weeks, this team has grown
so much, tremendously. They've matured. They've become closer in the sense of
not just cooperating with each other, but collaborating with each other. So
they've already taken it to another notch.  
We've got players that can make plays. When you get into post‑season, you're
going to need everybody to contribute. Tonight I saw a team that played with a
lot of heart and a lot of courage.  
  
Q. Coach and the players, how tough was it to stop Glory and Shekinna?  
COACH CALDWELL: You have two very skilled basketball players. I thought our
players matched their intensity. I felt like we missed some defensive
assignments on some screening action. But, you know, this group did an amazing
job considering.  
Even though, again, you play a team like a Tennessee, they've got two very,
very good players, I felt like our team played very courageous. I can't
explain that because you know their accolades, you know what they're capable
of. But I never felt like we backed down from either one of them. This is
something they both can carry with them.  
THE MODERATOR: Same question to the players.  
ADRIENNE WEBB: They're both tough opponents to compete against. Our coach said
we missed a few defensive assignments coming off screens and box outs where
they got a majority of their points from.  
We need to work on just establishing our defense, letting it be known that we
do box out, we do crash the boards, and that we take pride in doing that.  
COURTNEY JONES: I think with any team, you have top players on each team. You
shouldn't let that stop you from, you know, going your max, giving it your
all.  
Glory Johnson, Vicki Baugh, that Shekinna are all great players. That's just
their game and you have to match their intensity.  
  
Q. For the players, I want to know what it is that Coach Caldwell has been
able to bring to y'all to give you the confidence and composure to play the
way you did in in SEC tournament?  
COURTNEY JONES: One thing that Coach Caldwell does for me is get me to believe
that I can excel in my full potential as a player and as a person, that you
should never be satisfied with what you are doing, what you have done.  
Just go out and have confidence in yourself and belief in yourself that you
can do whatever it is you want to do.  
ADRIENNE WEBB: For me, coach has instilled in me to also go out there and do
my best in everything I do. Luckily we have the rest of this tournament and I
also have another year with coach. She's still teaching me things that I may
encounter in the real world after college.  
  
Q. Coach, you came into this tournament on a pretty good streak. At that
point you already looked like you were set to host your tournament and play in
it. How do you think the performance this week might have affected your
seeding or the momentum going in?  
COACH CALDWELL: Each game was a game to help prepare for NCAAs. We really
focused in on, you know, again, sliding our name one more time across the
board and hopefully being the last name up there. We didn't really worry too
much about where we'd be seeded.  
This team has really been focused on one game at a time. I think that's why
we've been able to string along back‑to‑back‑to‑back wins. As soon as we win,
we leave it and move on to the next opponent. That's been their mentality.  
Even when we lose, we do the same thing.  
But this team going into a tournament, they have every belief in each other
that they can win it all. If we actually won it all, we knew we were going to
get an automatic bid. It was about how we were going to play through this
tournament.  
And I thought this team played under the radar, because a lot of people didn't
expect us to be in this championship game. But they laid it on the line. You
can't ask anything more than that from your student‑athletes, to be gracious
and humble for the opportunity, and go out there and perform to the maximum of
their ability. They did that.  
That's why I'm extremely proud of this team, for the body of work that they've
accomplished, not only these last six, seven games, but the whole season.  
  
Q. You mentioned how courageous you thought your team was playing. You've
been in this atmosphere yourself. To be on the other side, how daunting is it
to be on that other side playing against Tennessee with a title on the line in
this tournament?  
COACH CALDWELL: Well, you know, it's something that you accept and you face
that challenge. A lot of credit to Tennessee, Coach Summitt and her staff. But
I wouldn't be the coach that I am right now without that competitive spirit by
playing at a Tennessee.  
We know when they face each other, I'm going to have every team ready. I'm
going to make sure our team is prepared to beat not just Tennessee, but
anybody that steps up in front of us. They have taken on that attitude, and
that's why they've battled and competed. Like I told them, they stood
toe‑to‑toe with a giant today. We gonna keep doing that.  
You enjoy the journey and you experience so many great memories. We're going
to have some fun memories here. Even though this stings right now, I told
them, You need to take this with you. Every day you go to practice, you need
to remember today and use it to get better in the next couple weeks.  
Again, when there's a setback, there's a comeback.  
  
Q. Was the baby kicking?  
COACH CALDWELL: No, the little one was calm today.

_NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE_  
  

LSU  72  
Kentucky  61

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Kentucky head coach Matthew Mitchell and A'dia
Mathies and Keyla Snowden.  
Coach, if you could start us off.  
COACH MITCHELL: Well, I want to congratulate LSU, what a terrific game they
played. They played with a lot of heart, a lot of desire tonight, clearly
wanted to play in the championship tomorrow.  
This time of year, it's a lot about that. I thought LSU did a great, great
job, really took us out of just about anything we wanted to do, dominated the
game.  
A great, great performance by a tough LSU team. I thought they did well today.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.  
  
Q. Coach, I thought they really dominated you in the paint. Did you think
so?  
COACH MITCHELL: Yeah, I thought they were really, really tough. A lot tougher
than us today. From the opening tip, it looked like their desire was greater
than ours.  
For us, we have to have that. We have to have an edge and desire. For whatever
reason, LSU had greater desire today. They really wanted to play for a
championship tomorrow. In the paint, they clearly had some big kids, have some
good, tough post players. We just don't seem to be able to get any pressure on
the ball. We foul them an awful lot.  
It just was a difficult game for us. We just had a hard time with them today.  
  
Q. I know you came back from the big deficit yesterday. Any confidence
knowing that you had done that before or did LSU keep you at enough
distance?  
COACH MITCHELL: Well, I just thought our top players would have been really
aggressive, if A'dia and Bria could start playing aggressive and making
midrange jumpers, because that's what you had to make today to beat them. You
clearly could not get to the rim and make any. It was tough to get to the rim
against them with their size. We didn't do a very good job with finishing with
contact.  
It's the kind of game that you had to have somebody step up and make some
midrange jumpers. We just couldn't do it. It was a tough day for us.  
I think we have a really good team. For whatever reason, we didn't play very
well today. A big reason for that it was LSU. But I still didn't think we were
never in much of an attack mode.  
So I have a lot of confidence in them, but we just didn't get the job done
today clearly.  
  
Q. A'dia, could you talk about the first half. Only 16 points for you guys
overall. What was their defense doing so well?  
A'DIA MATHIES: I think they were just doing a good job of playing out wide. We
wasn't able to get the ball inside, attacking the gap. It was mostly our
fault. We wasn't attacking when we should have. They just played good.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about the free ‑throw shooting disparity, 28‑point
differential.   
COACH MITCHELL: It's a big factor in the game. You lose by 9, get outscored 28
at the free‑throw line, we clearly fouled too much. I was disappointed with
that, that we could not play a cleaner game. 30 more attempts for them.  
We definitely didn't play as clean of a game as they played. They obviously
played a much cleaner game and didn't foul as much as we did.  
It's difficult for us, too, on a game like today. I think they really wanted
our post players to try to beat 'em. They put a lot of pressure on A'dia,
Keyla and Bria. We didn't get much production out of our post game today,
could not make shots around the basket.  
You'd like to see the free throws a little bit more even. But when you have it
like that, you have to find some way to pull it out. We had a chance to win
today; just couldn't get it done.  
  
Q. Keyla, how do you fix the team offensively? You struggled almost the
whole SEC tournament, never shot more than 50% a game. What do you need to do
offensively?  
KEYLA SNOWDEN: We need to get in the gym and get some shots up and get
confidence back. I think a lot of people are lacking confidence in their
shots, their abilities right now. The main thing, we just got to play
together.  
COACH MITCHELL: I don't know any other thing to do but get back and go to
practice. I think Keyla put it well there. We at times this season had a real
dedicated group getting in the gym, so we know we have people that will.
They'll have a lot of time this week as we await and see where our destination
is in the tournament.  
What a great job these players have done to win 14 games against SEC
competition, finding ways to win, being the regular‑season champions.  
So today is very disappointing. To win the tournament, you have to play well
for three days, and we didn't do that. But I think it's a great accomplishment
to play the best over a 16‑game schedule. I think that is an even greater
accomplishment.  
So real proud of the team for being the champions of the regular season. It's
something that we should draw some confidence from. I just agree with Keyla, I
think we just find a way to get in the gym. That's what you want to do.  
So now as we go forward, we have to decide how special we want to be. We're
already a special team. We've already done something that hasn't been done in
30 years.  
My hope for them is they're never satisfied with where they are. I think when
you do that in life, you have a lot of problems. If you get to the point of
success and you stop working, I don't think that's a good formula for them as
they go forward. That's what I'll try to share with them. We have a lot left
to accomplish.  
Today is disappointing, but we need to bounce back and really try to focus in
practice and try to take advantage of some of this time we have off to maybe
regain some confidence shooting.  
  
Q. There's probably a very good chance the SEC is going to have eight teams
in. When you consider some of the seniors that are in this league, looking
forward, do you feel like all this preparation is going to do you a lot of
good for the NCAA tournament?  
COACH MITCHELL: Absolutely. I think we have played in a lot of tough games. We
won a lot of tough games. Clearly we won more than anybody else in the regular
season. Had to win 'em in different ways.  
So we I think will be very much battle‑tested going into the tournament. I
don't get a vote. My opinion doesn't matter. But if we don't get eight teams
in, I don't know how. We really have eight strong teams.  
As you watched our eighth‑seeded team yesterday perform so spectacularly,
they're so tough. I don't know if anybody would be jumping for joy if they
draw Florida in the tournament.  
I think we should get eight teams in. It's been a good conference season. It
makes you even prouder to be the champions of the regular season when the
conference is so strong.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

### [La'Keisha Sutton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19265)

  
_NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE_  
  

Tennessee  74  
South Carolina  58

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by South Carolina head coach Dawn Staley,
Markeshia Grant and La'Keisha Sutton.  
We'll take questions.  
  
Q. What did you tell them in the locker room after the game?  
COACH STALEY: I told our seniors and our captains left a legacy here this
particular year in the SEC tournament. What they've done to get us this far,
you know, our program at South Carolina. I told them how important it was to
be one of four that gets a bye because today will be our championship game.
It's really hard to play all these games just mentally and physically.  
But they left our program in good hands.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions. For the players, talk about what happened today with
Tennessee versus what happened a month ago?  
MARKESHIA GRANT: I think a month ago, I mean, we just had a type of mojo about
us going into Knoxville. I think we were just hitting shots, winning the
hustle plays, out‑playing them.  
Today I think we did the same. But I think we just came up short. We did work
hard. I think we did play hard. It was you just not our night.  
La'KEISHA SUTTON: I would say a month ago we had two or three days to prepare
and rest for Tennessee, whereas today we came in from a game yesterday against
Georgia, just tried to put 40 minutes together.  
I think we did play hard. We just wasn't fresh.  
  
Q. Dawn, what do you take away from the experience this week that you'll
take with you when you start the NCAAs?  
COACH STALEY: We're in (laughter)?  
Just I think playing in front of a crowd like this is very much like the NCAA
tournament. May be very similar in that you could be put in a region where
you're playing on somebody's home floor. Tennessee and their fans gave us an
opportunity to play in a situation like that.  
But just knowing that we can play with anybody in the country because of the
type of parity that's in this particular conference.  
MARKESHIA GRANT: I think just like preparation for the type of crowds we're
going to face in the future, just handling the noise, just staying together
'cause if we go into an arena with loud crowds like this, then we'll have to
stay together and communicate with each other.  
  
Q. You have some experienced players on your team. Tennessee has so many
seniors, graduate players. Do you see that helping them? Is that a big asset
for them?  
COACH STALEY: Oh, absolutely. They're so used to being in this situation year
in and year out. I think we got out‑experienced today, along with I think we
got out‑talented. Their talent was better than our talent today. You certainly
have to take your hat off to them.  
I hope they get Coach Summitt another SEC championship.  
  
Q. La'Keisha, tough shooting game for the team. Was there anything in
particular that shooting wasn't as crisp?  
La'KEISHA SUTTON: Maybe the fact that we're not familiar with this arena. But,
I don't know, we took shots with our offense, they just wasn't falling.  
  
Q. Dawn, just a historical standpoint, you and Nikki Caldwell, the battles
you've had as players, what does that say when people look at what you've been
able to do so young in your coaching careers?  
COACH STALEY: I think it goes to show we've been taught well. We come from
very respected college programs, coached by some coaches that have coached
this game for 30 plus years. So they have passed down, you know, a lot of
knowledge and approach to the game.  
We're only just kind of paving the way for younger players like you see
sitting here to do the same. I'm very proud of Nikki for getting to the finals
in her first year. She coached with Coach Ryan, Coach Summitt. So all of those
coaches have given us knowledge, tough love, all of those things that help us
in these situations put our teams in a situation where we're competitive and
possibly win at a high level.  
  
Q. Coach, with a lot of younger players on your roster, what do you think
they're going to be taking away from this as you move forward with this
program?  
COACH STALEY: I hope our young players found out what it takes to play at this
level year in and year out. I know they really can't understand it from an
experience standpoint. But we did try to put a team of five out there that
would play in this situation next year just to give them a little experience
at it, to play against a team like Tennessee, playing against Glory Johnson.
Glory gets two feet in the paint every single time. We want to draw some
experiences that will help her in the near future.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.

_NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE_  
  

Tennessee  74  
South Carolina  58

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Tennessee coach Holly Warlick, Vicki Baugh and
Glory Johnson.  
Coach, if you could start us off with an opening comment.  
COACH WARLICK: It was a great night for us. I thought the first half Vicki
Baugh was just dominating. She kept us in the game. Great team effort, great
team win.  
Let me say this. Our fans are just absolutely incredible. I never thought I
would say this, that the arena would sound like Thompson‑Boling. But that was
a loud crowd tonight and we're so appreciative of them coming out and
supporting us. It's a tribute to this team, to Coach Summitt. I'm just proud
to be from Tennessee and know how many people we have that love our basketball
team.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Watching that game today, it was hard to think of you losing on your home
floor.  
COACH WARLICK: I go back to our defensive effort. South Carolina is a very
athletic, very well‑coached basketball team. We weren't ready to guard, defend
their athleticism in Knoxville.  
Glory got into foul trouble and we couldn't get in a rhythm. It had a lot to
do with what South Carolina did to us. So we've gone back and we really put in
the time with our defensive effort.  
I think you're seeing it pay off for the amount of time we've put in working
on our defense.  
  
Q. It seemed like one of the turning points of the game was midway through
the second half, two blocks, transition baskets, then you pulled away. How
important do you think that stretch was there?  
COACH WARLICK: Well, it was huge. Anytime you can get transition points and
you score off your defense, it's huge for us. It's a momentum builder. It's a
transition basket. That's what we want.  
We've always prided ourselves on defense and rebounding. I thought we did
those two things tonight. So, absolutely, when Strick and Vicki had blocks,
it's a great momentum for us. When we can convert and score, it's huge for our
basketball team.  
  
Q. For both players. Can you talk a little bit about just playing for a
third straight SEC championship, especially this year with some of the
struggles that Coach Summitt has gone through.  
VICKI BAUGH: It means a lot. We're always a great team and we were tired this
year of saying what potential we have. Now it was time to apply it. We just
worked hard in practice. I think finally we figured out that defense and
rebounding is the philosophy here. That's Tennessee basketball. It opens up a
lot in the transition game, especially where we're most comfortable.  
So I think we're figuring that out, just taking it game by game. Now we're
where we want to be.  
GLORY JOHNSON: Getting into the championship game is huge. We put in so much
work in practice, out of practice for so long. I think it means a lot that we
can show people what we've been working on. We've had lapses throughout our
season. We are strong players and being together and working consistently is
what we're trying to do. It kind of show, three years getting back to the
championship game. That was huge for us.  
  
Q. The second half, for the second day in a row, really is when you made the
big push, obviously. What is it about that second 20 minutes that made such a
big difference?  
COACH WARLICK: I'm just glad we have it in us, in the second half.  
GLORY JOHNSON: Meet at halftime, discuss what we're doing wrong. The coaches
are really positive with us. We can fix it. We know we did wrong. We talk to
each other, try to communicate in a positive manner. Second half is our half,
we can correct it.  
VICKI BAUGH: We put together two halves of basketball. That's something we
struggled with. We needed to mature. I think we stepped it up this tournament
and we definitely need to do it one more time tomorrow.  
  
Q. What did you try to do to negate South Carolina's athleticism?  
COACH WARLICK: Well, we started off in our zone defense. Against athletic
teams, it's really helped us, gotten us off to a great start. I think the
games that we have lost or not played well in, we have not gotten off to a
good start.  
I credit our seniors. It's probably our best defensive team that we start
with. It's really worked for us. And we mixed it up. We felt like once they
got into a rhythm against the zone, we would go to man. We tried two different
zones. We tried two different types of man‑to‑man. So it was a collection of
our defense. Our players were very receptive.  
As Glory said, we worked hard on it and we communicated. That's been our
second biggest problem, is communication. When we're doing those things, we're
playing good basketball.  
  
Q. Glory, Vicki, could you talk a little bit about how you played the first
two teams that had wins over you this year, what motivation that provided?  
VICKI BAUGH: We were definitely motivated. We were fortunate to play the teams
that we wanted to play. We wanted revenge. I think that was our motivation
stepping into this tournament. We just wanted to prove that we were the better
team.  
We played two great teams that pushed the ball, great tempo. It was going to
be a challenge. But in order to get to where we wanted to be, we had to
overcome that.  
GLORY JOHNSON: It shows our development, shows what we've been working on.
When we make mistakes, lose games, come back and play the teams, we've got
better. It shows our team has grown since then. It's a steppingstone for us.  
  
Q. Glory, could you address what Holly was saying. Every time she thinks you
played as hard as you can, you raise it a level. What do you need to do
tomorrow?  
GLORY JOHNSON: Go up strong, stay strong with the ball, whether it's a guard
passing inside, or a post going up. Play through fouls. Don't worry about how
the other team is playing. We're trying to play good as a team first. We'll
figure out how LSU will guard us, figure out what we need to do on defense to
stop their offense.  
Right now we need to focus on the small things and work on ourselves and then
it will all come eventually.  
  
Q. Did you feel like LSU might have been as physical of a team as you played
during the regular season?  
GLORY JOHNSON: LSU is a physical team, just like us. They match up with us
well. One thing we have on them is speed. Our post has been working with
Heather Mason all season long and we're willing to run. I think that's going
to be the huge difference, is running in transition.  
VICKI BAUGH: It's definitely going to be a physical game. LSU is a very strong
and great team. So I'm looking forward to a good basketball game tomorrow. We
have to be mentally strong and physically matching it up with them.  
  
Q. Sometimes you face your best friends in games. Nikki was saying earlier
if they were to face you guys, it would be a testament to the Tennessee legacy
to have the two of you squaring off. Talk about that.  
COACH WARLICK: Yeah, Nikki, we talk before each game. It's going to be
different because I'm not calling her tonight or tomorrow.  
But it is, Nikki has done a great job. She prides herself and her team on
defensive rebounding. As I love Nikki Caldwell, she's not going to be a great
friend of mine tomorrow. Maybe after the game. But I respect what Nikki and
her staff has done. She's just an example of the success of people who have
played and have coached for Pat Summitt.  
I'm not surprised how successful Nikki has been. She had a great high school
coach. Obviously she had a great teacher in Pat and a great friend.  
Looking forward to it. It's going to be a great battle. It's going to be
physical. It's going to be two good teams going at each other. I'm excited to
have the opportunity to play Nikki again.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.

### [LaSondra Barrett](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19292)

### [Nikki Caldwell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21947)

### [Courtney Jones](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19311)

  
_NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE_  
  

LSU  72  
Kentucky  61

  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by LSU head coach Nikki Caldwell, LaSondra
Barrett and Courtney Jones.  
Coach, if you could start us with some opening comments.  
COACH CALDWELL: First off, these two young ladies to my right, I can't say
enough about them, as not only players but as people. Their competitive spirit
tonight was huge. Even though LaSondra was in foul trouble the first half, I
thought Courtney really stepped up her game. That's what you have to have at
this time.  
Kentucky, a very, very good basketball team. I mean, we knew it was going to
be a battle. They have one of the best players in our conference. Defensively
they really do a great job of getting after you.  
Obviously, they turned us over quite a bit. I was proud of this group for
staying together and playing this game with a lot of heart.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. What was going through your mind when LaSondra had to go to the bench for
two fouls? Did you think you had to elevate your game in any way?  
COURTNEY JONES: My first thought, I was a bit angry. She's a very physical
player. She takes charge, offense and defense. But I knew we had to have her
on the court.  
I knew the second half she would come up with her A game, and she did. I just
tried to be as motivating, just do the things that LaSondra did when she's not
on the court.  
  
Q. Coach, first half, shutting Kentucky down so well with some of the 16
points. What were some of the things you were doing to hold a good offense
down like that?  
COACH CALDWELL: Well, first off, we talked about awareness, knowing where
Mathies is at all times. We took the shape of their offense by running 2‑3
look. We stayed true to trying to keep them off the boards. I thought we did a
much better job of that.  
We eliminated some of the transition baskets in the first half. That was key
for us because they're a team that really relishes on you turning the ball
over because they execute so well in the transition game.  
So we talked about those two areas, transition defense and board play.  
  
Q. Courtney and LaSondra, all things consider, is this the biggest game you
ever played in your career?  
COURTNEY JONES: I don't think so. I think LSU still hasn't had their big game
yet.  
  
Q. To this point.  
COURTNEY JONES: But I think there's so much more to this team. We decided to
come out and give all our effort and work hard because we wanted to win bad.  
  
Q. LaSondra, you had 24 turnovers today, but you are kind of used to turning
the ball over, dealing with it.  
LaSONDRA BARRETT: Absolutely. I mean, they're a good pressing team. They try
to speed you up. They're very aggressive in their defense and traps. I think
we took advantage of that. We were just patient with the ball. We wanted to
dictate our tempo of the game.  
Playing them the second time, we know their personnel, what they like to do. I
think we took over. We just dictated the tempo from the beginning, carried
that throughout the game.  
  
Q. LaSondra and Coach Caldwell, when you go back a month, you lose Destini,
you lost five of six games, what was it that you talked about then to get to
the point where you are now?  
COACH CALDWELL: First off, I told Boogie that she has to run point. That was a
big adjustment. There's not too many players you can move from the, let's say,
4 or 5 all the way to the point guard. Usually you'll move a swing guard into
that situation, which we have. When we lost Destini, we also lost Jeanne in
that stretch with a concussion.  
By her stepping up her game, playing the point, I thought that really helped
us. It gave us a different sense of security, ball security. Obviously
Courtney, we had to move her around, as well. We had to put her out on the
perimeter. We were really shuffling players around.  
I think it took us a little bit to settle in. Once we did, we started on that
run. But this group really made a huge sacrifice. But if you look at Destini,
what she is about, her spirit, she makes sacrifices for her teammates, as
well.  
So it was an easy transition for them when they really grasped their mindset
around, Okay, I got to do whatever I need to do for this team.  
  
Q. Coach, if you do wind up taking on UT in the final tomorrow, is that
something that be a little bit more special to you?  
COACH CALDWELL: It would be just special. It's just going to be special
anyway. I have truly enjoyed this group. It's been an amazing journey. Whoever
comes out of that next line, I know this team is going to lay it on the line.
I know they're going to play with a lot of heart. We're going to go after
whoever we have to stand up against.  
I have much respect obviously for Coach Summitt and what she's meant to the
game, as well as Dawn Staley. I remember playing against her when she was at
Virginia. This tournament, being in the SEC, this is where it's at. We got two
great teams getting ready to tip off. I know our name has been moved over one
more slot.  
  
Q. Coach, I felt like you dominated this game inside today. Did you think
so?  
COACH CALDWELL: I felt like we tried to really establish our inside game
because we're big. We're going to take advantage of our size. When we did do
that, it put a lot of pressure on them to guard us, which allowed us to get to
the free‑throw line.  
But that's been our game plan the whole time. Whenever we are establishing
that inside attack, we typically do a very good job of shooting a high
percentage. We may turn it over 20‑plus times, but we're near 48, 49% each
game.  
  
Q. Was there ever a point that it went through your mind if you lost the
lead, Kentucky made a big run, you might have put LaSondra back in during the
first half?  
COACH CALDWELL: No, she thought that (laughter). Coach, can I go in the last
two minutes?  
No.  
Again, when we see that we've got our opponents playing 20, 25 points in a
half, we feel like we can keep them in the 40s, I feel good about this team
winning.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.

### [Matthew Mitchell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18056)

_NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE_  
  

Kentucky  71  
Florida  67

  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined now by Kentucky head coach Matthew Mitchell,
A'dia Mathies and Keyla Snowden.  
COACH MITCHELL: It's just really good to be sitting here in the press
conference winning that game. What a great, hard‑fought tough game. We have a
tremendous respect for the University of Florida and their basketball team. If
they're not one of the toughest teams in America, I don't know who is. They're
well‑coached, well‑prepared, and their players play very hard.  
It's a real honor to be a part of that game because they are a tough, tough
team.  
I'm not sure exactly how we won the game, but we were able to make enough
hustle plays in the second half, thought we finally started hustling a little
bit more, and that's a real key for us.  
Real proud of the players. Did not look good there for a large portion of the
game. For us to overcome poor shooting and find a way to win is something I'm
proud of our players for doing.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.  
  
Q. Coach, in the second half you went with Amber Smith at the point guard
position. Talk about your decision to make that move.  
COACH MITCHELL: Yeah, we just were real hesitant at that position today. We
needed somebody to come off with some energy. Amber had been struggling in
that department in practice and in games. I was really proud she was able to
rise to the occasion because we needed it badly. We were just sort of lifeless
out there at the point position.  
We just told her she needed to go in and make some plays. I thought she played
probably her best game of the year.  
  
Q. Coach, do you feel like one of the reasons you were able to pull this out
was because you were able to come through a little more at the foul line than
they were?  
COACH MITCHELL: Yeah, I thought that we did a good job getting to the line and
making some shots. We missed some at crucial moments, and it made it feel like
we weren't doing that great a job at the foul line. Now as you look at the
stats, that was a big, big difference in the game.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the matchup problems that George and Stewart
presented, especially in the first half, how you were able to counterbalance
that in the second?  
COACH MITCHELL: If you look at the three games we played this year, they were
all very, very close. I think that's one of the reasons Florida is such a
tough matchup for us, is they have excellent post players that play so well
together. They're seniors, they're veterans, they play well together.  
For a large portion of the game, we had to play four guards. I thought that
A'dia really tried to battle down there. It's just tough. Those kids are so
big, physical, skilled. You see they were big producers today. That's a tough,
tough matchup for us and makes it difficult to beat Florida.  
  
Q. For the players, it seemed your freshman Bria Goss struggled. What did
you say to her for her to make some good defensive plays?  
A'DIA MATHIES: Bring a hustles every day in practice, every game. Even though
she wasn't having the best night, made a mistake here or there, she's going to
try to give it her best and her all.  
We kept encouraging her, kept motivating her. She came back and played some
big plays for us.  
KEYLA SNOWDEN: The main thing I was telling everybody is to try to settle
down. Everybody had first‑game jitters. We played extremely hard. I think our
defense helped us get through that slump in the beginning. Definitely with
Bria, she plays hard and aggressive and we appreciate everything she brings to
the team.  
  
Q. How important was it for Keyla, especially in the first half, like she
said, just to settle you down and keep you in the game?  
COACH MITCHELL: Keyla came off the bench with great energy. She's done that
all year. She certainly showed today. It's great to see that. I tell you, I
don't know why we're having such a hard time making shots, but we just are.
There's nothing you can do but hang in there. Keyla just stepped in the gap
right there and was able to help us hold on.  
We started out 14 down, just nothing going on. It's so difficult to fight out
of that hole. But when you get the three‑point ball going, it can kind of lift
everybody's spirits, lets you play harder on the defensive end.  
Keyla's performance was spectacular. Obviously we could not have won without
that kind of performance. So real happy and proud of her on that.  
  
Q. Keyla, referring to your first ‑game jitters comment, why do you think
that happened?   
KEYLA SNOWDEN: Just being in the atmosphere. We're a team, we've been here
before. I think that comes with anybody or any team. Just the first game, you
kind of loosen up a little bit as the game goes on.  
  
Q. Do you think maybe Florida having had the game yesterday helped them come
out and get that jump on you a little bit early?  
UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: I think so. That's what coach said, they had a game
under they belt. They were a little more accustomed to the gym, the balls and
everything. They just got the flow. I think once we settled down and got used
to everything, our defense started to pick up in the second half, our offense
picked up. I think it was just a matter of time.  
  
Q. The first ‑game jitters, was it different this time because you had won
the regular‑season championship?   
UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: I think that adds a little bit of pressure, but I don't
think that affected our start. It's mainly like how we come, how we prepare
ourselves to play.  
I think it was within ourselves, like A'dia said, we worked through that.  
  
Q. What does it say about your team to go down so much in the first half,
then come back and take a lead in the second?  
COACH MITCHELL: Well, it says a lot about them. I'm not sure how level my head
was staying when we were down 14. That's a real good job by the players.  
I was so concerned about our opponent, first of all. Coach Butler I think is
one of the finest coaches in the country. I knew they would be prepared, they
would compete, they would play hard.  
It's a difficult day for us, not playing yesterday. We were out of our
game‑day routine because the shootaround was so early. We take a lot of pride
in our game‑day practice. We feel like that is something that gives us an
edge. We really prepare hard.  
We just did a walk‑through at the hotel this morning. I don't know that we
were just ready to roll to start out. Kind of out of routine. I don't know if
that had something to do with it. I don't know if it was getting the trophy
there. A lot was going on that's not usually going on for us.  
For them to battle back from all of that... 20‑6, looked like it might get
36‑6\. Didn't look like it was going real good for us.  
They just kept chipping away and battling. I think in the end defensively
having the confidence you could get stops, you could pressure the ball, you
could get some turnovers. We had a foul, then a travel. That's what we hang
our hat on, is pressure defense.  
I think in the end down the stretch we were able to make enough of those
plays. It says they're a tough group of kids to come back from that terrible
start.  
  
  
Q. Did you draw that game plan up for the free throw that Bria hit?  
COACH MITCHELL: That was such a huge play because Florida took away what we
were trying to get. When they took that away, then I saw what was going on.
Thank goodness, I don't know who was throwing the ball in, but I think Amber
threw it into Bria, then we had a good matchup there.  
That was not the play we were going to run, but really it ended up being
better than anything we could have gotten. She was able to drive. Jennifer
George had some fouls and I think she was more tentative than what she would
have been. We got a good matchup there. She missed so many of those layups.
Thank goodness she was able to power through.  
We were struggling to score. Florida, I'm telling you, is one of the best
defensive teams in this league. That's why we tried to call the timeout to
know exactly what we wanted to do. I give the players a hard time for not
making reads sometimes. They made that one well. That was a huge bucket in the
game.  
  
  
Q. A'dia, for you players, do you feel showing you could come back from
double ‑digit deficits on a big stage like this gives you some confidence
going forward?   
A'DIA MATHIES: Yeah, definitely. We just know if there's any other times we
get down that much, we can always come back and win. We have to stay focused,
keep defensive focus. Even if we go up or down, we're still able to win.  
  
Q. Coach, we don't know who you are playing next, but we know LSU and
Arkansas are two very good defensive clubs. What is that going to be like
either way?  
COACH MITCHELL: Well, it will be tough. All the questions I've been getting is
we're a pretty weak 1 seed. It's going to be a tough game. We're going to have
to play hard because nobody thought we were going to be that strong of a 1
seed in this tournament.  
I guess we'll have our hands full tomorrow. We'll get the players ready to go.
Whoever it is, clearly LSU or Arkansas, both outstanding teams. We had very
tough games with both. So I'm sure it will be a tough game.  
But our players have to have some confidence headed into tomorrow overcoming a
tremendous deficit to win this game. So I'm real proud of them. They need to
be pumped up and ready to go tomorrow, and I think they will be.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

Tennessee  68

THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Tennessee associate head coach Holly Warlick
and student athletes Glory Johnson and Shekinna Stricklen.  
COACH WARLICK: It was a great win for us tonight. It's kind of weird because
we've been in a game called off at Ole Miss because of the rain, the lights
went out in St.Thomas, so now we have a tornado watch. I don't know what we're
doing, but...  
I was proud of our group. I thought we got ahead. Vanderbilt came back. That's
just Vanderbilt. They're well‑coached, very offense‑oriented team. I think our
young ladies stepped up and met the challenge. As I said, just very proud of
'em today.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Shekinna, you picked up a third foul on the push ‑off early in the second
half, went to the bench. What was going on in your head?   
SHEKINNA STRICKLEN: I was really frustrated. I didn't get to play in the first
half because I had two fouls. I picked up the third, got really frustrated.
Coach came over there, went off on me, made it worse. I really got mad. I
really felt bad because I let my teammates down. They were still encouraging
me.  
I went out there understand a let it go. I was positive. I stayed focused.
Just knew I had to step up. Glory stepped up big for us on the inside also.  
  
Q. Shekinna, wondering if that little chat with the coach served as
motivation?  
SHEKINNA STRICKLEN: It was a lot of motivation. I think I got the stare. She
really stared at me. I had to really respond (laughter).  
You know, just having my teammates having my back, they were there for me,
encouraging me. I just feel like I was letting them down.  
  
Q. Coach, tinkered with the starting lineup all year long. You went with
your seniors and graduate students in the starting lineup today. Why was
that?  
COACH WARLICK: Well, that's probably our best defensive team. The last couple
games before their Senior Day, we haven't gotten off to a good start. So we
thought it was important when we played Florida, we got off to a great start.
Our defense was solid. So we're going to go with it.  
These seniors have been through a lot so we're putting it in their hands.
They've accepted the challenge. They set the tone and then we subbed in. But
just excited about how hard we played.  
At the beginning of the second half when we had the delay, I wasn't really
pleased with how we came out. But we sustained the run.  
These young ladies, they've had a lot of pressure on them all year. They've
stepped up to the challenge. If they play the way they played and continue to
play, we're in good shape.  
  
Q. Less than a month ago you gave up 93 points to this Vanderbilt team. What
changed?  
COACH WARLICK: We've gotten very serious about our defense. Not very often we
give up 93 points. We went back to work. If I would have told you we were
going to run three‑fourths of the game in a 2‑3 zone, I thought you would have
been crazy.  
We went back and forth, thought we would go with it, it worked. Then we had to
get back into our man defense.  
We made a commitment in practice. They understand the value of defensive
rebounding. So that's what has gotten us so far and why we're playing the way
we are.  
  
Q. Shekinna, I noticed you especially interacting with a very passionate pro
Lady Vol crowd that takes the neutral out of this neutral. Almost like a home
game.  
SHEKINNA STRICKLEN: It's great. I feel like we're at home. I feel like we have
another player on our team with our fans. They're so loud. They stay into it
the whole game. They there cheering for us. Why not ask for louder noise? It's
just great. I love it.  
GLORY JOHNSON: Something we like to do is acknowledge the fans before and
after the games. They travel far to see us play. The majority of every game
we've played has almost all Tennessee fans. It's just Lady Vol fans. They love
the game of basketball. We have to respect that and acknowledge them. I think
it's great they come to so many of our games.  
COACH WARLICK: I think it's a tribute to the program that Pat has built, the
tradition. It's amazing to me, it really is. So we're very proud of our fans.
We just appreciate them coming out.  
Like Shekinna said, we need our fans. Times we need our fans to get us going.
Whatever it takes, we'll take it. We love the crowd and we appreciate 'em.  
  
Q. Shekinna, when you hit the deep three, then a couple more threes, was
that just riding the crowd or were you hot and feeling it?  
SHEKINNA STRICKLEN: If you see me play, I'm like a streaky shooter, I hit one
and I really feel like I'm going to hit the next one and the next one.  
But the crowd helped out a lot. When I hit the second one, the deep one right
before the shot clock, maybe the third one, I think that really helped, yes.  
  
Q. The 2 ‑3 zone, were you concerned that Vandy might shoot you out of
that?  
COACH WARLICK: We worked quite a bit on their sets. I think probably what we
worried about the most was their setting screens, us going under, they hit
threes. So we worked really hard on going over the top of their screens,
making sure we identified their three‑point shooters.  
It worked. We were rebounding. So as long as it kept working, we were going to
stay in it. If they would have hit some threes early, we probably would have
gotten out of it.  
But I thought our game plan, our practice on them, was great preparation. We
had stops and that's what we needed. We rebound better out of our 2‑3 zone, as
well. It worked out for us today.  
  
Q. Glory, when you were making that second ‑half run, you hit a fade‑away,
Shekinna came up and hit you in the back. How hard was that hit?   
GLORY JOHNSON: Shekinna is really strong. But the majority of that game was so
physical that that was nothing compared to the rest of the game (laughter).  
COACH WARLICK: You'll take that hit.  
GLORY JOHNSON: Yeah, I'll take that one (laughter).  
  
Q. Shekinna, in the few losses that you have, a lot of times you're getting
off to a slow start in the first half. Why is that?  
SHEKINNA STRICKLEN: You know, honestly just having low energy. That's
something that my teammates have addressed with me, came to me. It's something
that I let them down. I really told the team that this won't happen again.  
I'd have to say low energy. Tonight it was my fouls. But it wasn't too late
and I was able to come in and step up.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.

# [SOUTHEASTERN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=SOUTHEASTERN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 2, 2012

  

### [Jasmine Hassell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21800)

### [Jasmine James](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22148)

### [Andy Landers](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13868)

  
_NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE_  
  

South Carolina  59  
Georgia  55

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Georgia head coach Andy Landers, Jasmine James
and Jasmine Hassell.  
COACH LANDERS: In my opinion the game was kind of the way that we thought that
it would be. It would be played hard and defensive. Both teams I thought did a
reasonably good job of defending the other. At the end of the day our
inability to keep the deep penetration, whether it be on the dribble or on the
pass with a post, ultimately it led to fouls which I think decided the
basketball game.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Coach, you were down six, but you got back in it. Talk about what you
were doing defensively to get the game going.  
COACH LANDERS: Just getting stops and rebounds. Earlier in the game we got
some stops, but we didn't get rebounds. We got stops and rebounds, came down
to the other end of the floor. J.J. and Meredith made a couple plays. Hassell
made a play late.  
But basically got stops, which is what you have to do when you're behind. Then
when we got it to the end of the floor, we were able to make plays.  
But South Carolina dictated the game. They drove it with their defense. They
dictated how the game would be played.  
  
Q. Out ‑rebounding South Carolina, the biggest difference on the score sheet
is their points off the bench. How do you take this and use this to boost you
through the NCAA tournament?  
COACH LANDERS: Well, the bench points are misleading because they have a
short‑term starter. They start a kid, a player, about 10 minutes a game, then
the real starter comes in off of the bench.  
But your point is a good one. We out‑rebound them. We shoot better than they
do from the field. We do some good things statistically. But at the end of the
day it was their spirit that won the basketball game. They pressured us and I
think at times their defensive pressure affected us. When we were on defense,
we weren't as willing to play as hard as we needed to play to keep some things
from happening.  
But as we go forward, hopefully you learn from mistakes. But unfortunately for
us, these are reoccurring mistakes. You look at that board. The people that
didn't have offensive rebounds haven't been going to the board all year. The
people that haven't got offensive rebounds haven't got them all year.  
The learning, I don't know if it will kick in before we go to the NCAA
tournament or not.  
  
Q. For the players, just talk about the closeness of the games you had
against South Carolina this year. Did you expect a close matchup?  
COACH LANDERS: Oh, yeah. It was a great game in Columbia, hard‑fought much
like tonight. Points about the same, just reversed.  
We shot the ball a little bit better. We missed some pretty good shots,
especially early in the game. But the game was the way you thought, the way I
kind of thought that it would be played.  
JASMINE JAMES: I would definitely say it was what we expected. We knew going
into the game that it would be a tough game because South Carolina is always a
pretty tough team.  
We always match up pretty well with them. We know every time we're going to
play them it's going to be a really good game. They have really good guards as
well as a really good inside game, despite the fact that they're considered to
be undersized.  
We knew going in it would be close and we would be fighting the whole game. So
there wasn't anything that we didn't expect.  
JASMINE HASSELL: Same as J.J. and Coach Landers said. We knew it was going to
be a hard, tough game. It's always a hard, tough game against South Carolina.  
  
Q. What is your goal to do to motivate your team through the NCAA
tournament? How do you take this tonight and learn from it and help your team
move forward?  
JASMINE JAMES: I would definitely say every night is a learning experience.
Whether it's a win or a loss, you're going to learn something from it or take
something from it.  
Throughout the whole year, constantly rebounding, defense. We know what our
key things are, that we need to focus on.  
Every game is a learning experience. You kind of get to say, Okay, well,
tonight where did we do good, where did we not do so well at, where do we need
to improve? You get to take those things and move on as well as try to use
those things as motivation to get better.  
We can take the things that were not so good as well as the things that were
good and try to improve upon those things before the NCAA tournament.  
JASMINE HASSELL: I agree with J.J. I think every game is a learning
experience. We just have to capitalize on the things we did right and the
things we did bad and make sure we improve them for the tournament.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.

_NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE_  
  

LSU  41  
Arkansas  40

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Arkansas head coach Tom Collen, Ashley Daniels
and C'eira Ricketts.

Coach if you could start us off.  
COACH COLLEN: I just think it was a tough loss. We obviously didn't play well
offensively. I think LSU had a lot to do with that. I think everybody knows
they're one of the better defensive teams in the country.  
We didn't make a lot of shots. I think the hardest thing about it is that our
kids fought so hard coming out of the locker room in the second half and
really probably had the game in hand, or at least maybe it appeared that we
had it in hand. Then just found a way to let it get away.  
Got to give LSU credit. Got to give the Webb kid credit. She hit two big
shots, had the courage to do it, and knocked them down. You got to give our
kids credit for coming back. Even credit for running the last play, getting to
the rim like C'eira did and having a chance to win the game.  
We probably didn't do enough good things in order to win the basketball game,
but we'll grow from it, learn from it. We still have one more regular‑season
game to play, then we have the NCAA tournament. So hopefully we'll go from
there and we'll bounce back. This team has always bounced back.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. The focus becomes on the way the game ended. Are you a coach that feels
like maybe you lost the game when you start 0 ‑16?  
COACH COLLEN: I think it's really hard. But it's indicative of this team, what
they've done. They got behind 0‑4 in the SEC, they battled back and won eight
in a row, won 10 of 12, won the first round here. I never had any doubts in my
mind we'd be able to come back from it, like I don't have any doubts in my
mind that as much as this is a heartbreaking loss, they'll bounce back and
find a way to do what they need to do in the last game of the season and the
NCAA tournament.  
It's a learning lesson. You never stop learning in life. One of the great
things about the game of basketball and athletics in general is that you have
a chance to get back up and grow from this kind of thing. I'm sure these kids
will do it.  
  
Q. You mentioned a learning lesson. In the locker room after a game like
this, is the vibe frustration, anger?  
COACH COLLEN: I can't really tell you what it is. The players could probably
tell you better than me. I think they're probably disappointed. More
disappointed maybe in themselves than anything else. I think they probably all
felt like they had a hand where they could have done one simple thing better,
made one more shot, and that would have made all the difference in the world.  
You can ask them and they might have a better answer for you.  
ASHLEY DANIELS: The vibe in the locker room isn't a good one. At the same time
we're a team that sticks together. We try to fight through adversity. Like
coach said, we do kind of have the increment of doubt in our mind that at this
play; I should have done this; at this shot I could have got this rebound.  
Me, I feel like at the beginning of the game we came out flat, but we stuck
together, kept going. The game just didn't turn out the way we wanted to at
the end.  
But we still have a ways to go. We have a lot ahead of us. We're just going to
stick together and try to take advantage of the opportunities still lies
ahead.  
  
Q. C'eira, if you could take me through the few minutes and hit some big
shots and the final possession.  
C'EIRA RICKETTS: Oh, well, I don't know. My shot just came off. They normally
pay attention to me driving. They started backing off from me. The last
possession, I ran my hardest getting down there. I got down there, got a
pretty good look at the rim. Felt like I got fouled, but they didn't call it.
That's the way it goes, so...  
  
Q. C'eira, the physicality in the league this year, you mentioned that last
play where you felt like you got fouled. Talking to a couple teams earlier,
has it changed at all as you've grown up in the league? Has it become more
physical?  
C'EIRA RICKETTS: Yeah, it's kind of more physical. The refs, they're letting
us play more and more. But they have a good feel for the game. They don't let
it get out of hand too much.  
I think they did a good job of ref'ing the game. But it's gotten way more
physical.  
ASHLEY DANIELS: I agree with C'eira. Everyone's game has developed and
everyone is getting stronger throughout the season, the pre‑season. While
growing up in this league, things have changed. Like she said with the refs,
they let us get physical in there, but at the same time they don't let us do
too much. You may have thought you got fouled, but you may have done the same
thing to the next person, so it goes both ways.  
  
Q. Last year you had a tune ‑up game for the post‑season as well. I believe
it was the same team. What is the philosophy of scheduling that last game? How
important is that? What are you looking to get?  
COACH COLLEN: When I came into the league, one of the things I recognized
right off the bat is if you're going to go in post‑season play, there's a
17‑game gap between the SEC tournament and the first NCAA game. It was a
little frustrating to me.  
With that said, you were trying to cram 30 games into a calendar that's one
week shorter than the men's calendar. I thought that was very, very hard on
our kids. I made up our mind I was going to try to schedule a game after the
SEC tournament with the expectation that we were going to be playing one way
or the other in the NIT or the NCAA.  
Last year we did it, it was fine. This year we have to go to a pretty good
team, Southern Illinois Edwardsville. I'm sure that will be a good challenge
for us, but it will give us a chance to bounce back, play a game, hopefully
play well and get a win leading into the NCAA tournament.  
There's not a lot of teams that have an opportunity to do that. The teams that
win their conference championships, they're the only ones. It will give us an
opportunity to bounce back and enter the NCAA on a positive note.  
  
Q. I know coaches love this question. Could you project what sort of seed
you think you'll get in the NCAA tournament?  
COACH COLLEN: You know, I think it's pretty hard. I've been doing this for 30
years. I feel like I could guess, but that's all it would be.  
The one thing I have confidence in is that the SEC had a strong season, I
think the strongest season of all the conferences. I think we have eight teams
that will finish in the top 30 to 35. I know we've got six wins against top‑35
teams. When I looked at it the other day, there were maybe 10 teams in the
country that had that.  
I think our résumé will speak for itself. It will be a good seed. It would be
nice if it was in Little Rock, Arkansas. The way the tournament is held now,
it's difficult. They have so much difficulty moving people around on the home
court sites. They really have their work cut out for them.  
So hopefully when it's all said and done, I know we're going to get a good
seed, I just hope we don't end up with a 5 seed playing a 12 on their floor.
That would be brutal. I've seen some mock brackets that look like that.  
Hopefully the SEC has garnered enough respect that they wouldn't do that to
us, if we earned the right to get a good seed, they wouldn't make us play
somebody on their home floor. It's going to happen to somebody. If it happens
to us, we'll just deal with it.

_NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE_  
  

Kentucky  71  
Florida  67

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Florida head coach Amanda Butler, Azania
Stewart and Jordan Jones.  
Coach, if you could start with some opening comments.  
COACH BUTLER: I just first have to congratulate Kentucky on a hard‑fought
battle. They certainly wouldn't go away. We had some moments in this game
where we looked like the better team. They always fought back and answered.  
A'dia is a Player of the Year for a reason. She definitely showed that. I was
very proud of our team, the way we fought, the way we played. If we could have
done a little bit better job of keeping ourselves out of foul trouble, maybe
we would have been the first team up here in the press conference.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. For the players, when they started making their run in the second half,
how tough was it to stop Mathies?  
AZANIA STEWART: We were trying to fight the momentum that they were getting
back. You just go on. Like coach says, Mathies is a good player. We knew they
were trying to run their offenses through her. We just tried to switch up
defenses, you know, tried to throw different things at them. We had our runs
and they had theirs.  
JORDAN JONES: They're a great team. We knew they were going to go on a run.
When we got that lead in the first half, they weren't going to lay down and
quit. That's what makes them a great team.  
Mathies is a great player. We knew it was going to go through her and we got
beat by a great player tonight.  
  
Q. Coach, what were you all able to do? The last time you played Kentucky,
you stopped Mathies. She only had two points in that game. What was the
difference with what happened in the second half today?  
COACH BUTLER: She's playing a little bit more fuller, which is a tough matchup
for her. If you switch your 4 and your 3, defensively they put you in some
tough spots.  
I think A'dia could answer that question better than me. I just think she came
into this game knowing how important it was. I think she had a lot of respect
for our team, knew she hadn't played her best in previous outings against us.
She played like the Player of the Year.  
Our game plan wasn't any different. She made plays and hit shots that in the
previous matchups she had missed.  
  
Q. Coach, what kind of impact do you think the insertion of Amber Smith in
the second half played into the way the second half played out?  
COACH BUTLER: Well, they have such a versatile group of kid. Having Conwright
playing the point sometimes is a great advantage. When you have a kid like
Amber, who is a true point guard, known her a long time, really proud of the
career she's had, especially as a Florida kid, I think it gives them maybe a
little bit more confidence of having a true floor general out there.  
A'dia's performance was outstanding. They really collectively in the second
half all chipped in and did what they had to do, did their jobs really well,
Amber included.  
  
Q. Coach, how frustrating or big of a factor was free ‑throw shooting down
the stretch for you guys?  
COACH BUTLER: It was important. Everything was important. We knew it was going
to be a ballgame that would be won or lost by two or three points, one or two
possessions. You look at every missed free throw. You look at every missed cue
offensively. You look at every foul.  
Free throws certainly contributed to it. We didn't down the stretch hit a
couple of those that we should have. I think we expected to. But I think
there's a lot of things we could single out and say, This possession here,
this stop there. We just didn't close out the way we needed to.  
  
Q. Coach, now the tough part: sitting and waiting. Do you think you made
your case this is a NCAA tournament team?  
COACH BUTLER: I don't think there's any doubt at all. The way we closed out
February, I think even this game in the face of losing again by a few points,
I think we definitely showed we deserve to be in that field.  
These kids, there's no question, have got a lot more basketball to play. It
would be a travesty if it was any other way.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.

### [Ashley Bruner](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23259)

### [Dawn Staley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15625)

### [Aleigsha Welch](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23260)

  
_NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE_  
  

South Carolina  59  
Georgia  55

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by South Carolina head coach Dawn Staley, and
Aleighsa Welch and Ashley Bruner.  
We'll take questions.  
  
Q. It seemed like y'all were making a concentrated effort to go inside, stay
away from the three ‑point line. Was that the game plan going in?   
ASHLEY BRUNER: Part of the game was to get the ball in the paint whether it
was passing the ball or getting it to the post.  
ALEIGHSA WELCH: I think the last game we let their post players get kind of
what they wanted. We watched a lot of film. It really did get to us how they
were scoring at will.  
We knew we needed to come out and play our game.  
  
Q. Talk about what it means to make the semifinals.  
COACH STALEY: I think it's great for our program. I think, again, our seniors,
they've seen this program from being 10‑18, to now participating in the
semifinals of the SEC tournament.  
I think it's something we've been working for all year long. They're
definitely leaving a legacy that hopefully will continue for a long time.  
  
Q. I think you might have said yesterday that Ieasia was hoping to get a
rematch with Georgia because they eliminated you last year. Has anybody been
wanting to take on Tennessee again?  
COACH STALEY: You know, I think we have some confidence. I think it's a
neutral site. Tennessee played a tough game today. We played a tough game
today. The fact we did beat them on their floor does help with our confidence
level. At this time of the season, if we do stick to our game plan and
execute, we can give ourselves a shot at winning it. That's all we did in this
particular game.  
  
Q. What does it mean you won this game with what ended up making three
‑point shots, that that wasn't going for you at all tonight?  
COACH STALEY: For us, I think our players, their legs got a little bit weary.
They just settled for taking outside shots, the three‑point shots a little bit
too much. At the same time when we were rebounding the way we were, the way
our post players were making plays in the paint, it just happened like that in
this particular game.  
Hopefully we won't rely on shooting the three ball, especially shooting it the
way we did. What I'm most proud of is our ability to knock down free throws.
That's the difference. We lose a basketball game like this if we don't shoot
70% from the free‑throw line.  
  
Q. Is it kind of incredible looking back the last two games that you have
been pretty automatic considering what the stats are?  
COACH STALEY: It's something that we want to point out but we don't want to
jinx ourselves because we're shooting it at a pretty decent percentage. For
us, games like this we lose, and we have to point to our free‑throw
percentage, our free‑throw performance.  
We do have to congratulate our team for knocking them down, sealing the deal.  
  
Q. It seemed like in the last five minutes, you would miss shots, but you
would get the rebounds, have two or three possessions in a row. What was the
key to that? How do you think Georgia reacted when they weren't able to get
the ball?  
ASHLEY BRUNER: I think it's hustle play. I don't know what they were thinking.
Didn't care. Just went to the boards.  
ALEIGHSA WELCH: I think we tried to drain them out as much as possible. We
played the game yesterday. Anybody would come in thinking our legs were gone.
It's disheartening when you play defense for a whole possession, then you give
up a defensive rebound. We wanted to drain out the clock as much as possible
because we knew we couldn't trade buckets with them.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Ashley's contribution.  
COACH STALEY: She has been playing well from the offensive end. We feel like
we can create an advantage with her at the high post or on the block because
she has pretty decent footwork. I think with Ashley, she wants to score. She
wants to score every time down the floor. She screams at our perimeter players
to give her the ball.  
Fortunately for us, she made some key baskets down the stretch. Also she
raised her free‑throw percentage by making four out of nine.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
COACH STALEY: When we inserted Tina into the game early in the first half, we
felt like Tina could stretch the defense out. We know she shoots the outside
shot. I put a bug in her ear to say, Don't rely on shooting outside shots, put
the ball on the floor. She made some things happen for us.  
  
Q. Considering how you did shoot from the outside, the outside was important
in Knoxville. What are you going to do to get that reinvigorated tomorrow
night?  
COACH STALEY: I mean, it's what we do. Our kids are going to take shots within
their limitations. If they're open from outside the three, they're a
three‑point shooter, we're going to encourage them to toe the line and knock
down shots. People that can get the ball in the paint by driving, penetrating,
we'll encourage them to do that.  
For the most part our defense has been our staple. We'll have to create some
stops, get some easy opportunities from our defense.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.

### [LaSondra Barrett](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19292)

### [Nikki Caldwell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21947)

### [Adrienne Webb](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21770)

  
_NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE_  
  

LSU  41  
Arkansas  40

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by LSU head coach Nikki Caldwell, and Adrienne
Webb and LaSondra Barrett.  
COACH CALDWELL: First off, I love this time of year. I love being back in the
SEC, what this is all about, one of the toughest conferences in the country.
Arkansas is a great team, knew it was going to be a battle.  
I'm proud of my team for showing resilience, staying together and coming out
with the win.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Adrienne, talk about the play. Tell us about that winning basket.  
ADRIENNE WEBB: Well, we pushed the ball up the floor. Kicked it ahead to me
since I was open. I'm used to hitting three‑pointers. But, I mean, nothing has
been bigger than this three‑pointer.  
I just kept thinking back to the speech that coach gave us in the locker room
about, We are champions, just thinking about that moment. I just kept
thinking, We are champions, we are champions. It showed in the shot.  
  
Q. LaSondra, if you can talk about the final sequence.  
LaSONDRA BARRETT: Originally, we were supposed to foul. But she did foul, but
they didn't call it. I don't know, I just made a play on instinct. I knew she
would try to attack because she had just made the last couple baskets.  
I don't know, just tried to have my teammates' back and just be there.  
  
Q. Back to the speech, what inspired you to send that message?  
COACH CALDWELL: Well, it's one of my favorite motivational speeches that I've
heard. It's entitled, Who am I? It talks about things that you won't accept.
You won't accept defeat. It talks about how you will stand together through
thick and thin, through adversity. You lean on your teammates. They would then
chant after. I would say, Who am I; they would chant, I am a champion.  
I feel like this team, through all of its ups and downs, adversities, that
they have exemplified the characteristics of a champion. Tonight it showed in
their play. I definitely have seen it all year.  
  
Q. Coach, part of the final run, points were tough to come by, a lot of
turnovers. Do you feel like Arkansas caused those or what happened there?  
COACH CALDWELL: Well, credit to Arkansas for getting after our guard play
defensively. But we turned the ball over a lot throughout the entire year.
That has a lot to do with players playing out of position. We had the swing
players with the loss of Destiny. We talk about good turnovers versus bad
turnovers. Some of those turnovers led to transition points for them, so those
weren't the good turnovers.  
Arkansas did a great job of executing their game plan. When you're only
scoring 40 and 41 points, that's a defensive battle. We obviously wanted to
make it just as tough on them as they were making it on us.  
  
Q. LaSondra, were you frustrated during the game? You had to sit a long
stretch. What did you feel when you came back in the second half?  
LaSONDRA BARRETT: I mean, it's always frustrating not being able to contribute
with your team. But, I mean, it's part of the game. I just tried to be the
biggest cheerleader on the bench, not get in my own head, because that
wouldn't help the team.  
In the second half, I just tried to get aggressive, get in the paint. They had
a smaller guard guarding me so we ran a lot of high‑low action, ball screens.  
I mean, I didn't have to do much when Adrienne Webb shoots the ball like she
does, so...  
  
Q. Something I've noticed that is a trend for you this year is you don't
have to take a lot of shots to win games. Where does the patience come from to
not want to rush in the offense?  
LaSONDRA BARRETT: I think we just want to establish our tempo. We get our
transition game going, knowing when and when not to push the ball. I think
when we establish that, we dictate the pace of the game.  
I think that fits us. That fits us in the halfcourt set. Although we can run,
but just slowing things down, slowing the tempo. Arkansas had a lot of guard
play, drive and kick. Just slow that down, get a lot of stops on defense helps
us out.  
  
Q. Coach, you probably feel like you have to take your game up a notch
tomorrow. Talk about the Kentucky game.  
COACH CALDWELL: Again, we felt that tonight with Arkansas. Just watching this
tournament, you feel the same way when you looked at the games prior to our
game. Everybody feels like they have to dial it up a notch because it's truly,
truly competitive in our conference.  
Games have gone either way. Florida had a great game plan. Kentucky did, too.
Kentucky just pulled away at the end. So the competition as far as dialing it
up a level, now you got to really dial it up because everybody has continued
to advance.  
But it's been that way all through the conference. When you look at this year,
in particular, the versatility, the different type of players you have in this
conference, we have some of the best players in the country here, which
obviously is why there are records.  
But against a team like Kentucky, they're going to be aggressive, they're
going to want to turn it over. We're going to try to stay patient and take
care of the basketball. We're not going to deviate from our game plan or feel
like we have to rush or anything. But there are some areas we have to change
as far as our mentality, that starts with our board play. I thought tonight
Arkansas exposed us on the boards, and we've got to do a much better job of
doing that in our next game.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.

Tennessee  68  
Vanderbilt  57

  
THE MODERATOR: We are now joined by Vanderbilt head coach Melanie Balcomb,
Christina Foggie and Stephanie Holzer.  
Coach, if you could give us some opening comments.  
COACH BALCOMB: You know, I think this is a frustrating finish for us. We had
every opportunity down the stretch. We played hard, fought hard, made good
adjustments, just didn't make the plays. Ball didn't fall the right way. Shots
didn't go in.  
I think we're a better basketball team than we showed tonight. That's what's
disappointing. But I think we have a lot to look forward to. We fought back,
played hard. We're the best basketball team we've been all season right now.  
Tennessee did a great job. Came out with a lot of energy. Defensively did a
great job. Obviously, they used the time to prepare for us while we were
preparing for Mississippi State, and used that time well. They were very
prepared tonight.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. In the past few weeks you talked a lot about Christina Foggie's
development as a scorer in this league. Can you talk about Stephanie Holzer's
development as a young post player in the SEC.  
COACH BALCOMB: I think Stephanie has done the same thing Foggie has done all
season: just get better and better and learn how to play in college.  
She was injured a lot last year, as well ‑ both of them were. She had a lot of
struggles physically. I think she used this year mentally just to learn how to
fight through adversity, how to keep getting better, how to keep playing when
things aren't perfect or go your way.  
She's an incredible competitor and a strong leader. I think her best
basketball is ahead of her. Really proud of her development right now.  
  
Q. Coach, why do you think you got off to a slow start? Seemed like their 2
‑3 zone created some problems.   
COACH BALCOMB: We shot the ball well the first couple possessions, hit shots.
After that, we didn't get the ball inside. We didn't penetrate. We didn't go
inside out.  
It's big. It's spread out. We just didn't attack it like we needed to. We
didn't get any second shots because when you don't get penetration, or you get
the ball inside, they've got everybody in position to rebound. That hurt us,
as well, no second shots.  
  
Q. For the players, compare matchups with Tennessee, which I know is one of
your biggest rivals within the conference, from a physicality standpoint, how
hard it is physically to the other games that you play in conference.  
STEPHANIE HOLZER: I think personally this conference as a whole has gotten a
lot stronger. Especially this year, every team has brought that and stepped it
up a level.  
I think since everyone has raised their levels, we're going to see a lot
better basketball in the SEC.  
CHRISTINA FOGGIE: I would agree with Stephanie. Every team we faced this year
has been very physical and aggressive on defense. Like she said, we're going
to see a lot more aggressiveness as a whole in the SEC over the next few
years.  
  
Q. Coach, I think there were a handful of possessions you had in the second
half that you had a chance to take the lead. Would it have made a difference
if you got the lead, momentum ‑wise, an extra boost?  
COACH BALCOMB: I think it always makes a difference if you could break
through. I did realize at that time we got close. There were a couple,
probably three possessions in a row that I thought we had a good chance of
scoring. It got very physical, but we did not finish.  
  
Q. In those situations, is it just as simple that the shots didn't fall? Is
it more to it?  
COACH BALCOMB: You guys go ahead.  
STEPHANIE HOLZER: I don't know if it's the shots not falling made us tight
more so than not crashing the boards, getting rebounds, getting second shots
off of that. We've had bad shooting nights before. I think that's a major part
to our game, is rebounding.  
CHRISTINA FOGGIE: I specifically remember a three‑possession stretch where we
scored or we traveled. It went in and then went out.  
I think it could go either way. But getting that lead would have been a huge
momentum burst for us. Our play doesn't solely rest on those possessions.  
  
Q. The other day you talked about being here in your backyard in Nashville,
the other teams traveled. Today's crowd seemed a little tilted.  
COACH BALCOMB: A little tilted, that's a nice way of saying it (laughter).  
It's tough. What I struggle with is the crowd that we do get is a lot smaller,
but it's all spread out in the arena. I don't know how that works. I'd like to
at least have our crowd in one section so we could see them and feel
supported, and that doesn't seem to happen here. I think that would help
everybody.  
You know, Tennessee draws so well. It's so close to Knoxville. They have great
women's basketball fans and support. They dominate the arena ‑ when it's this
close especially.  
So, yeah, it did feel like we were playing at Tennessee, although we're in
Nashville.  
  
Q. The delay at halftime didn't hurt the momentum. Was it good to have that
extra time with your team?  
COACH BALCOMB: I don't think that probably affected either team. Probably both
teams would like to rest a little bit more, get their thoughts together.  
I think for our team, a lot of it is mental. I think we talked about some good
things. We felt fresh. We don't have the bench they have and the depth they
have.  
We thought the longer we rested the better it is. We didn't have a problem
with it.  
  
Q. For the players, obviously it's a disappointing loss. Can you talk about
the mood of your team and teammates.  
CHRISTINA FOGGIE: Like you said, it's a disappointing loss because we fought
till the end. But I think we're very proud of each other. We stayed together.
We played really hard. We know we have the best ahead of us. We're very
confident in each other and trust each other. We're in a good spot right now.  
STEPHANIE HOLZER: I personally think all my teammates are amazing. Coach is
saying the girls that go the farthest have the most fun together because they
want to stay and play till the end.  
In March, we're going to be a little crazy and show up and surprise a few
people.  
  
Q. For all three of you, with the delay, what's going on, I don't know how
aware you were of tornados everywhere. Does it take away focus? Are you
concerned? Are you so zoned in you don't think about friends or family that
may be affected by what's going on?  
COACH BALCOMB: No. I told them. I had to tell Foggie three times, There's
tornados.  
CHRISTINA FOGGIE: We have tornado warnings all the time at school. We stay in
our dorms and are fine.  
COACH BALCOMB: We have a false sense of security, obviously.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.

# [SOUTHEASTERN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=SOUTHEASTERN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 1, 2012

  

### [Tina Roy](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23246)

### [Dawn Staley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15625)

### [La'Keisha Sutton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19265)

  
_NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE_  
  

South Carolina  57  
Alabama  38

  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by South Carolina head coach Dawn Staley and
La'Keisha Sutton and Tina Roy. We'll take questions, please.  
  
Q. La'Keisha, wondered if you could talk about the team's defense. What was
the defense doing well to force a lot of turnovers?  
La'KEISHA SUTTON: I think we did a good job of pressuring the ball. Our post
players did a good job. Our post players were just getting in front, playing
on the block. We were just trying to sit on their right hands and put up the
block. They're a good driving team.  
  
Q. Coach, could you talk about La'Keisha's performance, especially in the
first half. Offensively she seemed to spark you guys.  
COACH STALEY: La'Keisha is playing like a senior, captain of our basketball
team. She's playing like she's been here before, and she has for the last four
years.  
She's certainly a calm amongst the storm. We had a couple of turnovers early.
But once we felt comfortable putting the ball in her hands to do something
positive, she did that in the first half.  
  
Q. Coach, what does it mean to be able to have rested your starters for 10
minutes in the second half?  
COACH STALEY: It's always a great thing, especially in this type of tournament
format. We put ourselves in a position where we have to win four in a row.
We're here for the long haul. Fortunately for us we got out to a big lead
where we could rest some of the players that played heavy minutes for us.  
  
Q. To get back into the game with free throws, how much of a surprise was
that to you? What were you doing when the team was making 11 straight from the
line?  
COACH STALEY: We've been on the other side of the percentages, which isn't
very good. I think we kind of not jinxed ourselves and talked about it. We
kind of let the game flow as far as from the free‑throw line situation. It's
good that we had our best free throw shooter, which is La'Keisha, shooting the
majority of them. It's good to see Ashley get a couple to go down, raise her
percentage.  
  
Q. Tina, this is your first SEC tournament game. What was it like out there?
How did you calm yourself down?  
TINA ROY: It felt real good. Coach always tells me to be ready when I go in
the game to knock down the shots. That's what I felt like I did, get my feet
ready, being set.  
  
Q. Coach, tomorrow's game against Georgia, you had a real close game here in
the second half of the season. Odds are you're expecting another tight one
tomorrow?  
COACH STALEY: I hope it's just like tonight. But Georgia is a very good
basketball team. I think they have an advantage because they didn't have to
play tonight.  
But we know exactly the types of things they want to do. Hopefully we can
disrupt the flow of their offense, hopefully shoot a little better than we
shot tonight.  
  
Q. La'Keisha, you scored 7 of the team's first 9. Was it just their defense
or were you trying to do a little too much after that?  
La'KEISHA SUTTON: I think they did a good job of putting people in the paint,
trying to stop the job. I was trying to get fouled to get to the free‑throw
line. I credit their defense, but we ran our plays.  
  
Q. How much of a confidence booster is it going into tomorrow where you can
try to get to your first semifinal?  
COACH STALEY: At this stage of the game, the more wins, the more opportunities
we have to get closer to winning an SEC championship, as well as just
continuing to build our résumé as far as NCAA, being an NCAA hopeful.  
Anytime you can get a win, looking at our history, it's always a great thing.  
  
Q. Are there some things you want the team to improve on in the game
tomorrow?  
COACH STALEY: Compared to tonight or the first time we played Georgia?  
There's a lot of things we can improve on. Our shooting percentage is one. We
had some unforced turnovers. We need to take care of the basket a little
better. Our defense has to be sharper than what it was. Seemed like tonight we
were off for a while, when this is our normal time to play.  
We're looking forward to the challenge of playing Georgia, a team that is very
good, very skilled. We just have to make sure our defense comes to play.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.

# [SOUTHEASTERN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=SOUTHEASTERN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 1, 2012

  

### [Renee Ladner](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18026)

### [Valencia McFarland](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21777)

  
_NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE_  
  

Arkansas  67  
Ole Miss  47

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Ole Miss coach Renee Ladner and Valencia
McFarland.  
Coach, if you could start with some opening comments.  
COACH LADNER: I understand why Arkansas is the hottest team in the league.
They came out ready to play. They seemed to be on a mission. They're just
getting a little bit better with each game. Played with a lot of confidence
and caused us a lot of problems early on.  
I tip my hat to Arkansas, they did an outstanding job. Put us in a hole early
and we never could get out of it.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Coach, you have a couple of positives from tonight. You out ‑rebounded
Arkansas. You forced them into 15 turnovers. How do you take those positives
and build off them?  
COACH LADNER: All year long we've done some really good things. Tonight we
missed a lot of shots. We had a lot of opportunities to rebound the
basketball.  
The thing I love the most about this basketball team is they don't ever quit.
They fight and they fight some more. We did cause them to make a lot of
turnovers.  
What it does is it allows us to understand that being as young as we are, we
can press, we can turn people over. We just have to be able to finish our
shots. We had a lot of turnovers. I'm not sure how many of those we converted
into points.  
Nine underclassmen on the floor. I started four freshmen and a sophomore
sitting beside me. The future is extremely bright. If they can learn to move
off that, they're going to be very strong in the league.  
  
Q. Talk about what Valencia has meant to you and how you can build off her
for the future.  
COACH LADNER: I tell everybody all the time that I have the best open‑court
point guard in the conference. Valencia is talented. She sees the floor so
well. A lot of times our young kids are not ready to play with her.  
What can she not do? She can take you off the dribble. She can shoot the
three. Probably her biggest fault is she's unselfish. I would like her to take
20 shots a game, she wants to take three. When she doesn't take enough shots,
we struggle to score.  
For her next year, she's got to learn to shoot the ball a lot more. She's got
to make the younger kids step up and understand their role. I think she's
game. I think she can do that. She's just very talented, and I was very
fortunate to be able to coach her the past two years.  
  
Q. Valencia, how have you seen your game progress this year? How have you
grown throughout the season?  
VALENCIA McFARLAND: Last year they played me for the three‑point shot. Coming
into this season, I had to make my three‑point shot a threat, so that's what I
worked on.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.

### [Sharon Fanning-Otis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16876)

### [Diamber Johnson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21780)

### [Porsha Porter](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23233)

  
_NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE_  
  

Vanderbilt  67  
Mississippi State  51

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Mississippi State head coach Sharon
Fanning‑Otis, Diamber Johnson and Porsha Porter.  
Coach, if you could start off with some comments.  
COACH FANNING‑OTIS: When we went in at halftime, I felt if we could take care
of the basketball, have some consistent effort, some more shots would fall for
us in the second half, and rebound the basketball a little bit better. I
thought in the second half we did that. Got within three. Tremendous team
effort. I was really proud of them.  
At that point you have to get a stop somewhere. You have to get a stop. You
cannot give up a free throw. I mean, obviously if you look at the stats, you
can see that's a huge difference, 21 to 4. We needed to take the ball at them,
be a little more patient.  
We only had one assist at halftime. So we saw each other better. But I felt
like we may have needed an extra pass. But we definitely needed to get to the
free‑throw line. You may need a pump fake. You need an offensive board with
second‑chance points. I don't think that we finished the way that we should
have there.  
Trying to hold them under 40% from the field was a goal, and for us to get
above 40%. Didn't quite achieve that. Especially their three‑point shots made
a big difference. You have to let a team make a mistake, not give them
second‑chance points, make sure not to let them get to the free‑throw line as
easily as we did.  
But Vanderbilt is a great team. When I look at their scoring, I see four
people in double figures, a couple more knocking on the door. They've had
several people that have done that, several different rotations. They don't
play maybe a lot of players, but players who understand what to do on the
floor, how to play well together. I'm proud of what they've done.  
I think our SEC is so very competitive. I really, really see eight teams that
have an ability to get to this NCAA tournament. We wish all of them the best.
This experience that we've had with a group, a couple of freshmen that are in
starting lineups.  
I've said this before, Diamber is the one player on this basketball team that
this year had already been to every gym to play with a lot of minutes.
Danielle Rector had been in there. She redshirted a year. Diamber is the one
that has carried the minutes in these last four years.  
She changed positions a couple of years ago, brought along Porter. To see this
young lady on the All Team SEC, see one of our freshman that was on the All
Freshman team, I'm very proud of it. I think there's good years ahead for this
young class because we have freshmen in the lineup and backing up with a
couple more.  
Anyway, Diamber has worked hard to develop those leadership skills that we've
needed. Sometimes there's been breakdowns on the floor because of some
experience. I know even the seniors, Porter and Brown and Bett, who rotated
key roles in the senior class, this is their second year with us. Bett just
second year and a semester actually with her. So there was a lot of learning
that had to take place.  
When you can get a team, they play hard, finish as hard as they can, I'm very,
very proud of that. Look forward to following their careers, their seniors as
they get jobs, the reality of real life now and these young players.  
Our basketball program has been in the finals of an SEC championship. We've
been to a Sweet 16. It's time now for Mississippi State to step up and to win
a championship and get to the Elite 8 and Final Four. I look forward to
following that progress.  
On the other side of the coin, I will be in the Bulldog Club working on
fundraising, working with all our sports program. I do thank the university
for the opportunity to serve as their head coach for these years. It's been a
tremendous experience. Again, just look forward to serving the university in a
very special way, a little bit different, but still giving to these young
student‑athletes.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Sharon, talk a little bit about what it's meant to you being the coach at
Mississippi State.  
COACH FANNING‑OTIS: I told Mr. Templeton, our athletic director, who was there
when I was hired, and of course to extend to Scott, our present AD, Greg,
those three guys, they've given me a tremendous opportunity.  
I think what makes it so special is the people. Small college town, usually
the community embraces that university. Got involved with church when I first
got there. It's just the friends.  
I think in life as we look back on whatever we do, usually the people we work
with, that's where the memories come from, the people who you've been with,
all the players, all the coaches, anybody that you worked with at the
university.  
But it's just a special community. It's a great time to be at Mississippi
State, from our leadership, from our president on down. It's great. We see
facilities getting in a position where all of our sports can compete in the
SEC at the very top. I know we're all expecting championships. I am very
thankful for that, very thankful for the blessing of being able to continue to
work with the university.  
  
Q. For the student ‑athletes, if you could sum up what Coach Fanning‑Otis
has meant to you and this program while you've been there.   
DIAMBER JOHNSON: Well, I've been here for four years. Every year, you look at
my career, it's grown every year. It's because of this woman here to the left
of me. She's guided me in every aspect on and off the court, has really helped
me become who I am today on and off the court.  
I'm glad she gave me the opportunity to be here. I wouldn't have wanted to be
anywhere else regardless. She shared great experiences. I'm glad I got to
experience that with her and the Bulldog family.  
THE MODERATOR: Porsha.  
PORSHA PORTER: I just want to thank Coach Fanning for giving me the
opportunity to play at Mississippi State. She has taught me well on and off
the court. I'm going to miss her. I'm going to miss my teammates. That's it.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.

# [SOUTHEASTERN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2012&title=SOUTHEASTERN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 1, 2012

  

### [Kyra Crosby](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23247)

### [Wendell Hudson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19262)

  
_NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE_  
  

South Carolina  57  
Alabama  38

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Alabama head coach and Kyra Crosby. Coach, some
opening comments.  
COACH HUDSON: I thought it was one of those games where South Carolina, we
were playing pretty good, South Carolina went on a run right before the half,
five‑minute period there where they scored 16 points and we didn't score. We
struggled a little bit.  
I thought we played hard. But it's hard to come back. We were not able to
score. I thought Kyra did a really good job in the post for us, was a bright
spot from an offensive standpoint for us. South Carolina had something to do
with the way we played.  
I just thought we had opportunities and didn't take advantage of the
opportunities. But as far as playing hard and giving a good effort, I thought
both teams played very hard. South Carolina shot the ball better. You look at
their shooting percentages, wasn't much better than ours. They went to the
line and converted those free throws. That was kind of the difference in the
game.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Kyra, talk about what they were doing in the first half that stifled you
offensively.  
KYRA CROSBY: I believe we beat ourselves. We weren't patient on offense. We
needed to attack them and do what we planned to do. All teams get ruffled in
tense situations.  
I think next time or next year we can do better because we learned from this.  
  
Q. Coach, there were some bright spots tonight, almost matching them in
rebounding. The positives you take away from this, how do you take this away
and go into the next season, how to improve?  
COACH HUDSON: One of the things I think we talked about a few minutes ago
about next year, it already started at the end of this game. We have to take
those positive things.  
I think Kyra was one of the big things we can take into next year, get her
healthy. If we can get her healthy, with the effort we got out of her tonight,
nobody know how much pain she's been in, not able to practice, come back.
That's the good thing for us because we know when she's healthy what she can
do. From that standpoint, that's something to build on for next year.  
There's a couple other things. Rebounding the basketball at times, we wasn't
bad. And getting the open shots. We didn't make them, but we got the open
shots. We have to step up, make those shots, have people step up and make
them, especially perimeter shots that would open up the inside so she wouldn't
be double‑teamed. Those are positive things we have to look forward to next
year.  
KYRA CROSBY: I mean, next year I hope we all have the same mindset, that we're
going to go hard in every practice, in every game. Every game is different.
But it's also in the same sense new. We have some new girls coming in.  
I just hope that next year we more focused to go against our opponents and to
know we have it at the end of the day. Doesn't matter what our record is, we
can't let those teams determine our fate. So that's how I feel.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

### [Lyndsay Harris](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23239)

### [C'eira Ricketts](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21760)

  
_NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE_  
  

Arkansas  67  
Ole Miss  47

  
THE MODERATOR: We are now joined by Arkansas head Coach Tom Collen and C'eira
Ricketts and Lyndsay Harris.  
Coach, if you could start us off with some opening comments.  
COACH COLLEN: Just proud of our kids, the way they came out and played early
in the game. We talked about trying to come out and play well early, first
four minutes, next four minutes. Thought we jumped out to a good lead. We shot
the ball well, our defense was good.  
Second half we did what we needed to do. Didn't put them away quite ‑‑ for a
while, but we made enough plays in spurts that got the lead up to 20 and kept
it there so we could rest some of our kids.  
All in all, it's been six years since Arkansas won a first‑round game in the
SEC tournament. I'm as proud of these kids as I can be that they stepped up
tonight and did it in a big way, and now we can prepare for our next game.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Tom, could you talk a little bit about what you did defensively, how much
you mixed things up early.  
COACH COLLEN: Yeah, I think we've been a pretty good defensive team all year
long. I give credit to my wife, she handles all that. I don't try to get
involved with it.  
We have a good scheme. I think we switch out ball screens pretty well with our
four player, keep people in front of us. We were worried about Byrd a little
bit. They didn't give her the ball early like we were afraid they might. We
controlled McFarland off the dribble.  
I think we rebounded okay with them. I felt like that was a key. I felt like
if there was one thing they could do, if they missed shots, they could get to
a lot of offensive rebounds if we didn't block it out. I thought we did a good
job of keeping them to one shot a possession, for the most part.  
  
Q. You shot almost 50% from the floor. How do you bring that up against a
tough LSU team that's been playing hot recently?  
COACH COLLEN: I think I'd rather go into that game shooting 50% than shooting
35%, which is what we normally shoot.  
We're very up and down, a little inconsistent with our shooting. We know that.
Our defense has always been our forté all year long, been our strength.  
We know they're going to come out and play a lot of zone against us. We're
going to need to be able to make threes at some level, the way we shot the
ball against them down here, I don't think it can be all threes. I don't think
we can go out there and think we can shoot them out of their zone. Too good a
zone. I think we have to mix it in and out and we're going to have to shoot
the basketball well against them, no doubt about it. Our team is always good
defensively. When they step up and make shots, they can beat anybody. They'll
have to step up and make shots tomorrow.  
C'EIRA RICKETTS: Just like coach said, our defense, we count on our defense to
do a lot for us, to help us get going. We hope our shots fall tomorrow like
they did today. We have to just stay together.  
  
Q. Coach, talk about what the difference was in the two games with LSU and
what you'll emphasize for tomorrow.  
COACH COLLEN: It was what we just talked about. The game was tight early in
the first half when we were down there. I can't remember the exact minute
mark, maybe 10 or 12 minutes to go in the first half, we started knocking down
threes against them, gained a lot of confidence. Dominique Robinson hit some
threes, Lyndsay hit some threes. We were just on fire.  
I think they were probably shocked that we shot the ball as well as what we
did. We got such a huge lead, and we never let up. We kept the pedal down on
them the second half, kept making plays. They never really had a fighting
chance to get back in the game down there.  
The game at our place was completely different. It was a defensive battle. We
didn't make shots. They made some adjustments in their zone that I thought
were good adjustments. We've seen those, we feel like we know how to adjust
back against that now.  
But I think it will still come down to our ability to make shots and rebound.  
Definitely two games. The second game at our place looked a little bit more
like the way LSU looked defensively against most of the teams in the SEC. When
we played them down there, they didn't look like that at all. I think she
would probably tell you that.  
  
Q. Lyndsay, could you talk about the teams three ‑point shooting. Ole Miss,
they went to their zone. Were they daring you to shoot threes or were they
slow getting out there?   
LYNDSAY HARRIS: They were face guarding me. We have confident shooters. The
thing we try to work on in our zone is moving the ball, getting it into the
high post. I think our post players did a good job of finding our shooters
early.  
We were able to lose their defensive players around the three‑point line. Once
one person starts making them, I think everybody gets confident. We were
getting open shots and they were just falling today, so...  
COACH COLLEN: We spread it around, too. Lyndsay hit one. Dominique hit some. I
think the one that got us going that hurt Ole Miss was when Williams stepped
up and made back‑to‑back threes for us. I don't think they expected that.
She's a good three‑point shooter. Doesn't have a good percentage. I believed
it would go in the basket today, and it did. Hopefully it will tomorrow. We
need that.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

## March 1, 2012

  

### [Amanda Butler](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18040)

### [Jennifer George](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23230)

### [Jordan Jones](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21757)

  
_NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE_  
  

Florida  70  
Auburn  60

  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined now by Florida head coach Amanda Butler and
junior forward Jennifer George and senior guard Jordan Jones. We'll start with
opening comments from coach and then take questions.  
COACH BUTLER: We beat a really good team this afternoon. It was an important
win for us for a lot of reasons. Auburn being as good as they are, as capable
as they are, we knew we had to play well, and I think we did for the most
part.  
Didn't close out exactly as strong as we wanted to. But this time of year,
it's just about some times hanging on to survive long enough. I think we did
that. Really thought we did a great job from the free‑throw line, which again
this time of year is crucial, certainly in a ballgame like this.  
Was really proud of the way we played collectively because it's hard to keep
playing hard when you're not playing as perfect as you want to. I thought we
did a good job of maintaining our composure, the push at the end, stepping up
to the free‑throw line and having a lot of poise and knocking down those ones
that really kept them from really getting in striking distance.  
  
Q. Coach, we talked yesterday about how you felt it was important to get off
to a good start to combat the emotion.  
COACH BUTLER: I thought our start was important. I don't know that we felt
like the lead was comfortable. I don't think we ever really felt comfortable.
But definitely having a lead and feeling like you were at least in the
driver's seat was important for us. Trying to eliminate some of that emotion,
the togetherness we knew those kids were going to play with, and rightly so.  
Again, I thought we did a good job in the first half of combatting that a lot
with our defense, only giving up 25 points when Blanche was torching us and a
lot of other kids were making plays.  
I think that's what we wanted to do and, for the most part, we did that.  
  
Q. Jennifer and Jordan, you had a balanced attack. Talk about how you worked
the inside out games.  
UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: Well, we knew they were going to double inside. George
has had an amazing season, she draws a lot of attention. It makes it easy on
the guards. Takes a lot of pressure off us. Thought we got a lot of easy
shots. That's what great teams have, is a good guard and postgame. That's what
we're set up for right now.  
UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: Our guards did a great job inside and we kicked it back
out to them.  
  
Q. If we could look ahead to tomorrow's opponent, if each of you could give
me a thought that you think about when you think about the two games you had
against Kentucky this year.  
UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: Close. A couple possessions here and there. We're
talking about two games we would have won against Kentucky. We know we're
going to have to handle their pressure, be ready not to back down. I'm sure
we're going to watch a lot of film tonight, so it will be an exciting game
tomorrow.  
UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: Going off of that, I would say missed opportunities. I
think it's a few possessions here and there that could have gone our way and
could have had a different outcome for us.  
COACH BUTLER: I think that really captures a lot of what we initially feel. I
think the detail work in both of our games against Kentucky was not good. That
showed up in the turnover column, that showed up in the rebounding column,
that showed up in the free throw column.  
I think we've got to play really, really hard and with a tremendous amount of
fight, which is I think while we're in the position we're in, that can't
waiver. But we also have to play a good, detailed basketball game.  
  
Q. Coach, can you comment on this being Nell's last game and the impact
she's had on the game.  
COACH BUTLER: I think when you look at what Nell has done thus far, not just
in our league, which you look at all the different stages she's been
successful on as a basketball player, as a basketball coach representing our
league, our leagues, and our country, that's certainly hard to give you a
short answer.  
But I think when you get past wins and losses, SEC championship, coaching and
recruiting players like Dewanna Bonner and all those great things are easy to
read about, I think she's also one of the most likable coaches we've had in
our league. It's hard to be likable in our league sometimes because it's so
competitive. She's always someone that competed with a great spirit about her
and I think that's obvious that that's also the way she coaches her team.  
Some of the pregame comments of her players, the things they were saying about
her, that's probably the greatest demonstration of the impact she's had on the
game. It's been an honor to compete against her, lucky to have her as a
friend. She's been a great encouragement. We've had some disappointments that
are well‑documented this year and I always got an uplifting message from Nell,
and that is unique, but she's a unique person and we'll miss her.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.

_NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE_  
  

Vanderbilt  67  
Mississippi State  51

  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Vanderbilt head coach Melanie Balcomb,
Christina Foggie and Stephanie Holzer. We'll start with opening comments from
coach, then take questions.  
COACH BALCOMB: I just really liked our defense tonight. I thought we did a
great job of preventing the middle drive and rebounding, not giving second
shots.  
We took care of our turnovers. That's where they got most of their points. It
would have been even a greater effort. I think we did a good job on what our
goal tonight was to do, was to defend and rebound.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
COACH BALCOMB: I wasn't telling them anything. They were telling each other
what they wanted. They were leading. I just sat outside the huddle and
listened. It started with Steph and Jas and Foggie, all talking about their
body language, what they needed to change.  
They all accepted it. It was critical at times, accepted the criticism and
changed it. That's when I knew that we could make a run back and we could take
care of our business.  
They're leading each other right now. We have really good leadership. On the
court in March they better be able to lead because I can't play.  
  
Q. The foul line, the big discrepancy there.  
COACH BALCOMB: I thought we did a good job of getting the ball outside. They
were doubling down. In the second half I think they got tired of doubling
down, fouling us. Tiff and Steph and Foggie did a great job of getting to the
free‑throw line and making all their free throws, seemed really relaxed and
confident at the free‑throw line.  
  
Q. How big was Tiffany Clarke's play especially late on the glass?  
COACH BALCOMB: She got aggressive. I thought we all got a lot more aggressive
on the offensive boards, too, not just defensively, getting second shots.
Because we got tight on offense because the game got close. This is the game
that's the hardest. It's the one that you're supposed to win.  
When they started making a run, we lost a little confidence in our defense,
our scoring ability, we crashed the boards hard. I think Steph did, I think
Tiff did, I think Elan did and Foggie did. They all went to the glass, got the
ball out, kicked it out, hit some big shots, and got fouled, as well.  
  
Q. Can you talk about meeting up with Tennessee for a third time.  
COACH BALCOMB: I really haven't thought a lot about it. Like I said, our focus
was on Mississippi State.  
But, you know, now that I think about it, again it's not really who we're
playing, what the jersey color is going to be, what it's going to say, it's
going to be about our game plan and how well we execute it. That's what our
focus is going to be, is getting a game plan together and executing that the
best we can tomorrow.  
  
Q. Melanie, you mentioned the pressure on today. Obviously the pressure will
not be on you guys tomorrow. Do you feel like having the game under your belt,
not having the pressure on, do you feel that will help you or be an advantage
tomorrow?  
COACH BALCOMB: I've always said that it's not the end of the world if you
don't have the bye because you do get the opportunity, I believe, to play on
this court, and it is a different court. I think you saw this year every team
played way better at home than they did on the road.  
What I thought would be neat about this tournament is who plays well on a
neutral court. That's going to be really interesting because nobody knows
that.  
Sometimes not getting that bye gets you more comfortable with the floor. I
don't know if it will be an advantage, but we've already shot on it twice and
played on it once, and there is a comfort level there that our players will
have.  
  
Q. Melanie, do you feel like your team is an underdog playing Tennessee? You
beat them handily not that long ago.  
COACH BALCOMB: I would say we're the underdog 'cause they're ranked higher
than us, have a better record than us right now in this season. They're a
higher seed. I would think we would be the underdogs.  
  
Q. For the student ‑athletes, you were plus 13 on the boards tonight. Going
up against what arguably is one of the best rebounding teams in the SEC, how
do you plan to bring that tomorrow against Tennessee?   
CHRISTINA FOGGIE: I think definitely as a focus we have to team rebound and
that means not rely on the post rebounding. We want to get guards in there and
rebound a lot more. Tomorrow it's going to be important that all us five of
check out and all five of us get in there and rebound.  
STEPHANIE HOLZER: I agree exactly with what Fogg said. It's part of executing
our game plan against Tennessee. We know they're big and aggressive. We all
have to make an effort to get in there, make contact, and go after the balls.  
  
Q. Why do you think the press gave you so many problems today and is that
concerning going forward?  
STEPHANIE HOLZER: I think we got a little ahead of ourselves. We were really
anxious at first. We're in the SEC tournament. Like coach said, we needed to
get our feet wet.  
So tomorrow ‑‑ we had the chance to get that out of our system today, so
tomorrow we're going to approach Tennessee as, Okay, we're going to settle
down, be patient, we know this court, we know this team, let's get back to
executing our game plan.  
CHRISTINA FOGGIE: I agree.  
  
Q. Coach, can you tell me just what Christina Foggie has meant to the team
this year, the contributions this year, especially coming off injuries last
year?  
COACH BALCOMB: I think it's been huge. I don't think anybody expected her to
do what she's done so consistently all season.  
I knew she had an edge and an advantage because I knew she was a great
basketball player when I recruited her. I knew the troubles she went through
last year. She wasn't herself.  
I also knew that she went home over the summer to get better, came back
tougher, stronger mentally and physically.  
What I didn't know is she could maintain it the way she has. I thought she was
our hidden secret, that she didn't get named pre‑season anything. I think I
said that to her. I said, We have this secret that nobody knows about and is
ready to play.  
When she first started playing as well as she was, I wasn't surprised in
pre‑season. I wasn't surprised in the beginning of the SEC. What I was
surprised probably by was the consistency and the fact that as they started to
tag her tougher, deny her more, put their best defender on her every night,
box‑and‑one on her, she became more of a complete player. It challenged her to
make her a better basketball player. Instead of being the best three‑point
shooter in the league, she became the best scorer in the league.  
I'm really proud of her development and her being able to do that in a season.
That's hard to do.  
  
Q. For the players, are you looking forward to another shot at Tennessee
tomorrow?  
STEPHANIE HOLZER: They're a great team. They're one of our biggest rivals. We
have to go out there, have fun, keep working hard.  
  
Q. You picked up your 400th career win. What does that mean to you, just the
success that you've had?  
COACH BALCOMB: That I'm old (laughter). Sharon Fanning is leaving, so now I'm
the third oldest. All the people are talking about is that I'm the third
oldest in the SEC.  
It sounds like I coached a lot of games. But I don't get those wins, I don't
get any of them by myself. I don't get to play, like I said earlier. I wasn't
a real good player. Don't tell my players that.  
I feel like I've had so many good players in the past. Right now I have such a
strong staff around me. Because of the success I've had, I've been able to
continue that. Just really to continue coaching as long as I have because I
enjoy the players. I enjoy coaching them. I enjoy helping them. I like to see
them be successful.  
  
Q. Stephanie, how do you explain the wide ‑ranging results in these two
games between Tennessee? You made Tennessee look bad here. They beat you by 20
or more there.   
STEPHANIE HOLZER: I think it's about how we came out ready to play the game. I
think we started the first half at Tennessee, we were kind of anxious. The
second half we just let down and they kind of hit us and we didn't fight back.
I think the second time we played them, we were ready to fight back. We
started at the tip. That's how we were able to take them over.  
But I think it's going to be a good game. They're going to come at us ready to
play and we're going to do exactly the same thing. It will be a really good
game.  
  
Q. Last time you played, you won points in the paint. Why do you think you
dominated in that game? How important will it be to stay out of foul trouble
tomorrow?  
STEPHANIE HOLZER: I think we need to be smart like we need to be smart every
game. Our team is going to need us tomorrow. It's a bigger game. If we're not
in there, our guards are going to have trouble because they're going to be
pressured more. Having the ability to stay on the court and play inside out is
going to be a big advantage for us.  
COACH BALCOMB: And rebounding obviously. Every time you play Tennessee, you
better be ready to rebound. They're big, they're athletic. That's one of the
things why our record is what it is against Tennessee. A lot of it's been
rebounding.  
So far I think this is the best rebounding team I've had in the SEC. I think
that's what helped us the first time around. We need to do the same thing ‑
and even better ‑ because now it's post‑season and they're going to pick up
their effort and we're going to have to pick up ours.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.

_NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE_  
  

Florida  70  
Auburn  60

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Auburn head coach Nell Fortner, junior guard
Blanche Alverson and Tyrese Tanner.  
Coach, some comments.  
COACH FORTNER: I thought this team played extremely hard today and did
everything they could to give us a chance to win. I'm just so proud of their
effort. Just their determination down the stretch, I really thought we had a
shot all the way until about, what, 28 seconds.  
Just thought they worked hard. We just couldn't get to the free‑throw line
enough today. Kind of made the difference in the game.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions.  
  
Q. What was the locker room like after the game? Had to be an emotional
scene.  
COACH FORTNER: It was a little emotional. But, you know, we played hard. We
felt like we gave ourselves a shot to win the game. So it was kind of
emotional. But these kids are fighters. They put everything into it to get a
win.  
They'll be okay. They'll be all right.  
  
Q. Coach, just talk about how in the first half the boards were completely
lopsided, then you came out in the second half and showed up and the boards
were even. What brought your players out playing with a different mentality?  
COACH FORTNER: A matter of having 20 more minutes left in your season. It's a
one‑and‑done situation. That's a lot of motivation in and of itself. That's a
reminder of that.  
Specific things, they were killing us on the offensive boards in the first
half. It was the difference in the game. So we knew we had to battle back in
that regard, keep them off. We needed to get our own offensive boards.  
I think just a little more focus and determination to not let them dominate us
in that area.  
  
Q. For the student ‑athletes, just talk about what Coach Fortner has meant
to you and Auburn.   
BLANCHE ALVERSON: Well, it's a recruiting process, Coach Fortner was the
reason we all decided to come here. When she told us this would be her final
year, we were shocked and upset. A lot of our last few games have been coming
out and playing hard for her, giving it all we got just to finish out strong.  
THE MODERATOR: Tyrese.  
TYRESE TANNER: Just as Blanche was taking, Coach Fortner, with her leaving, it
meant a lot to us for her coaching us, so we're going to miss her.  
  
Q. Did you feel like the way you were down at halftime, you didn't lay down
in the second half, do you think that makes you feel better about the way you
played in your last game here?  
COACH FORTNER: I think they should feel really good about that because I
thought they played extremely well. I think it was an effort, the second‑half
effort, was I think how I envisioned us playing all year long. The aggression
on trapping screens, the rotations, attacking the basket. It was 20 minutes of
really how we've wanted to play all year. Just kind of eluded us a little bit.  
They should feel very proud of how they finished the season. They should feel
great going into the spring and summer, getting ready for next year, because
they're going to be really, really good.  
BLANCHE ALVERSON: I think it should give us some momentum going into the
off‑season, fuel us to keep getting better because of the potential we have.
Playing hard in this game really fuels us for the off‑season.  
TYRESE TANNER: I'm good (laughter).  
  
Q. Talk about what your time at Auburn has meant to you.  
COACH FORTNER: You know, Auburn came into my life at just the right time. It
was the perfect job for me at just the right time.  
We had so much fun building that program, just doing a lot of things. Winning
the SEC championship in 2009, getting that Coliseum filled up, getting Auburn
excited about women's basketball. I'm most proud of that.  
I think we've recruited fantastic student‑athletes, not only are they good
people and good basketball players, they're great in the classroom. So proud
of what they've done. Sitting here with Auburn's first ever SEC Scholar
Athlete of the Year in women's basketball. So, so proud of Blanche.  
I think just overall I'm most proud of everything that Auburn has meant to me
and helped me accomplish. The administration gave us everything we needed from
budget to scheduling to do everything we can to attract the best athletes.  
I think it just came to me in my life at the right time, and hopefully I came
into Auburn's life at the right time. I'll forever be an Auburn Tiger.  
Thank y'all very much.
